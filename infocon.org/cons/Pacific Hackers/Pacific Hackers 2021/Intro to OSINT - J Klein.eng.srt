00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,080
uh what is opens first intelligence and

60
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,760
before i go any further

61
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,599
one thing about open source intelligence

62
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,440
is a little up to cover here

63
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,720
uh whether it's um you know whether

64

you're like uh what is good the bad

65
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,440
using votes first intelligence whether

66
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,519
you know some people or you don't know

67
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:38,800
scent on a

68
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,120
business or area you're talking about

69
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,560
creating software

70
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,239
by using a tool uh onion router tour

71
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,959
or your uh what different ocean tools to

72
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,160
use and we could use like

73
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,680
we could have made different discussions

74
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,760
on that because i know that at least we

75
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,280
used uh joe grace course

76
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,879
uh through trace labs and the ascension

77
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,640
where the missing people first missing

78
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,120
people open source intelligence courses

79
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,360
those could be like six to eight hours

80
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,280
just talking about all the details so

81
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,720

82
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,040
surface and just give some uh

85
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,319
going to talk about like what's good a

86
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,239

89
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,920
privacy and stuff because you're doing

90
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,680
some research online

91
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,080

do what you enter can be tracked

93
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,799
so haven't so it's always good to

cyber security or whatever all you have

148
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,320
is you always never stop learning

149
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,000
what is open source intelligence

150
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,960
okay process of data collecting and

151
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,880
analyzing information which is far from

152
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,240
public and open uh resources so it's not

153
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,440
business

154
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,919
so uh when it comes to getting up right

155
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,360
there is many different ways you can do

156
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,160
about it

157
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,680
what you're not doing is you're actually

158
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,360
it's more of a passive reconnaissance

159
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,800
for those of you taking like

160
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,000
the ceh or that pen test plus

161
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,680
it's a passive constant active

162
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,680
reconnaissance one thing about passive

163
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,360
reconnaissance is you're looking at uh

164
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,000
public

165
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,960
and open resources active reconstitutes

166
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,560
you're actually touching the uh

167
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,199
you're actually doing scanning of uh of

168
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,319
the company's network

169
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,919
okay okay what is uh what

170
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,919
was open source intelligence used for

171

detrimental to them where it's like a

260
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,480
little too polarizing with political

261

or uh religious you want to be that's

262

employees

313
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,040
they're the weakest link when it comes

314
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,800
to security for those who have been in a

315

317
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,519
of the bad stuff for a business uh opsec

and if you don't have a good security

321
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,480
practices people can easily find out a

322
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,560
lot of information about the business

323
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,120
even your employees if they have any

324
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,760
like uh

325
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,279
acts of revenge because they just

326
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,519
recently got fired

327
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,079
that's one that's uh where uh it can be

328
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,760
bad for business opsec

329
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,440

330
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,880
mentioned that before you want to

331
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,640

332
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,480
if your job if you're a job honey you

333

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,480
using open source intelligence

335
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,839
and it's also when you're working with

336
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,040
vendors you want to make sure that are

337
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,680
these

338
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,760

anything they post on linkedin

468
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,320
also if we could just look at social

469
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,079
media especially employee pictures

470
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,680

476
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,320
if they show any possible id badges

477
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,519
you'd be surprised that happens all the

478
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,279
time with their company photo

479

business course intelligence is google

526
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,080
maps like what's nearby

527
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,720
there's certain highways any other

528
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,160
businesses

529
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,919
any roads like you always look at the

530
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,520
parking lot see

531
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,640
how full or empty it is and also uh to

532
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,320
see like you know what's a

533
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,160
good place to get good way to get in

534
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,679
there

535
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,480
and uh also anything maybe anything else

536
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,400
like any logos

537
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,559
or maybe employees like uh walking

538
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:07,520
around

539
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,039
that's something that's something to

540
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,280
consider

541
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,720
one big thing about when it comes to

542
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,080
openness first intelligence you always

543
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,000
want to protect your privacy

544
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,880
because one thing is that you never know

545
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,080
like even if you're not

546
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,600
targeting somebody but someone's

547
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,679
targeting you it's always good to be

548
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,039
careful because you'd be surprised what

549
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,720
we can find online

550
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,160
first thing is what you want to do is

551
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,840
turn off your uh

552
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,840
your location gps services one big

553
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,840
example is and this is like a few years

554
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,960
ago

555
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,039
uh i could go ahead and i'm gonna send

556
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,799
the slides out uh you can go ahead and

557
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,240
look at this link

558
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,440
right here this is like in uh this is

559
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,799
in uh afghan is in afghanistan soldiers

560
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,480
were using you know how you have the uh

561
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,520
those uh those uh fitness apps where

562
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,120
they track like uh

563
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,360
like you know uh my fitness app i

564
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,880
believe that's what's called

565
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,720
where you can actually track like uh

566
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,320
where you're where you're running and

567
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,360
how far you run

568
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,640
and stuff what happens is is that their

569
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,799
the enemy can track that right there and

570
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,160
just by where they're running they can

571
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,080
get the perimeter of the base

572
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,559
and where it's actually located so

573
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,240
that's why you always want to especially

574
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,919
now it's a combat zone so it's a little

575
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,440
different so

576
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,640
they want to make sure they turn that

577
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,919
off but even like for your own privacy

578
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,760
sometimes when you have facebook when

579
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,760
you have your uh on facebook you always

580
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,320
want to

581
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,720
turn off your location the location gps

582
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,919
services

583
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,240
because if you make a post it could say

584
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,960
okay i'm in san jose california

585
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,240
and if you're on a if you're uh you know

586
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,160
locate if you're at a certain location

587
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,960
like let's say i have to go to

588
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,280
restaurant los gatos it will say

589
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,120
in i make a post and it's in los gatos

590
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,559
california so people can see

591
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,360
like where you're actually going another

592
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,120
thing uh one thing in protection privacy

593
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,160
is use a

594
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,480
uh vpn service i'm gonna talk about vpn

595
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,919
service a little later now the one thing

596
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,840
is like let's say if i'm at my desktop

597
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,960
right here

598
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,120
there's a network connection it's on my

599
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,240
it's like my

600
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,520
desktop which goes to a modem which goes

601
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,960
to the isp

602
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,440
which goes to the side of visiting and

603
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,080
stuff so

604
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,080
if somebody actually finds out like uh

605
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,440
where you actually

606
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,360
you know your location finds out your

607
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,760
location they go onto domain tools

608
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,000
put in the ip address and it'll show

609
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,200
exactly like you're

610
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,360
mailing it like what uh service provider

611
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,320
you used

612
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,960
what and what your mailing address is

613
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,640
another thing you could use is uh the

614
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,799
onion router that's uh that's more like

615
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:31,919
if you're especially if you're going to

616
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,120
the dark web i'll

617
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,039
talk about that a little later the most

618
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,080
important thing about that is you want

619
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,679
to shield less in your detail

620
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:38,960
like i mentioned the bad facility you

621
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,440
don't want to be showing that

622
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,200
i don't want to be showing like anything

623
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,280
around your home because you want people

624
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,039
stalking you there

625
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,120
you also want to make sure that uh you

626
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,200
don't like show

627
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,280
you know too much about like you know

628
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,120
who your favorite team is

629
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,120
your family members you want to keep

630
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,880
that private for a people so if you have

631
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,360
your faith

632
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,679
for your people you know so on your

633
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,280
facebook page what you want to do is

634
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,320
like you know for

635
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,039
anything that is uh anything you put on

636
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:07,840
there

637
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,760
just keep it like private with friends

638
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,440
now it's one thing to put like okay i

639
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,360
live in san jose

640
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,080
or in just like a profile pic but don't

641
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,840
just put don't put too much detail

642
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,480
because

643
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,240
like say a picture is worth a thousand

644
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,679
words and you'd be surprised what people

645
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:22,559
would find

646
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,080
another thing is uh creating a sock

647
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,600
puppet i could do like a whole there

648
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,960
could be like a whole another

649
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,640
course on a sock puppet i'll just put

650
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,000
add a little more details a little

651
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,240
bit

652
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,440
okay now for a crazy stock of it first

653
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,559
off you want to create account on

654
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,000
facebook uh twitter

655
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,960
and linkedin especially especially on

656
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,000
facebook because one

657
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,760
thing is anytime you do somebody you

658
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,280
probably notice this before when you go

659
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,320
to like your

660
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,960
uh potential friends suggested friends

661
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,919
page

662
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,760
and you see like how much people like

663
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,760
who you know people you possibly know

664
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,960
and stuff

665
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,400
like what happens is they're actually

666
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,200
viewed your profile so they're stalking

667
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,880
um so you always want to create a sock

668
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,799
button because you want someone saying

669
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,320
hey you know that guy or

670
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,080
oh i know that person like i've seen him

671
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,520
at my work or

672
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,200
another person i bumped to the bar he

673
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,480
was a jerk i don't want to be around

674
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,600
that guy

675
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,799
so that's reason why you always want to

676
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,039
create a sock puppet and plus

677
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,720
you know if especially for missing

678
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,200
persons you never know who may have

679
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,280
gotten access to that profile so it's

680
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,720
always good to create a sock puppet

681
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,600
anytime you uh

682
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,640
see people see people now

683
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,640
uh what you want to do is like get it

684
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,240
get a separate email don't use your own

685
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,840
personal email whether you use it for

686
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,360
business or using it for

687
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,760
uh just personal stuff like tracking

688
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,640
subscriptions or any uh

689
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,400
or is it like saying email friends

690
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,240
family members using crypt

691
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,720
email that's completely dedicated to

692
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,799
setting up the sock puppet

693
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,240
second thing is you want to get a burner

694
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,919
phone for uh

695
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,799
for the account now uh which you want

696
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,640
you can purchase cheap ones at target

697
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,480
walmart or best buy don't use like your

698
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,520
iphone or samsung galaxy normally use

699
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,360
okay good and even don't get like this

700
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,720
sometimes they have those burner apps

701
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,039
it's much better to get a burger phone

702
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,679
okay so it could still track they can

703
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,360
possibly still track like you know where

704
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,960
that phone is coming from who it belongs

705
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,320
to

706
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,159
another thing is uh for you get a sim

707
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,760
card through a mobile

708
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,360
or pretty cheap uh and now for sample

709
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,039
profile you use a picture profile

710
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:23,600
picture

711
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,640
uh you for your profile picture it uh go

712
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,320
to this person does not exist

713
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,679
that way you can get like uh it's an ai

714
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,120
generated a photo

715
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,360
of a it's not like people actually do

716
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,880
exist so i'll say

717
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,400
i know that guy isn't like the guy i'm

718
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,320
someone's targeting me but you can be

719
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,679
targeting somebody and somebody says

720
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:44,799
well

721
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,440
i know that guy he's uh you know he's

722
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,960
actually like he lives down street for

723
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,320
me

724
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,400
so it's going to be ai generated where

725
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,360
it's somebody

726
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,320
who does not exist and uh profile

727
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:56,960
information

728
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,480
fake name generator what you come up

729
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,480
with is uh you want to have it according

730
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,000
to the region i'll talk about a little

731
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,799
bit

732
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,279
about where the target is located they

733
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,039
can give you a name

734
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,840
mailing address and you know branch like

735
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,039
age and uh

736
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,520
and gender and also you search you can

737
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,279
put that in as well

738
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,760
uh also you make sure like any time uh

739
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,240
you're using your sock bed use tor vpn

740
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,440
that way it's not gonna come back to

741
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,159
your phone laptop desktop

742
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:25,919
or like a track re where somebody could

743
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,760
track where you are because you never

744
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,840
know who's monitoring your target

745
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,520
you never know who you're who you're

746
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,520
targeting and one thing is you always

747
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,960
want to be realistic about your target

748
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,080
demographic

749
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,679
because for your uh for your target

750
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,240
demographic if i'm uh doing

751
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,200
and i and one thing that uh

752
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,679
tracelabs.org i'll talk

753
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,679
i'll mention a little later they do like

754
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,240
a ct they do ctfs they'll do

755
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,279
ongoing uh ops for uh searching for

i'm searching for somebody in a say

759
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,159

760
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,159
put like a sock puppet

761
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,559
that's realistic for that uh or someone

762
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,559
being in paris france if i'm over here

763
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:09,520
in uh

764
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,000
you know in san jose california which is

765
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,799
a nine hour difference in paris france

766
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,760
and i'm always like active as if i'm in

767
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,520

right here unless he's working graveyard

770
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,919
so people that could be that could be a

771
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,000
red flag right there also

772
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,360

774
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,080

kind of pervert

779
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,279
or that's going to also raise the red

780
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,480
black too so

781
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,080
i want to have somebody who's like more

area and stuff

801
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,919
because you know living in uh the west

coast or from the east coast

803

in the south and it's also different

804
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,400
than europe

805
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,159
okay if you're using a vpn this is kind

806
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,840
of how it's set up uh you have your

807
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,520
monitor your monitor connects your

808
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,600
uh connect to your modem it goes to your

809
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,960
isp without ctt

810
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,039
verizon or comcast this can go to a vpn

811
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:49,520
server

812
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,440
vpn server can be anything like nordvpn

813
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,760
cyberghost

814
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,640
or it can be expressvpn and that'll take

815
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,679
you out to the website

816
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,080
now these websites right here they're

817
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,799
not gonna see

818
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,279
they're not gonna see your or your uh

819
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,320
your

820
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,559
ip address your modem and your uh

821
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,520
computer

822
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,960
they're going to see the ip address from

823
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,279
the vpn server so if they just

824
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,520
if they uh want to do a search on that

825
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,559
ip address

826
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,720
they're going to see it belongs to a vpn

827
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,760
server whether that be

828
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,159
cyberghost nordvpn expressvpn

829
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,080
and uh anything associated with that

830
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,640
okay i'm using tor this is more like

831
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,000
that this is really more for

832
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,520
privacy and anomalous a lot of people

833
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,080
who call

834
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,240
the dark web use this and even like

835
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,200
journalists use this

836
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,679
and stuff now the one thing is is that

837
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,120
uh because

838
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,799
this uh area right here from these uh

839
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,080
three by three uh computers

840
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,840
they're going to be uh that right there

841
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,600
is like the tour network

842
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,679
and so let's say alice is trying to

843
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,120
communicate with bob

844
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,080
the way it goes is that alice will go to

845
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,799
the uh

846
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,360
alice will go through like the x the

847
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,320
internal

848
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,840
the entry uh node which is this guy

849
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,720
right here

850
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,080
now the one thing about going through

851
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,559
rice going through her isp

852
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,440
vpn server she's not gonna see like

853
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,159
they're not gonna

854
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,279
that uh isp is not going to see that her

855
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,720
going to bob

856
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,840
it's going to see you're going through

857
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,679
the tor network and it'll be encrypt and

858
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,360
it'll be encrypted

859
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,200
and go through and it'll go through like

860
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,399
a bunch of nodes

861
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,159
and also within the tor network you're

862
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:29,600
also going to have onion signs that's

863
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,480
where

864
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,679
that will suffer is like secret legal

865
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,000
and stuff something like silk road

866
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,159
it'll go through a different nodes and

867
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,080
come to the exit it'll come to the exit

868
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,799
node

869
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,880
you'll decrypt and go straight to bob

870
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,240
and what bob scott

871
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,039
is going to see unless alice alison

872
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,559
notes this in a message

873
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,640
it's going to see that comes from the

874
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,159
tor network it's not going to see it

875
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:52,720
comes from

876
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,159
alice it's not going to see it comes

877
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,559
from alice's isp

878
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:57,600
it's going to see it's going to come

879
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,000
from the tor network

880
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,440
and what you can also do is you can also

881
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,960
use uh you can also use tor

882
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,159
with the vpn where in between the

883
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,840
work and your isp you have your vpn

884
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,480
server

885
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,440
it goes from the core client okay on

886
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,360
your laptop desktop where you have

887
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,799
your xp your vpn server

888
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,480
bridge like the tor network which is

889
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,159
right here is because it comes from a

890
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,200
certain vpn server

891
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,320
etc and it's going to travel through a

892
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,000
bunch of nodes

893
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,679
unless you visit an onion site inside

894
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,679
the network

895
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,279
let's go through exit no it's going to

896
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,360
decrypt us or website

897
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,480
or an individual or a company or a

898
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,000
company server

899
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,399
so on

900
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,279
okay now one thing uh now mark are you

901
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,679
still there

902
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,080
come here okay now i just want to

903
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,760
mention this because i do have some uh

904
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,399
pictures here just to show people

905
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,320
uh are you so are you gonna be able to

906
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,720
do your uh presentation at the end

907
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,520
yes yeah so just go for it no no worries

908
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,640
go for it

909
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,559
okay because a rod i think this is a

910
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,399
good idea to maybe do afterwards i don't

911
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,720
want to take up people's too much time

912
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,480
is maybe sent this i can send with the

913
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,240
slides and also i could send some

914
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,320
some more pictures i have where people

915
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,919
do on their own just figure out okay

916
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,679
where are these plates where are these

917
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,679
pictures i'm showing and i'll give you a

918
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,520
hint they're all in europe

919
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,320
yeah actually this is gonna be uh uh

920
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,640
play out really good with what i have so

921
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,840
uh definitely this is gonna be good so

922
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,320
so the rest of your presentation is uh

923
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,080
pictures then

924
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,080
well just uh some just like about i have

925
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,919
like six slides of pictures

926
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,120
okay and let me see i think those

927
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,399
pictures are gonna be good

928
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:52,320
again for um for uh um

929
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,279
you know what what i have so so yeah

930
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,080
let's uh

931
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,200
let's keep those as a practice so we'll

932
00:30:59,200 --> 00:30:59,519
come

933
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,200
we'll combine the other presentations

934
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,840
eventually so

935
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,519
okay now does anyone know where possibly

936
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,480
this is located

937
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,360
you put in the chat

938
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,720
yeah this one's like not as obvious

939
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,480
because they do have uh some

940
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,840
because they do have um because francis

941
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,600
like no landmarks or anything like that

942
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,880
you definitely tell their snow so you

943
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,720
know it's not in california

944
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,559
you know it's not like in a warm it's

945
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,039
not a wholesome place that's coastal

946
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,559
one that some hints you could look at as

947
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,880
you look at the signs right here

948
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,640
you can tell that's like uh that's over

949
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,880
in europe uh one thing you see over here

950
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,600
and this is kind of cut off

951
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,360
galleria that's like a kind of shop

952
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,440
that's a shopping mall in europe

953
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,559
the hotel right up here you have some

954
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,320
other stuff right over here

955
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,360
uh on this like uh

956
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:00,080
on the right uh you do have like misery

957
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,080
you have this right here and also you

958
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,000
have the street sign right here

959
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,760
so i can help uh look if you're looking

960
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,640
on google maps

961
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,840
now this one right here uh this um this

962
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,640
is also in

963
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,960
europe uh some things you look at some

964
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,039
of the signs over here

965
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,039
uh for anybody if they have a certain

966
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,320
like for

967
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,600
there's a bunch of people right here

968
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,200
like you know it's kind of hard because

969
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,039
mostly it's showing their heads but

970
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,720
what do you look at as they trust a

971
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,320
certain way

972
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,240
because sometimes when you have like you

973
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,919
could tell by

974
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,640
you know going out to europe the fashion

975
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,840
is a little different over there because

976
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,519
their cuts are a lot different

977
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,200
because one thing about americans we use

978
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,519
a lot of bag wear a lot of baggy clothes

979
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,840
or there it's more like slim fit or any

980
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,000
like hats that are using

981
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,320
that's a good hint you look at the side

982
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,760
you look at the signs right here

983
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,120
it looks like it's very festive so it

984
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,720
looks like it's during christmas time

985
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,519
oops that's a hit it looks like a

986
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,559
festival

987
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,320
looks like a market oops that's a hint

988
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,320
now here's another thing now one thing

989
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,919
is you can look at is you look at these

990
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:08,240
uh

991
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,080
guards right here that's a hint

992
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,679
you can look at this is before like a

993
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,440
little event they're using

994
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,799
uh you look at uh look at this right

995
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,200
here you have police officer

996
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,080
see some statues right here uh you could

997
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,960
look at

998
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,799
this wheel right here that could be a

999
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,320
giveaway it's a certain landmark

1000
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,720
and you just have some people right here

1001
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,000
more likely they're tourists

1002
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:37,679
there's another thing here's another one

1003
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,360
i went to that's like a 60th anniversary

1004
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,399
um you look at this uh this woman right

1005
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:44,960
here

1006
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,000
certain sign you can read that and you

1007
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,640
also see a bunch of flags

1008
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,880
uh it looks like it's an open space one

1009
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,760
thing you look at is this uh

1010
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,679
right here this uh right here

1011
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,080
on the right there's a sign right below

1012
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,279
and there's like a

1013
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,640
structure right there that's one thing

1014
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,840
to look at

1015
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,440
there's one thing uh to look at this is

1016
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,839
also in europe and you got statue

1017
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,918
any of you mentioned that before seen

1018
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,359
that before

1019
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:19,280
uh you have like a sign right here

1020
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,839
now some now one thing about this is

1021
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,760
like an old photo so sometimes you know

1022
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,239
the

1023
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,079
resolution is not as good so if you try

1024
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,239
adjusting it's going to look real blurry

1025
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,159
especially the vehicles right here over

1026
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,599
in europe

1027
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:34,079
it's easy you can tell like where

1028
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:34,719
someone's

1029
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,079
where they're located because you have

1030
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,560
like uh the your you have the uh

1031
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,839
european union uh

1032
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,079
flag on it and then right below you have

1033
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,359
the country designation

1034
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:47,199
like d is uh germany deutschland

1035
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,879
uh you have uh you have like

1036
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:55,040
n i believe is no ages holland

1037
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,640
uh f is france uh

1038
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,040
then you have like i believe uk or great

1039
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,520
britain

1040
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,040
but they're about to leave the european

1041
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,839
union that's a that's a hit you can use

1042
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,760
i mean you look at the cars maybe some

1043
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,839
of the people

1044
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,839
walking by see what they're possibly

1045
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:16,800
wearing

1046
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,320
this right here this is uh i'll give you

1047
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,040
a hint this is a famous this is a

1048
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,440
soccer scene of a famous team over in uh

1049
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,440
over in europe just look at like

1050
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,160
the bus the buses any words there you

1051
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,440
can look at flags

1052
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,040
okay those are the pictures i have and i

1053
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,599
can send

1054
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,839
i get some more out if you like rod uh

1055
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,280
as far as for uh

1056
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,960
there's some top open source

1057
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,640
intelligence tools one of the big ones

1058
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,920
is open source

1059
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,079
uh ocean framework that's like the bible

1060
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,720
when it comes to uh that's the bible

1061
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,920
when it comes to or

1062
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,760
overseas intelligence there's a lot

1063
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,280
right there you can use when it comes to

1064
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,040
searching for people where it's like

1065
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,839
searching people searching businesses

1066
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,640
and different tools out there

1067
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,320
on the web another good one is multego

1068
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,160
that's a good one right there uh google

1069
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,920
doors that's a

1070
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,599
certain techniques like file type

1071
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,240
oh i just saw someone commented but they

1072
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,320
kind of it kind of faded away

1073
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,920
um i'll tell you it was a good uh one

1074
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,240
right there uh exploring uh email

1075
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,200
domains

1076
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,119
uh showdance good one especially if

1077
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,640
you're looking for uh camp

1078
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,200
cameras or any uh vulnerabilities

1079
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,119
harvester is also a good one

1080
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,320
uh spider foot xf tool

1081
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,400
marco's gonna be talking about that i

1082
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,200
believe correct me if i'm wrong

1083
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,839
um now nmap right there and map you

1084
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,040
could use roscent

1085
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,960
that's more like active reconnaissance

1086
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,320
because you're actually scanning a

1087
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,079
network

1088
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,079
so i'd say that's uh but these are all

1089
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,359
and like i said there are like

1090
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,640
lots of open source intelligence tools

1091
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,320
uh around and also recon and g is

1092
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,920
another one that's already similar to

1093
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,880
exit

1094
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,480
xf tool where you can get information

1095
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,240
about certain uh what

1096
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,160
we're gonna get gather information about

1097
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,720
certain image amongst other things

1098
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,359
okay some resources to use um open

1099
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,040
source framework i mentioned

1100
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,440
and if you go to osun curious they talk

1101
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,200
a lot about they talk about ocean they

1102
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,520
have a blog they usually have a blog

1103
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,520
i also recommend going through youtube

1104
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,920
because for their youtube

1105
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,200
what they do look for their youtube uh

1106
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,800
they actually uh

1107
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,440
for the youtube they usually have like a

1108
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,520
kinda like a presentation for about an

1109
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,720
hour or two

1110
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,240
uh every sun every two sundays

1111
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,839
where uh they talk they have a certain

1112
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:45,680
guest they talk about anything opens

1113
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,440
about open source intelligence any

1114
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,680
techniques any uh

1115
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,800
any uh news any apps or anything

1116
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,680
or any apps use and stuff like that if

1117
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,960
you go in their description they

1118
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,599
actually have they actually have uh

1119
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,280
resources for what they were talking

1120
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,560
about uh whether it's like uh you know

1121
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,119
whether it's a blog article or center

1122
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,320
tool that's one thing

1123
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,800
that's good research right there uh

1124
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,560
michael vesels recently

1125
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,200
as of uh january he came up this eighth

1126
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,040
edition of open source intelligence

1127
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,480
technique book

1128
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,160
i can only get a paperback and it's like

1129
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,760
about 40 bucks

1130
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,280
one good thing what i recommend is that

1131
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,119
bellingcats they're

1132
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,440
investigative journalists and usually

1133
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,359
these recently came out with a book

1134
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,200
now the one thing about journalism it

1135
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,400
can be kind of biased

1136
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,960
it's also more opinionated what they do

1137
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,400
is they actually do investigations they

1138
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,280
do investigations of any like uh

1139
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,760
rogue regimes they do investigations

1140
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,720
about

1141
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,560
any uh occupation military occupations

1142
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,160
uh they even uh did uh uh

1143
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,240
like the like uh recent protests like in

1144
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,960
in uh in portland where they had like

1145
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,359
the

1146
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,000
national guard come in or they also had

1147
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,240
like extremist groups they even had like

1148
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,680
uh talked about the insurrection that

1149
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,920
happened in january six

1150
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,920
about uh like some people were apart

1151
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,280
talking about some people were part of

1152
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,320
it

1153
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,079
another one i recommend is a hunting uh

1154
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,920
cyber criminals by vinnie troyer

1155
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,160
asked robert about like i mean not

1156
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,359
robert rod

1157
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,040
if we could actually get him off if we

1158
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,560
can actually get him alex he knows alex

1159
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,200
hyde

1160
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,640
it's one of the co-founders of hack

1161
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,400
miami and on

1162
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,920
another good one is how to disappear

1163
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,079
this right here is like by scripts

1164
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,119
skip tracer who's a frank uh eight

1165
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,599
frank ahern and what talks about is like

1166
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,640
uh how to kind of like cover

1167
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,320
it helps people like uh cover their

1168
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,240
tracks not just people are like

1169
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,839
criminals trying to get away from the

1170
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,280
law or anything like that

1171
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,200
but it's also like people are like who

1172
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,480
are high profile

1173
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,640
such as uh executive business executives

1174
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,240
uh politicians

1175
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,800
or celebrities because one thing is you

1176
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,079
always want to kind of keep

1177
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,480
because you really live a public life

1178
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,400
but you want people like you know

1179
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,240
follow you everywhere we go especially

1180
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,160
if it's something simple like you're

1181
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,160
going to dinner with your spouse or

1182
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,079
you're going grocery shopping you're

1183
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,680
just going for a jog

1184
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,800
you know you just want to be kind of

1185
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,960
sometimes you just want to be left alone

1186
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,040
another one that i i recommend is a

1187
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,319
great man by matt

1188
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:19,040
uh matthew germany uh this is more for

1189
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,400
like uh

1190
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,319
upset purposes it's more talks about

1191
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:23,680
like blending with in with your

1192
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,720
environment

1193
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,000
now for those of you who've been in the

1194
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,560
military uh

1195
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,079
one thing about it especially if you go

1196
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,920
overseas you can spot america in a mile

1197
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,520
away you can tell by their haircuts you

1198
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,319
can talk about

1199
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,560
what they wear i mean not just a new

1200
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,560
york agent's baseball jersey or a los

1201
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,400
angeles lakers basketball jersey

1202
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,720
but you also tell like uh how they like

1203
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,319
the shoes they wear

1204
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:47,520
uh like if their pants are a little uh

1205
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,839
baggy or loose or if their shirts are uh

1206
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:53,119
big you can actually tell if you can

1207
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,400
tell if they're american so it's

1208
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,160
kind of like talks a little bit about

1209
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,760
blending in with your atmosphere

1210
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,680
it's not like a doomsday prep sometimes

1211
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,240
can be a little doomsay preppy but

1212
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,319
it's actually good for to uh you know

1213
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,000
see like how what it takes to actually

1214
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,319
blend in with your environment and one

1215
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,319
good resource i recommend this is from a

1216
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:11,680
hatless uh wonder

1217
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,200
this is one of them it was from the many

1218
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,560
hats club that's something good to

1219
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,319
follow on uh

1220
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,480
that's a that's a good uh group to

1221
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,480
follow they have a discord channel

1222
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,160
and talk a lot about ocean they also had

1223
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,000
a content

1224
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,160
uh the conference this was like this

1225
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,599
past uh

1226
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,119
october they had a lot of good things to

1227
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,480
talk about when it comes to open source

1228
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,520
intelligence

1229
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,680
now on this start me page there's a lot

1230
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,880
of resources there

1231
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,280
i mean even the more so i recommend go

1232
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,720
to that first

1233
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,920
because they talk about different blog

1234
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,520
sites different videos different

1235
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,640
training

1236
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,680
who to follow another thing to talk

1237
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,839
about this is what uh joe gray

1238
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,720
talks about with his uh classes is a

1239
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,560
reference to uses it's

1240
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,359
army techniques uh procedures for open

1241
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:56,800
source intelligence

1242
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,839
it's a little dated it's as of july 2012

1243
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:01,599
part of the army but it's actually a

1244
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,280
good resource

1245
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,160
education one thing i forgot to mention

1246
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:06,640
and

1247
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:12,480
i'll see who puts us in chat

1248
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:17,839
whoops

1249
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,760
what do you think one good admission was

1250
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,720
trace labs

1251
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,079
what they do is they uh they're

1252
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:33,760
non-profit group it's

1253
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,560
started by nike security analyst who

1254
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,040
also does a search and rescue

1255
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,200
he's up in canada i believe it's british

1256
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,599
columbia or someplace else

1257
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,400
what he does is for uh what he does he

1258
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,839
set up trace labs

1259
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:49,280
he's helped local federal law

1260
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,960
enforcements in uh

1261
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,720
north america and also even in australia

1262
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,960
i believe also in europe too we're

1263
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,960
finding for uh finding this in person so

1264
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,680
you can actually

1265
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,400
that's a great way to apply open source

1266
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,000
intelligence schools and in conjunction

1267
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,359
with that

1268
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:07,040
uh for the next one the ascension that's

1269
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,640
by joe gray

1270
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,560
he actually gives classes it's actually

1271
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,240
very very affordable

1272
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,359
it's about probably about 90 bucks it

1273
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:16,560
gives about a 15

1274
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,359
discount uh through trace labs so it

1275
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:21,200
costs about 69

1276
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,880
and that's good right there i mean he's

1277
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,800
very he keeps it very simple

1278
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,599
very easy goes over different stuff like

1279
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:28,400
uh

1280
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,240
tracking this open source intelligence

1281
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,920
for missing persons

1282
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,200
open source intelligence for business uh

1283
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,280
using uh regular expressions for open

1284
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,720
source intelligence

1285
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,000
i highly recommend taking his classes

1286
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,839
if you go on to uh twit if you go

1287
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:46,319
through uh trace labs you go on to

1288
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,880
go onto twitter he'll be there and he

1289
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,599
he'll

1290
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,599
show you what uh when his classes are

1291
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,119
because he does have some classes coming

1292
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,359
up and also for trace labs this weekend

1293
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:56,319
they're doing a

1294
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,640
they're doing a open source intelligence

1295
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,680
ctf you do by teams or individually

1296
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,000
uh they usually have one round leave

1297
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,760
every quarter

1298
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,760
but that's something also to do to

1299
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,359
practice your ocean skills

1300
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,119
also there's ocean combine they're of

1301
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,880
australia they have some good resources

1302
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,760
right there

1303
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,240
they're classically a little pricey same

1304
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,800
with uh kirby plexus

1305
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,079
or plastis.net she's an army veteran she

1306
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:22,800
does uh

1307
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,280
some she does like a social media

1308
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,280
opsec and open source intel's training

1309
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,119
another good site you use is geogaster

1310
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,359
now geoguesser right there

1311
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:35,599
that is if if uh that's a good way to

1312
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:37,040
practice those things because when

1313
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,000
you go on the site and give these like

1314
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,200
it gives you about like five

1315
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,040
uh places to explore a day i believe

1316
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,280
and there's also about three dollars

1317
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,319
five dollars

1318
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:53,040
if you want to uh if you want to do it

1319
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,160
unlimited

1320
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,000
what it is is they'll drop you anywhere

1321
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,760
on the envelope drop you anywhere on the

1322
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,040
map and you have to find out where

1323
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,520
you're located mainly what country it is

1324
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,359
so it's almost like a google maps where

1325
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,520
you gotta really explore

1326
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,440
where this is located where am i where

1327
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,040
am i at right here and there's different

1328
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,480
things you can look at you can look at

1329
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,319
uh road signs

1330
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,359
usually there any businesses nearby uh

1331
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,520
you could look at uh any signs in a

1332
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,119
certain language

1333
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,560
you could look at it you look for any

1334
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,160
landmarks

1335
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,079
it's definitely it's definitely good for

1336
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:25,760
uh

1337
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,440
for uh developing open source

1338
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,040
intelligence skills

1339
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,720
a couple of courses on udemy i recommend

1340
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,400
these are a couple i have

1341
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,119
uh open source intelligence ocean

1342
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:37,040
fundamentals by heath adams is also

1343
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,359
cyber mentor he's also a

1344

a twitch uh page which you have to pick

1348
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:50,960
so it's more for

1349
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,200
mentee type thing another thing is

1350

through a z security who also has a

1351
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,560
youtube page uh the ultimate

1352
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,000
uh where the ultimate dark web anonymity

1353
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,119
privacy the security course uh that's a

1354
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,800
good one to use i'm doing that right now

1355
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,839
where he talks about like

1356
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:09,119
using tor and also using a certain like

1357
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:10,319
uh

1358
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,079
operating systems that are secure when

1359
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:13,760
you're doing any type of open source

1360
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,359
intelligence especially on the dark web

1361
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:16,560
where

1362
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,760
you got to be careful it can be kind of

1363
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,240
dangerous

1364
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,680
just final words most important thing is

1365
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,960
about when it comes to open source

1366
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,000
intelligence

1367
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,440
is you always want to keep looking

1368
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,599
because don't just settle a lot like for

1369
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:28,000
one

1370
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,280
certain thing pay attention to detail

1371
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,720
and always remember that you've seen us

1372
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,480
or the saying uh

1373
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,520
picture is worth a thousand words so

1374
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,359
even though like it's even if you don't

1375
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,839
really see much information like a

1376
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,119
landmark or a certain sign

1377
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,839
or if there's any uh or if there's any

1378
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:46,160
like

1379
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,040
there's no like uh business signs or

1380
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,319
road signs

1381
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:52,160
you can still look at okay you know is

1382
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,440
this a side street

1383
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,680
is it a main boulevard what's the

1384
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,800
weather

1385
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,119
is there any snow on the ground is there

1386
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:00,960
a lot of graffiti

00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,960
uh are people like wearing certain

1388
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,079
clothes

1389
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,240
that's detailed to look at because small

1390
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,839
information even little information

1391
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:10,720
could be very big an investigation

1392
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,839
and that's all i have

1393

1406
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:50,640
some awesome tools

1407
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,280
now i'm not gonna go like just like john

1408
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,960
said there's too much to learn

1409
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,680
that these two presentations themselves

1410
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,720
are not gonna be

1411
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,760
like uh big enough to like you know

1412
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,920
provide you a lot of uh background on it

1413
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,359
but it's definitely something to give

1414
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:06,400
you started

1415
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,480
and i hope uh after this presentation

1416
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,559
you you can go and

1417
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:13,119
you know start helping with all these um

1418
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:14,319
associations that

1419
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:16,000
you know uh john mentioned like the

1420
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,440
missing people ctf

1421
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,720
you know they're using real world

1422
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,200
scenarios to do this so with that

1423
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:26,000
again my name is marco palacios uh oops

1424
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,720
uh so who i am i'm a co-founder for

1425
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,160
pacific hackers

1426
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,440
and uh you know i i started with

1427
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,520
with ron uh you know almost four years

1428
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,480
ago when

1429
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,280
us hacked the valley and and now you

1430
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:39,599
know

1431
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:42,079
it became pacific hackers and and we're

1432
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:43,920
heading to uh non-profit

1433
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,359
um i've been in the industry for almost

1434
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,720
six years now um i i you know i have an

1435
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,160
education in

1436
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,040
you know in always a technical education

1437
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,720
so i came from my information systems

1438
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,000
background i.t

1439
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,440
and then eventually went to get my

1440
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,359
master's in cyber security

1441
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:04,559
i'm currently working with fortinet um i

1442
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,720
left foreign a few months ago well last

1443
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,359
year

1444
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:10,160
and then went for a startup and then

1445
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,839
came back to fortinet uh

1446
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:15,280
doing a different role and all that

1447
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:19,520
so again i i was doing it with before

1448
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:23,680
security i was doing it operations um

1449
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,319
and i was also in the air force uh where

1450
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:27,599
i was able to help

1451
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,640
um you know in one deployment that i did

1452
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,280
um as you can see i have some um

1453
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,400
certifications

1454
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,000
um so that's pretty much about me

1455
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,079
so what's the agenda for today so what

1456
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:41,520
i'm gonna walk you through is gonna be

1457
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,119
in this scenario and i hope you like

1458
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:44,800
this scenario because

1459
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,319
um uh well i'm not gonna give spoilers

1460
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:49,839
but you will see it in a second

1461
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:51,520
i'm gonna talk a little bit about the

1462
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,920
awesome framework that john mentioned as

1463
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:54,480
well

1464
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,480
uh and i'm gonna show you some reverse

1465
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,960
image methods i'm going to show you how

1466
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,079
to set up a

1467
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:03,440
um a machine to to

1468
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,599
conduct these investigations and talk a

1469
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:07,200
little bit about privacy

1470
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,480
but in reality john actually did a

1471
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,920
better job uh

1472
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,160
talking about privacy i'm just gonna

1473
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,040
just show you

1474
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,760
um it's kind of like a follow-up on that

1475
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,240
and

1476
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,920
that's pretty much it so

1477
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,839
i'm gonna talk with this scenario so one

1478
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:25,040
of my favorite movies

1479
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,800
is taken and and i know we have uh

1480
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,240
uh you know new generation fox that you

1481
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:32,960
know

1482
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,319
probably back in between 2000 and 2010

1483
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:38,559
were still young enough that probably

1484
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,559
you will not remember this movie

1485
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,559
but uh taking is one of those movies

1486
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,559
that um

1487
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:48,079
um you know if you really wanted to be a

1488
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,800
cia uh spy or something that that you

1489
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,520
know

1490
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,440
uh you know you just want to be like uh

1491
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,720
ryan mills right so

1492
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,760
this is a synopsis of the the movie

1493
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,480
however i did add the extra whatever's

1494
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,760
involved i did

1495
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,040
highlight that extra uh so um

1496
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,720
brian mills which is a retired cia agent

1497
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,200
travels across europe and relies on his

1498
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,079
old skills

1499
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:16,000
okay so he's a good uh cia

1500
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,280
person but he also has friends that has

1501
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,119

00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:33,760
that wasn't

1539
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,800
the the truth that she was going to

1540
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:37,200
follow

1541
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,559
youtube um open arrival to parties um

1542
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:43,359

1543
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:44,400
guy

1544
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,119
good looking you know and then um he

1545
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:48,559
offered to take a

1546
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:52,720
uh a picture of both kim and her friend

1547
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,880
and uh that basically where everything

1548
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:55,839
started because

1549
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,119
this guy started doing social

1550
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:58,640
engineering with the friend and

1551
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,000
obviously the friend like this

1552
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,520
guy and obviously she was just open to

1553
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,000
to everything right she he was asking oh

1554

where are you staying where all that and

1555
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,319
she was just giving

1556
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:10,240
so much information and as you know you

1557
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,599
have to be cautious who you

1558
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:13,359
provide information because you don't

1559
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:15,200
know who the other person is but so that

1560
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:15,839
was

1561
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:18,800
a big mistake uh well the girls got

1562
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,920
kidnapped and

1563
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:24,079
uh while um kim is hiding in the um

1564
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:26,480
under the bed she's talking to her that

1565
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:27,680
she's telling him

1566
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,160
that you know her friend is getting

1567
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:30,880

1580
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,599

what i do have

1618
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:17,599
are a very particular set of skills

1619
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:19,440
skills i have acquired over a very long

1620
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,480
career

1621
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,240
skills that make me a nightmare for

1622
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,170
people like you

1623
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:24,799
[Music]

1624
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,720
if you let my daughter go now that'll be

1625
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,319
the end of it

1626
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:30,640
i will not look for you i will not

1627
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,400

1630
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:49,040
so so with that um so that's one of his

1631
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,280
uh famous quotes and and what i like

1632
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,559
about it is that

1633
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:55,680
um uh he has a

1634
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,440
former cia agent he knows that um

1635
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,880
he must act a very uh very determined

1636
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,559
and one of the things like he shouldn't

1637
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,240
be giving up because

1638
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,640
it is his daughter on the other end

1639
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,920
right so

1640
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,880
with that i'm gonna talk about a real

1641
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,520
life scenario which is human trafficking

1642
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,160
human trafficking is a real issue in

1643
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,559
around the world

1644
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:23,599
we barely see it in america because uh

1645
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:26,319
you know we have a lot of you know

1646
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:27,520
strict rules uh

1647
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,559
but it still happens and you if you just

1648
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:33,119
turn on the uh the news the local news

1649
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:34,400
around the country

1650
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,119
uh from time to time they they they

1651
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,799
provide cases where

1652
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:41,839
they um bust a a

1653
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:43,920
gang of human traffickers and stuff like

1654
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,599
that we see those

1655
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,760
more often like in the border towns

1656
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,280
because you know obviously

1657
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,040
people who are trying to cross from

1658
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,720
mexico to the us

1659
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,920
but also um you know it's not just the

1660
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,200
uh

1661
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,000
crossing the illegal immigration but

1662
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,400

1663
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,040
uh women women who just like in the

1664
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:03,599

prostitution and stuff like that

1667
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,440
um so now let's take this scenario and

1668
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,319
and

1669
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:15,280
unless let's start becoming a part of

1670
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,160
the movie

1671
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,640
so we're gonna we're gonna pretend that

1672
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,599
um

1673
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:21,760
you know brian is your friend and he's

1674
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,680
gonna trust you with this matter

1675
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,680
uh he knows you're a computer geek

1676
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,520
enthusiast hacker whatever you want to

1677
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,160
call it

1678
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:31,520
computer card in general he calls you on

1679
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,000
and and will help you with the answer uh

1680
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,119
to you know

1681
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:38,559
uh to to solve his his issue

1682
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:41,680
uh how will you respond um yes i will

1683
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:42,799
help you

1684
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:45,920
no don't do it um i do have a

1685
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,520
and this is pretty funny actually found

1686
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,280
it it's um um

1687
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,880
i will probably provide it so i don't

1688
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,799
have to bump you with

1689
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:56,559
more videos but this video right here

1690
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:57,470
it's from

1691
00:57:57,470 --> 00:57:58,799
[Music]

1692
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:01,040
it was from the family guy and they

1693
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,880
basically replayed that scene that i was

1694
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:03,920
talking about

1695
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,960
using peters and megan's

1696
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,680
boys and that was pretty funny so

1697
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:10,319
anyways

1698
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:12,240
uh the movie shows different ways he

1699
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,319
gathered information but once you watch

1700
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:14,960
the movie

1701
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,319
if you have if you have not watched it

1702
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:18,319
recently or at all

1703
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:22,640
watch it he he he applies a lot of those

1704
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,359
uh awesome skills but just just pay

1705
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:27,119
attention that he's actually not doing

1706
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:28,400
all the research

1707
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,720
the rich the research has been provided

1708
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,720
or the information he gathers is

1709
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,079
provided to him

1710
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:35,839
so because he doesn't really have time

1711
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:37,359
to do it he maybe he's not even a

1712
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:39,040
computer guy to do it

1713
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,839
there's people behind him to to get this

1714
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:42,960
information to him

1715
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,480
right so um just like uh john mentioned

1716
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,680
earlier uh

1717
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,480
attention to detail is it's crucial in

1718
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,400
this type of situation because

1719
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,880
like in the movie if if the people

1720
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:55,680
provide the

1721
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:59,359
the wrong information the there is

1722
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:02,720
the life of other people are at risk

1723
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,799
so when you're actually in an

1724
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:06,720
investigation like this you

1725
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:10,079
really want to be concise you want to

1726
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:11,040
provide

1727
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,520
very accurate information because then

1728
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:14,240
otherwise

1729
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,359
um you know

1730
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:19,520
you know things can go the other way and

1731
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,040
then obviously we don't want that

1732
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:24,160
so uh so the question am i ready to help

1733
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,440
brian

1734
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,640
the answer is uh no no yeah

1735
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,680
we we are uh not ready to to help brian

1736
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:35,200
yeah so

1737
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,240
um give me a second

1738
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,240
okay

1739
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,839
all right so we're not gonna there yet

1740
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:48,400
because

1741
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,799
we need a few things before uh we can

1742
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:51,920
actually help him

1743
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,520
and the next thing we have in mind is

1744
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,280
the awesome frame now

1745
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,680
um john mentioned it and and this is

1746
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,799
just a screenshot

1747
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:01,440
of what's in in that website and i'm

1748
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,119
gonna show it to you right now

1749
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:06,480
uh if you go to the awesome framework um

1750
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,680
these little dots will open things for

1751
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,440
where exactly you're trying to look

1752
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,720
right so let's say

1753
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,799
you're looking for usernames it's gonna

1754
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:16,000
pop up you know

1755
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,079
tools and you click on that tool it will

1756
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:20,160
open more tools and if you click on this

1757
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,599
it will actually take you to where the

1758
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:22,720
tool is located

1759
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,760
and that goes for every uh different

1760
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:26,319
types of

1761
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:29,520
investigation that you're doing okay so

1762
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:32,720
um it's very helpful so

1763
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,640
i will definitely recommend it to spend

1764
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:35,839
some time on it i'm just

1765
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:37,680
just clicking around to see what's in

1766
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:38,670
there

1767
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:40,079
[Music]

1768
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:42,880
then and and for reverse engineering

1769
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:43,280
just

1770
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,440
like it is in the picture look how many

1771
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,960
things are

1772
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,720
you know just for for searching for

1773
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,119
images you have just the searching

1774
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:54,240
um engines you have instagram

1775
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,400
there is flickr uh you have some

1776
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,599
metadata

1777
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:01,760
uh forensics uh and all that now

1778
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,760
i was looking at this and and obviously

1779
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,200
there's missing

1780
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,480
um uh engines there or or

1781
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:12,240
social media such as facebook

1782
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:15,359
twitter parlor you know

1783
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:17,839
others that also provides really good

1784
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:19,839
information so

1785
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:22,799
so just keep in mind that even though a

1786
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:23,280
lot of

1787
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,160
good information is showing this website

1788
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,119
there is missing

1789
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:29,280
information because uh you know it's

1790
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:32,319
just too much and you just have to do

1791
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:34,480
you just have to see what works and what

1792
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,160
doesn't but right

1793
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,359
um so um

1794
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:41,359
before we actually do an investigation

1795
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:44,160
we have to dedicate a machine to

1796
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:47,119
to do this type of investigation um i

1797
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:48,400
will suggest

1798
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:52,960
uh not use your primary computer or or

1799
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,839
production workstation at work because

1800
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,400
um

1801
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,960
you know you have to treat this as a

1802
01:01:58,960 --> 01:01:59,520
real

1803
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:01,839
like if you are an fbi agent helping

1804
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:04,559
another fbi agent in the field

1805
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:06,559
so you don't want to contaminate any

1806
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:08,559
information that they provide you or you

1807
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:09,839
get and stuff like that

1808
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:12,000
you basically have to start fresh so

1809
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,160
every time you start a new investigation

1810
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:17,200
right you have to start um from a fresh

1811
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,000
install

1812
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,400
now what is recommended and just like

1813
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,240
when you do penetration testing when you

1814
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:22,559
do

1815
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:25,839
malware analysis uh and so on and so on

1816
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:27,760
is that you're using a virtual machine

1817
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,000
so because you can take snapshots you

1818
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,400
can

1819
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:33,520
sever you know reverb back you can copy

1820
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:36,720
from a base uh image

1821
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,440
uh or and stuff like that and and you

1822
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,119
know replicating so

1823
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:44,319
instead of some starting from scratch

1824
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:46,799
or you know if you have a spare machine

1825
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:48,000
around that you really

1826
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,920
want to use for for this type of

1827
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,520
investigations you can

1828
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,119
just keep in mind that you have to the

1829
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:55,039
fresh install of the os

1830
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:58,240
um everything so just

1831
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,039
it's just gonna take you time so you can

1832
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:01,760
use mac

1833
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:05,520
windows linux uh i will say um

1834
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:09,119
in linux i'm a ubuntu user

1835
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:12,240
uh that's my preference but um

1836
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,000
you know you can definitely use whatever

1837
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,079
you like a lot of the awesome

1838
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:19,039
tools that were presented in in the

1839
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,400
awesome framework

1840
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,920
um you know were created or or have a

1841
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:24,559
lot of

1842
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:27,680
backgrounds in with linux so you

1843
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,119
definitely will find a lot of

1844
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:30,319
information there

1845
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:33,280
um so you know you decide what what do

1846
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,640
you want to use but there's definitely

1847
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:35,520
tools for

1848
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:39,280
for all os is here

1849
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,160
once you have your peak how you want to

1850
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,119
which computer you're going

1851
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:45,200
use and and all that now it's time to

1852
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,799
set up the browser

1853
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:49,920
um now i was

1854
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:53,119
doing some research and uh happened to

1855
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:54,559
find out that

1856
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:58,000
firefox is like the go-to browser

1857
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,039
for um for awesome

1858
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:04,079
uh don't ask me why um but i at least i

1859
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:05,760
was reading like

1860
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:09,039
10 different forums and out of the 10

1861
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:12,319
um eight of them said that for

1862
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:15,920
firefox is a the uh the go-to tool for

1863
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:19,119
for uh awesome um and

1864
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:20,960
with that you also have to install some

1865
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,799
add-ons um

1866
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:24,480
this is just some of them but you know

1867
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,079
just like any other

1868
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:29,359
um browser that

1869
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:32,640
they have extensions and add-ons um they

1870
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,240
you know there's a million sometimes

1871
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,000
they they cross uh

1872
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,240
you know they have a they're um

1873
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,039
available in different uh browsers and

1874
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:44,160
stuff like that

1875
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:47,119
but in this case um and i'm not going to

1876
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:49,039
go through every single one

1877
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:53,760
definitely once you installed your first

1878
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:57,280
os you can definitely go and see where

1879
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:00,720
uh which every of this one does right

1880
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,400
the one that i'm going to talk about i'm

1881
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,960
going to give a little demo is

1882
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:07,440
search by image right because uh this

1883
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:08,960
one actually i found

1884
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,400
it's a very cool tool and uh

1885
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,559
i was surprised and impressed at the

1886
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:15,680
same time

1887
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,880
for what this tool can do um i didn't

1888
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:19,599
know there was

1889
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:21,280
such thing as that until i started doing

1890
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,640
this research

1891
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:25,760
and uh i think that was pretty cool so

1892
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,960
you will see in a second um

1893
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,119
so other tools that you have uh you have

1894
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:32,319
the exif

1895
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:35,280
tool uh exif tool is a command line tool

1896
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:35,760
um

1897
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,079
so if you go to the website it will just

1898
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:40,640
provide you documentation about the tool

1899
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,319
and it will give you the uh the links to

1900
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:44,559
download um

1901
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:48,160
the the one below is also similar to the

1902
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,400
exif tool from phil harvey now the

1903
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:51,599
difference is that

1904
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:54,319
this other tool provides a way to export

1905
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:55,839
your findings in a csv

1906
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:57,760
file where the other one is just going

1907
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:58,880
to be um

1908
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,920
you know regular you know

1909
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:05,280
output right to a you know text file or

1910
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,400
something like that

1911
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,760
um jeffree's image metadata viewer

1912
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,520
it's actually an online tool and that

1913
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,799
was actually pretty cool

1914
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:16,319
because um you know you have to use the

1915
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:18,000
command line all you have to do is click

1916
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,200
the the uh upload and that's it

1917
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,960
um google airpro now you will say well

1918
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,119
you have google maps why you want to use

1919
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:28,240
google earth

1920
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:32,400
well just keep in mind that sometimes

1921
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,240
some of the investigations you might be

1922
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,079
in an area where

1923
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:37,440
you want to find the answer but you're

1924
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,280
not connected to the internet

1925
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,960
and uh google will uh the air google

1926
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:43,680
earth

1927
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,920
will have uh you know if you're doing uh

1928
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,680
gps analysis of

1929
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,839
coordinates and stuff like that you know

1930
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:52,240
google air will have that offline

1931
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:54,960
so you don't have to connect online uh

1932
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,720
there's obviously features that you have

1933
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:57,680
to be on

1934
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,599
online in order to get them but in

1935
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:01,920
general you you'll get that information

1936
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,119
like that

1937
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,520
so now we're going to move to metadata

1938
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:06,799
so metadata

1939
01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:10,079
it's what is basically

1940
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:12,640
saying the description is data of data

1941
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:13,280
right

1942
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,680
and that's the best way to describe it

1943
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:18,160
um especially on images there's so much

1944
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,319
information about the images

1945
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:23,440
that um you can use for

1946
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,160
for the investigation so in the example

1947
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,280
of the movie right

1948
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:30,960
there is um the the picture that

1949
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,920
they the guy took with the the cell

1950
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:34,480
phone

1951
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,039
and then eventually brian was able to

1952
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:38,319
find um

1953
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:41,119
on the room uh he he actually in the

1954
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:42,000
movie he went

1955
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,200
to a a picture booth

1956
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:48,319
and uh he put in the sd card and then

1957
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:51,760
um he was able to to see where the

1958
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,520
picture was taken

1959
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,680
and actually was able supposedly to zoom

1960
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:56,640
in and see

1961
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:59,520
how the guy looked like and all that

1962
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:00,640
well

1963
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:03,440
um there's a lot of things that happen

1964
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:04,799
behind doors

1965
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:07,839
there because i don't i

1966
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:09,599
honestly don't think he obviously is a

1967
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,680
hollywood movie so he's

1968
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:15,200
a superhero almost and

1969
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,040
but in reality you might not know

1970
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:19,279
exactly where the picture was taken

1971
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:21,759
and how the guy look like unless you

1972
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:22,960
take it to a tool

1973
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,479
where it's going to show you that

1974
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:26,319
information

1975
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:29,920
so in in in the meta data there is

1976
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:32,479
a a thing called geotagging and

1977
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:33,920
geotagging basically

1978
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,799
it's the process of identification of

1979
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:38,799
gps coordinates that's that's what it is

1980
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:40,238
it shows the uh

1981
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:44,080
um the other uh the connection of those

1982
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:45,520
coordinates uh

1983
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,679
uh and where depiction was taken and all

1984
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:49,839
that so that's basically what it is

1985
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:53,040
now you see this camera this this camera

1986
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,880
is a semi-pro camera

1987
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,120
and i actually do have the same camera

1988
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,600
happen to have the same cam

1989
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:02,319
model and everything and it does have

1990
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:02,960
the uh

1991
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,960
um and a plug-in to put in the uh the

1992
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:07,679
gps

1993
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:11,040
um uh

1994
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:13,359
input which is this one this is like the

1995
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:14,399
the dongle

1996
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:16,719
um but if so if you don't have this

1997
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:18,238
dongle then

1998
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:19,839
that you obviously you're not gonna have

1999
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:21,279
gps data

2000
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:22,960
and you're gonna be probably asking is

2001
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:25,120
like well why do you wanna have gps

2002
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:26,238
coordinates on

2003
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:28,479
on an expensive camera like this like

2004
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:29,600
what's the point

2005
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,080
well um i did actually have to ask my

2006
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,198
friend about it because

2007
01:09:33,198 --> 01:09:34,719
i was asking the same question i was

2008
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:36,719
like well why

2009
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:39,520
is this even even here why do i even

2010
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,080
care

2011
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:42,080
about gps coordinates in here and he

2012
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,359
actually gave me a really good

2013
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:46,158
explanation because he's a photographer

2014
01:09:46,158 --> 01:09:48,238
and he said well um

2015
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:51,279
sometimes when we're looking for where

2016
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:52,719
to take pictures

2017
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:55,679
we um you know we take pictures

2018
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:56,480
everywhere

2019
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,560
and you definitely you're not really

2020
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,760
paying attention where you took the

2021
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:00,960
picture

2022
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,199
until you actually go back to your

2023
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,199
studio and start looking at the cameras

2024
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:06,960
and yourself oh my god this is the

2025
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:09,120
the place where i really want to uh do

2026
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,640
it and because you

2027
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,880
you went to all these places you don't

2028
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,800
really remember where exactly it was you

2029
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,800
don't remember it was on park a or park

2030
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:17,120
b

2031
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,600
or in the mountains you don't really

2032
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,480
know that

2033
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,560
but with obviously gps coordinates he

2034
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:23,760
can actually look

2035
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,239
uh where the picture was taken at what

2036
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:27,120
time

2037
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:30,000
um and all that and that's how they are

2038
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,120
able to

2039
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:33,679
to you know to go back and and see that

2040
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:35,280
information so it's it's very helpful

2041
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:35,679
for

2042
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:39,520
for them um and you know uh

2043
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,400
obviously for investigations like when

2044
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,040
fbi

2045
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:46,719
uh agents do uh you know uh

2046
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:49,840
ceasing of something you know also um

2047
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,560
they can it is important that it has

2048
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:53,920
that information because

2049
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,520
they need to know where the picture was

2050
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,920
taken uh and they they can just go

2051
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,199
when they're doing actually an

2052
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:01,520
investigation of that caliber

2053
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,679
they can actually match the uh where the

2054
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:05,199
picture was taken

2055
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:07,840
with where let's say they took a picture

2056
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:08,640
of a bullet

2057
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,159
uh where the bullet was located and

2058
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:12,159
stuff like that so it's kind of like you

2059
01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:12,880
know

2060
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,920
collaboration on collaboration in

2061
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:19,760
in that respect so with that um

2062
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:22,640
all your phones by default have has the

2063
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:23,440
uh

2064
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,679
the location tags enabled and obviously

2065
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:27,360
that's for a reason because

2066
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,400
you know you know google or

2067
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,920
apple wants to know um

2068
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:35,920
you know they want to know about about

2069
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,920
your pictures and where everything

2070
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:40,320
where was located and everything but uh

2071
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,239
um you have the option to

2072
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:44,320
take those down and i will show you that

2073
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:45,520
in fact

2074
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:48,159
you cannot it will definitely raise that

2075
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:49,040
information

2076
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,520
from the metadata now with that being

2077
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,080
said

2078
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:55,120
does that mean it's really raised we

2079
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,080
don't know that yet

2080
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:57,520
because maybe there's some hidden

2081
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,199
information that these

2082
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:02,480
uh commercial tools or or

2083
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,600
i should say open source tools um are

2084
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,280
not providing but maybe there's some

2085
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,360
commercial tools

2086
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,719
that you know the fbi is using

2087
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:14,080
that we don't know about it and they

2088
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,159
actually can retrieve that information

2089
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:18,640
so we don't know that

2090
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:21,440
so here i'm gonna show you jeffrey's

2091
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:22,719
image viewer

2092
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:25,600
so on the picture on the left so it is

2093
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,679
basically the same location

2094
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:30,800
two different pictures and i will show

2095
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,760
you in a second here

2096
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,159
so picture on the left um

2097
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,920
it has the the the coordinates the

2098
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:43,040
location right

2099
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:44,960
where picture sorry a picture on the

2100
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,640
right picture on the left doesn't have

2101
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:47,840
that information

2102
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,920
but if you can see it is the same i took

2103
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:50,880
the picture

2104
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:54,239
in fact last night just to to to do that

2105
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:56,080
investigation whether it was gonna show

2106
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:56,719
or not

2107
01:12:56,719 --> 01:12:59,840
and and i'm i'm well not surprised but

2108
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:01,440
i'm glad that it the

2109
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,760
the location wasn't there after i turned

2110
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:05,600
off my my yield tax

2111
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,760
um so as you can see you know a little

2112
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:08,880
bit uh

2113
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:12,239
you know same angle same everything

2114
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:14,960
but yeah this picture does not have the

2115
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:15,600
uh

2116
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:20,640
the geo location so if we scroll down

2117
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:24,719
you will see that here even has a

2118
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:27,679
gps location but this one doesn't have

2119
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:29,840
it

2120
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:32,400
again that that's just for your kind of

2121
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,000
like your information

2122
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,000
um when you're doing it in

2123
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,719
in the command line it's pretty much the

2124
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:41,360
same thing

2125
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:47,839
uh when you're using exif tool let me uh

2126
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:56,080
um this is the same information here you

2127
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,360
can see that

2128
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:00,080
gps on the left he has the gps i don't

2129
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:03,199
know if you can see it let me

2130
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:11,040
it has that information here

2131
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:14,640
but it's not showing in here right so

2132
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,880
as you can see you can you can see it on

2133
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:17,840
on both the uh

2134
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:21,360
uh the command line and on the other

2135
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:22,800
tool here

2136
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:26,239
now gps coordinates i

2137
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:28,480
i was doing the research research

2138
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,080
exactly how you're supposed to enter

2139
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,000
them and it's actually very tricky

2140
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,440
but either on youtube on on google air

2141
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:36,640
or google maps

2142
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:39,040
you have to enter in a certain way so

2143
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,800
i'm just showing it in here

2144
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:43,040
but this actually this link is actually

2145
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:45,199
very cool i'm gonna show it to you

2146
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:47,600
um i'm not gonna go through it i really

2147
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:50,000
want you to go through it and experience

2148
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,800
you know how how you enter um you know

2149
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:53,679
the process of

2150
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:55,760
entering coordinates and getting

2151
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:57,600
information on

2152
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,520
google maps in terms of location and

2153
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,199
stuff like that because it does provide

2154
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:02,080
you step by step

2155
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:04,159
on how you're supposed to use it and and

2156
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:05,760
things that you have to keep in mind

2157
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,239
it even shows you like a way to do it in

2158
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:09,600
excel and all that so it's actually

2159
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:10,320
pretty cool

2160
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:13,520
so um so something that uh john was

2161
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:14,960
mentioning earlier

2162
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:18,719
with um you know uh of looking at

2163
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:20,800
uh you know what's in the picture and

2164
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:21,840

01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:24,400
um you know this is the type of

2166
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:25,440
information that

2167
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,120
you can put in an excel sheet and stuff

2168
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,040
like that and you can put the points and

2169
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,120
you can download and do

2170
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,719
a bunch of stuff so all you have to do

2171
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:34,400
is just basically research

2172
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:39,839
um so let's see here

2173
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:43,360
so um so question so am i ready to help

2174
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:43,840
brian

2175

think you have enough tools and and

2177

knowledge

2178
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:51,120
to to do at least helping with part of

2179
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:52,400
the investigation

2180
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,800
which the first one that came into mind

2181
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,120
was a picture

2182
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,280
getting a picture of something it is

2183

2200
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:39,440
search by the image and you can search

2201
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:40,719
by by

2202
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:43,600
by different uh engines what is cool

2203
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:44,400
about it is

2204
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,719
that you have different options you can

2205
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:48,560
select a picture when you are

2206
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:50,239
on the website so you just basically

2207
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:51,679
click on it and it will

2208
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:54,080
automatically start searching for it you

2209
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:55,040
can select

2210
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:58,480
and or upload a picture you can just cut

2211
01:16:58,480 --> 01:16:59,360
and paste

2212
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:02,480
um you know part of that picture so if

2213
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:03,760
we're going to

2214
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:06,719
to john's presentation uh maybe we don't

2215
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:08,000
want to take

2216
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,320
where the people were but maybe we don't

2217
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:11,920
want to take where the the um

2218
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:14,320
the buildings were and and that's what

2219
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:15,360
we're going to capture

2220
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,520
you can actually just upload it or just

2221
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:18,640
provide a url

2222
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:21,120
so what i was doing earlier i just i

2223
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:22,480
just typed um

2224
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:25,760
budapest earlier um

2225
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:28,000
and i just pick a random picture from

2226
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,120
from what's in here

2227
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,840
right

2228
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:35,520
so i i went in here and said okay that's

2229
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:37,360
a pretty nice picture

2230
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:44,320
i think i picked this one yeah

2231
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:47,600
so here what i did is i went and

2232
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:51,360
and click search by

2233
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:54,400
by capture and i highlight uh

2234
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:57,440
all search engines and i highlight this

2235
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:58,000
one now

2236
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,560
i'm not telling anything about it other

2237
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,120
than

2238
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:02,719
selecting the picture so i'm not telling

2239
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:04,480
it it's in budapest i'm not telling

2240
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:05,520
everything

2241
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,679
but once this happens you can click on

2242
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:09,040
search

2243
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:11,040
and then it will start opening all the

2244
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:12,719
uh um

2245
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:15,360
the search engines that you select on

2246
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:16,719
and you will see that it will start

2247
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:18,239
populating pictures

2248
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:21,520
of that location right and i didn't tell

2249
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,000
the

2250
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,320
picture that it wasn't what i passed but

2251
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,640
it started telling me about it

2252
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:29,840
um so some search engines are better

2253
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:31,120
than others

2254
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:34,880
um um

2255
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,719
some of them will provide actually

2256
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:39,199
different angles of it so you can start

2257
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:41,920
you know taking uh different approaches

2258
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:42,960
to it

2259
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:46,400
uh and now um last but not least you can

2260
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,280
take

2261
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:49,520
this and and take it to like let's say

2262
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,280
if you're taking a picture of a street

2263
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:53,360
you can actually take it to google maps

2264
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:54,320
or or

2265
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:57,600
um or google earth and actually start

2266
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:58,400
playing with

2267
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,960
you know uh the google functions in

2268
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,000
terms of like

2269
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
live image well not live image but you

2270
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,679
know like the the google streaks and

2271
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:08,560
stuff like that right um yeah see like

2272
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:11,280
this one this is uh from the chinese one

2273
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:14,320
this is tiny eye

2274
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:17,679
um so again uh

2275
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:20,960
it also um i guess this this particular

2276
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,000
image is very like

2277
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,880
famous because it not only show in this

2278
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,320
original

2279
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:29,679
um website which is director that

2280
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:33,280
ceo the uk but also in other websites so

2281
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,360
this image is being used by different

2282
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,760
uh in different places as you can see in

2283
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,320
tiny eye

2284
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:45,920
and again it again it it depending where

2285
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:46,880
you're using

2286
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,960
it it will show you different locations

2287
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,560
different times different

2288
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:54,000
as you know stuff like that so um

2289
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:59,280
so with that um let me go back to this

2290
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:03,440
so um in summary i mean austin is very

2291
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:04,640
powerful

2292
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:08,560
but it's also dangerous at the same time

2293
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:13,280
you you just like any of um

2294
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:15,520
knowledge on penetration testing right

2295
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:16,719
you can use it for good

2296
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:18,639
you can use it for battery use use your

2297
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:20,800
judgment and use it for good

2298
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,560
um whatever we're showing you here

2299
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,080
obviously we're not

2300
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,679
we're not telling you to go on dox

2301
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:27,360
people or or or

2302
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,040
you know be a stalker or anything like

2303
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:31,199
that but just know that

2304
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:33,520
you can actually help people um just

2305
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:34,960
like john mentioned

2306
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:37,199
um with the ctf lab for like missing

2307
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:39,040
people ctf or

2308
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:41,199
other organizations that are doing this

2309
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:42,080
type of work

2310
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:44,400
you know join them you know they're are

2311
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,000
using real data

2312
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,480
and and you can put your skills uh with

2313
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,719
that and definitely learn more skills

2314
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:53,679
that what we're presenting here um so

2315
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:55,600
having these skills are very important

2316
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:59,199
um you you don't really know and pray

2317
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:01,679
that no no one goes through a scenario

2318
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:02,719
just like

2319
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:05,199
brian in the movie uh went through uh

2320
01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:05,840
having a

2321
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:08,320
daughter kidnapped but definitely i i

2322
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:09,040
have had

2323
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:12,800
uh family members kidnapped and

2324
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:15,040
you know and it's it's very it's very

2325
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,239
stressful

2326
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:18,239
when when you know that uh the other

2327
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:20,000
person might not come back

2328
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,280
let's put it that way um so

2329
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:26,159
uh but yeah having those skills it can

2330
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:26,800
be very

2331
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:30,400
uh very helpful um just remember that

2332
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,639
not everybody is a computer person and

2333
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:34,480
whatever extra information

2334
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:37,840
or or skill that you have

2335
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:41,040
it works more than just staying there

2336
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,000
crying and don't

2337
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,480
not doing anything so put those skills

2338
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:45,840
into practice

2339
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,679

2340
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:49,280
mentality you know when conducting

2341
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:51,520
investigations or when you're thinking

2342
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,760
you know in the worst case scenarios you

2343
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:54,800
know um

2344
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:58,480
just just remember that um
