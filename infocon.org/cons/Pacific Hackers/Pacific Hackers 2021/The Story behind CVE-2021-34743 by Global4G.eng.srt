1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
was the cable actually

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,520
so the cable was a problem so i use a

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,880
different cable for uh

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,480
i used to have the cable that came with

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,679
the camera

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,920
i change it to you know to a shorter

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,880
one and

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,320
it looks like it was a cable

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,880
go figure

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,320
so it's just what kind of cable was it

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,519
it was just a usb cable but it um a usbc

12
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,880
but i i use a different one from a gopro

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,480

december 2021

62
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,120
uh sounds like a lot of time

63
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,840
but yeah

64
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,000
we decided to

65
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,319
uh you know postpone the actual you know

66
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,599
conference as we used to have it uh last

67
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,720
last conference we had was november 2019

68
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,560
then obviously as you know the pandemic

69
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,639
happened and uh pretty much everything

70
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,759
was closed

71
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,319
uh now things are still reopening but

72
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,840
you know so we decided to do a

73
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,800
you know mini festival winter hack we

74
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,800

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,800
many people we were going to like attend

78
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,319
or anything like that

79
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,800
however uh we decided that it was

80
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,360
necessary to you know to see each other

81
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,160

82
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,879

89

anywhere from from your home but then

94
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,600
there's also gonna be like you know like

95
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,519
uh uh i think you're gonna bring your

96
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,040
drone correct uh

97
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,959
yeah i'm bringing one drone that we're

98
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,560
to have there it's an indoor drone i

99
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,760
didn't want to make it difficult

100
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,120
i'm going to be honest with you i don't

101
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,040
know what the protocols are

102
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,560
uh when you get there i'm going to be

103
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,240
honest with you guys i know they're not

104
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,160
requiring vaccines but they may require

105
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,959
you to wear a mask um

106
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,160
is crazy that even meetup actually asks

107
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,480
you to put those details now every time

108
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,000
you set up a meeting

109
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,560
we know they're not requesting or at

110
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,560
least when we talk to them the last time

111
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,399
they were requesting proof of

112
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,200
vaccination but they may request you to

113
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,040
wear masks what i'll probably do is i'll

114
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,800
just buy a box

115
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,680
and i'll have them there for any of you

116
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,519
guys who wants to come i didn't want to

117
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,399
also we didn't want to occupy like

118
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,399
outdoor space because then that would

119
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,000
have you know

120
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,800
many other things we have to do but i'll

121
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,360
have an indoor drum the nano drone that

122
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,800
can be hacked

123
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,480
by a wi-fi and

124
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,200
plus there's no quarter plus uh uh we're

125
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,720
going to have also the low picking

126
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,560
village

127
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,800
uh irving talked about maybe rerunning

128
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,720
the crypto ctf so we have plenty of

129
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,720
stuff to do and we have extended the

130
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,600
time

131
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,839
from we were originally we're gonna do

132
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,760
two to five now we're gonna do eleven to

133
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,600

134
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,680

135

don't know what's going on with omikron

137
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,440
so i would suggest you to take the

138
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,040
opportunity and

139
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,720

141
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,200

and i am a pentas architect currently uh

357
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,880
previously worked at a work as a senior

358
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,360
penetration tester and even now i am

359
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,200
pretty much you know doing penetration

360
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,160
testing for most of my job

361
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,559
and i was also a programmer so i have

362
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,160
i've got again a number of years of

363
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,000
experience in the it started as a

364
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,720
programmer designer developer

365
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,320
and and did you know pretty much

366
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,720
everything you know possible in i.t for

367
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,280
a long time and then

368
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,120
i think it's been a while you know for

369
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,240
maybe five years or so i i

370
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,480
i thought i should just

371
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,960
you know focus my life to security and i

372
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,039
got interested in security

373
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,000
i think back in 2011 or 13 when i did

374
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,080
some courses from stanford

375
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,720
and and then i decided you know that i i

376
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,039
need to work on security and and nothing

377
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,320
else so

378
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,480
yeah luckily i got a break uh you know a

379
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,720
few few years back and

380
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,400

386
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,799
is a need for for the job

387
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,159
so uh

388
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,200
some

389
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,600
some other fact about me you know i grew

390
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,200
up

391
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,159

okay with love comic books

395
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,960
all right so yeah i mean i i never

396
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,120
imagined that you know mask would become

397
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,960
such an integral part of everybody's

398
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,840
life

399
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,559
was also i've been reading about mask

400
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,200
man for a long time

401
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,400
so

402
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,080
okay so

403
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,159
yeah so this is the cve you know this is

404
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,400
this you know if you want to take a look

405
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,960
you can uh take a look here cisco's

406
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,080
cisco's security security advisory

407
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,480
you know the easier easiest way to go is

408
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,840
you know google

409
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,880
security advisory and then on the then

410
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,960
you will be see you will see a search

411
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,880
box you know type webex

412
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,320
and um

413
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,200
and search for authorization bypass

414
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,960
and that's where you will see so let me

415
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,400
let me open it up here

416
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,480
so so basically this is a cross site i

417
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,440
hope you are all familiar with csrf

418
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,440
so if you're not you know feel free to

419
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,520
ask me any question or interrupt me but

420
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,280
but i can always take the answers at the

421
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,240
end

422
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,000
but you know you if you feel if you feel

423
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,600
like you know feel free to interrupt as

424
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,520
well

425
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,400
so

426
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,039
so this is a you know so as a part of so

427
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,120
how i found this so basically i was

428
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,480
doing the you know pen test on

429
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,559
one of our products so you know i do

430
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,200
pentest as a part of my job so i i was

431
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,960
doing this you know i started working on

432
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,280
the pen test and then

433
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,520
this product this particular product has

434
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,559
integrations with multiple meeting

435
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,799
providers you know webex is one of them

436
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,720
zoom zoom is another and there were a

437
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,840
couple more

438
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,880
so

439
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,799
as a part of that test you know i i

440
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,640
found i found this you know some

441
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,520
vulnerability in in the webex itself

442
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,440
so

443
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,520
so yeah so i will talk about that in a

444
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,360
bit uh so basically yeah so this

445
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,159
vulnerability what is this so this is a

446
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,240
you know

447
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,799
let me show you this a second

448
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,799
part

449
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,480
so what happens there is a you know this

450
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,679
software has integration with uh with

451
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:46,720
webex

452
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,000
so

453
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,960
so

454
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,480
there is a link which is you know when

455
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,480
you start using the software the link

456
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,440
gets you here and and it basically asks

457
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,799
you to log in to your own webex account

458
00:22:58,799 --> 00:22:59,679
and

459
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,280
if once you're logged in if you're

460
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,120
logged into the webex account you are

461
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,440
you know from that software you know

462
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,360
basically that software drives all this

463
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,080
and then you get something like this

464
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,919
so basically what's happening behind the

465
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,600
scene this particular software has

466
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,679
integration with cisco webex and

467
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,679
it's asking you this permission so you

468
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,919
basically at this point you allow the

469
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,880
app to integrate with your webex account

470
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,520
and once you hit accept then this

471
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,679
software which i was testing would do

472
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,440
this part so basically as you can see

473
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,919
here this particular software is asking

474
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,760
for this permissions you know create

475
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,880
manage or cancel your webex meetings so

476
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,720
basically you are allowing this software

477
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,000
to you know

478
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,679
all these permissions

479
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:44,799
so

480
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,000
uh

481
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
so what what happened you know i saw i

482
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,559
noticed this in you know in the in the

483
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,080
in the traffic

484
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,559
and and then i was uh and then then next

485
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,080
time i did it it did not ask me of

486
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,600
course because this is only supposed to

487
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,880
be one time

488
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,640
and and then

489
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,640
so i was interested how this happens so

490
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,799
basically i looked at the source code of

491
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,559
this particular page

492
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,520
and

493
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,840
and then when i when i looked at it i

494
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,720
found

495
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,360
there was a csrf token so as a pen

496
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,440
tester what would what would i do you

497
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,240
know if i find a csrf token the easiest

498
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,760
thing for me to do

499
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,120
is try that request one more time

500
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,200
without any token

501
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,039
so that's what that's exactly what i did

502
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,880
and and to my surprise it actually

503
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,679
worked

504
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:30,960
so

505
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,760
so so what happened essentially you know

506
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,080
basically what happened is without any

507
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,440
token this uh webex allowed access to

508
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,240
this third-party app for that particular

509
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,679
user account so

510
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,559
csrf is a client-side

511
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,640
problem like client-side vulnerability

512
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,000
so

513
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,679
the particular user is basically

514
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,159
vulnerable to this kind of attack

515
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,440
so

516
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,279
yeah so this is how

517
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,200
so this this is how the form was you

518
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,039
know i kind of minimized that form the

519
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,760
form was actually quite big and i i when

520
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,840
i was testing it i found it

521
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,200
you know i just

522
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,919
grabbed the essentials and created a poc

523
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,600
for this and then

524
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,440
and then basically worked with our team

525
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,799
for first you know

526
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,760
found it uh within our team and and the

527
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,240
client of course and so so this is how

528
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,480
you know once i found it you know then

529
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,159
this is the kind of things i had to do

530
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,080
right so first i had to try as it myself

531
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,640
like basically make sure that it's

532
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,480
really a problem right really a

533
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,120
vulnerability and then then once i know

534
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,919
it's a vulnerability i i need to

535
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,000
find the impact to explain like what

536
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,480
what what all bad things a malicious

537
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,919
actor can do so

538
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,159
and then once i know that i can i can

539
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,840
talk to the stakeholders you know talk

540
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,760
to the team describe them what's

541
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,279
happening you know what is the problem

542
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,360
and and what needs to be done in order

543
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,919
to fix it but in this case i knew that

544
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,760
this is a webex problem i explained it

545
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,840
to the team and the team also knew it's

546
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,679
not their problem it's a webex problem

547
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,240
but nevertheless it was a problem

548
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,440
so

549
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,400
they yes the team

550
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,360
so then

551
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,120
the next step was i need to find the

552
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,600
impact exactly what what could be done

553
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,400
right so this is where you know i i have

554
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,559
that's when i actually found out about

555
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:19,440
this

556
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,720
and

557
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,200
this link here you can see this is the

558
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,679
webex link it actually talks

559
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,840
in detail about this

560
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,039
and

561
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,240
by the way does anybody have any

562
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,400
questions i will take a pause

563
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,440
before i

564
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,480
keep talking further

565
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,320
yeah i had a quick question so when you

566
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,799
discovered this vulnerability here did

567
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,360
you so how did you

568
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,039
contact webex or did you did you

569
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,880
decide to reach out to the support team

570
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,120
and what was that relationship like like

571
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,600
did they respond right away or yes yes

572
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,440
yeah i'm yeah that that is actually my

573
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,600
next next bullet point here

574
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,960
so give me a minute i'll talk about that

575
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,200
excellent

576
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,679
yeah uh so

577
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,840
so yeah so before before i yeah so

578
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,400
before i uh you know before i went

579
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,559
before i you know let it so let me let

580
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,840
me first talk about this you know this

581
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,600
screen here which is already open so

582
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,440
basically this you know this integration

583
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,039
piece has

584
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,240
as you can see here

585
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,320
it talks about this out you know this is

586
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,200
an example uh scenario so out of office

587
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,440
assistant is requesting the following

588
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,640
and it you know there are so many

589
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,799
permissions here and if you scroll down

590
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,880
there are tons and tons of permissions

591
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,679
so as an attacker what i thought was i

592
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,600
could create an app and i could just

593
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,760
request all the permissions

594
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,480
and

595
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,640
if i request all the permissions and if

596
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,080
there is you know because there is a

597
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,000
csrf

598
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,399
there is a you know csrf vulnerability

599
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,200
here if i create a poc send it to bunch

600
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,279
of people i could pretty much take over

601
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,120
their webex account right that's the

602
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,640
that's the biggest impact so this

603
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,399
actually you know in retrospect i mean i

604
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,399
thought about it but in the last but you

605
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,399
can see it's it's like it it had a huge

606
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,960
impact because webex has so many users

607
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,480
and even if you send like phishing

608
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,240
emails to so many people even if there

609
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,520
is a low low rate of actual clicks you

610
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,039
can still take over a lot of accounts so

611
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,159
so

612
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,000
so i didn't know this though i mean i i

613
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,520
had a feeling that this is how what the

614
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,600
impact was but i didn't actually create

615
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,200
the poc for that because i had no

616
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,880
intention to actually

617
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,760
do that kind of attack i just wanted the

618
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,760
the cisco or webex or whoever that you

619
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,520
know the responsible folks were i just

620
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,480
wanted

621
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,240
to let them know that this could be the

622
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,840
impact and

623
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,520
so so

624
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,679
so what i did so yeah at that point you

625
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,679
know i i kind of knew that this this was

626
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,679
uh this is something i must you know

627
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:52,640
inform

628
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,559
inform the team the you know the cisco

629
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,960
team or webex team but i didn't know how

630
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,840
so so so what you know so i

631
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,520
what what are my options you know i have

632
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,520
previously reported if you know a bunch

633
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,279
of findings to

634
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,279
on bug bounty programs you know i'm also

635
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,200
part of some private programs so hacker

636
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,120
one and buck crowd come to the mind

637
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,880
right so i

638
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,600
so i i knew cisco did not have a public

639
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,279
program at least maybe they have a

640
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,520
private program i still don't know

641
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,640
so

642
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,559
i actually reached out to a contact of

643
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,600
mine in cisco and and asked him you know

644
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,399
if if he's aware of any bounty program

645
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,320
so he said no there is no he's not aware

646
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,480
so he said you know just just use bug

647
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,320
hacker one or buck crowd but when i

648
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,000
actually looked at hacker one and buck

649
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,200
crowd

650
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,880
they did not have a direct managed

651
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,799
program so they were actually just you

652
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,559
know like people you know they were

653
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,159
basically just

654
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,240
they would just forward my my finding to

655
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,120
them so i later found out that you know

656
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,960
cisco has an email pieceword basically

657
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,720
the pso.cisco.com

658
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,360
so i found out that email i said okay

659
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,120
let me just you know send them send them

660
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,840
an email directly but i was you know

661
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,520
this is where actually i took some time

662
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,440
you know i took like a couple days i did

663
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,279
not immediately report to them but i

664
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,120
took a couple days because i did not

665
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,039
know exactly what to do or you know who

666
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,840
to contact uh and i at the same time i

667
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,600
did not want to spend too much time

668
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,120
writing up the email compiling the

669
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,279
report and sending it

670
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,799
and not knowing you know how it would be

671
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,880
how how they would respond or even if

672
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,399
they respond because

673
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,480
because i've been you know i know

674
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,960
if you are if you ever manage bug bounty

675
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,559
program you know you get a lot of false

676
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,720
positives many times right

677
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,960
so i was not sure but i took a chance

678
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,919
anyways and i just send them uh i just

679
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,840
you know on that email i just send them

680
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,279
like a few lines with a short

681
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,919
description of the finding and

682
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,360
and to my surprise they they

683
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,039
acknowledged the same day

684
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,039
and they said yeah they needed they had

685
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,720
some more questions so at that time i

686
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,640
was more more than happy to give them

687
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,320
the actual poc

688
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,480
and i emailed them the actual peers to

689
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,880
describe the problem and the impact

690
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,720
and they they came back and said hey

691
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,840
they they do have csrf protections they

692
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,679
checked with their team they do have csr

693
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:06,720
protection

694
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,760
uh so but but i i send them the poc then

695
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,799
and then

696
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,399
and then uh

697
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,000
and then yeah basically this this was

698
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,399
very smooth you know uh with them the

699
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,480
interaction i had a great time i had no

700
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,240
problem as such you know they they were

701
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,559
quick to respond and

702
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,120
they fixed it in within a few weeks and

703
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,120
and i asked them if i could get a cv for

704
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,840
this and they said yeah i mean they will

705
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,480
they will publish the advisory and that

706
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,159
they have you know they will assign a

707
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,480
cve so they did that within couple

708
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,240
months and

709
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,480
and yeah and then i got the cv you know

710
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,960
they asked me what name

711
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,200
they would like me to to give and i just

712
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,519
gave them my alias so they said yeah

713
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:48,399
fine

714
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,080
with the alias and

715
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,159
they published the advisory basically

716
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,360
with and credited my my alias global 4g

717
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,519
so yeah i mean before actually in

718
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,919
previous in the past like you know most

719
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,360
previous uh

720
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,880
assignments i have actually found a few

721
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,840
uh

722
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,000
zero days on some other vendor products

723
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,519
and and i have reported to them but uh

724
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,240
at that time

725
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,559
i was just i did not actually pursue and

726
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,440
ask them to create a cv so those those

727
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,480
findings got fixed and uh but i never

728
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,760
actually got any official cv for those

729
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,840
so this time i you know i thought you

730
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,080
know i that you know this is you know i

731
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,440
did something different because i asked

732
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,880
them if they will do you know create a

733
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,279
cv i did not know i was not sure if they

734
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,760
would have created a cve if i had not

735
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,080
asked for that so

736
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,640
uh but anyway i had i had actually very

737
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,240
good experience with cisco team on this

738
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,039
one

739
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,200
and um

740
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,600
so yeah so that's uh that's so the

741
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,360
learnings basically

742
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,360
yeah so any any other questions before i

743
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,320
talk about this

744
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,279
yeah i i have some questions um so

745
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,440
so um

746
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,440
and then this is obviously more for on

747
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,080
the bach mount it's a uh uh a question

748
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,559
right because a lot of people ask us uh

749
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,240
continuously about bulk bounties and

750
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,320
stuff like that but based on your

751
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,600
experience and all that i mean

752
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,600
besides getting obviously your name in

753
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,440
there did

754
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,720
the company

755
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,480
provide you any like

756
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,440
monetary or no no

757
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,240
okay no no so uh i was uh yeah so this

758
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,120
basically i i did not get any you know

759
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,240
any dollar amount uh to my credit so so

760
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,559
bug bounty yeah so you know

761
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,720
you know for bug bounty there are two

762
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,120
different kinds you generally speaking

763
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,440
one is where you actually get paid which

764
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,039
is you know bug bounty program the

765
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,640
companies have those kind of program bug

766
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,320
bounty and another is

767
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,159
popularly called as vulnerability

768
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,720
disclosure program where you just

769
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,799
disclose you know responsibly disclose

770
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,960
the vulnerability to the vendor and they

771
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,399
would give you credit but they won't

772
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,879
give you they won't pay you for that

773
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,399
so

774
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,440
uh

775
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,359
yeah so

776
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,520
so cisco i don't know cisco may have a

777
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,440
private program where they actually pay

778
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,760
i am not aware of that i did not ask

779
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,159
them ask him or ask the team about that

780
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,639
one because i am anyway i it's not yeah

781
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,239
i mean i did not ask him that question

782
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,480
but if if anybody knows you know maybe

783
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,839
they did they do i don't know

784
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
thank you for that because again a lot

785
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,480
of people you know uh they they they

786
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,399
want to see buck bounty has a career

787
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,399
field where they think you know they

788
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,119
will make a lot of money but the reality

789
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,239
is that not all companies pay uh and

790
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,760
probably cisco's one of them i don't

791
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,199
know like you you mentioned you don't

792
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,000
know

793
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
i know my company uh doesn't um

794
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,040
uh

795
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,440
but again everything is different when

796
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,000
when it comes to disclosure this type of

797
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,800
stuff

798
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,800
uh so yep

799
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,720
that's my only question

800
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,200
i have a question yeah uh how did this

801
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,280
get to miter because you need or is

802
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,160
cisco an authorized cv

803
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,280
um

804
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,079
organization

805
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,960
yeah so i think cisco assigned some

806
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,280
cisco probably is assigning a block of

807
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,240
cv numbers right because they have

808
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,560
they just

809
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,079
what do you mean by not go to mitre well

810
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,680
miter is the the the master agency the

811
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,200
government agency that

812
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,839
manages the cve program they just have

813
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,280
assigners

814
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,920
and it looks like cisco may have been an

815
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,240
assigner but usually what happens is

816
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,320
that this goes to miter miter contacts

817
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,440
the vendor

818
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,920
uh i see you did it through uh buck

819
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,800
crowd i guess i know i did it directly i

820
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,640
didn't oh you did it yeah that's that's

821
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,560
what i was saying i did it directly i

822
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,480
sent an email to cisco product team

823
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,280
directly the pcert team

824
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,119
the product support and incident

825
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,040
response the product security incident

826
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,800
response in pcr theme so so it actually

827
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,200
yeah i so i think it's still

828
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,720
so i think so there are i think there

829
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,560
are different ways you can create cv

830
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,680
right so one is through the miter and

831
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,520
other another is this so this was the

832
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,520
easiest way i didn't didn't have to do a

833
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,200
whole lot

834
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,200
other than finding of course other than

835
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,760
actually finding the thing

836
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,079
and just reporting it to the cisco team

837
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,000
that's all right

838
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,680
well you were very lucky that they were

839
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,480
nice to you because sometimes

840
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,800
this is an opinion by the way this is my

841
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,960
personal opinion i've seen researchers

842
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,800
that go direct and then they get

843
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,280
threatened to be sued that's usually why

844
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,599
the best way to do is from either

845
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,440
because sort of my turk will call them

846
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,760
and say hey we got this and we tested it

847
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,119
and it works

848
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,960
uh what you're going to do about it you

849
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,480
have 90 days

850
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,040
that's the responsible disclosure yeah

851
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,400
yeah

852
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,040
okay yeah so i think in my case maybe my

853
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,720
company has some

854
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,880
uh some affiliation with cisco right

855
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,599
although i did not i did not use any of

856
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,599
my company contacts i just emailed them

857
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,400
like directly as if like anybody else

858
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,960
the only thing is i use my my core email

859
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,440
so maybe that that maybe that influenced

860
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,680
them to actually to read it

861
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,400
right

862
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,400
and once they read it then and then once

863
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,720
i had the poc they tried it

864
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,240
so

865
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,599
uh

866
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,760
and yeah i mean i think even our company

867
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,520
we have you know even our company have

868
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,040
the policy that you know if there is a

869
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,119
vulnerability then we create the peace

870
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,720
out finding and if it's in the

871
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,760
production if it's not fixed within

872
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,400
30 days or 60 days then then we create a

873
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,560
cv as well

874
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,680
cool

875
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,040
so

876
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,680
yeah so i i yeah so i think that that

877
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,760
worked for me i i did not have to do a

878
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,839
whole lot of extra work for for the

879
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,920
actual getting the cvs i just you know

880
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,440
reported them

881
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,359
and and i send them the poc that's all

882
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,680
so

883
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,880
any other questions

884
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,119
i kind of had a question so

885
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,359
interesting that you mentioned the you

886
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:25,680
know about the bug bounty you know kind

887
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,280
of like you you get this

888
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,119
sort of an incentive right you go to

889
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,119
apple you find a vulnerability they're

890
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,119
happy to to give you some kind of

891
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,280
compensation right for your time

892
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,400
your effort now yeah do you think that

893
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,520
that that that in in the way that sort

894
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,680
of like your relationship has it changed

895
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,960
the maybe

896
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,960
um the way you think about it now in

897
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,119
terms of when you do you think it would

898
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,040
have because i saw i saw someone they

899
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,359
did something interesting and they found

900
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:56,079
a vulnerability in in one of these um

901
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,880
crypto uh blockchains and then they kind

902
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,440
of reached out and um they they told

903
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,880
them hey this is what's happening and

904
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,839
kind of

905
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,240
they they they went back and forth with

906
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,960
with the security team

907
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,560
to try to figure out how can we

908
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,880
remediate against it and so they told

909
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,200
them exactly what they did and so the

910
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,800
the the conversation was interesting

911
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,760
because

912
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,200
as you know everything in the digital

913
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,280
world is you know it's kind of you know

914
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,359
it's there's a record of it right so

915
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:24,800
they kind of posted it on twitter and

916
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,320
they were like hey you know this is kind

917
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,760
of the situation

918
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,520
that they promised to pay us but then i

919
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,359
guess they didn't you know at the end of

920
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:32,640
the day they were just like happy that

921
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,240
they disclosed it

922
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,560
um i think it's kind of good to get some

923
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,720
kind of compensation but but i do agree

924
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,400
with you you know at the end of the day

925
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,400
you you got the cve

926
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,640
and that's something that you know you

927
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,280
should be very proud of because not only

928
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,359
did you save you know them

929
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:50,800
you know the time in trouble but you

930
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,720
actually came forward you could have

931
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,880
just said hey let me put this in some

932
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,880
forum on reddit and then you know people

933
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,880
would have exploited it so that's really

934
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,040
awesome that you did that

935
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,960
right and and the part of the reason

936
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,760
behind that was you know my goal was

937
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,680
i was already working right i was

938
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,000
actually pen testing other product and

939
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,880
and in while testing that i found this

940
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,119
so it's not like i was looking to get

941
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,359
money from cisco and that's how i that's

942
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:18,800
how i you know and

943
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,560
that's why i started testing that

944
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,319
product it's not it it was not like that

945
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,720
right and right and as far as the bug

946
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,960
bounty is concerned you know i mean for

947
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,880
those people who are trying to look get

948
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,800
into bug bounty you know you can go to

949
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,119
hacker one and you can actually see who

950
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,200
is paying what and then and if you are

951
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,960
looking for you know monetary

952
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,760
compensation then you can you can target

953
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,240
uh you know based on based on that you

954
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,480
know based on who is paying and based on

955
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,760
your interest

956
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,680
so

957
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,839
so yeah i mean i have i have reported a

958
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,800
few on on on hacker one and i have

959
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,560
gotten money for those so but but then

960
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,640
but but during those times i was

961
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,079
actually

962
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:01,680
you know trying to find because i

963
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,040
thought you know yeah if i get some

964
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,200
compensation i'll be happy right i mean

965
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,680
who even this case yeah i mean if they

966
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,440
had paid me you know a few thousand

967
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,640
dollars i would have been definitely

968
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,640
more happy but but even if they didn't

969
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,880
pay i'm okay because because they don't

970
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,640
have a bug bounty program right if they

971
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,400
had a bug bounty public bug bounty

972
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,359
program

973
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,200
then i would have definitely reported it

974
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,720
through that program so that i would

975
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,400
have gotten money

976
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,920
but

977
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,359
this but they don't have a public

978
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,480
boundary

979
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,720
per buck boundary program right so

980
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,160
some companies don't have it some

981
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,650
companies pay a lot i mean it depends uh

982
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:36,800
[Music]

983
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,880
and and for the buck bounty you know

984
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,119
just my my observation for people you

985
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,319
know it's it's easy and it's very tough

986
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,640
because for a buck bounty you know the

987
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,800
companies don't are not giving away

988
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,800
money because they because you report

989
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,319
something to them they they just trying

990
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,319
to protect themselves in fact i would

991
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:56,640
say bug bounty is actually very good for

992
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,480
the come from the company's point of

993
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,680
view because they get a lot of attention

994
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,079
they get they basically hire pretty much

995
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,000
everybody right whoever is participating

996
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,599
in their program and they don't have to

997
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,079
give them full-time salary so you have

998
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,040
to be the first to get paid you know if

999
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,480
you are paying if you are trying to get

1000
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,920
paid from the bug boundary you have to

1001
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,599
find first you have to find a

1002
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:18,960
vulnerability

1003
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,440
which has impact and then second you

1004
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,680
have to be the first one to to find it

1005
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,400
whereas if you are pen testing you know

1006
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,720
its pen testing is way easier than

1007
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,880
because you just find it report it right

1008
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,720
you don't have to be the first you still

1009
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,640
get paid if you are interested

1010
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,960
uh whereas bug bounty bug party i mean

1011
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,319
you you will see a lot of people you

1012
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:39,760
know there are some people who are made

1013
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,760
like like there are probably i don't

1014
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,440
know exactly but maybe there are five to

1015
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,400
ten people

1016
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,640
who have made like a million dollars in

1017
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,880
on hacker one program over over the

1018
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,800
years right over the number of years but

1019
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,359
those people are very few very few

1020
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:55,280
and it's it's not easy because highly

1021
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,119
competitive it's you know because there

1022
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,200
are so many people like so many people

1023
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,079
trying to make money and so so it's not

1024
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,839
easy to get

1025
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,119
to you know yeah i mean you could you

1026
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,440
could be lucky i mean whatever i have

1027
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,000
found i was yeah i mean i found quickly

1028
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,920
and reported to them some of the

1029
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,000
findings i had you know i have had

1030
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,640
and i got paid pretty handsomely if i

1031
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,319
think about it you know like a few

1032
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:19,760
minutes of my effort i get couple

1033
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,000
thousands it's not bad at all

1034
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,319
that's great also but then sometimes

1035
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,640
yeah but then sometimes yeah i think

1036
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,560
you're in if you're involved monty

1037
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,119
you're you're bound by an nda too i

1038
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,560
don't think you can get a cve

1039
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,960
so yeah actually there is another cache

1040
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,079
there so some companies you know if some

1041
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,960
companies have a have explicit policy

1042
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,359
where they don't pay you if it's a cv if

1043
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,599
it's a zero day

1044
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,280
so if you found you know there are you

1045
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,480
know if you look at there are some

1046
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,319
policies so every you know every program

1047
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:55,760
like most programs on hacker one at

1048
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,839
least i know from hacker one they have a

1049
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,079
policy of what they pay for so some

1050
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,400
companies say that they won't pay for

1051
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,720
any zero days some companies even say

1052
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,599
that they won't pay for in zero days

1053
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,760
even after like 30 or 90 days so if

1054
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,760
there is a zero day let's say you find

1055
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,880
you know let's say there is a zero day

1056
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,119
vulnerability in some popular software

1057
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,800
and you actually exploit them and you

1058
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,560
report it to them and even if they are

1059
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,480
paying they may not pay you at all

1060
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,560
because they in their policy they would

1061
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,640
say you know they may have that clause

1062
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,160
where they say hey

1063
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,240
we won't pay you for zero day

1064
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,960
so but but some companies like apple or

1065
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,960
some other company like microsoft you

1066
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:33,839
know

1067
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,240
facebook google they would pay you a lot

1068
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,760
you know if you find a zero day in their

1069
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,960
products

1070
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:39,680
but

1071
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,599
some other companies who are the users

1072
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,160
of those products and if you find zero

1073
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,319
even if you find zero days you won't get

1074
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,880
paid at all

1075
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,119
because they don't uh because again it's

1076
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,200
you know for many companies they are not

1077
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,400
trying to pay you they're trying to

1078
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,920
protect themselves

1079
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,720
right

1080
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,160
i think a cve has more value that

1081
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,680
just getting a couple of thousand

1082
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,400
dollars i think a cbe you know cv

1083
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,680
basically

1084
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,119
gives you a name

1085
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,839
and it puts you above uh many other

1086
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:12,560
people when you're in interviews

1087
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,440
so i i think is i will definitely go for

1088
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,640
the cv

1089
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,800
definitely

1090
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,560
so you did great man

1091
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,599
yeah

1092
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,520
yeah thanks

1093
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,560
yeah so okay so let me let me uh go

1094
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,720
through the learnings uh quickly so

1095
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,880
basically number one is the broaden the

1096
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,119
scope so i've seen you know the the

1097
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,359
reason i say this i've seen some pen

1098
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,839
testers when they are testing they just

1099
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:39,839
they just ask the team hey what's your

1100
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:42,079
software what's the domain you are at

1101
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:44,079
and you know what is in scope so the

1102
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,160
team would say yeah this is my domain

1103
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,240
and they would just use their their

1104
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,520
their domain

1105
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,040
and

1106
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,560
and then they would put that in the

1107
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,480
scope and and just look at that's that

1108
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,920
particular domain and nothing else so

1109
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,839
i mean that's that's a good strategy if

1110
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:01,280
you are actually doing some brute force

1111
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,680
attack because you know or some scanning

1112
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,839
with like uh heavy duty scanning then

1113
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:09,359
that's a good strategy but

1114
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:11,359
but in other case you know like in this

1115
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:13,760
case this this particular test if i had

1116
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,680
excluded webex because webex was not in

1117
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,680
scope i would have just missed this

1118
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,440
right

1119
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,599
but i did not exclude anything i just

1120
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,359
observed the traffic

1121
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:24,240
and then

1122
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,839
i was able to find it because i did not

1123
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:27,520
exclude it

1124
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,880
so

1125
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,119
that's that's that and then the second

1126
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:33,599
is uh

1127
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,319
is this one the you know just do it so

1128
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:39,200
you know like like i took some time uh

1129
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,960
you know thinking hey how how they would

1130
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,160
respond and uh you know

1131
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,800
so so that this is a great video you

1132
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,440
know uh i i'm young you may have already

1133
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,920
uh seen this it's like two minutes one

1134
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,800
minute video actually it's pretty cool i

1135
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,920
like it a lot so i thought i would uh

1136
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,920
i would put that here

1137
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,200
and

1138
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,520
and and yeah and the third thing here is

1139
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,200
try simple things you know like who

1140
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,880
would have thought i mean

1141
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,560
it's 2021 uh age of machine learning ai

1142
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,119
and you know even then there are even

1143
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,839
csrfs yet to be found you know and

1144
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:17,680
companies like even big companies miss

1145
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,200
those kind of things

1146
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,920
even in 2021 so always try simple things

1147
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,160
you know and you might get lucky so i

1148
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,079
just got lucky here tried simple simple

1149
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,240
thing

1150
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,119
so

1151
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,880
yeah that's all i have

1152
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,640
excellent

1153
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,960
any questions

1154
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,960
questions for global 4g

1155
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,960
yeah the slides are probably going to be

1156
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,640
shared in

1157
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,200
discord
