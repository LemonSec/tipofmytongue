1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,770
hey everybody hey everybody how's it

2
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,770
going

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,369
okay I'm gonna stand right here because

4
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:27,799
protector is kind of right so my talk

5
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:30,439
today is using Kratos principles to

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:34,090
secure a diverse accounts using service

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:38,840
control policies so a little about me I

8
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:42,110
love AWS and I've embraced it for at

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,180
least five six years now I knew that it

10
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:46,309
was going to be either things so kind of

11
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:49,250
just jumped all in it and I know you

12
00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:51,229
know I run the consultancy that helps

13
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:56,390
CTOs or security minded CTOs

14
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:59,269
get their security up to speed I also am

15
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:04,010
really into coffee so this is my coffee

16
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:05,120
set at home drives my wife crazy but you

17
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:08,150
know I can talk about single version

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:11,930
coffee and brew methods all day long so

19
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:15,890
a little offset leakage there if you

20
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:19,189
want to you know get to me temp equal

21
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:21,289
coffee I also have a podcast called

22
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:24,320
getting at info SEC and what I do there

23
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:25,530
is I interview folks on how they got

24
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,080
into the

25
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,460
to get into the field can also be

26
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,320
encouraged and learn from their

27
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,509
experience and kind of save some time

28
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,809
and I'm sort of the book so if you were

29
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:38,729
to sit down with coffee in an hour to

30
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,729
tell you you know how to get in with

31
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:45,000
Fring zero this would be everything I

32
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:46,500
would say frankly and I'm also really

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,149
into white shirt so if we see them on a

34
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,640
Friday I like wearing Hawaiian shirts I

35
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,659
think it's really important to you know

36
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,549
keep it Lively

37
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:58,770
and I'm really excited about the car so

38
00:01:55,549 --> 00:02:00,979
coming up so you know might throw some

39
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:06,030
Star Trek references here and there

40
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:09,959
okay so a little bit of a survey how

41
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,790
many folks here have nativist accounts

42
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:15,000
like ten or less accounts or run or

43
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:18,750
manage ten or less okay and then how

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,500
about 25 accounts okay great

45
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:25,769
and then 75 or more accounts okay so

46
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,750
this talk is really it's geared to take

47
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:29,820
advantage of ADA based organizations and

48
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,430
when you have a lot of accounts I'm

49
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,380
going to take advantage of a diverse

50
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:37,530
organizations that run as an

51
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:39,690
organization level so little private or

52
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:43,680
what's Pareto's principle the idea is

53
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:49,470
that you want to make 20% effort to have

54
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,970
80% results so 8020 rule theorem read

55
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:56,599
the 80/20 rule of it's actually called

56
00:02:50,970 --> 00:03:01,030
Kratos principle so let me so

57
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:09,078
and who here has an eight oh six okay

58
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:12,260
okay great so comments cause security

59
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:13,310
issues many you know not sure the

60
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,569
audience don't you're just going to go

61
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:17,719
over this something you might know this

62
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:21,170
or not but let's go over so I am for

63
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:23,989
example so many times there's keys in

64
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:26,540
source code so that's a common issue oh

65
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:28,549
he needs a key this operation certain

66
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,849
type to these keys and so a lot of times

67
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:35,419
developers are lazy and or don't know

68
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:37,429
and may put keys in source code also

69
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:39,919
adding a lot of provisions to instance

70
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:43,669
so yes you might be using role based

71
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:46,159
access which is great but then the role

72
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:47,510
itself might have easy to start I am

73
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,679
starting I have actually seen this out

74
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:53,358
there so that's kind of problematic

75
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,950
storage a lot of leaky buckets we've

76
00:03:53,359 --> 00:04:00,019
heard about s3 bucket

77
00:03:54,950 --> 00:04:01,940
a little bit later and logging so a lot

78
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:04,819
of blogging and the thing is with the

79
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:06,920
cloud if the cloud is everything to

80
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:08,119
reference it thinks this is what

81
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,420
everybody thinks of the cloud and I'm

82
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:14,630
going to be able to do this and you know

83
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:17,988
you're essentially giving a lot of power

84
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:22,940
in the hands from at a keystroke or the

85
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:26,330
CLI with not really cool things that are

86
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,680
locally not knowing like what was

87
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:31,849
necessary you kind of end up with this

88
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,680
and in a way so that's the you know the

89
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:36,200
power clause so we kind of you know as

90
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,360
security professionals we want to help

91
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:45,130
guide your folks and kind of get them to

92
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:48,440
curtailed so leaky has free bonus well

93
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:50,960
somebody has to read it a give up page

94
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:55,100
all that s3 bucket leaks that have been

95
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:57,380
out there right you know even GoDaddy a

96
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:00,350
salesperson leaked a lot of information

97
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,430
FedEx a lot of companies so I don't need

98
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,919
to go to a public

99
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:07,430
look at look at it this is as of last

100
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:10,940
year nine million pieces of data so we

101
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:12,949
don't need a reminder on why a three

102
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:16,759
buckets like that I mean I'm sorry I'm

103
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:19,520
leaking s3 buckets so let's talk about I

104
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:21,289
am I am is the new perimeter right I

105
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,120
think we can all agree in the cloud

106
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:26,240
space I am it used to be the network but

107
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,660
I am is really the new perimeter so was

108
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,330
a security access key and the secret key

109
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:36,139
like this you in any permissions types

110
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:39,020
where you can do whatever you want so we

111
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:42,080
want to stay away from this now who here

112
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:46,609
knows about the codes basis who's here

113
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:49,240
okay so code spaces was a company that

114
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:53,030
offered rock-solid secure and affordable

115
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,740
github hosting okay so if they say it's

116
00:05:53,030 --> 00:06:00,469
rock-solid it secure than must be right

117
00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:02,180
so this was their website of Serbia

118
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:05,120
they'll say like this was a row site

119
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:09,430
where they were in production this is

120
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:12,410
what the rogue site a couple days later

121
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:15,449
so that was our website Jude 14 this was

122
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:17,669
the 17th what happened was

123
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:20,999
had their root keys of the company

124
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:22,889
leaked online and this attacker went and

125
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:24,809
literally just terminated all their

126
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:26,699
instances and their backups and

127
00:06:24,809 --> 00:06:27,719
everything so there's gone and so

128
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:31,229
literally the company went out of

129
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:35,659
business overnight and so this was what

130
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:39,270
their web page look like on the 17th or

131
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:40,770
companies there and in summary this this

132
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:43,409
is what they said so everything was

133
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:47,219
deleted so this is why I am is really

134
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:51,539
important okay so why a tow makes

135
00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:52,979
organizations an SCP well so a little

136
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:55,650
background this talk is really to raise

137
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:57,599
awareness it's not like super it's not

138
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,830
rocket science right but there's a lot

139
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,900
of our folks that are not taking

140
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:04,740
advantage of this and so it's really to

141
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:07,188
kind of increase awareness because you

142
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,749
know again it's where you can just

143
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:11,339
deploy a few lines and you kind of get

144
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:12,990
everything set up and with only a few

145
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:15,509
lines of code you can really secure a

146
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:18,939
lot I mean amidst accounts so that's the

147
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:22,210
idea and you want to have it as a garden

148
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:23,710
go through all the security best

149
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:26,948
practices you're not going to be super

150
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:29,909
secure from justice but it really helps

151
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:29,909
make your job a lot easier

152
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,280
so here's a little overview say you have

153
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:38,830
multiple accounts and you haven't

154
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,409
organized according to our database as

155
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:43,599
well architected framework okay so you

156
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:46,319
have a security account our networking

157
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,430
account shared services and then

158
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:52,000
developers may have their own accounts

159
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:54,550
or not and then you know your production

160
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,719
and your pre fraud in your staging

161
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:58,779
things like that

162
00:07:55,719 --> 00:08:05,039
so god forbid maybe some of these other

163
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:09,490
so this is a lot to manage okay and so

164
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:12,128
it was a CPS does is it applies at the

165
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:14,159
org low so ideally you would have this

166
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:17,770
set up in in different organizations

167
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:19,449
such as this okay so you've taken your

168
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:22,000
accounts and now you applied some sort

169
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:25,839
of logical separation to your accounts

170
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,979
to like say ok it's dev test fraud and

171
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,319
you create go use it you could have

172
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:32,740
several use and you can apply these

173
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:36,310
scps at any level of oh you okay you

174
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:39,240
just apply it at the top of you or some

175
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:41,260
level we'll use anywhere you'd like and

176
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,919
moving your accounts is like super easy

177
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:48,380
I'll walk through it in a second

178
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:50,270
and so here's really like a playbook

179
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:53,090
you want to do if you don't have a

180
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:54,590
reason organizations in STP set up okay

181
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:56,480
you want to just you want to create a

182
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:58,760
Messer accountant with no resources

183
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,520
create the organization and naval all

184
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,900
the features create no use and then move

185
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,120
those accounts of you literally just

186
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:07,280
dragging and dropping and then enable

187
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,020
policies I'll go through all this and

188
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,120
the next few slides but this is really

189
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:14,420
like everything my will talking works

190
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,520
like then you know setup blogging

191
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:22,400
because it's best practice so centralize

192
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:26,930
your logs and then start applying SOPs

193
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:30,260
up that we're gonna go through okay

194
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:31,849
really important do not apply resources

195
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:34,430
or do not apply scps

196
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:36,260
onto your master account okay the whole

197
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:38,089
reason you have to migrate is usually

198
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:40,100
you start off with your master account

199
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:41,000
your master bath has resources and so

200
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:45,890
you have to go through this whole

201
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,420
headache because it's just a rule okay

202
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,860
so if you apply at least you master how

203
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,290
do you lock yourself out I think you

204
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,970
it's just you get this like kind of

205
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:56,449
feedback for your master account you

206
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:58,700
want it to be no resources and just

207
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:02,870
really proceed from there so it's really

208
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:03,050
bad okay so migrating your mess right

209
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,490
now

210
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:06,280
well depending on the size or in

211
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:08,050
addition all around

212
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,870
it's gonna affect your billing you might

213
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:14,380
have reserved instances or like

214
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:18,280
Enterprise billing discount so it's

215
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:19,720
gonna be a medium to big deal right you

216
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,699
might have signed a new contract and

217
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,610
they still live over paper it's uh kind

218
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:31,350
of weird so hopefully it's changed past

219
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:33,370
few months so the simple yet complicated

220
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,080
you know you're also going to lose your

221
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:36,730
billing history on your town so if

222
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:39,940
you're you just if you're using the GUI

223
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:41,800
for that let your folks know so try to

224
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:44,620
stay away from the budget season you

225
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,030
know doing this during budget season I'm

226
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,470
working with a company right now and

227
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,699
they're like yeah we can do this right

228
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,490
now is everybody still using cost

229
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:54,970
Explorer can you let me do this please

230
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:56,920
so yeah so you'll need to sign a new

231
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:59,020
agreement and and then you will create a

232
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:02,079
new organ unlink it link your accounts

233
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:04,900
and then check your bill because you

234
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:07,330
might get a blip you might see like a

235
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,410
like a hundred other dollar increase and

236
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:10,020
then a hundred thousand dollar credit

237
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:14,020
the next month so be kind of funny

238
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:15,460
okay so then no we just want to organize

239
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,560
our organization how does your

240
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:20,230
organisation to work do you do you have

241
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:22,900
you know everything separated fraud and

242
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:25,390
staging and you know nice and clean and

243
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:29,260
logically so this might take baby steps

244
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:31,120
in one place they have a lot of

245
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,819
acquisitions and these acquisitions they

246
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,170
didn't want to mess with them so I just

247
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,299
created another

248
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,649
and it's through there and I didn't do

249
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:40,089
anything without because I don't want to

250
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:41,379
rock the boat

251
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:46,209
you know insecurities have to choose

252
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:48,600
your balance right also a request some

253
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:54,279
limit increased so by default in 2010

254
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:57,999
I'm sorry to take votes but you want to

255
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:59,799
ask for more accounts proprietary

256
00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:02,619
organization so this is how it looks

257
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:05,079
like so now you're you set up your

258
00:12:02,619 --> 00:12:08,919
organization you set up on stage 8 dev

259
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:13,628
another and you just literally commit

260
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:15,459
drag and drop and in any other boot camp

261
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:17,769
you can have multiple use so that we use

262
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:20,290
I think apply to three or five levels

263
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:21,879
deep that I documentation online and

264
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,988
they're just enabling yes there's

265
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:24,519
nothing wrong with doing it just click

266
00:12:22,989 --> 00:12:27,569
enable you're not doing anything yet you

267
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:31,769
don't have any NCP's so it's okay

268
00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:36,488
alright now we're ready to apply to be

269
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:39,939
someone's getting the card okay okay

270
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:40,660
something - no you know scps take effect

271
00:12:39,939 --> 00:12:44,169
immediately

272
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:46,719
so please test appropriately don't do

273
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:50,550
this on a Friday afternoon okay not a

274
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:53,880
good idea so test test test test on

275
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:56,609
on your own test account make sure it

276
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,959
works really I mean you know the first

277
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,940
time I did this I was like super scared

278
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:02,520
I mean I was still like even when I

279
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,470
still do it I was still coming okay

280
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,630
so if we're gonna take these one other

281
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:09,620
thing that you take advantage on your

282
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:12,750
nice view well-organized account

283
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:14,399
organization it is the Quatro you can

284
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,839
create this cloud trail at the master

285
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,820
account this is one resource I would say

286
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:23,310
you can do and you would see this dialog

287
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,620
right here so you can apply this trail

288
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,270
to your whole organization so any new

289
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,670
account that comes up will automatically

290
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:31,980
have this trail yeah and you'll see why

291
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:34,399
I do this later it's just easier to

292
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,970
manage from SOP perspective

293
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,190
unfortunately we don't have the ability

294
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:40,350
to do this at the OE level I would like

295
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:42,500
that to happen put in a request form a

296
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:50,430
dough guess but we know that's not gonna

297
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:52,440
lie to me yeah so so now that we have

298
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:54,569
this cops real account our cloud shall

299
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,690
set up in this particular bucket set up

300
00:13:54,570 --> 00:14:02,870
now we can put an SCP to block this

301
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:07,079
voucher from being deleted and so

302
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:07,939
basically you would apply this ICP this

303
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:11,388
is an

304
00:14:07,939 --> 00:14:17,719
you buy your knee like start the pride

305
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:18,829
and the dev levels and that's a haven't

306
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,019
even you know it's like what is it's

307
00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:22,459
like six lines and this would prevent

308
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:31,939
someone from deleting your cloud trust

309
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:34,518
so this is super important now also

310
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:36,709
protecting your root account so you

311
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:40,220
don't want Australia oh so here's an

312
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:42,799
example of me trying to delete the cloud

313
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,809
show and I'm doing this as a root so I'm

314
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:47,149
logged in as root in one of the accounts

315
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:50,809
and don't let me do it so these NCP's

316
00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:52,129
are really really powerful and open to

317
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:53,899
taking questions this is not going to be

318
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:55,909
like a whole 45-minute talk so I love

319
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:58,419
any questions throughout so feel free

320
00:14:55,909 --> 00:14:58,419
and

321
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:05,009
questions so you can see faux locs so

322
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,499
also again protecting your logs you want

323
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:12,949
to have these full-on set up here's an

324
00:15:07,499 --> 00:15:16,399
example ICP to protect those loggers

325
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:16,399
between it to your life

326
00:15:23,109 --> 00:15:26,109
so

327
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,089
okay eliminate your regions I like this

328
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,959
one a lot

329
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:37,090
so you know your cradle reproduction

330
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:41,890
probe only ones in the u.s. East maybe

331
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:44,920
us West one but it doesn't run in

332
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:49,240
asia-pacific it doesn't run in EU it

333
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:50,860
doesn't run in Ohio so you know if an

334
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:54,640
attacker were to get into account the

335
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:56,650
first thing I would do is create a

336
00:15:54,640 --> 00:16:01,840
resource or great DC - it's a summary

337
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:04,990
that you don't check right so we want to

338
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:07,570
stop that we also it's also helps from a

339
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:10,090
Billy perspective so you know where all

340
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:16,110
your resources are and so if a developer

341
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:18,340
or someone wants to set up a coin mining

342
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:21,580
instance that's what we do right

343
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:24,400
so again understanding where your

344
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:31,150
resources are and just kind of walking

345
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:32,530
that down now this might break some of

346
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:36,610
your laundry because what i'm doing here

347
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:38,920
is denying easy to describe all over

348
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:44,140
except for these regions so if you're

349
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:46,660
relying on this on this api then you

350
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:48,370
know might read you some results and you

351
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,499
can see here this is me trying to launch

352
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:53,799
something in a region

353
00:16:50,499 --> 00:16:57,279
of us east 1 & 2 OS - and it's not

354
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:58,689
working going okay now there's another

355
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,269
with denying instant Sykes

356
00:16:58,689 --> 00:17:04,569
so again comes to buildings so if you

357
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:07,539
don't want everyone launching you know

358
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:10,688
for GPU instance and racking up you know

359
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:14,619
lots of dollars and trying to answer

360
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:16,720
questions on that so this is a way to

361
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:18,518
kind of limit instance types that you

362
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,339
could run so you can do you can take it

363
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:23,589
two ways you can take it to deny it's

364
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:26,319
the time so say you might not know

365
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:29,200
exactly what everyone wants to allow you

366
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,330
can do take the deny approach or you can

367
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,610
take the whole lot of approach I'm gonna

368
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:37,269
allow a is the T threes and m5s and

369
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:39,789
enforcement now I know buddy you take

370
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:42,429
money is by a lot of only like the

371
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:45,070
latest generation instances so at e3 is

372
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:50,830
cheaper than the t2 so even from that

373
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:52,658
perspective you can save money so you

374
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:54,070
know you kind of want to show us

375
00:17:52,659 --> 00:17:57,789
security and good like hey we're saving

376
00:17:54,070 --> 00:18:05,619
Mike so our customers

377
00:17:57,789 --> 00:18:09,929
so yeah based on you know can we do

378
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:12,728
carry customizer based on the role yes I

379
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:18,190
don't think so we could put a condition

380
00:18:12,729 --> 00:18:20,349
or abuse yeah maybe there might be a

381
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:24,940
condition actually that you can apply if

382
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:27,330
I am role is this yeah yeah so in about

383
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:30,279
the mayor March SCP are eight of us

384
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:33,070
added I am light permissions to se PS

385
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:36,279
which really increase the scope of what

386
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:37,960
we can do with SVP so yeah Rose our

387
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:42,729
oyster as long as it's within the

388
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:44,710
condition statement again the minibrute

389
00:18:42,729 --> 00:18:48,639
actions so we don't want actions to be

390
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:50,320
done as route that's you know we want to

391
00:18:48,639 --> 00:18:52,689
stay away from that the best practice

392
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:56,590
your route account is to apply MFA and

393
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:59,950
then blocking way make sure that very

394
00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:01,389
few people have access to it but of

395
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:07,349
course apply carefully and make sure

396
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:10,748
that they're you're testing properly and

397
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:14,678
here is a screen of myself trying to go

398
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:17,080
in and look at the ec2 dashboard I can't

399
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:21,940
do anything this is what that's to be in

400
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:24,520
place here's another one for requiring a

401
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:27,400
Syrian Christian so you want enforced

402
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:30,030
make sure your compliance and best

403
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,920
practices oh here's another one

404
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:35,320
and then we're ending as three

405
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:38,590
public-access right so when you know not

406
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:41,129
allowing someone to create a button with

407
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,129
public access

408
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:52,159
no troubleshooter so again as hippies

409
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:53,870
are using I am like syntax so you know

410
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:56,630
there's a lot of you know can be tricky

411
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:58,360
especially the condition walk you know I

412
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:01,610
spend a lot of time trying to get

413
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:04,629
somebody's conditions right and I found

414
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:07,070
like some really tiny obscure like

415
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:09,380
documentation after you know voter fraud

416
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:10,610
you know I recommend you know just you

417
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,679
know whenever you're frustrated walk

418
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:14,270
walk take a walk and come back to it you

419
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:17,870
know let that self-conscious do the

420
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:19,520
processing but this is an example of you

421
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:22,729
know trying to do the initial box so if

422
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:26,210
you look here you know this is this was

423
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:30,770
where I was kind of like where that

424
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:34,580
where that was helpful also doing some

425
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:37,970
of the little nuances of AWS so you know

426
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:39,408
I tried to change the date here to that

427
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:43,659
because I was just trying to be like a

428
00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:43,659
little goofy does anybody know this date

429
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:53,510
November 5th 1955 it was a date in that

430
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:57,020
Back to the Future you know anyone back

431
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,660
to so but you know any rest

432
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:03,629
was not

433
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:06,300
that they fund and then also limiting

434
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:10,680
principles so you know the principle

435
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:17,159
syntax and SCP is a little different

436
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:21,260
than then I would like so this was this

437
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:22,440
was something that I little tip there

438
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:26,879
okay

439
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:32,210
and really probably valuable site that

440
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:35,730
has a whole new recipes more than this I

441
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:40,680
talked to the developer and he does not

442
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:43,230
want to share his name but it's a really

443
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:45,750
useful website a securedoc cloud and

444
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:48,090
there's tons of Confirmation templates

445
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:51,630
and things there that are I found this

446
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:56,899
super useful so that's and that's about

447
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:56,900
it and thanks so no minutes of questions
