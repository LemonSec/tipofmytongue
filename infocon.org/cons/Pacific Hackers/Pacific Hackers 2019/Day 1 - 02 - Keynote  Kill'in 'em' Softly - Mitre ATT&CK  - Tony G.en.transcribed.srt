1
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:17,290
I don't have to use Dhoni 1 over 20

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,360
a genuine event which 449 and he used

3
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:21,490
one of the cofounders of know all that

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,400
that Shakuntala you guys are her a

5
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:28,830
chocolate on its in Hawaii that

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,830
everybody wants to go on speak in Hawaii

7
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:39,160
so I'm sure he's got a lot of

8
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:41,470
experiences and we shared a lot among

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,699
when it comes to the community and when

10
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:48,100
you have to go through to make this

11
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:49,960
events happen so we look at this profile

12
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:54,370
and I said yeah a lot to have this guy

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:56,289
keynote and like I'm looking forward to

14
00:00:54,370 --> 00:01:06,910
hear what he has to say Denny so we got

15
00:00:56,289 --> 00:01:08,560
further ado Tony Domenico I think that I

16
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,360
thought it was pretty impressive that we

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,220
kind of showed up here only kind of 15

18
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,810
minutes per solo before was actually

19
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:17,760
supposed to start you see how the Hawaii

20
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:19,440
a lot longer its Hawaii times

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,570
I don't know they're 10 I'll tell them

22
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,380
they're gonna be there at 9:00

23
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:26,610
eventually directly so it's a real quick

24
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:29,460
just kind of a shoe I hand that kind of

25
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,990
I asked like what the audience is as far

26
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,119
as kind of technical level and kind of

27
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:37,830
where they sort of sit is everybody here

28
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:40,170
like super technical awesome because

29
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,340
Mike my presentations a little bit kind

30
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,950
of higher level there's more one-on-one

31
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,720
on some minor attack stuff so you know

32
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,630
so again my name is Anthony agenda

33
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,030
medical be 20 G because no one eager can

34
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,679
pronounce or spell my last name I

35
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:57,030
couldn't do it to the fifth grade but I

36
00:01:52,680 --> 00:02:00,560
got a nail down now awesome oh so let me

37
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,560
just kind of get my presentation up here

38
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:22,709
how many people here have heard a minor

39
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:25,530
attack okay so a few people how many

40
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:27,629
have out actually operationalized it in

41
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,459
their own environment yet they went back

42
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:31,048
their gospel cool cool

43
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,519
so there might be something like nuggets

44
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:34,049
you can glean that you might be able to

45
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:36,480
think back with you're kinda excited

46
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:38,040
about that so I got you know the type of

47
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,108
the presentation is really killing them

48
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,450
softly it was minor attack and I really

49
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:44,730
want to introduce you folks who haven't

50
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,349
actually heard of minor attack talk a

51
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:50,790
little bit about that and then dive into

52
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:53,700
a little bit more about what are how do

53
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:56,400
you actually take advantage of that

54
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,138
minor attack knowledge base so you know

55
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,930
the high level of talk about the problem

56
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:02,459
I have a few slides to talk about some

57
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,170
of the high level trends so bear with me

58
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,760
as I go through this I'm kind of setting

59
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,858
up but the overall problem is at least

60
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,108
what I think and then introduce minor

61
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:12,480
attack and then talk about how do you

62
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:14,639
take that and then operationalize it in

63
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,619
your own environment and then of a

64
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,629
couple neat things that I think you're

65
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,370
starting to see some vendors do by

66
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:22,379
creating these threat actor play books

67
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:24,120
and talk a little bit about once you

68
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:26,129
start to understand am i hearing these

69
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,350
types of techniques you can start to

70
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:30,700
understand some dependencies

71
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:33,370
within each one of them I think that's

72
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:40,089
going to be beneficial in maybe three to

73
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:41,650
five years so this is a little bit about

74
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,650
me here that this is now for about

75
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:47,020
thirty plus years or so I actually wish

76
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,820
I had here but I don't anymore but the

77
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:52,140
good thing is all this in from what I

78
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:55,239
hear so I kind of fitting right in there

79
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:57,040
this is my first time a vendor getting a

80
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,960
bit with for Neff about five years or so

81
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,760
but most of my experience has really

82
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,440
been around security consulting I had

83
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,600
this pretty consulting practice that did

84
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,280
the whole full security lifecycle for

85
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,829
penetration testing for security

86
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,420
assessments to remediation I build a

87
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,980
couple's of 20 operation centers and

88
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,530
then we had some instant response there

89
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:16,180
I had the fortunate opportunity to

90
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,760
spending most of those years on Honolulu

91
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,829
Hawaii where I ended up having my

92
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,390
organization there I've sold it to my

93
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:24,940
business partners they turned around the

94
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,169
Sola to fire I so most of my folks that

95
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,480
I kind of work with that fire I

96
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:30,970
eventually ended up at you know I fought

97
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,830
in it and of course the whole finished

98
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,930
doctor pond thing so that's the

99
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,310
corporate version we but really I'm kind

100
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,069
of an island boy at heart and that's

101
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,330
really what

102
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:44,380
how many people got a bit to the islands

103
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:47,229
before a beautiful place out either love

104
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:49,630
it or you hate it I found that I spent

105
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:51,639
though I spent about three or four years

106
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,259
there originally because of the new

107
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:57,130
military that's how I got to know this

108
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:58,419
sir kind of experience Hawaii so talk a

109
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,620
little bit about the problem here I'm

110
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:01,930
going to go through some of these sort

111
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,970
of threat trends here now you know I'm

112
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,770
not sure how how well do you all are

113
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,180
following some of the apps of different

114
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,650
types of threats friends that we're kind

115
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,259
of see happen over the last few years

116
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:13,448
but you guys know the cyber crime

117
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:14,830
ecosystem right how elaborate that is

118
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:17,289
and I think it's the affiliate program

119
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:19,508
that's really driving the volume on a

120
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:20,680
lot of different threats these days but

121
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:22,870
in this my program bingo system

122
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,960
typically a lot of this stuff has been

123
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:29,110
very opportunistic it's the spray of

124
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:31,120
grade you know type approach right we've

125
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:34,509
seen that start to change over the last

126
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,190
few years right I love the other series

127
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:38,380
under the cyber crime ecosystem I'm

128
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,909
becoming a lot more targeted right

129
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,159
especially when they're trying to drop

130
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:44,050
this ransomware payload and we've seen

131
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:46,870
it time and time again this year anyway

132
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:49,870
where there bullseye now is right on

133
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:52,090
state local governments cities and

134
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:54,430
municipalities they're really hammering

135
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,530
in on finding those organizations that

136
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,750
have a weak cybersecurity programs and

137
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:00,030
then they're going

138
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,620
because it's highly likely that their

139
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:04,080
pelo is going to be successfully

140
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,930
installed on those you know machine had

141
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,969
a city of Baltimore you had a whole

142
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:11,430
bunch of cities out in Florida I

143
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:13,920
actually get hit one state was clubbed

144
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:16,200
with their pants down so bad and they

145
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,710
end up having to paint $600,000 for the

146
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:21,300
ransom of course nobody says hey you

147
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,950
should be actually paying the ransom but

148
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,600
at the end of the day you know when it

149
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,670
comes down to dollars and cents you know

150
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,050
sometimes it just makes it most sense to

151
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:30,510
pay the ransom then they actually did

152
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:33,320
that and then you also have here there's

153
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:35,490
about 22 municipalities who are also

154
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,070
infiltrated and her mansion where Tom

155
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:39,630
was dropped in there with in Texas so

156
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:43,790
you kind of start to see this kind of

157
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:47,820
trend here and I would also mention up

158
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:51,090
when you see what Madison where first

159
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:53,550
came out it was affecting usually

160
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:55,169
workstations right it was the users we

161
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,300
put the files now and they're getting

162
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:59,760
into the organizations you're looking

163
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,680
for the critical assets that does those

164
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,169
critical business processes are riding

165
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,180
over and they're securing dollars to

166
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:08,159
squeeze this much kind of I guess you

167
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,540
could say fear out of you that you're

168
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,040
going to end up paying a ransom because

169
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:13,320
when you drop those critical business

170
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,330
processes and they stop working you're

171
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,800
more apt to be able to pay that no

172
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,919
ransom so they're putting a little bit

173
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,890
more investment into that I would also

174
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:25,799
say what's kind of interesting most of

175
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:28,289
these companies that got hit they had

176
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,050
cyber insurance so they weren't actually

177
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:32,249
paying it so I'm wondering are they also

178
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,589
doing some the best

179
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:37,109
looking for organizations who actually

180
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:38,579
have you know cyber insurance and their

181
00:07:37,109 --> 00:07:40,409
knowing hey if we split the time to hack

182
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:44,339
down they're probably going to end up

183
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:48,688
you know paying the ransom right yeah

184
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:49,919
exactly so that's not here so also we're

185
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:51,839
starting to see a little bit of the

186
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,729
tactics starting to change a little bit

187
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,039
the going back to old school remember

188
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:57,779
maybe 20 years ago how they infiltrate

189
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:59,878
the network the initial access into the

190
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:01,859
network which usually at the edge right

191
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:04,739
usually kind of we're focusing on those

192
00:08:01,859 --> 00:08:06,448
edge services and then kind of looking

193
00:08:04,739 --> 00:08:08,518
at services that might have been

194
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:09,929
vulnerable and getting him back away of

195
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:11,789
course now we all know it's fishing

196
00:08:09,929 --> 00:08:13,948
right it's not out right there going in

197
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:16,169
and then going back out but we are

198
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:19,199
starting to see them look at these edge

199
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:21,179
services a bit more especially RDP

200
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,949
there's a lot of RDP sessions but I'm

201
00:08:21,179 --> 00:08:24,899
super surprised that it basically is

202
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:27,479
hanging out there they're either kind of

203
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:30,049
compromising a vulnerability or they're

204
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:33,240
looking at the RTT sessions that have

205
00:08:30,049 --> 00:08:36,688
credentials now one big one how many

206
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,969
people here have heard of blook you know

207
00:08:36,688 --> 00:08:42,568
some people have right no what's the big

208
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:44,459
deal about blue key it's workable

209
00:08:42,568 --> 00:08:47,639
all right I mean that was a big earlier

210
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:50,619
on in May they announced as was

211
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:53,930
microsoft also DHS and a whole

212
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:57,800
NSA all urged everyone to patch these

213
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:59,870
actual systems why because if they were

214
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,420
able to successfully exploit this this

215
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:04,730
could have the ability to spread like

216
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:07,610
the all the worms they'd like ran some

217
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:10,880
way off or like you know want to cry and

218
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:12,560
not petia so that was the big deal on

219
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,350
that one we're starting to see more and

220
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:18,369
more folks or young adversaries kanaky

221
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:22,340
on and I think it was was it earlier on

222
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:26,510
this week we finally started seeing the

223
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:28,310
adversary exploit this vulnerability now

224
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:31,790
of course we've kind of seen this

225
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:35,270
activity in our labs but obviously it's

226
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:37,400
it's now in the Metasploit framework so

227
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:38,960
it's pretty easy just to kind of spray

228
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,340
that stuff out there so I think we were

229
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,870
kind of seeing a lot of you know

230
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:44,150
researchers trying to see what the

231
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:46,040
attack surface looks like but earlier on

232
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,949
it there was either Sunday or Monday we

233
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,750
saw this actually being actively

234
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:52,820
exploited around to a Spain area so I

235
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,260
would imagine and the coming weeks or

236
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,980
months we're going to see this worm I

237
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,779
kind of kicked

238
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,310
you might actually see something like

239
00:09:56,779 --> 00:10:03,199
you know what a cry is gonna happen

240
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:05,510
again in the coming months another one

241
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:08,359
here I just want to you know show you

242
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:11,660
guys this as well you know if you're not

243
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:14,660
into the whole you know understanding

244
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:17,019
how malware can be dropped and so I

245
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:19,730
distributed you know many times now

246
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:22,510
malware is also being distributed a few

247
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:25,399
through cloud storage apps as well as

248
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:27,399
social media apps right you know they

249
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:29,839
know that we're all using these things

250
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:32,600
and in our networks we're allowing this

251
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,730
stuff to go out so why not you know for

252
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,620
example throw something on my Twitter

253
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,839
account it's a meme it's actually

254
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:42,560
pictures file have a dropper on the

255
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:45,500
machine on home grab that thing you're

256
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,149
leveraging speken ography you had a you

257
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,920
know commands within that actual

258
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:51,380
pictures file that then that malicious

259
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,849
malware and then abused in this case it

260
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:55,550
wasn't doing a lot it was collecting a

261
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:57,139
lot of information but man very

262
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:58,519
difficult sometimes to be able to

263
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:01,430
discover this type of stuff it's

264
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:05,779
basically happening along blogspot we

265
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:07,189
got a spin dropbox gonna give up a lot

266
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:09,019
of the malicious payloads are hanging

267
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:12,680
out there and then waiting for some of

268
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:15,889
the like phone home and gravel and then

269
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:17,149
this last one here before I move on how

270
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:20,360
many people are familiar with multiple

271
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:22,550
data streams how many people that know

272
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,120
that malware is kind of stuffing stuff

273
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:26,479
in

274
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,970
all industries and there's a few right I

275
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,490
don't see it all the time but I have

276
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:33,350
seen it for quite a few years so if you

277
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:37,010
don't know it all time data streams it's

278
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:39,230
basically a feature and the NTFS file

279
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:44,870
system right where you're allowed to

280
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:46,220
it's almost like if you have a if you

281
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,680
have a bunch of drawers that you can

282
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,750
open up and you can put stuff in and

283
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,790
that basically what you know all 10 data

284
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:55,460
streams is you're allowed to stuff other

285
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:57,319
things inside a file then you can stuff

286
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:59,300
a file inside another file and that's

287
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,370
what they are kind of doing here is it

288
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:07,069
have an actual macro that was then

289
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:09,410
calling this malicious I guess filer you

290
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:11,180
know soft order inside alternate data

291
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:16,100
streams kind of hiding itself a little

292
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:18,920
bit so with that if I give this

293
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:23,210
presentation to be on also maybe it's

294
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:25,880
you know closed room of organizations

295
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:28,160
and I'm also along with this I gave them

296
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,750
detailed reports about all the different

297
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,449
types of campaigns and what they are

298
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:35,740
active you know actually doing what do

299
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:37,910
you think organizations would ask for

300
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:43,760
from a threat intelligence perspective

301
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:46,400
to make this actionable typically what

302
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:50,100
are they going to ask for

303
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:52,410
firewall well well they're done I mean

304
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:56,220
to be able to detect this stuff they're

305
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:58,890
gonna ask for my penis is gonna give me

306
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:02,340
the mains gonna give you the URLs gonna

307
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:04,350
give me the ashes also uh you know if

308
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:07,620
you know I'm a beggar they're gonna ask

309
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:08,880
us where's the signature or you know if

310
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,520
you're dabbling

311
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,710
you know AI or ml you know they're gonna

312
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,210
ask haters you're out you algorithms are

313
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:18,120
you being able to detect this type of

314
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:20,250
stuff and that's what we're seeing them

315
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,280
ask for but this is kind of easy they

316
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,990
have that capability but as you move up

317
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,850
the stack you can kind of see this is

318
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:28,770
kind of a pyramid of pain here because

319
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:31,680
they're familiar with what that actual

320
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:33,300
pyramid is maybe the last for something

321
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,430
that we're close to the artifacts but

322
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:37,380
typically they don't have that actual

323
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:40,050
capability then lastly well they should

324
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,370
be asking for is probably the tactics

325
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:43,319
that they need from the procedures

326
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,940
because I want to do the behaviors and

327
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,070
be able to understand those those

328
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,020
behaviors so I can identify them in the

329
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:53,010
environment but that's tough because

330
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:58,699
it's very difficult now quite sort of

331
00:13:53,010 --> 00:14:01,950
get this until a few years ago I used to

332
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:04,170
do a lot of presentations around the

333
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:06,660
cyber kill Jim you know remember back in

334
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:09,400
the day it was like super popular

335
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:11,230
so I talked about hey you're going to

336
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,790
understand the adversary and the

337
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:14,410
different types of phases that the

338
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:16,630
adversary goes to to complete their

339
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:19,689
cyber mission and again I have all this

340
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:21,769
stuff and I thought I found them do

341
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:23,269
you know people will come up and say

342
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:24,519
correct presentation told me that was

343
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:26,540
awesome

344
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:28,850
what's the tactics and what's the

345
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,829
techniques nobody really knew what the

346
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:32,660
adversary was doing is like I want to

347
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:34,399
follow that Tony but I don't know what

348
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,469
the frigging techniques are and then it

349
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,050
kind of hit me inside no you know

350
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:41,240
we're gonna figure out how how how do we

351
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:45,758
get that information out to those

352
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:48,259
individuals because really they have

353
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,209
limited understanding of those tactics

354
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:52,220
those techniques and those procedures

355
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:54,469
and even if they didn't have a little

356
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,720
bit of knowledge how are you gonna

357
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:59,029
measure track and document this over

358
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:04,129
time to really really take advantage of

359
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:06,680
this information I think this problem is

360
00:15:04,129 --> 00:15:08,990
the problem that minor attack really

361
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,910
starts to solve now I think there's a

362
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:15,019
lot of benefits with minor attack but I

363
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:16,579
think this is definitely one of them so

364
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:19,560
let me die

365
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:21,000
exactly that this was lives here I'd

366
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,260
like to be able to introduce you to and

367
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,570
then from there you can go to a website

368
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:26,760
and kind of grows a little bit more but

369
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:30,149
what well my heart attack did over the

370
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,380
last few years this is a project that

371
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:33,000
they said hey Lou

372
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,680
you know lending them out they're all

373
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,839
open-source outlets

374
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,630
let me grab all the security reports

375
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:43,080
from vendors from different researchers

376
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:45,839
let me bring it all in and document it

377
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:48,390
so you know and understand all the

378
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,430
different that the actual tactics and

379
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:52,709
corresponding techniques and adversary

380
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:54,449
happen to go through to be able to

381
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:57,270
complete the cyber mission at least that

382
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:59,760
we know of today and they documented it

383
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:02,850
all right here there's eleven well now

384
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:05,370
there's twelve different kind of tactic

385
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:07,649
categories and corresponding techniques

386
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:09,570
so choose if you're in industry you

387
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:11,160
really don't know you know threat

388
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:13,320
intelligence you know certain research

389
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,709
or kind of person you go to this website

390
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:19,410
of man there's so much education you can

391
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:21,270
start to just learn what the adversaries

392
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:23,160
are actually doing this I think it's

393
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:25,980
awesome so if everyone are really good

394
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,079
start what happens is as you drill in

395
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,790
here and here for example here is

396
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,339
PowerShell that's a technique but the

397
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:34,589
adversaries are using you know to be

398
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:36,899
able to do whatever they need to do be

399
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:39,630
able to clean you complete their cyber

400
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:42,630
mission so it gives you an overview of

401
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:45,160
what the actual technique is right it

402
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:49,290
also then tells you something

403
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:51,790
fools how to get some detection and then

404
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:54,399
what operating systems does that really

405
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:56,829
actually work on and then what is some

406
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,290
of the permissions you need to be able

407
00:16:56,829 --> 00:17:01,449
to run this stuff even what are the logs

408
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:03,189
that you need to grab so that you can

409
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:05,260
actually detect when this is actually

410
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:07,750
happening in your environment I tell you

411
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:10,000
it's a wealth of information that now

412
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:12,459
allows you to really get started and

413
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,010
being able to identify how your security

414
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:16,390
posture fares up against some of these

415
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:18,539
real world attacks that are happening

416
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:21,610
out there today

417
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:24,579
so with that what I want to do right now

418
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:27,428
is walk you guys through how do we take

419
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:29,678
advantage of this minor attack

420
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:31,780
information this knowledge base how do

421
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,090
we make it you know actionable and

422
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:40,658
really start to operationalize it in our

423
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:43,658
own environment now when I look at these

424
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:45,010
different types of socks here how many

425
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:47,470
people working on you know it's pretty

426
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:49,990
operation center you do anybody else

427
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:52,750
well what what are the one things that

428
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:55,390
you need to have in a sock you need to

429
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:57,580
have use cases what are you going to be

430
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:59,020
monitoring right I think here we don't

431
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:05,540
know what a new stage is it's basically

432
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:09,500
some logical you know actionable and

433
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:12,500
a proponent of Assad of assume it

434
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:14,180
basically lets you understand what are

435
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,770
you actually going to be monitoring and

436
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,480
what type of information do you need to

437
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:21,950
be able to collect tax the effectively

438
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:23,480
do them now one thing that I do when I

439
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:27,320
walk in a certain order different

440
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:29,870
organizations as I ask them hey what do

441
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:34,280
you monitor guess what response I get

442
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:38,840
not all of them but some of them monitor

443
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:40,700
police activity let me be more specific

444
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,740
what do you monitor and I get the same

445
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:45,110
thing I'm honoring malicious

446
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:49,160
you know activity I think the problem is

447
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:50,929
we rely so heavily on these security

448
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:53,120
controls that we're buying from the

449
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:55,220
vendors we just kind of assume hey we're

450
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,780
gonna take the default rules maybe

451
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,640
there's a little bit of a false tuning

452
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:02,870
in there and then basically they kind of

453
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:05,900
said we forget it's almost like right

454
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:07,820
then we know how sometimes then when

455
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,800
you're driving a car on autopilot you

456
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:15,590
know sometime this is that it doesn't

457
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:20,020
end up very well so I will get a minor

458
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:22,909
attack and these techniques as use cases

459
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:24,440
right I mean you can just you know if

460
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:26,930
you don't even have some well you let me

461
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,810
start with use case use the minor attack

462
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:31,570
technique that's an actual use case I

463
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:33,790
want to monitor

464
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:35,439
that technique so then you start going

465
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:37,060
through and that and when you go through

466
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,920
everything now you have a ton of

467
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:40,960
different use cases now you're starting

468
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,940
to be able to monitor things that maybe

469
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,770
you're seeing that you want wasn't

470
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:47,050
necessarily able to do when you first

471
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:48,730
purchased it so let's go through the I

472
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:50,830
got five different steps here I'd like

473
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,600
to be able to walk you all through to

474
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:55,090
start to get an idea of how you can

475
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,409
operationalize this stuff so the first

476
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:58,270
thing that you want to do is be able to

477
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:59,440
identify the app so can detect the

478
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,400
meeting you want to understand a little

479
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,500
bit more about it

480
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,480
what is that actual technique itself so

481
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:07,360
you can ask yourself some questions here

482
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,490
you know what is the accent I think just

483
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,320
get a little bit familiar with that

484
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:13,210
technique and then what types of

485
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,950
platforms do they actually work on

486
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,900
because you want to start focusing in on

487
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:19,630
the different operating systems I may

488
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:21,820
reside within your environment you know

489
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:24,370
also one of the permissions that's the

490
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:26,250
Abuna admin or are you able to just kind

491
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:30,189
of do it with regular user permissions

492
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:33,490
yeah also what type of data needs to be

493
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:34,630
collected right to be able to happy able

494
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:37,929
to do

495
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:39,669
other tools or technologies or anybody

496
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:41,890
need to ultimately be able to protect

497
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:43,270
this and of course the one thing that

498
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:44,410
we're gonna have to do is figure out a

499
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,940
way to be a little you produce that

500
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,890
attack right because when you go through

501
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:50,530
that you typically won't be able to

502
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:51,789
reproduce what that particular technique

503
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:53,740
was doing if you want to be able to

504
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:56,559
create that digital dust that that

505
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:59,080
technique leaves behind now if you ask

506
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,549
them answering these questions on all

507
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,889
the different sort of techniques first

508
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:04,539
that might save you a lot of a lot of

509
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:07,030
time because you might go through this H

510
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:09,340
if I'm not in plenty any of the right

511
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:12,250
data that I need so you might actually

512
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:14,860
get a lot of really good insight into

513
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:16,390
how you measure up against these

514
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,399
techniques but just ask a lot of

515
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:20,710
questions on all these different

516
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,799
techniques but let's say you go through

517
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:27,700
that and now some of the things that I

518
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:30,070
get asked a lot is what's the selecting

519
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,900
process there's so many techniques close

520
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:34,750
to 300 what do I start

521
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:36,820
well run I talked to our variety of

522
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:39,640
people who have operationalized this and

523
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:41,889
you know some will just start in the

524
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,980
upper left hand corner and go all the

525
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:47,679
way through which I guess is fine what I

526
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:50,289
recommend one is do it in phases because

527
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:54,400
you want to get some quick wins and when

528
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:56,080
you start out that phase one when you

529
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,929
put this process you're going to realize

530
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,760
that okay the techniques there it gives

531
00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:01,730
you good information but there's a lot

532
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,710
of variation

533
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:06,440
the way the adversaries can execute that

534
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:08,780
technique and may take some time but

535
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:11,390
when you look at for example persistence

536
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:13,100
its kind of static you know it's a

537
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:14,840
little bit easier you to be able to

538
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:17,179
detect that so I will start out with the

539
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,919
whole kind of persistent attack that

540
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:21,230
you've walked down all those actual

541
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,850
techniques that would be phase one get

542
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:25,100
some quick wins and that can kind of go

543
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:27,520
through these two they see before the

544
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:30,469
other approach I've actually seen is

545
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,960
individuals would identify some of the

546
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:35,420
techniques that they've kind of seen

547
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,980
commonly being used like powers on you

548
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,870
know so then they kind of figure out how

549
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,520
they get guys to be able to detect you

550
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:43,040
know PowerShell being used in the

551
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,540
nefarious way of course you're going to

552
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,850
want to actually document some of this

553
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:48,409
stuff here right oh there's a variety of

554
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:51,800
different sort of things to get back

555
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:53,390
that you can do and we don't have

556
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:57,350
anything you can always use you know

557
00:22:53,390 --> 00:23:00,650
good a little excel starts out excel is

558
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:02,750
going to be fine six months to a year

559
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:05,090
into it you're gonna hate Excel you're

560
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:06,650
gonna wish you did something else but at

561
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:08,600
least is a good place to start might

562
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:11,120
either has something out there call this

563
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:15,110
attack navigator that may help a little

564
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:17,179
bit but if you have a development team

565
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:18,240
and you have a good relationship with

566
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,830
anyone

567
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,630
ability to a small little app here I

568
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:25,149
would imagine Walmart's probably got

569
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:29,590
something pretty elaborate you know back

570
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:31,870
in your area and also what you want to

571
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:35,080
be able to do is define these different

572
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:37,840
levels I say keep it simple you don't

573
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,189
reg yellow green red is I can't find

574
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,649
that thing at all I got zero visibility

575
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:44,500
into that particular technique or maybe

576
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:47,620
yellow partially I'm still missing some

577
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:50,919
things or maybe it's green paper I got

578
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:53,469
that one covered so you start out adding

579
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:55,809
those different levels there so that's a

580
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:58,690
little bit about identifying the asset

581
00:23:55,809 --> 00:24:00,309
in yourself now you want to start to

582
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:04,330
figure out how to ID simulate that

583
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:05,799
attack you know how do I do that so one

584
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:07,330
of the things that you could do I know

585
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:08,650
this is a hacker conference here a lot

586
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:12,280
of you were probably able to be able to

587
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:13,960
go in and use a lot of the open-source

588
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,879
kind of hacking tools or even some of

589
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,010
the commercial tools you could look at

590
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,720
Metasploit framework you got a canvas

591
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:23,290
you get a bunch of other ones out there

592
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:24,460
you know PowerShell you know Empire and

593
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:26,830
all these other ones of you could

594
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:30,400
leverage but also if you're not an

595
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:32,290
expert in that stuff you'd be amazed

596
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,049
here there's a lot of other free

597
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:37,809
simulation products that you can use

598
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:41,049
basically simulates the attack it's very

599
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:45,580
benign it just makes that sort of

600
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:46,660
technique produce the log and that's

601
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,220
really what you want you want to

602
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:50,110
actually be able to produce the action

603
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,290
and then you can kind of figure out if

604
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:54,949
you're able to detect

605
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:58,159
or not atomic ray teaming superwoman

606
00:24:54,950 --> 00:25:00,950
with that attack IQ that's a commercial

607
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:03,380
product but as I said pretty cool too

608
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:05,030
and this is other month here if you want

609
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,890
to use Metasploit because the problem

610
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:10,370
using Metasploit right now if you don't

611
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:13,790
know it very well and you don't know the

612
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:16,209
exact thing to do in the Metasploit and

613
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:20,420
translating back to the attack technique

614
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:21,950
from lighter you're gonna struggle a

615
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,780
little bit you gotta find someone who

616
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:27,410
knows what you're talking about what

617
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:30,050
these guys did here is they mapped the

618
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:32,210
attack the minor attack techniques to

619
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:33,830
the Metasploit frameworks was up another

620
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:36,080
ad on there so once you install the

621
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:38,360
Venice boy framework you add this on top

622
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,360
of it and now you can just you know

623
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:43,909
select focus to be on a specific attack

624
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,469
number and it's going to execute it a

625
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:47,300
little bit easier I haven't used that

626
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:49,450
yet but I heard it is actually pretty

627
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,450
decent

628
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:54,840
so if you know it's super hard to see

629
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:57,000
everybody but uh this is kind of an

630
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,490
example here here I'm using the you know

631
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,220
the best way you know framework I have a

632
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:13,320
shell on that you know the actual system

633
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:15,330
now so you see what I'm trying to do

634
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:18,330
here right now what I want to be able to

635
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:20,639
do is do escalator privileges but first

636
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:23,970
I'm trying to get persistence on the box

637
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:28,770
so basically what I'm doing is I'm

638
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:31,530
trying to insert a script inside the run

639
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:35,670
registry keys that's what I'm doing here

640
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:38,520
first and you're gonna notice that boom

641
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:40,680
I've been denied and I just don't have

642
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:43,710
the right access right so kind of move

643
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:46,320
it along here somehow I gotta be able to

644
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:47,880
get more access so you know in the

645
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,159
Metasploit one of the things that I

646
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,230
should easily be able to do I want to

647
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:55,370
see get UID so I can see who the heck I

648
00:26:52,230 --> 00:27:02,310
am I found that I'm is a user whose

649
00:26:55,370 --> 00:27:04,919
start it over again so now you get

650
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:06,810
system automatically it's a nice little

651
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:09,120
way for me to be able to try to get

652
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:13,620
system privileges here are we gonna find

653
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:17,810
out is once again it didn't work and I

654
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:17,810
the reason why it didn't work

655
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:26,230
Pat this down before get here you're

656
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:26,230
right

657
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,519
everybody know what you may see is right

658
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:34,919
when you're on a machine like physically

659
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:36,509
on the machine and that thing kind of

660
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:38,250
comes up and says hey you sure you want

661
00:27:36,509 --> 00:27:39,690
to do this nice pair privileges you know

662
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:42,330
yes or no you click yes

663
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:44,250
see it's easy but if you were a hacker

664
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:46,199
or you're trying to attack a machine and

665
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:48,210
remotely you don't have that ability to

666
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,399
you know be able to click yeah so

667
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:52,620
somehow either circa midnight and that's

668
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:56,939
how that's what we got to do now is to

669
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:58,889
be able to get around that UAC so

670
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,899
basically what I'm going to do is it

671
00:27:58,889 --> 00:28:03,178
Metasploit we're going to find one of

672
00:28:00,899 --> 00:28:07,678
the exploits that's already there for me

673
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:09,539
to be able to bypass UAC this process

674
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,120
here liquid I mean it's about support a

675
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:14,450
little bit and now what that actually

676
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:18,629
gonna bid is it's going to give me

677
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:23,399
another session but now it has the right

678
00:28:18,629 --> 00:28:25,408
access that I need so I'm gonna hop back

679
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:31,789
in that actual session here after you

680
00:28:25,409 --> 00:28:31,789
exploit it boom looks like it worked

681
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:45,849
so now I want to see who you know Who am

682
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:48,279
I as you see this now it's a little low

683
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:50,769
but now I'm trying to get system now and

684
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:53,859
now I got access now the fact that I've

685
00:28:50,769 --> 00:28:56,289
access I'm going to go back in and try

686
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:58,899
to establish my persistence so I'm

687
00:28:56,289 --> 00:29:01,570
basically going to do that the same rage

688
00:28:58,899 --> 00:29:03,820
without exe command in that actual shell

689
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:07,689
and you're going to see that it's

690
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:11,439
actually going to be successfully pumped

691
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:13,869
in there so riskier you know it's

692
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,179
basically what you would do then to be

693
00:29:13,869 --> 00:29:18,849
able to test that specific tactic

694
00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:21,009
corresponding technique easy if you know

695
00:29:18,849 --> 00:29:23,590
what the medicine went framework it is

696
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:25,690
but if they if you don't you know of

697
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:27,879
course some of those simulation tools

698
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:33,940
are really good you're gonna be able to

699
00:29:27,879 --> 00:29:35,859
use cool so from there now ninety done

700
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:38,229
as you start to kind of identify how to

701
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:39,668
be able to simulate that attack now we

702
00:29:38,229 --> 00:29:40,899
want to start being able to monitor

703
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:44,070
these things right I mean how do we

704
00:29:40,899 --> 00:29:45,939
actually monitor or the bar to that

705
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:47,470
environment one of the things that you

706
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:49,899
want to be able to figure out you know

707
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:51,700
do you set up a new environment like a

708
00:29:49,899 --> 00:29:52,840
testing environment or do you just kind

709
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:55,230
of do it in your production environment

710
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:59,129
the people that I've talked to or

711
00:29:55,230 --> 00:30:01,260
I've gone to the the fighter attack

712
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:03,059
you know conference the first year they

713
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:05,790
had and a lot of people were out there

714
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:07,830
talking about their trials and

715
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:10,080
tribulations of being able to implement

716
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:11,909
this minor attack framework and a lot of

717
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,678
them said I just do it get the

718
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:15,690
production environment I guess kind of

719
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,340
isolate a little area of in the

720
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:19,740
production environment but I want to use

721
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:22,678
my production security controls to

722
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:24,480
really see if I'm able to you know to

723
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:26,940
detect this or not so I would probably

724
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,710
recommend actually doing that you could

725
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:31,200
set up y'all kind of test environment

726
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:36,440
but gosh it's a lot of work a whole lot

727
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:39,590
of work you know it maybes even up a

728
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,590
hybrid environment

729
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:48,090
what other good thing really to be able

730
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,030
to do is to create a list of all your

731
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:52,289
security controls that you have because

732
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:54,330
what you're gonna find as you go through

733
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:58,530
this process you're gonna find out which

734
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:59,820
ones have the most coverage and you're

735
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:01,289
gonna find out which ones have you

736
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:04,350
purchased they give you the most bang

737
00:31:01,289 --> 00:31:06,179
for your buck so having this knowledge

738
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:10,559
with my air attack is going to give you

739
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:13,320
folks the actual consumers a lot more

740
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:15,178
leverage I know the vendors realize this

741
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,530
and you can see it now do you see some

742
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:18,390
of the vendors some of their products

743
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:19,918
they're all talk about either attack

744
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:22,590
their all-star can implement minor

745
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,169
attack framework into their their you

746
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:26,100
know different types of tools now also

747
00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:28,409
what are the ones they start out with

748
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:30,360
first most of the video art tools right

749
00:31:28,409 --> 00:31:32,460
there on the end the end point but I've

750
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:34,039
also seen a lot of folks start

751
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:37,679
implementing this fighter attack

752
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:43,140
framework also in sandbox technology as

753
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:46,230
well so now trying to evaluate kind of

754
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:47,610
what your gaps are right to kind of

755
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:48,090
focus on what our necks looking on the

756
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,949
trolls

757
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:51,090
you're really gonna look at most most of

758
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:53,669
the time it's really going to be

759
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:55,139
something with samurai long at you know

760
00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:57,840
aggregator that you're going to be

761
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:59,340
looking for one important thing I think

762
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,139
you might actually forget as you're

763
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:03,030
going through this is how do you

764
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:04,530
validate the actual collection change

765
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:06,840
and I'll tell you really what I mean

766
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:08,549
about that here you know in a minute

767
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,340
make sure that you're looking at the

768
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:14,490
security controls itself and the entire

769
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:16,649
team to make sure that you're not losing

770
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:20,130
in somewhere else so what I mean here

771
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:21,080
with a collection chain so here you put

772
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:23,390
that actual effect

773
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:25,550
you're simulating maybe you're using

774
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:26,810
Metasploit or something like that you

775
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:29,300
know the first thing you want to look at

776
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:31,220
did that technique actually execute and

777
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:34,430
then the logs kind of generated on the

778
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:37,400
box itself see what you got there and

779
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:39,350
then from there alone maybe uh there

780
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,030
might be a security control you have on

781
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:43,969
there that's maybe going back to some

782
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:46,190
type of management system look in there

783
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:48,170
and see if the logs are there and then

784
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:50,480
of course you want to be able to come

785
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:53,600
back and see if the logs finally

786
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:56,060
actually got to let's see myself along

787
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:59,540
that way you might have you know a bunch

788
00:32:56,060 --> 00:33:02,600
of other you know weird is happening you

789
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:03,649
got no you got switches routers there so

790
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,939
you want to make sure all that

791
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:08,210
informations going back you'd be

792
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:10,550
surprised how many times there's an

793
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:12,380
issue the actual technique work you know

794
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:17,389
somewhere along the way there was some

795
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:18,800
issue there and then lastly here I'm

796
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:21,170
going to be able to review and improve

797
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,879
of what you currently have right so once

798
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:24,740
you kind of document you identify some

799
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,300
of your gaps right you're gonna look at

800
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,980
different types of you know

801
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:30,260
configuration changes they're going to

802
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:32,690
need on the security controls you might

803
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,129
need some additional logging that you're

804
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:35,540
gonna have to figure out how to put in

805
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,690
place of course you might need some

806
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,490
rules

807
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:40,380
some dashboards you're going to have to

808
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:42,750
create and whatever your actual sim is

809
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:45,600
but really ultimately what you ended up

810
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:47,670
doing now is you got no whether that's

811
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,699
an Excel spreadsheet this happens to be

812
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:52,440
the attack by your attack Navigator

813
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,780
you're going to end up with red yellow

814
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,250
green right management love those colors

815
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:58,200
right so you want to be able to give

816
00:33:56,250 --> 00:34:00,390
them that so you can quickly determine

817
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,060
if you got a dab sir if you don't got

818
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:04,650
gaps right and that's how it actually

819
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:07,409
kind of works and and that the

820
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:09,630
high-level bevel point here was just to

821
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:11,760
show you folks you kind of how easy it

822
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:13,409
really is at a higher level just to

823
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,330
start implementing this minor attack

824
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:18,360
framework I think it's super important

825
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:19,980
something that hopefully a lot of other

826
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:22,560
organizations are gonna start to do more

827
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:24,810
and more so with that I switch gears a

828
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,940
little bit and start talking about a few

829
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:28,830
things as you start to get a little bit

830
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,450
more mature and you've implemented

831
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:32,130
monthly all and get actual minor attack

832
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:34,199
framework what are some of the other

833
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:39,149
things are you're gonna be able to sort

834
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:41,520
of glean out of this one this starts to

835
00:34:39,149 --> 00:34:43,109
help you answer the question everyone

836
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,210
management will come up to you and they

837
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:48,690
saw something in the news now some to

838
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:51,120
attack a are we are we we belong

839
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:52,710
protected against this you know do how

840
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:55,918
we fare that's basically the

841
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:57,390
and you know what's the answer oh yeah

842
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:59,700
we're good we're good

843
00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:03,328
then you go back and figure out got

844
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:04,950
another army army this having this minor

845
00:35:03,329 --> 00:35:07,260
attack Frank's weren't in there I think

846
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:08,910
gives you a little bit more of the

847
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,260
ability to be able to do that and

848
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:13,649
there's a couple things are happening

849
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:15,990
right now in in the industry one besides

850
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:17,309
there's other bankers now you know

851
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:20,160
especially part of the cyber threat

852
00:35:17,309 --> 00:35:22,500
Alliance where we're creating these

853
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,799
threat actor play books and it's

854
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:27,119
basically you know collection of

855
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,190
different types of you know techniques

856
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,140
and tactics overall steps and

857
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:33,569
adversarial you know we go through so

858
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:36,690
when we do our research we're mapping

859
00:35:33,569 --> 00:35:39,240
that stuff back to miter so when you do

860
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:41,280
that we're also having we call a

861
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,618
playbook viewer so you go to our quarter

862
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,980
guard calm you'll have a clippo viewer

863
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:49,410
there that will show one yell threat

864
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:51,089
actor the different campaigns and these

865
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:54,118
campaign whether the acts

866
00:35:51,089 --> 00:35:55,680
and corresponding techniques map back to

867
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:57,329
minor that they're actually doing you

868
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,129
click on that and you'll see a little

869
00:35:57,329 --> 00:36:01,289
bit more information about it we almost

870
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:02,999
have a JSON file that then you can kind

871
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:05,160
of download and implementing into your

872
00:36:02,999 --> 00:36:07,169
environment so we're starting to do more

873
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:09,808
and more of that so there's one side

874
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:11,700
where if you know how will you fare

875
00:36:09,809 --> 00:36:13,979
against you know the attack techniques

876
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,299
you can quickly determine how well

877
00:36:13,979 --> 00:36:18,269
you're going to fare against those

878
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:20,788
particular playbooks that's the same

879
00:36:18,269 --> 00:36:22,919
token if there hasn't been a playbook

880
00:36:20,789 --> 00:36:24,779
out there yet for this specific attack

881
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,150
that may be a management is asking about

882
00:36:24,779 --> 00:36:29,880
it's really not that difficult once you

883
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:32,430
get a good understanding of what the

884
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,380
actual TTP's are then you can start to

885
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:36,989
look at whatever research is out there

886
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:39,210
and you can do your own mapping in this

887
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:42,269
case this is something last year I mean

888
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:43,769
this is one of the arms worm attacks

889
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:47,069
they're kind of focused on a lot of the

890
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:49,200
healthcare you know industry and you can

891
00:36:47,069 --> 00:36:51,058
basically map out a lot of their so it's

892
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,729
not that difficult to do and then you

893
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:56,400
can start diving in a little bit more to

894
00:36:53,729 --> 00:36:58,348
these actual techniques in this case it

895
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,739
looks like the end of the executions

896
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:04,619
that are usually run DLL 32 to register

897
00:37:01,739 --> 00:37:06,860
that malicious DLL into memory from a

898
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:09,410
persistence perspective they

899
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:11,630
we would start a new service they give

900
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:13,759
it that actual display name and they're

901
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:15,410
basically having the they're executing

902
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,720
that malicious bent pelo so it gets some

903
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:20,270
five different reboots and then they go

904
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:22,370
on and on here where basically what they

905
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:24,350
were doing as they were trying to

906
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:26,150
discover things that were on the box

907
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:29,900
they were doing a lot of collections so

908
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:33,380
can you actually detect win CMD is spawn

909
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:37,040
and they're running next year that

910
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:39,290
accounts system info IP config can you

911
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,600
detect that type of stuff and as you go

912
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:43,250
through all of course here moving

913
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,960
laterally they're using Windows and they

914
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:47,600
still have these chairs to copy their

915
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,460
malware from system the system you go

916
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,500
through that document that you go

917
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:54,860
through and then because you understand

918
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:56,270
what your capabilities are now but the

919
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:58,820
regular living here well you can

920
00:37:56,270 --> 00:38:01,700
actually see how well you fare up

921
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:03,800
against that particular adversary but

922
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:05,779
when here is now you come back to

923
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,790
management with a little bit more

924
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:09,650
detailed information and you can say you

925
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:12,470
know what we do creation but you know

926
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:14,540
over here we're totally blind you know

927
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:16,040
how that also helps come budget time

928
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:17,990
well you want the money to get that

929
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,310
particular type of tool you can say they

930
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:21,979
look you asked me about all this stuff

931
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:24,020
we don't you know we're blind in this

932
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:25,580
area they might be more have to be able

933
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:29,120
to give you the money you know they'll

934
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:30,529
go buy that actual tool and now closing

935
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:35,540
it up here just going to finish out the

936
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:37,850
presentation a little bit now once you

937
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,390
start to identify and you know these

938
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:40,910
acts

939
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:44,058
that means because they are a standard

940
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:46,180
there's now a common language we could

941
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:48,859
start to identify some of the attack

942
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:51,288
dependencies now folks have been in this

943
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:52,788
industry you're doing IR now and you

944
00:38:51,289 --> 00:38:54,799
know what have you probably get a little

945
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:56,180
sense of what is happening now if you're

946
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:58,038
doing circus right hunting

947
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:59,930
you probably already know some of the

948
00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:02,450
dependencies but the majority of folks

949
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:05,660
really don't there was something else I

950
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:07,879
was in a Scotland and we did at the

951
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:11,569
first conference in Scotland and there's

952
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:13,910
Gaea Andy Applebaum he saw a part of the

953
00:39:11,569 --> 00:39:16,910
fighter attack project here this really

954
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:19,190
neat presentation on looking at the

955
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:21,618
different types of dependencies with

956
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:24,769
these actual techniques and of course I

957
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:27,200
think we all know this but no technique

958
00:39:24,769 --> 00:39:28,879
is rarely executed and stands alone

959
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,129
you're not just going to find one

960
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,569
technique you're gonna find it you're

961
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:34,700
going to see that one technique crime

962
00:39:32,569 --> 00:39:36,349
and you know there's probably a couple

963
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:38,779
techniques that would probably happen

964
00:39:36,349 --> 00:39:40,220
before and you're going to know a few of

965
00:39:38,779 --> 00:39:41,990
the actual techniques that the

966
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:44,149
atmosphere that has to do you know to

967
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:46,339
move forward if you start to understand

968
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:52,220
that stuff you know that there's going

969
00:39:46,339 --> 00:39:54,049
to be usually a chain of I guess common

970
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:56,450
techniques that you can continue to

971
00:39:54,049 --> 00:39:58,579
actually see and then once you

972
00:39:56,450 --> 00:40:00,240
understand that it's going to help you

973
00:39:58,579 --> 00:40:02,940
prepare your defense

974
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,770
a little bit more romantic it's like

975
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:06,510
that this technique happens now I know

976
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:08,250
that these things had them probably

977
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:10,290
happen sort of before or maybe one of

978
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:13,320
the three and here's the three or four

979
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:16,590
or five that the adversary can actually

980
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:19,230
do next a little example about here you

981
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:21,000
know it's fairly simple you know you

982
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:24,240
hear about lateral movement all the time

983
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,620
but and you know you might think that

984
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,540
it's very difficult but at the end of

985
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,859
the day moving laterally that all the

986
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:31,050
adversary DS is three different things

987
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:33,450
one they need to be able to have the

988
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:35,640
right access right you know to move so

989
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:37,410
now there's all types of different types

990
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:41,040
of potential attacks

991
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:43,410
there's toking stealing you know whole

992
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,220
bunch of sort of ticket stealing kind so

993
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:46,950
on so forth

994
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:49,049
the gold in cut together the silver

995
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:51,509
ticket you know got me the other once

996
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:52,440
they have that now I have to figure out

997
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:55,140
a way to be able to tell me they're

998
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:57,960
malware from system a system you can do

999
00:40:55,140 --> 00:41:00,480
that through our desktop you can use

1000
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,100
nope is exactly a lot of the adversaries

1001
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,320
do and then they know that admin share

1002
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:06,870
it was on the box so that you kind of

1003
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,160
copy off of those and finally the guys

1004
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:11,790
will be able to get their mouth were to

1005
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:13,710
execute power shell that eww am i or

1006
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:15,120
exploit the vulnerability to be able to

1007
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:16,830
do that but at a high level these are

1008
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:19,529
the three things but you see this year

1009
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:21,690
all that stuff is one two words if

1010
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:25,890
someone else going to did this this is

1011
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:27,240
whole this exact slide the information

1012
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:29,970
well apparently the high level is

1013
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:32,669
his wording might actually be different

1014
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:37,459
now because of the Micra attack now the

1015
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:39,869
C language now I have a systemic

1016
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:42,180
documented common language now that I

1017
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:44,070
can use and when you have this now I

1018
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:48,000
think that allows you to start seeing

1019
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:51,300
some dependencies I'm excited right now

1020
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,980
to see the near future where we see

1021
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:55,650
different technologies go for this

1022
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:58,200
automatic threat hunting now so if

1023
00:41:55,650 --> 00:42:00,990
you're able to look at these different

1024
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:03,149
types of techniques find some of the

1025
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:05,729
actual logs yellow or the digital does

1026
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:07,320
that's actually left behind make sure

1027
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:10,530
you can associate that with the

1028
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:13,230
technology now when they see that now

1029
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:15,030
the actual you know the machine now it's

1030
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,830
okay well I'm gonna start hunting for

1031
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:18,330
things that happened before almost are

1032
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:20,098
hunting for the things that I know have

1033
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:22,770
to actually happen next I'm looking for

1034
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:25,260
your evidence of that within the logs

1035
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:26,970
and I think that real quickly can start

1036
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:29,670
to help you understand the scope of a

1037
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:31,230
breach yes is anybody doing that

1038
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:34,500
technique changing today whether

1039
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:38,190
associate I don't think we have enough

1040
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:40,530
data again yeah actually uh the miner

1041
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:43,320
guys are see so you see a little bit of

1042
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:45,630
it now I mean they're they're able to do

1043
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:48,960
it because and the way that they're

1044
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:50,660
doing it is their reports yeah yeah but

1045
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:55,740
I'm really seeing it kind of real Brooke

1046
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:57,569
but I will say this why your attack I

1047
00:42:55,740 --> 00:43:00,149
think it is kind of coming out of the

1048
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:02,550
membership and I think you're going to

1049
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:04,470
start to kind of see this this on a much

1050
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:06,290
larger scale there's a lot of other

1051
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:08,200
organizations I think are going to be

1052
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:11,259
providing this information

1053
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:14,529
the inoculum more data then we can start

1054
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:18,010
using analytics and see real world and

1055
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:20,140
what so you know folks are kind of

1056
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:21,880
living with this and I think you know in

1057
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:24,190
my mind I love this slide was Muhammad

1058
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:26,320
Ali actually said the best the hands can

1059
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:28,060
hit with us can see you don't have that

1060
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:30,160
granular visibility into your

1061
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:32,170
environment it's really gonna be tough

1062
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:34,210
you're flying blind so I really would

1063
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:36,400
encourage you folks if you guys have

1064
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:38,620
don't actually run your stock talk to

1065
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,450
your sock folks and ask them if they've

1066
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:42,370
introduced a minor attack framer and how

1067
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:44,109
they operationalized it and just

1068
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:46,000
encourage them could actually do so

1069
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:48,220
that's pretty cool some of the things

1070
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,530
that you can do I say on the other side

1071
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:53,040
though for the offensive side I think

1072
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:57,460
there's some interesting things as well

1073
00:43:53,040 --> 00:44:00,160
mitre has some open source software that

1074
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:03,130
they created caldera which they're

1075
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:06,490
actually kind of just some automated no

1076
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:10,600
AI have stopped what they do is you

1077
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:12,580
basically can create a you know big

1078
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:14,650
circle admission so hey this is what I

1079
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:16,450
want to do kind of click that and here

1080
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:18,400
the actually kind of over also like

1081
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:19,870
thinks I want to use cool and then you

1082
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,020
run it and then it tries to kind of

1083
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:25,368
figure out okay if I got access here is

1084
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:28,190
business so you start to see

1085
00:44:25,369 --> 00:44:31,160
to fruition now I'm really excited to

1086
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:33,870
see what happens in their future so with

1087
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:36,969
that said thank you for your time

1088
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:36,969
