there's been a little bit of grassroots

36
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:03,080
culture when it comes to hacking and

37
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:04,640
understand the responsibilities that you

38
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:08,270
have a survey for sec professor on this

39
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,450

00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:46,420
and start playing we hopefully I will be

52
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:49,400
having a lock-picking village and I

53
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:53,208
understand that there's a hockey match

54
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:56,299
so you will be able to play with it

55
00:02:53,209 --> 00:03:01,160
you'll be able to interact with it so

56
00:02:56,299 --> 00:03:03,830
just ask mr. su how to get ahold of one

57
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:06,220
of those and

58
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:10,130

00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:28,010
laugh as much as you can and we're

66
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:30,080
working very hard to expand this event

67
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,459
and make it bigger and more affordable

68
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,440
for everybody because that's that's the

69
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:35,780
point of this event that the point of

70
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,090
this event is to bring like-minded

71
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,280
people and people that are in need of

72
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,500
help when I when I was trying to

73
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,200
practically the InfoSec industry 10 15

74
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,780
years ago you basically have to do some

75
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,700
teach yourself and all these tactics

76
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,890
groups we're like Oh secure girls so you

77
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:55,339
had to be hazed or become lead in order

78
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:58,339
to be effective we got away with that

79
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:01,550
right you go everything pretty Saturday

80
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:03,530
or whenever we have the meeting you're

81
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:07,100
more than welcome and nobody's got their

82
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:08,690
do anything nobody's gonna ask you you

83
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,579
have this or that is that's how they

84
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:13,670
used to do the high producible all I

85
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:16,040
have to do I have this or whatever like

86
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,358
that was basically they're very open and

87
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,980
wanting to share information and help

88
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:25,070
you pursue your career and if you just

89
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:27,530
want to sit down and dog and have a good

90
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:30,590
that's perfectly fine and if you don't

91
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:33,500
like it that's your you're welcome to

92
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:37,150

93
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:39,380
completely open group and welcome

94
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:42,229
literally everyone

95
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:44,870
I saw as you you're intolerant as long

96
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:47,570
as you understand that there are people

97
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:50,360
that with different opinions every three

98
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:52,700
that every client is welcome with that

99
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:56,690
in mind I'm not sure that before we

100
00:04:52,700 --> 00:05:00,620
present you want to give us some aspects

101
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:02,090
