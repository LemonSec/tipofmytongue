1
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:16,250
all right so uh continuing our journey

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,470
this weekend we're gonna have the the

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:21,259
new respectable world-class researcher

4
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:24,680
dr. Adina soothe and he's going to be

5
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:27,340
speaking about her 20th and web security

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,340
so please

7
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:55,059
yeah

8
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,059
[Music]

9
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:08,360
right that's getting started welcome

10
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,950
everyone I have to share the fact that

11
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,470
you guys are digging time on the weekend

12
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,720
and attending this talk and for the next

13
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,520
45 to 50 minutes we're going to make it

14
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,230
really good so what we're going to talk

15
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,869
about today is the law of the napkin

16
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:23,240
devices an exploit to be formatted web

17
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:26,330
security so this coffee primera dama

18
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,100
focus entirely on the fact of invalid

19
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,480
that security would be not that I would

20
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,610
do much cheaper a different set of

21
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,980
components but rather than focus

22
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,480
primarily on the web security and during

23
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,700
the course of this stop you will realize

24
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,100
you know how vulnerable is it existing

25
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:44,090
BT systems because of the scary fault

26
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:46,699
their existing you know time but in this

27
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:48,710
particular talk we gotta focus from what

28
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,510
we have seen in the history what we are

29
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:52,429
we stand with respect to that right now

30
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:55,280
and what we're gonna look into the

31
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,750
future so we'll take that the following

32
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,910
case studies about different now there

33
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,560
are examples you know in do you know how

34
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,940
what we have discovered the white

35
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,950
whether it's the context of style

36
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,229
devices and all that but it's all

37
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,000
connected on the internet and that is

38
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:11,090
the most important part we're gonna look

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,130
into it so before moving further I will

40
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:15,019
even on a little disclaimer and the

41
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,710
reason for that is because in this

42
00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:19,410
particular talk with an active

43
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:21,180
Deepak's right considering that it's

44
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,980
always cigarette line between so it's

45
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,380
tired to just you know just so see it

46
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,510
from from whatever you working right now

47
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,250
and then because of security community

48
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,870
we gonna you know what are the

49
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,120
contributions we are making to the scary

50
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,890
comedy that's most important one so

51
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,770
nothing relate to any of my previous are

52
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,690
present boys just for the community so

53
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,400
look at that down of mine just try to

54
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,710
give you an idea that if we are

55
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,960
somebody's to the breakfast table is in

56
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:48,900
less amount of time in the field and

57
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,490
what we are going to talk about today so

58
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,660
you can have the little lady to my

59
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:53,340
bottle if you're gonna do the legal

60
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,730
background search that's totally fine

61
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,830
but this get it started here so what's

62
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,209
that again daddy today so we can I take

63
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:02,610
a look into that connected devices

64
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:04,800
present scenario current and the future

65
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:06,960
state we look at the security and

66
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,390
threats in Charlie including a pallet of

67
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,370
scary space we'll go to the real one

68
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,380
these studies starting from the

69
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,970
possibilities then malware analysis and

70
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:17,190
then happy and how the water sorry

71
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,870
you know bill and then at the end we

72
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,810
need to look at you know using all the

73
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,310
techniques and indicators what kind of

74
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,520
scary devices we have seen in the world

75
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:30,500
basically mm-hm eyes and then we open

76
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:32,490
for that watch turning points okay so

77
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,050
father I think it's really good to

78
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,730
understand what we are dealing with in

79
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,380
today's world if you look at the

80
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:40,470
connected devices

81
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:42,450
in some of the news portals what get

82
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,040
talking about you get here just stop it

83
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:48,149
you know in which one will live in data

84
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:50,579
movement you know reason usage of

85
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,200
devices at an exponential rate and even

86
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,700
in this thing the checks are increasing

87
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,049
as well if you're talking about millions

88
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,880
of billions of devices that are

89
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,200
connected in nature so we all need to

90
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,019
understand how the threat landscape

91
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,790
volleyball with danezaa and that is the

92
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,380
most important part we really need to

93
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:07,620
look into you know that launchpad for

94
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:10,470
evening attacks is increasing at a rapid

95
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,720
pace but that is the reality will live

96
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,730
in well live in the water we are doing

97
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,230
everything to internet but we really

98
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,730
need to understand it's not all about

99
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:20,520
the data movement between these devices

100
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:21,960
but also at the end of the day is one of

101
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,760
a kind of threats we are gathered with

102
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:27,840
it in the mobile space so this single

103
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,180
looking to be connected you are

104
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,640
suspended future state why this is a way

105
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:36,870
you know justing call them to look into

106
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:41,460
if you look at from the 2015 and either

107
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:43,320
by 2025 how many devices we are actually

108
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,049
gonna deal with in the billion strike

109
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,300
and this actually gives you the idea

110
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:50,970
that this thing is amazing exponentially

111
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,980
every year we are dealing with the

112
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,780
problems from the existing year but the

113
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,430
next year for devices are adding them to

114
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,409
the system and how they are

115
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,919
communicating between each other you

116
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:02,139
know how

117
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,479
launch bags all you know adaptive sigh

118
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:06,310
boy not for them big strong botnets and

119
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,830
all those sort of things but this is a

120
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:14,919
realistic problem and we really need to

121
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:17,258
deal with Adam seriously ok so what we

122
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:19,479
gonna talk about today is if you look at

123
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:20,830
the connected devices if you look

124
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:22,599
that'll be the scattering modeling

125
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:26,229
object modeling we really need to

126
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:27,789
dissect the state of devices which means

127
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:29,590
that we need to understand what kind of

128
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:32,710
different components that our system in

129
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:34,029
that so we talked about all transition

130
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,888
boundary we're at peace you I said

131
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:37,779
located how the data movement is been

132
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:39,669
happening a fabrication authorization

133
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:43,719
controls and all those kind of standard

134
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:45,878
security parameters network encryption

135
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:48,189
software over a gate mechanism so and

136
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:51,039
soon but the focus today is that in

137
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:53,050
panic where security and why using

138
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,699
forgot is because this is one of you

139
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,860
know primary component that actually

140
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:58,930
persists and has been basically shipped

141
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,330
with most of the devices that are

142
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:03,339
actually available on the internet and

143
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,680
means which means that we're dealing

144
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:06,200
with the HTTP protocol here because of

145
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,600
the rabbit

146
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,969
raise and then at the end of the day on

147
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,610
the internet also be ready to be exposed

148
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:16,610
or not secure but one or the other way

149
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:19,070
if you have the ability to find that

150
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,840
indicators you can actually go back and

151
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:23,150
actually find these devices on an

152
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,919
Internet which means that it's an

153
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:27,229
interface that is available to you and

154
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,760
at the end of the day it's all about are

155
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,410
you gonna go out great if you want

156
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:34,730
understand how we want to perform the

157
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:38,120
research now next step is a wide

158
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:41,060
embedded web security so if you you know

159
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,680
if you win a lottery that I'm trying to

160
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,420
dissect the web security

161
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,950
we're gonna talk about the different

162
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,960
things you're likely reduce a buffer

163
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,940
overflow web components cause I stepped

164
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,830
in and those kind of things which means

165
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:54,860
that look at this from a statistical

166
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:56,870
point of view the different kind of all

167
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,360
the abilities there existed symbol in

168
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:01,340
the web confident and that will really

169
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,890
need to look after and then we're doing

170
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,869
research we have to focus the state of

171
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,729
the research we just cannot go to broad

172
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:10,039
because that you lose the church and

173
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:12,949
then whatever you wanna

174
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:14,688
it's just not that impactful so the idea

175
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:16,430
is that let us concentrate on a web

176
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:20,059
component and take it from the

177
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:21,979
vulnerability we do the math analysis

178
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:23,300
and how banner has been being using

179
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:24,770
these vulnerabilities and then at the

180
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:30,080
end of the day what we've seen on the

181
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:31,789
Internet and that's the target so let's

182
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,539
move further we can I look into the

183
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:37,279
imagine web server attacks and security

184
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:38,748
so different that scar tissue that can

185
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:42,259
exist in this world when we talk about

186
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:44,210
web server security in that so but we

187
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:45,710
gotta talk and concentrate on that base

188
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,719
from the time of all the babies that we

189
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:49,669
have seen in the wild so what we have

190
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:52,490
seen exactly you know how you can bypass

191
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:54,409
drowsily stellosphere restrictions right

192
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,930
for example your open up a web interface

193
00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:58,399
of our router and you really look into

194
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:00,589
it and it's saying there is some

195
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,809
scattering mechanisms deployed and by

196
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:04,849
coming in by mouse if we force that an

197
00:08:02,809 --> 00:08:07,099
insecure password storage we look at it

198
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:08,899
how they actually pull our thread of

199
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:11,180
course speaker properties of a problem

200
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:12,889
and we're going to talk about how that

201
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:15,889
that kind of a chisel actually you know

202
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:17,870
you know basically compromised the web

203
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:20,180
interface credential the cage

204
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,919
unauthenticated web resources injection

205
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,050
attacks and caused him to freeze attacks

206
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,229
I think the cost interfaces are going to

207
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:27,000
love it it isn't that

208
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:28,650
we are actually doing after attacking

209
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,900
the device from a different interface

210
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:33,630
and then we're gonna talk about all

211
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:35,459
exactly that is that important see that

212
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,929
in this town of scenario this is also

213
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,910
hot women here actually go in after

214
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:41,309
doing validation testing or scared ESS

215
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:44,640
max in every space it just and not only

216
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:46,949
we you know directed towards IOT devices

217
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,660
but you can actually go off her you know

218
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:50,340
difference at web components when you're

219
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:54,510
going to perform some kind of steady

220
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:56,610
assessments now let's move it talk about

221
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,500
we on would a study so really talking

222
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:01,320
about real or these studies is just like

223
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,420
a real war devices that we have on the

224
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,340
internet and someone ability research

225
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,839
that have been conducted and this

226
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,370
actually talks about like whatever the

227
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,820
scattering issues we're talking about a

228
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:13,680
real and under the responsibility story

229
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,440
our guidelines has been reported back to

230
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,689
the vendors they are fixing but from you

231
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,120
know intelligence perspective is really

232
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:23,820
it's just really require to understand

233
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,640
why you really need to you know perform

234
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,890
this kind of research so let's take a

235
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,470
look into the lot thousand ways

236
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,730
javascript controls and this is we have

237
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,760
seen that this has been you know

238
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:37,750
implemented away because said when the

239
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,369
toolbar thing about just

240
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,689
[Music]

241
00:09:39,369 --> 00:09:43,730
Deauville offering lamenting strong

242
00:09:41,689 --> 00:09:45,738
productions we can actually go a little

243
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:47,869
bit here and there implementers and then

244
00:09:45,739 --> 00:09:49,009
take it from there but then again it

245
00:09:47,869 --> 00:09:51,859
becomes a nightmare

246
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:53,689
down the lane if somebody find it up and

247
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:55,129
let's take a look into it so that I

248
00:09:53,689 --> 00:09:56,899
think this piece is that what we have

249
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:58,549
seen you know X are you open about

250
00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:00,889
whether to freeze so funny you know

251
00:09:58,549 --> 00:10:03,019
basically int device whether it's a

252
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:05,089
router switch or any kind of other

253
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,470
device type and you've seen that you

254
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:08,359
provided some you know you're

255
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,160
interacting with it providing user

256
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:12,799
name/password by lobbying authentication

257
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,629
component or any other kind of thing but

258
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:16,759
what we have seen in that realize if the

259
00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:18,499
arbitrary provided input values started

260
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:21,739
it's just actually gonna trigger a

261
00:10:18,499 --> 00:10:24,199
notification totally fine but that is

262
00:10:21,739 --> 00:10:25,999
only based on browser because at the end

263
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:28,429
the web server is actually you know

264
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:30,259
actually looking into the fact that

265
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:32,899
you're moving the interface in a browser

266
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:35,890
but what about the other kind of

267
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:38,770
utilities that we have whether it's

268
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:40,990
let's take a look so this actually gives

269
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:42,010
you a lot of the interface so when you

270
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:44,860
try to interact with

271
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:47,110
we're trying to access system

272
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,330
information file with an extension or

273
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,980
not gch and you can clear this you could

274
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:52,450
try to you know get that path after

275
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,820
research and you try to put it in a

276
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:56,890
browser and they actually found that

277
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:59,700
there's some you know control is being

278
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:01,930
implemented which is restricting the

279
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,540
request to go through so it's saying you

280
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:06,459
know timeout please login be totally

281
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,349
fine so which means that as a part of

282
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:11,050
the research we are not able to get

283
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:12,880
access to that path totally find that we

284
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,920
really want that research so whatever I

285
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,890
do next time because of track modeling

286
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,900
that we have done and the security you

287
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:22,810
know boundaries that we have checked

288
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:26,439
we're gonna change our you know attack

289
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:29,020
back to what we did it's the same attack

290
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,670
path but we have changed the client so

291
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:33,189
you can clearly see with the girl in

292
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:36,430
trouble you can't give any issue that

293
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:38,290
request it went through and you got an

294
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:40,870
access to their system information file

295
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:43,360
and all the details interestingly they

296
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:45,900
are also talking to you and give you

297
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,680
your password on the client side

298
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:51,569
the circulators which means that now

299
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:53,609
after understanding the way you know

300
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,710
that device is working which has an

301
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:58,200
embedded web server application in there

302
00:11:55,710 --> 00:12:00,480
exposed to a link to them and then you

303
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,270
find in other ways little bit scanning

304
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,890
or you know maneuvering manually you get

305
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,510
an idea that they are some you know

306
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,699
resources there it can be very very

307
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:10,170
critical and then you stop testing and

308
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,510
you can clearly see all the browser

309
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:15,000
waste even JavaScript protection of my

310
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:18,180
verse because without that inquest

311
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,279
widget is never be my browser is my wk

312
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:22,380
and they actually were interacting with

313
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:25,020
the web server resource and then there

314
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:27,480
is no client-side mechanism there to

315
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,790
actually detect it so you can access to

316
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,550
it you've got a password and that

317
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:34,469
basically as a pensioner password is

318
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:36,900
slower because an access to that audio

319
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:39,720
video conferencing device and then could

320
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:41,520
have full control that is a one-way in

321
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,700
this case you know we didn't know about

322
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:46,319
all what we have is you know the device

323
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,210
was exposed on the internet and we

324
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,800
started doing our own research but

325
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,370
according to the manual that's totally

326
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,829
fine

327
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,959
but it's actually I like the fact that

328
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:57,450
you know performance carry the suspense

329
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,050
of these devices how you have to go step

330
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,850
by step

331
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:01,920
we started with one thing but that

332
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:04,709
actually go after and changing things

333
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,310
one by one and try to see whether all

334
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:09,569
the cases have been validated by the

335
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:13,859
many web server but that was not the

336
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:16,020
case any now captured limitation

337
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,760
JavaScript based so we have also seen

338
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:20,529
that in of course we have to restrict

339
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,760
the automation and at capture is away

340
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:24,380
we want to attack like whoever is

341
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,600
attracting with their web component

342
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,760
should be the same identity or some

343
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,829
manual behaviors should be noticed in

344
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,660
order to make sure that that is ID but

345
00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:35,029
what is the problem that we have seen in

346
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:38,480
these IOT devices like CAPTCHA code is

347
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:40,430
hard for me but I'll show you and it

348
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,470
becomes a problematic scenario because

349
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:44,479
on the best friend it looks like either

350
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,430
you providing their ass in CAPTCHA and

351
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,829
that you have entered the CAPTCHA and

352
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:51,079
then you actually log into the web

353
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:52,550
interface but that was not the case so

354
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:54,019
when you start looking at the back and

355
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:56,240
trying to understand you know how the

356
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:58,610
CAPTCHA code is generated it gives you

357
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,470
this idea so this is a case study on the

358
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:03,290
highlight so look at this is a ruptor

359
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:04,850
web interface here and whenever we try

360
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:06,769
to you know interact with authentication

361
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:08,690
Tom when I am providing username and

362
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:11,420
password it actually gives you an idea

363
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:13,339
here they need capture that is totally

364
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:15,709
fine so what we going to do next we look

365
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:19,370
at the HTTP requests that has been sent

366
00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:23,839
to that and value web server so if you

367
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:26,870
look at this this one that's a totally a

368
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:33,949
standard way of you know and asking for

369
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:35,360
any CAPTCHA code but what was happening

370
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:37,699
if you look at the gist in the

371
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,550
JavaScript code we was saying you know

372
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:43,399
all the standard the best parameters but

373
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:45,199
they are quoted by capture for you which

374
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:47,209
means that whatever to capture code you

375
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,140
provided they actually sent about one

376
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:50,449
standard thing

377
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:52,819
backup server which means now you know

378
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:56,079
it but what kind of that food is free to

379
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:59,420
buy possible right and in that case

380
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:01,969
looks like there's capture everything is

381
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:03,649
good we have implemented security but

382
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,360
the wash it comes to play who perform

383
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:08,000
that you which is super from the scary

384
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,420
assessments but that was not at least so

385
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,519
when that happened in this case we are

386
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:15,529
able to you know trigger the xhr request

387
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,240
and all that and related true because we

388
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:20,060
know the hard-coded thing and it all

389
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:22,390
went through and it's that my bass be or

390
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:25,250
whatever the mechanism for preventing

391
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:27,050
automated attacks but in the JavaScript

392
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,310
waste but they never do work that how

393
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:30,529
the CAPTCHA needs to be implemented

394
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:32,329
every time you access the web interface

395
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:34,820
the food has to be generated on the

396
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:37,670
server side fused on that Senate by a

397
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:39,920
JavaScript spot a webpage as a model in

398
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:42,790
a document object model on walls but

399
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,839
there was not the case but interestingly

400
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:46,189
you can you know you can use these kind

401
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:48,410
of techniques whenever you're performing

402
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:50,870
web testing and that it actually gives

403
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:52,490
you a different view won't fit you know

404
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:54,920
how the server-side technologies work

405
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:56,300
you know now another interesting thing

406
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,060
we found out is one of the biggest

407
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:01,519
budget issues still reported to that it

408
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:04,369
was a title in cryptography and insecure

409
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,959
tokens sous apologies of a session

410
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,640
management we all know only over the

411
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:10,550
cookies need to be you know generated

412
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:13,279
they have to be really strong you know

413
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:15,500
and then random factor and that it

414
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,660
should be hard to make sure that is not

415
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,459
gasps eval not practical but there was

416
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,199
not the ease and these devices because

417
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:23,989
the way this thing I mean the very

418
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,969
simple factor is the IV boil is that

419
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,680
who's gonna cactus so people never

420
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,400
thought about seven or ten years back

421
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,760
like

422
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:33,709
of these devices nobody cared right so

423
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,780
some other things still got it added it

424
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:37,340
with the same mindset and that is a

425
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,530
problem these days like you know if

426
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:41,180
you're lying the neck

427
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:42,949
think about your compromise and that's

428
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:45,620
how you have to start with the discovery

429
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:49,190
mechanisms but let's take a look into

430
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:51,680
this a study the V cryptography one so

431
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:54,200
I'm just going to give you the idea this

432
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,870
is a tool we created and I'll explain

433
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:59,780
that issue later but we've seen that

434
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:01,460
well the device category of the devices

435
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:04,160
of wynia generating session token' it

436
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:05,540
just like a phone if you think I'm just

437
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,839
a four-digit number

438
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:10,550
how hard is to crack it right how hard

439
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:12,139
it is it's not a big deal you just you

440
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:13,790
know with a Python code we do all this

441
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,620
code and all that and then we

442
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:17,780
constructed the same request

443
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:19,550
whenever the hot dog you know hard-coded

444
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,290
parameters are to keep running

445
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:23,839
what we need is that with every request

446
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:26,240
which every did all the best up front

447
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:30,470
which means that when we trigger the

448
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,300
request you can clearly see in this case

449
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:35,600
here the channel that it was based only

450
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:37,430
for food digital and that's be shot at

451
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,080
Udacity where the spit was running an

452
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:42,630
automated fashion we are able to

453
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,570
file transfer faster than it without

454
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:48,390
logging without any aggregation because

455
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:51,000
we know what some an extension gonna be

456
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:53,700
because the weight is implemented in a

457
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,140
very easy way which means that now we

458
00:17:53,700 --> 00:18:00,360
not the passer you know is compromised

459
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:02,130
but that's all into the real one in

460
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:05,070
studies what we have seen these are the

461
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:06,630
realistic devices but this one this has

462
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:08,610
been you know deployed on a white state

463
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:10,110
the one appoint to the vendor it is

464
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:13,830
maybe somebody might have already

465
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:16,519
figured it out but I just avoid that so

466
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:19,139
now I mean the point is the movies right

467
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:21,149
it's a very simple thing very basic

468
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:23,399
thing but I always believed that basics

469
00:18:21,149 --> 00:18:26,850
of the hardest part of all you can tell

470
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:28,768
me always just implemented md5 hashing

471
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:31,500
for example right it just has a

472
00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:34,320
collision problem I still using it some

473
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,519
some point of time right so similarity

474
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,510
with the cookies you can say that you

475
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:38,940
know where the cookies need to be

476
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:41,129
generated after evaluating the event by

477
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,600
the education component you're going to

478
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,279
make sure that cookies have your

479
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,320
standard parameters you know the east

480
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:48,360
and a flag should be there HTTP only

481
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,340
secure flash but the rectum identifier

482
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:53,370
with the session children should be good

483
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:54,779
but irrespective there's a difference

484
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,489
between what you proposed and what we

485
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:59,610
see in real world and let's take a look

486
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:02,460
into this one so when we try to give

487
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:04,159
another thing and you clearly see with

488
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,900
all the new license

489
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,190
rather it's an anonymous state or

490
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,490
they're running inactive on state

491
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:13,470
disability password somehow they've not

492
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:17,430
even changed what is coming in the

493
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:20,130
cookie the succeed number is all one

494
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:22,200
right and the question is that you have

495
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:23,820
to win these kind of testing basic

496
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,410
things but that impact is really

497
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:30,090
disastrous on the states

498
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:32,340
so with that you can easily get an

499
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:34,560
access to it you know that interface and

500
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:36,990
you can have all the components I just

501
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:39,870
take whatever you want to do one can do

502
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:43,650
it but look it from the attackers

503
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:45,600
perspective if investing up you know a

504
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:47,550
few degrees into this kind of research

505
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,560
and you have figured it out all those

506
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:51,419
things you have to think about the

507
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,760
tactics are ten steps ahead of you right

508
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:55,350
and they can find it as well Tomic you

509
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,480
found it it's just like in an arms race

510
00:19:55,350 --> 00:20:00,719
you get a chance to find it little

511
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,980
earlier but they are there so might be

512
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,380
have already be compromising and

513
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,150
exploiting it so the question is that

514
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,400
and you look with the vendor make sure

515
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:10,440
they fix these issues that's the best

516
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,110
you can do as a bar Oh scary research

517
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:16,740
but the problems are very realistic in

518
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:19,740
nature so this is also very interesting

519
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:21,510
fact is like I know getting an access to

520
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,920
all the logging paths that there's a

521
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:25,379
deeper loss warlocks

522
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:28,170
in full of any kind of different set of

523
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:30,930
locks access logs you know what is how

524
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:33,120
many you know time I actually connecting

525
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:34,590
back to the server so what we have see

526
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,239
that it also suffers from the same

527
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:37,418
problem of implementing a direct

528
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,749
authorization

529
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:42,940
right the most important part in this

530
00:20:40,749 --> 00:20:46,209
category service you really need to find

531
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:48,669
a way with exactly the law or a file is

532
00:20:46,209 --> 00:20:51,039
replaced on the web server as a lot of a

533
00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:53,229
resource mechanism which means that if

534
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:55,749
you have a full bath and you can access

535
00:20:53,229 --> 00:20:58,599
that file that you have tested in many

536
00:20:55,749 --> 00:21:00,309
domains and we have seen it earlier but

537
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:03,158
this kind of problems persist in these

538
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:05,499
devices a lot but people actually in

539
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:09,219
this case twelvers they don't realize in

540
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:11,349
this kind of scenario that discovery of

541
00:21:09,219 --> 00:21:13,599
this kind of information can be really

542
00:21:11,349 --> 00:21:15,218
disastrous because you can read a lot of

543
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,079
information about on the back end and

544
00:21:15,219 --> 00:21:19,629
that is what is being needed by the

545
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:24,099
attackers let's take a look into this

546
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:25,689
one similarly we use our previous one

547
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:27,279
ability so what we started doing right

548
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:30,070
now we are changing the what abilities

549
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:33,039
right we know how we exploit Universal

550
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:34,958
ability and some other router a device I

551
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,940
found that thing at some point they have

552
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:40,599
the same vulnerability in a decimal so

553
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:43,269
we use the same thing we know that all

554
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:45,849
the love there is family is such an

555
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:48,940
information that a clear idea all the

556
00:21:45,849 --> 00:21:51,359
devices being working at the back and

557
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,359
that is

558
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:57,070
interesting issues is that you know

559
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:58,810
authorization controls who's got access

560
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:00,340
and if you're not a thank you David why

561
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:03,129
the resource have been placed like a

562
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:06,669
seminal flies on the website where if

563
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:08,340
you're not restricting it but that's a

564
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:11,410
real bullet

565
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:14,830
now of course nothing in the Mexican

566
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:16,990
army will be you know complete without

567
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:19,000
talking about the injection force but I

568
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:22,060
will stop with the distorted persistent

569
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,950
excesses but what my end goal is will be

570
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:26,560
really interesting and I hope you guys

571
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:28,840
love it if this is we have seen that you

572
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:31,690
know the problem exists the problem is a

573
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:33,790
is the mood effects when the injection

574
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:36,520
floors become persistent in nature right

575
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:39,010
you know I mean if you trigger one

576
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:40,840
pillow and if it it is there and

577
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:42,879
distinctive in the session that's a

578
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:46,840
problem because every time you open the

579
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,550
session is gonna get executed so

580
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,260
similarity I'll give you the idea I

581
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:52,750
haven't quite quick series unethical

582
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:54,879
Arliss ruptures the industrial routers

583
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:57,220
you can generally see is all getting

584
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,500
injected it's a persistent one but it's

585
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:02,440
just a poof of concept which means that

586
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:04,180
would we can not give you assuming what

587
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,340
is the realistic nature the web

588
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:08,800
interfaces or the web application style

589
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:10,629
of being you know deployed by as

590
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,730
naturally silently devices they are all

591
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:15,670
over these vulnerabilities but now the

592
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:18,070
most interesting part is the next case

593
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:20,260
study this you will enjoy it because

594
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:22,689
it's gonna I know adapt it from one

595
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:25,180
interface to the other but making sure

596
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:28,000
you still get the be executable let's

597
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:30,400
take a look into that one the calling

598
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,950
that cost interface attack and you know

599
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,080
little gist of it which means that it

600
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:37,330
also can i OT devices they're different

601
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,100
important more manifest interfaces are

602
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:41,199
available whether it's a child and when

603
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:43,330
it's an FD be rather send back the idea

604
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,280
is you are able to at the access that

605
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:48,550
you life anywhere sitting remote be

606
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,500
totally fine but the interesting part of

607
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:53,440
this very research is that can you

608
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:56,320
actually use one interface to kind of

609
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,360
attack each other is it possible exit if

610
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,970
I might even do that agree into the you

611
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:02,500
know that interface because they have

612
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:04,930
strong password and all that can I

613
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,850
utilize some other interface like an FTP

614
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:09,520
or Bala they actually detects on that

615
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:13,000
open ability and that is the case so

616
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:15,430
what we did in this daddy because we

617
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,340
have the idea and you just actually show

618
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:21,280
it we constructed the proof of concept

619
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:26,080
in that way but it will make it very

620
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:27,340
clear you know I used to be done so take

621
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,340
a look at this one this is some

622
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:33,149
interface a kind of Talmud interface for

623
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:36,269
some IOT device you just you know

624
00:24:33,149 --> 00:24:38,609
23 for and what they actually giving you

625
00:24:36,269 --> 00:24:40,559
username so what we most people that

626
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:42,960
I've either launched a light-blue force

627
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:46,559
attacks try to use an imposter on you

628
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:49,409
that you try but we didn't do that what

629
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:53,039
we did is we actually used as a reject

630
00:24:49,409 --> 00:24:55,499
web base tables right so you filling

631
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,359
field I injected some avatar comm with

632
00:24:55,499 --> 00:25:02,039
an ayah you know from an iframe higher

633
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:04,289
or some you know HTML tags but the

634
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:06,389
interface the talent interface still

635
00:25:04,289 --> 00:25:08,519
accept it as a part of something strange

636
00:25:06,389 --> 00:25:10,139
why it just totally fine but I can check

637
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:13,049
what immediate attack or something like

638
00:25:10,139 --> 00:25:15,689
that I'm using that as a nun as an input

639
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:18,200
factor to provide arbitrary values and

640
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:21,330
of course we triggered multiple things

641
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:24,599
now see so what we did now we are

642
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:28,228
looking to the web interface so in that

643
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:30,658
is what was happening whatever you say

644
00:25:28,229 --> 00:25:33,389
ejecting by the telnet or the activity

645
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:35,429
interface it is actually going into the

646
00:25:33,389 --> 00:25:36,809
log online of the web interface talking

647
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:41,009
about you know

648
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:43,408
right so in that case the law component

649
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:44,460
they never assumed this going to be any

650
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:46,379
attack vector

651
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:48,360
they never implemented like good

652
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:50,699
validation controls and what happened

653
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:53,209
the people can execute it and we

654
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:55,289
triggered an avatar comment to that

655
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:57,779
because we have excellent this is the

656
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:59,309
way we show it but it all can execute

657
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:02,009
your so you can clearly see you can add

658
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:04,049
process like professor Audrey of course

659
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:05,519
you can change the savage unit with a

660
00:26:04,049 --> 00:26:07,679
lot of other interesting things there as

661
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:09,840
well because anytime you touch the law

662
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,480
components when I get executed but the

663
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,100
vector is not the web in this case the

664
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:18,059
vector is the sum another interface

665
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:20,699
which is a remote management one in that

666
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:22,369
big sanity what we have seen that we

667
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:25,470
have just a wide variety of other

668
00:26:22,369 --> 00:26:27,658
security issues talking from some water

669
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:30,059
ization of navigation controls password

670
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:32,279
Oslo heaters by massing restrictions and

671
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:34,529
then at the end even looking into the

672
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:36,389
cause it reveals attacks but now the

673
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:38,820
question that we get asked by the

674
00:26:36,389 --> 00:26:40,619
dreamer has a lot of resent is who's got

675
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,939
a lot of these kind of things right that

676
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:43,678
is the most important part because

677
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,519
attackers are not gonna go after ones

678
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,940
that was available

679
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:49,889
that's not how to pay for next

680
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:52,350
collection of bots that are actually

681
00:26:49,889 --> 00:26:54,360
designed to perform the various

682
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:56,189
operations on the internet so what they

683
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,990
gonna do they actually gonna utilize one

684
00:26:56,190 --> 00:27:00,010
of these have been vulnerability you

685
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:02,350
know launch of

686
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:04,690
that embarrassing how many get it

687
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:07,600
compromised and let's take a look at you

688
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:10,180
- what that one would as well so we're

689
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,429
doing some research into that context

690
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:15,550
and what we do that you know covered in

691
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:17,380
this body's like to specific exploits

692
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:19,570
which have been widely used is the

693
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:23,560
Linksys router exploit and why you want

694
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:28,510
a tree and you sympathize you know what

695
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:30,580
something to the 5g stuff they wanna

696
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:33,280
make these kind of things so what we

697
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:35,560
usually have a research community you

698
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:38,920
know cuz we know about it so let's take

699
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:40,840
a look into one so in this case what we

700
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:43,030
found that some of the market might be I

701
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:44,679
don't have good food he dips into your

702
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:46,389
reverse engineering this and that but I

703
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:49,600
just want and wait the point white

704
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:51,910
hydroxide so this was the next 56 binary

705
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,830
and when you try to check the magic

706
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:55,690
feathers on it whether the fight command

707
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:57,970
you come to know about you know what

708
00:27:55,690 --> 00:28:00,100
this file is all about so rest by that

709
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:01,420
you know when you lose little bit we

710
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,639
were essentially we try to look at the

711
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:05,860
strings right just give me all the HTTP

712
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,990
connections or excuse me ones that I've

713
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:10,929
been used in to it so you can clearly

714
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:14,020
see that we perform the analysis and all

715
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:17,440
that when we try to extract a specific

716
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:20,889
set of data this XY is kind of are coded

717
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,820
into it that binary base64 you can see

718
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:25,239
what the user name

719
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:27,759
so it is but then X likes a negative so

720
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:29,679
the idea was led here the body's gonna

721
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:32,919
be x86 dogbane we're not going to gonna

722
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,899
place it somewhere on you know X schools

723
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:37,779
to start where somewhere and they're

724
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:39,309
gonna stop drinking the infections one

725
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:40,960
sending device is compromised they're

726
00:28:39,309 --> 00:28:43,389
gonna start building the botnets out of

727
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,700
it and that is the target but it's all

728
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:48,340
hard coded so once the spine is gone

729
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:50,789
executed on any compromise device it's

730
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:54,238
going to launch the exploit on a

731
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:58,210
predefined list of targets or they just

732
00:28:54,239 --> 00:29:00,070
discover that dynamically but similarly

733
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:01,720
with the Lynx is doctor exploit I'm just

734
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:03,939
talking about meaning one and two events

735
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:06,789
here if you fall hard to date but they

736
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:08,830
are utilizing the web vulnerability into

737
00:29:06,789 --> 00:29:11,830
those devices because either they have

738
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:14,139
like some kind of CGI interface and some

739
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:16,749
other things but the target is actually

740
00:29:14,139 --> 00:29:18,248
to try to see if we can utilize it and

741
00:29:16,749 --> 00:29:21,749
interesting part is that they have been

742
00:29:18,249 --> 00:29:25,509
using the exploits from like 2014 2013

743
00:29:21,749 --> 00:29:27,489
still via building any more buttons and

744
00:29:25,509 --> 00:29:29,019
the end of it which means that you can

745
00:29:27,489 --> 00:29:30,909
clearly see how good the patch

746
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:32,640
management processes of the update

747
00:29:30,909 --> 00:29:36,250
mechanism

748
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,830
and interesting is Israeli sometimes

749
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:40,870
back you analyze that still after five

750
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:44,850
years we have so many devices on the

751
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:49,179
internet but that's true the real bonus

752
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:52,120
so considering that how can you not know

753
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:55,540
that I talked about it why write love I

754
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:56,949
gene that anyway but that in this case

755
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:59,379
is that young people are starting its

756
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:02,110
fighting final eight weeks as well same

757
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:03,910
mechanism you know the new exploit they

758
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:05,979
know how to actually embedded they've

759
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:08,500
construct the windings which is just not

760
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:10,390
only the x86 starving but all the

761
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,700
different architecture whether it's a

762
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:15,220
mix and all that and they have like

763
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:16,630
Duncan on one bottle and you know once

764
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,800
they actually compromise one device

765
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:19,900
you're going to start downloading the

766
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:22,210
payloads execute why that device and

767
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:24,660
then you start any movement move

768
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:27,910
compromised devices to the network but

769
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:30,220
in the pockets but we stopped you from

770
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:32,320
the choir the vulnerabilities in the web

771
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:34,030
interface now we are into the boy it's

772
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,460
like how exactly is what abilities are

773
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:38,410
exploited in the real world and how they

774
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:41,340
are built bottlenecks and you know

775
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:45,160
malware infection platforms

776
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:47,970
similarly this gave just a quick demo to

777
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,970
actually give you an idea

778
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:07,149
find some infections on the internet

779
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:10,630
we've done the binary just a basic

780
00:31:07,149 --> 00:31:12,879
Jackson Jeff defeat I tell the x86 third

781
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:16,990
quartile and dis checking the magic

782
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:18,340
powder they say it is strict binary

783
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:20,860
which means that you know gotta fight

784
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:23,370
any kind of debug samples into it means

785
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:29,080
is pretty straight forward compartments

786
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:32,320
but if you see that they have this kind

787
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:34,629
of exploit the maggot into it and then

788
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,460
you have seen not in the bond exploited

789
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:40,750
by a spending multiple service exploits

790
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:43,000
exist and trigger whatever the one they

791
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:48,010
want depending on the architecture of

792
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:52,120
the by size device and this is all the

793
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:55,389
cycle binding and you can clearly see

794
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:58,260
what's up with here the post request to

795
00:31:55,389 --> 00:31:58,260
trigger the exploit

796
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:08,360
and this is suppose one too if I like

797
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:09,800
the fact that you know how the ex-wives

798
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:12,350
are getting embedded into defined

799
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:19,370
reasons by research Spanish spreads and

800
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:20,870
about net servings so of course nothing

801
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:23,239
solid me for not to talk about

802
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:27,379
ransomware right and just think this

803
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:29,059
came out in 2018 and but we discovered

804
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:30,559
in the same line but we don't even in

805
00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:32,480
the research freak the most important

806
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:34,639
value that was gonna you know release it

807
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,559
first Roy this totally fine this is an

808
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,210
arms race you know sometimes you do

809
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,620
research but when you try to check it

810
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:41,390
and you can clearly see somebody else's

811
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:43,428
done it is totally fine the question is

812
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:45,260
not that the portion is there like even

813
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:48,040
in 2018 when this kind of information

814
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:50,480
came to exist

815
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:52,520
you know actually release it wisely and

816
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:56,179
all that so this is actually an example

817
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:58,520
HP of other systems I think integrated

818
00:32:56,179 --> 00:33:00,200
lights-out and these systems are

819
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:03,650
actually infected friend severe as well

820
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:06,370
and that is of a victory so somehow the

821
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:08,710
weight is being done

822
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:10,209
my seven you know and the guy actually

823
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:12,700
injected the rent severe communication

824
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:15,130
into it so pennies are publically

825
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:17,440
available at the what what an

826
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:19,960
interesting part is that you still find

827
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:24,240
these kinder in fashions today and that

828
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:24,240
is what I wanna highlight here so

829
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:34,740
so similarly in this example

830
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:52,419
[Music]

831
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:59,679
something that issued the but that's

832
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,990
truly final but actually highlighted in

833
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:04,570
the same way so what we did in that we

834
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:08,080
actually know that mere text another

835
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:10,449
file is located on that Ashley system

836
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:15,370
and we dumped it right and then if you

837
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:18,189
see it in the next slide we actually you

838
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:19,420
know this XML file I like it so much

839
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:22,659
interesting information

840
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:23,889
what kind of version is there and then

841
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:26,920
we started collecting some good

842
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:28,870
indicators in that and this is the file

843
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:32,170
how it looks like in a browser and I

844
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:35,679
have not actually you know passed the IP

845
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:38,350
address I'm pretty much sure if we just

846
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,360
open that IP address you'll still see

847
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:45,310
that infection hopefully if they are not

848
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:50,060
affected by that again so again we try

849
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:54,350
to access this one the ransom

850
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:57,680
in fact it is still there now we talk

851
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:59,650
about a very big organization where that

852
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,480
we should have been talk about 2000

853
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:05,060
totally fine you know it wisely have

854
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,100
been released but this is the world we

855
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:10,630
live you know these kind of issues still

856
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:16,130
persist and then I mean I will

857
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:17,810
you can try next time as well but and

858
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:19,850
this is really the one itself there's

859
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:28,279
still many instances in the world but

860
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:30,950
anyways so you know go up discover those

861
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:33,470
vulnerabilities our actors actually you

862
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:34,399
know exploit what abilities to build now

863
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:36,589
that phantom

864
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,120
but now the important part is that you

865
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:41,000
know when we talk about that connected

866
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:42,620
wall in the Chi will be spaced it can't

867
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,710
be complaining if we're not going to

868
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:47,810
talk about whether Chennai's so HMI is

869
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:50,170
basically human to machine interface in

870
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:53,240
the world of scatter environments and

871
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:55,310
what I'm going to highlight here is an

872
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,560
interesting things that we have

873
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:59,480
discovered utilizing the town of

874
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:02,090
indicators we you know actually sketched

875
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,680
out and what we have seen so this

876
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:07,310
actually gives you the idea what is

877
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:09,440
available on the Internet and you know

878
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:12,369
how it disasters is standing

879
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,960
even while driving the nation state that

880
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:16,910
even these things are real in nature

881
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,819
let's take a look can start with a

882
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:22,040
little thing but would go by out after

883
00:36:19,819 --> 00:36:25,160
that's it again should have told us

884
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:26,210
right here it's right but if these style

885
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,339
controllers have some that

886
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:32,839
functionalities to trigger fish like

887
00:36:28,339 --> 00:36:35,839
Sangha SMTP and I even smile SMT begins

888
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:37,460
for SMTP interface this is interesting

889
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:40,460
for us because we can utilize the same

890
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:42,380
you know from ice device to actually do

891
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:44,359
it and that's actually that can go up

892
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:46,190
that's what you've seen in southern

893
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:47,589
scenarios you know they see no the

894
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:49,310
emails are coming from is not

895
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:51,529
refrigerators like emails are coming

896
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:53,720
from a smile accident it's not that it

897
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:55,940
is compromising device the device has a

898
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:58,310
built-in functionality to support an

899
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,869
SMTP interface and go after triggering

900
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:01,578
the attacks and I think that was the

901
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:01,910
most important one and they compromised

902
00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:03,920
it

903
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:06,529
they utilize that as a launch pad to

904
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,450
trigger technology phishing emails but

905
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:10,250
what you detection so this is not be

906
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:11,868
that always is coming from that device

907
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:14,750
but nobody knows what's at the baguette

908
00:37:11,869 --> 00:37:17,599
if you go and perform the research but

909
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:19,160
this one this is the kind of idea giving

910
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,910
you right now let's take a look at the

911
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:23,598
next one

912
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:25,098
smart IP controllers right they are also

913
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:28,430
available on the Internet

914
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:30,980
what we mean is to switch on and off but

915
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:32,868
you got an access I'm saying this is the

916
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:35,420
part of the research you can clearly see

917
00:37:32,869 --> 00:37:37,609
what attackers are going after right you

918
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:39,950
just switch it off you can see that

919
00:37:37,609 --> 00:37:42,589
impact and it's all gonna happen to our

920
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:44,509
web interface right your input and

921
00:37:42,589 --> 00:37:47,070
output status can be there you can

922
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:48,990
switch on and off and the functionality

923
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:52,290
and the impact will be really

924
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:52,950
interesting now let's take a look at the

925
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:55,380
next example

926
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:57,419
industrial control automation at UMass

927
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:00,450
would you believe that is a lot of the

928
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:03,240
manufacturing functionality and this is

929
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:06,509
mm-hm I exposed on the internet and what

930
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:08,069
they have four digit password not a big

931
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:09,840
one great right

932
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:11,430
and there's another mechanism there as

933
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,380
well they should disclose this kind of

934
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:16,109
information here and then connect the

935
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:19,340
Dawson right now and that is once after

936
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:21,870
that you know you have a lot of things

937
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:24,870
to look into from scattering point of

938
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:26,580
view but the only money that we have is

939
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:30,690
attackers might have already done a

940
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:32,490
control of it as a researchers we just

941
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:34,710
here for the positivity but you know

942
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:38,700
they don't expect the same from everyone

943
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:39,390
out there now another industrial control

944
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,960
automation

945
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:46,740
did you see that this one and it's a

946
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,300
water wizard you know I mean the one I

947
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:50,189
go to too much tea is but it actually

948
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:53,640
gives you the is on a PLC controller

949
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:56,130
that is MSM associated HMI racism for

950
00:38:53,640 --> 00:39:00,839
use for water wizard things so you can

951
00:38:56,130 --> 00:39:02,820
you stop this fly if you want but again

952
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:05,420
the point is from attackers might

953
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:09,530
already be they have been drilling it

954
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:11,070
another interesting one recycle them

955
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:13,740
same thing

956
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:15,810
why don't you my interface you have this

957
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:17,370
and at the end of the way

958
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:21,180
kind of functionality or their fare

959
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:25,859
buttons turn it on by Bassett but this

960
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:28,100
is recycle boom all exposed on the

961
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:33,240
Internet

962
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:35,910
so with that thing I wanna you know

963
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:37,470
little bit talk about the gist of the

964
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:40,020
talk right now trying to connect all the

965
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:45,419
dots what we have seen that in the world

966
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:48,350
of connected devices you know data human

967
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:50,670
is happening at a very rapid pace pace

968
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:52,170
devices that we are using whether it's

969
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:56,340
mobile devices or any device that

970
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:59,280
connected you know interconnections

971
00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:01,380
between that but that's the one aspect

972
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,240
of it but what about those devices that

973
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:05,550
are actually used a used for critical

974
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:08,160
infrastructure it is we need automation

975
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:10,410
at the end of the day why but this is a

976
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,759
part of the security mission that is

977
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:13,080
also the most important part that we

978
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,490
really need to talk about we talked

979
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,980
about how to ensure in all different

980
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:18,600
applications but at the end of the day

981
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:22,110
the question should be the secure our

982
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:23,640
nation and then we said what we have

983
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:25,980
seen in this store whether into the back

984
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,270
component of it we have seen one of the

985
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,370
abilities we have seen how the

986
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:31,980
vulnerabilities are automated by that is

987
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:32,790
and then how they are you know used for

988
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:35,760
building

989
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:37,950
lishus black bombs but at the end we

990
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,770
also seen utilizing all the information

991
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:42,299
and one who we have found that savvy

992
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:44,130
interesting critical infrastructure

993
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:46,650
devices on the Internet as well which

994
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:50,190
could be very very disastrous if bad

995
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:53,520
actors gonna get access to it and that

996
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:56,340
being said this is what that result

997
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,530
I didn't this is the 1i question like

998
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:00,780
the most because this one the message I

999
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:02,760
was like talking it Tigers on planet

1000
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:04,380
earth like two years back and they have

1001
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,840
actually displayed that message all

1002
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:09,540
across and the conference is an

1003
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:11,850
important one and what they say is like

1004
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:13,650
you know city already right we always

1005
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:15,509
talk about security we have come as we

1006
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:18,990
need to secure we have to stay private

1007
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:22,700
blah blah blah and it's saying it isn't

1008
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:25,890
new the cautionary that is w right

1009
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:28,080
Scotty if they're all knocks em in there

1010
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:30,420
for a long period of time that one specs

1011
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:33,420
is in the way on the rocks and of it

1012
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:36,060
right but it is up to you you can walk

1013
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:39,120
the house but if you let the window open

1014
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:40,380
who hears it just reaction point and

1015
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,790
that's all you still gonna get

1016
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,870
compromised but you still have a false

1017
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:45,180
sense of security

1018
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:46,470
I still have walked my house and I think

1019
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:48,129
that's the way we need to look into

1020
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:51,069
that's where when we talk

1021
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:52,660
in a security solutions or performing

1022
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:55,260
any kind of security assessments we

1023
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:57,940
actually will after analysing

1024
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:00,070
authorization boundary and the entry

1025
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:01,570
points into it it is not only go by the

1026
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:04,780
front end there many other entry points

1027
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:07,420
as well but interesting aspect X theory

1028
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:09,160
is nothing new but the portions that are

1029
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:10,780
we doing it what are we doing it in the

1030
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,330
right way I think that's what we really

1031
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:16,300
need to decide in this context rather is

1032
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:18,910
an IP space or scanner infrastructure

1033
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:21,310
but the problem is that these the tracks

1034
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:23,200
and the IP space are very real and I

1035
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:24,880
they are going to be a problem they are

1036
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:29,080
still a problem and they are going to be

1037
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:33,520
a big problem when the Sun shines every

1038
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:35,319
night and that being said I think I've

1039
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,180
covered the content that I have and all

1040
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:39,310
the questions love to discuss

1041
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:42,990
interesting ideas and you know your

1042
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:42,990
briefs if you have any questions

1043
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,119
[Music]

1044
00:42:56,439 --> 00:42:59,799
any better

1045
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:11,290
see I don't if I'm reading the question

1046
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:12,759
again so that so in this particular case

1047
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:15,460
you know there are two aspects to it

1048
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:17,110
right you know if you were building so

1049
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,670
your question is that political

1050
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:20,680
infrastructure now we can enhance the

1051
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:22,750
security or what they can exactly do if

1052
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,770
I'm getting it right so the first part

1053
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:26,050
is that you know in there are two

1054
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:29,590
aspects to it in a software that you are

1055
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:31,150
building and it's a homegrown they're a

1056
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:33,100
different way you have to look at it

1057
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:34,750
software that you are actually importing

1058
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:36,730
from the external vendors they're a

1059
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:38,920
different aspect because in the first

1060
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:41,470
case the responsibility model changes

1061
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,580
the entire the responsibility is upon

1062
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:44,890
you because you don't think that

1063
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:46,299
component and how security needs to be

1064
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:47,859
introduced into it it's your

1065
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:49,810
responsibility but when you are

1066
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:50,830
importing the software from some bank it

1067
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:53,020
becomes a part of a shared

1068
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:55,270
responsibility when you get it can play

1069
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:57,430
smartly and they can give you the second

1070
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:59,110
options to configure those devices in

1071
00:43:57,430 --> 00:44:01,240
your environment but in this context

1072
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:02,230
your responsibility model it actually

1073
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,270
comes back to you whether you are

1074
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:06,280
configuring it really know or you just

1075
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:08,130
doing it from the compliance purposes so

1076
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,590
that is where the problem is that

1077
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:12,750
I think that efforts need to go into

1078
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:14,430
housing times you know people with the

1079
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:16,410
documentation before actually deploying

1080
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:18,810
the device I'm just saying an example

1081
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:20,850
small things the most important is gonna

1082
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:22,620
come from the documentation as well but

1083
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:24,750
I think it's in that basis of shared

1084
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:27,180
responsibility model in this case the

1085
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:29,580
onus is on them and how a factory there

1086
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:31,500
is using security within one the second

1087
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:33,540
question with an IUD one that you asked

1088
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,740
like the California law I think the

1089
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:37,200
interesting one they have to come up

1090
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:39,209
with I'm not sure it is like always sign

1091
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,790
but the discussion is already in a place

1092
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:44,070
you know any ality device or any kind of

1093
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:46,590
well you know specific iberic device

1094
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:49,530
that's when used on a cell they have to

1095
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:52,050
actually enforce this functionality of

1096
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:53,790
you know change the password right away

1097
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:56,160
so let's say you open up you actually

1098
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:58,170
deploy that device and you wanna try to

1099
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,060
login into it as soon as you log in with

1100
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:02,460
the default password they have to have

1101
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:04,980
you force you to actually go out there

1102
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:06,780
and change the password right away to

1103
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:08,610
just actually present one set of at

1104
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:10,320
expert for exact other you were doing it

1105
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:12,900
but that also comes to the question

1106
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:14,250
whether how strong password you're

1107
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,800
setting it up people still set up the

1108
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:18,630
password as a password or stoma so I

1109
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,460
think that is where it has to be looking

1110
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:21,840
to from all aspects if you look at this

1111
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:23,940
key already it has to start from the

1112
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:31,730
source and it has to go to that and and

1113
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:31,730
that's how I think there is one

1114
00:45:35,549 --> 00:45:42,250
at least you can see that this is still

1115
00:45:39,759 --> 00:45:44,109
a good step to actually head forwards

1116
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:45,849
that thing that's nice involved yeah

1117
00:45:44,109 --> 00:45:47,710
just at least be fault is taken off the

1118
00:45:45,849 --> 00:45:51,269
table a few things from a regulation

1119
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:51,269
perspective here and there but not much

1120
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:59,049
any more question if you mentioned about

1121
00:45:56,349 --> 00:46:02,680
the cross interface capabilities did you

1122
00:45:59,049 --> 00:46:05,380
come up with any statistics or number

1123
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:08,440
how prevalent that is I mean tell that's

1124
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:12,009
not probably a real yea big deal but

1125
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:14,140
there may be other interfaces absolutely

1126
00:46:12,009 --> 00:46:16,269
I think if I was gonna beat your

1127
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:18,069
question like an opera you know talent

1128
00:46:16,269 --> 00:46:19,598
interface is very much prevailed at the

1129
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:21,220
Hydra device is there any other

1130
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,990
interfaces that we have which connects

1131
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:24,848
but and again I go into the little bit

1132
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:26,410
into the into the model of you know

1133
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:28,000
there's a remote management interface

1134
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:29,529
but then there is also an interface

1135
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,509
where the services are actually being

1136
00:46:29,529 --> 00:46:32,180
the zoomed right the first one is that

1137
00:46:31,509 --> 00:46:33,920
we can

1138
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:36,470
I'm asking me we're gonna have a

1139
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,210
caesarean about that but Callahan web

1140
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:39,410
and ftp are the most prominent ones

1141
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:41,630
because they just give you the

1142
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:44,118
functionality to actually go after Nexus

1143
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:45,770
31 now with the service use is the kind

1144
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:47,569
of there becomes very specific to

1145
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:50,329
different protocols like in a TCP based

1146
00:46:47,569 --> 00:46:52,520
service or UDP be service right but then

1147
00:46:50,329 --> 00:46:54,349
that if it is very customized these are

1148
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,450
the standard protocol they make it worth

1149
00:46:54,349 --> 00:46:58,339
this much so in order to understand I

1150
00:46:56,450 --> 00:47:00,740
think there are some reverse engineering

1151
00:46:58,339 --> 00:47:02,990
efforts to move it move it it is you can

1152
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:04,939
have some custom line you can use a net

1153
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:07,038
gateway like where - where should

1154
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:09,230
connect to it but you have to understand

1155
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:10,760
that those other details because it for

1156
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:12,470
example it uniquely mini correctly

1157
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:16,220
dissect the packet you can still get

1158
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:17,660
past what is some some some devices but

1159
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:19,160
the question is that that how you

1160
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:21,410
actually look after gathering the

1161
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:26,629
information from the device that you saw

1162
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:30,410
about $40 TPMT in you via Yahoo Watson

1163
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:32,760
it is this the way it is being used

1164
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:35,190
right now and for example you

1165
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:36,690
in your mouth like this likewise a

1166
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:38,760
Samson you know seven thousand nine

1167
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:40,500
thousand cities you can clearly see that

1168
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,880
you just you just trigger the sniffer

1169
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:44,580
and then why but you can the early scene

1170
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,320
oun ppmv is interacting you know we're

1171
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:47,759
at your some test that it should be no

1172
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:50,310
that moment and I actually catching when

1173
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:53,400
my facebook app directly why it takes

1174
00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:56,509
the server and then you can do those

1175
00:47:53,400 --> 00:48:00,450
style things as other PNP is the problem

1176
00:47:56,510 --> 00:48:02,840
in versus overhead play any more

1177
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:02,839
questions

1178
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:16,749
first of that was like natural

1179
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:19,769
machine machine stuff that's like an

1180
00:48:16,749 --> 00:48:19,769
outsider state

1181
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:27,549
because a lot of the stuff that's in the

1182
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:27,550
energy sector is not actually

1183
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:34,220
yep there's a lot of people keep saying

1184
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:37,730
this stuff I see has been active in

1185
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:39,720
and the irrigation systems you know each

1186
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:43,260
back have agreed with

1187
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:51,000
energy is not right

1188
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:54,330
yeah a lot of bases in that so I think

1189
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,099
I'm gonna report your question and I

1190
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:58,410
think you're asking that in the energy

1191
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:59,970
sector at the SCADA devices that are

1192
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:01,410
deployed in the energy sector we are

1193
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:05,160
pretty much gives you the read excess a

1194
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:06,089
naughty word Texas I think that is true

1195
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,040
as well

1196
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:10,230
the interesting part that ace is value

1197
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:11,700
even if you get a read excess Lexi from

1198
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:14,220
our tacit respecting you sniff that I

1199
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:16,200
get a lot of information right and yet

1200
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:18,060
still connect the dots right huh jack if

1201
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,930
the documentation will be there this and

1202
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:21,150
that and they start finding

1203
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:22,950
vulnerabilities in that context read

1204
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:24,869
information have seen that when you do

1205
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:26,609
to thread water reserves in any kind of

1206
00:49:24,869 --> 00:49:28,650
functionalities like different devices

1207
00:49:26,609 --> 00:49:30,740
even the vxs give you a lot of

1208
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:33,210
interesting information for example if

1209
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:34,740
you still have a read access but they

1210
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:36,240
have certain critical components and

1211
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:37,770
which are reading information like a

1212
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,689
predicate token or some other kind of

1213
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:42,119
thing or they have a link to some web

1214
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:44,070
resource still green only whets world is

1215
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:45,089
closed in Europe you know a password

1216
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:48,240
stairs again

1217
00:49:45,089 --> 00:49:49,980
done advantage but again in critical

1218
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:52,410
infrastructure is not only one component

1219
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:54,720
these are like any plz controllers

1220
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:56,038
back and how exactly you know for

1221
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:58,109
example it does feel facilities are

1222
00:49:56,039 --> 00:49:59,670
being maintained but the entire me in

1223
00:49:58,109 --> 00:50:01,828
this context you that you know even if

1224
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:03,990
you were solving open up it can still

1225
00:50:01,829 --> 00:50:06,269
give them the leverage to actual after

1226
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:07,618
an attack and I think that's where they

1227
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:10,038
really need to look at the my simple

1228
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:13,069
question that use the web interface look

1229
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:18,599
restricted to your own environment

1230
00:50:13,069 --> 00:50:19,799
having fire and that you think because

1231
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:22,980
people think there's nobody gonna look

1232
00:50:19,799 --> 00:50:24,660
at you have firewalls you have IDs IDs

1233
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:28,460
but then you will think it on internet

1234
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:30,779
like the skeletons on you next n foil

1235
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:32,090
and it is thank you very much I'll be

1236
00:50:30,779 --> 00:50:35,149
around

1237
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:35,149
