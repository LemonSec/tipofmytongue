1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,520
so like if you don't have a repeat

2
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,380
account onto the line is going to be

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:18,779
three or four months row but that's a

4
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,599
big one so good for not three months

5
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:23,670
want to go back so if you want to query

6
00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:27,630
every hour for 24 hours 20 go better

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,220
blows he's gonna go to you only three

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:33,809
dollars and 56 cents

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:39,000
precisely so now if you want to have an

10
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:41,370
elastic certain spin up on awareness

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,380
just sitting there not doing any

12
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,269
analysis just have the infrastructure

13
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,010
ready to put your glossary logs or when

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,300
you're gonna need it it's gonna it's

15
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,550
gonna cost you a hundred and fifty

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,899
dollars per month it's not sitting there

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,540
not doing anything you might need me do

18
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,250
also houses so we're talking about

19
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,379
really if we seen a really cost

20
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,320
effective solution it's available

21
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:03,599
through I'm gonna show you today more

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:09,920
planets really easily programmable and

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:13,410
that through like an API or vasila and

24
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,360
the sensitivity for framework framework

25
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:19,350
or different that suggests that we will

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,880
browser media is centralized long

27
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:26,158
analysis solution

28
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:29,158
describe and it's a cooperatively Morel

29
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,170
that huge teams can work together

30
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,009
because do you have if we're gonna see

31
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,130
him demo

32
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:37,950
it's one single phase which you can have

33
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,690
different group working groups and you

34
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,270
can have different databases different

35
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:46,320
tables and a really nice and a really

36
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:49,670
good way of teaching younger and super

37
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,860
junior analysts sequel a great because

38
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:58,350
and you can have your more senior more

39
00:01:52,860 --> 00:02:00,929
data analysis gurus going and creating

40
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,300
queries for investigations you can show

41
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:05,310
you how like the different scenarios

42
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:07,860
beforehand so you're prepared for any to

43
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,920
MIT and then as junior an excandesco

44
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,660
mean go to the same query style which

45
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,429
I'm gonna show you afterwards select the

46
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,500
query that humans run and the only thing

47
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:19,140
that he needs to do is specify the

48
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,060
database which is gonna be the specific

49
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,290
instant database let's say your specific

50
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,299
e to the tables

51
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:27,810
that's great for that your wants to say

52
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:30,360
use cases exactly that's better because

53
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:34,470
they don't need to know similar need to

54
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,910
know anything did you just tell them in

55
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:44,100
the demo you can have any solution let's

56
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:46,049
say because within Athena its same query

57
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,600
that you have you can name me and have a

58
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:49,640
description and say these queries for

59
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,220
identifying

60
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,170
a specific role and the rule that you

61
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:56,600
need to do I'll show you you just need

62
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:59,000
to go click the query it opens up on

63
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:02,510
declare it up and I use me two things

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,459
they actually use your name or IP and

65
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:08,989
just great about that you sit under them

66
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:12,560
so what do you have some simple queries

67
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:14,630
the first one we fear the top is looking

68
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,690
for any unauthorized operations as 44

69
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:18,829
over any error codes access denied

70
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:22,520
or someone's trying to access something

71
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:25,010
and this could be also like a small time

72
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:28,700
frame as you said before they make the

73
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:30,920
second one we're here for a specific

74
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:34,700
access key and essentially this event is

75
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:37,549
really important because I want to see

76
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:41,390
about 70 or 80 percent of the publicly

77
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:44,750
known ADA Lewis Bridges has been because

78
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:47,149
of its over- being exposed right so like

79
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:49,489
we found out about someone reports back

80
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:51,019
to us that oh we saw that aw keep

81
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:52,190
exposing it very cool

82
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:54,709
so what are you going to do other

83
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,959
brothers any response team to go when I

84
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:58,489
go get something now you create the

85
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,019
table with your flower tree looks for

86
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:02,930
that particular account and I'll show

87
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:05,390
you that and then you just query that

88
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,840
key you to say what actions did that you

89
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,640
made

90
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,120
did someone and then you're gonna have a

91
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:15,320
detailed table with controls as well

92
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,810
telling you from why he went what they

93
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:21,180
do and everything then the third one

94
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:23,950
over here is to cast any other

95
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:27,190
security routines so language sounds

96
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:28,930
opens up one security admittedly opens

97
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,219
up or significant access it or something

98
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:33,860
like that

99
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:37,580
then I didn't mention this but I'm gonna

100
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:40,790
mention in another time that this is not

101
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:43,130
written for large it looks like I told

102
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:46,790
you the beginning business needs a

103
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:51,620
structured format what does it mean

104
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:53,060
they're gonna have any loves anything

105
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,250
I'm gonna talk about it later but I have

106
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:57,950
some questions for example the second

107
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,750
one looks for a service attack someone

108
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,580
who look for possible file within your

109
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,700
different servers I mean this is like

110
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:07,609
you query you're right and they are the

111
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:16,130
last one is to find out actions from a

112
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:17,900
specific IP 200 something such it and as

113
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:20,270
promised with your even more notes write

114
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,729
anything English instruction way or you

115
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,590
can make it in this rush away you're

116
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,419
gonna have an extra bucket and then

117
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,010
we're leaving Africa and there are

118
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:29,780
actually really end up in ways to do

119
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:31,909
that enables you yeah it's like he makes

120
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:34,130
these fireballs you can say you can set

121
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:37,760
up when you set up your web service or

122
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:40,219
ews you can essentially automate all the

123
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,409
logs from your access with your web

124
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:48,370
access dogs going to industry pocket and

125
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:48,370
then feed the puffiness all right

126
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,970
okay so this is the main it'll be

127
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,750
responsible and the way that we happy

128
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:08,430
now so we just sit over here in the bar

129
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:10,050
Athena or historians over there and this

130
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:12,120
is the thing over here to the right you

131
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:14,070
have the query top where you're gonna

132
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:18,420
write your own ways or use our saved

133
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:21,180
queries and you know how I think up to

134
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:25,200
$50.00 with different parents did you

135
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:27,210
lift up your databases on the door I

136
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,670
have to here because it's a special

137
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:32,520
account it's not like an open-mike over

138
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:36,330
the county agency tens of them and then

139
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:38,789
below you're gonna have tables it for it

140
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:41,609
stuff is really bad so what I actually

141
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:44,910
recommend is having a single database

142
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:47,760
for a single format of the loaves what I

143
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:51,990
recommend and so like you have a cloud

144
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:55,050
trail databases look database a meal of

145
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:57,120
idioms in your database and then you can

146
00:06:55,050 --> 00:07:01,200
do collaborations you can combine these

147
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,540
different looks with joints and then if

148
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,990
you need to do another picture like I

149
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:08,850
didn't know that's true you can have set

150
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:11,340
up working groups they say that you work

151
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:14,190
on that and inside the case like

152
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:17,789
something right a chargeable and you and

153
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:19,110
you can involve the whole team like it's

154
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,070
only one or two others that need to know

155
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,130
about this incident

156
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:24,230
or it's something even bigger you can't

157
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,900
read your work

158
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:29,210
with in Athena service and specify the

159
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:31,280
weeds actual users or roles can

160
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,750
accidentally so even if I go here I

161
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,849
won't see the material we found out

162
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:38,660
there I am producers so this is pretty

163
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:40,580
cool and let's continue so then they say

164
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,410
they'd be safe where stuff that I

165
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,690
promised before is why don't you see

166
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:47,180
you're not gonna do they're gonna create

167
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:49,370
the queries have a description and then

168
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,650
the junior analyst either I just plain

169
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:54,260
go to here or next play because you said

170
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,890
they can go in here select the coroner

171
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,230
go around

172
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:58,280
just saying bits and bytes right there

173
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,720
which is I'm going to show you about

174
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,489
they could be to change it's just on the

175
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,290
queries into the investigation can you

176
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:06,500
separate queries based on the user's

177
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:08,840
account so they only let Tier one would

178
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,000
have to run queries I think it's it's

179
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:16,400
the working groups plural forms yeah the

180
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,500
working groups for that so how we do how

181
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:23,650
we do this let me see if I do this now

182
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,650
that they're more rhythmical next house

183
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:31,780
yes yes so the way that he's doing is

184
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:34,270
they say actually click on one of these

185
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:35,799
queries but I'm not doing it yet let me

186
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,240
have this mystery down so that he sir

187
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:39,909
that was another really really cool

188
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,260
feature about a division in and it's

189
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:44,049
actually something that makes they're

190
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,790
really good people frame over here you

191
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:49,479
have all the queries that you have for

192
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:50,740
the past 90 days and again you know how

193
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,790
about record YouTube so they can see it

194
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:56,350
and everything and you can have

195
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:58,420
management oversight let's say because

196
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:00,340
they want to see you are handle for

197
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,500
their hands of you because anyone could

198
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:05,530
go within that working group and blowy

199
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,630
be stopped and see which squares were on

200
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:10,290
and the really cool thing is actually

201
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:13,420
done by selecting one of these queries

202
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:15,939
you get all the results then it doesn't

203
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:18,310
run again it's our Jam or it already has

204
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,840
the results a ministry pocket and then

205
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,550
you it's the pocket and it's just going

206
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,500
to get the results back it's not gonna

207
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,270
push anything could just see all the

208
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:28,750
results and as you see over here in the

209
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:30,699
encryption type is the third I how

210
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,980
everything in blue beaker no I just

211
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,860
think when I first was when you release

212
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:38,980
I did this rooty mistake and I had

213
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,690
everything under fifty so we feel the

214
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,520
security then I thought I did but I

215
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:44,380
figured that out after me because we

216
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:47,350
have all the clocks little dogs are

217
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:50,290
activity but then Athena was

218
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:51,820
I lived in the market so what do you

219
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:55,329
need to do actually to go to the

220
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:56,860
settings over here the top bar and when

221
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:59,200
you first go in here it's gonna be like

222
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,730
this it's gonna be very clear results

223
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,380
it's going to be injected by people

224
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:04,750
they're not equally by default so you

225
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:07,240
have to delete this and then select one

226
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:09,130
of your KMS keys your D for whatever key

227
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,500
you want to use to increase those logs

228
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:19,350
so they're going to be encrypted after

229
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:19,350
the grave all right

230
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:29,579
yes judge what I think here I just give

231
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,290
them a query or the despondency Aquarius

232
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,290
getting hooked up right on the copy

233
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,630
[Music]

234
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:51,419
[Music]

235
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,049
[Music]

236
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:23,410
yes it's working pretty good for us and

237
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:26,969
it's not only cost effective it's really

238
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:29,650
quick also to do I will take will be a

239
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:32,500
feat on an efficient scale it would be

240
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:37,569
the same using like elastic stack or

241
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:45,490
black but then it goes a hundred times

242
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:48,550
less for an example like the 122 by per

243
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:51,190
hour for 24 hours for 30 days it's gonna

244
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:53,709
cost only three dollars 56 cents and if

245
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:58,840
you have an elastic search stock sitting

246
00:11:53,710 --> 00:12:02,320
on AWS $50 now we will have to so this

247
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:05,200
is every yeah so this is a cost

248
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,570
efficient and fast and collaborative way

249
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,460
of doing things you can do a this plank

250
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:13,800
way but then you cannot spend a little

251
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,800
more money so it depends how much

252
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:19,770
as long as feeling that pressure right

253
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:23,810
now a lot of people oh yeah that man had

254
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:23,810
they come up with any resolution there

255
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:32,030
so the solution is they're predicting it

256
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:33,920
so so because yeah you can test feed all

257
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:35,390
these lobsters done and you can quickly

258
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,459
them and then how is it addition

259
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:39,230
anything that you want there but again

260
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:44,270
you need someone to make things bland

261
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:45,820
you mean licensees we so for us it's

262
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:48,740
thousand accounts are we have and

263
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:51,410
accounts generating tons and tons and

264
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:54,640
tons of data culture it would cost to

265
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:58,219
just how these dates back I don't know

266
00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:00,740
yeah yeah it's like really cause explain

267
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,950
is cause this planet expect is expensive

268
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:06,980
we don't plan but we don't do this data

269
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:09,020
because yeah we selectively choose what

270
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:13,130
data to put its plan and what they use

271
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:17,420
other okay so let's continue so these

272
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:20,090
essentially what I did before was go to

273
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:22,040
the same place and select they create a

274
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:24,680
great for cloud backups which is already

275
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,449
given to you in the audience the only

276
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:29,239
thing that you need to do is go down

277
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:30,920
here and I'm sobbing because I think it

278
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:35,300
goes really quick as you see I haven't

279
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:37,459
saved with like an account and region a

280
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:40,130
year and month you can just need to

281
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:41,360
change the account number from the

282
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:43,700
different color cameras if I

283
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,470
the region the year and the month or

284
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:48,890
even Eve nonsense for the whole year or

285
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:51,529
specify single day so he knows the code

286
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:53,720
agrestic packet in query only not there

287
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:55,010
I'm not doing it for this demo because I

288
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,480
didn't my personally I don't think there

289
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,170
was a recent way I'm gonna talk about

290
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,850
that later

291
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,769
the most efficient ways to have all this

292
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:06,380
data partition but I'm not doing it

293
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:07,040
because of you guys so everything that

294
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,140
was really great

295
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,640
so it is actually I think I think the

296
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:13,310
location I bought it to my cloud

297
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:16,220
trailers over here I keep running Barry

298
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:18,529
and we get the lift then they pretty

299
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,750
much created now I just I recommend

300
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:23,029
because sometimes you know the schema is

301
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:25,310
a little bit wrong or something is not

302
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:27,890
exactly as it should be so we made fair

303
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:29,329
trade in the table suggest recommend

304
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:34,670
going to these three dots over here

305
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:37,399
it's a selecting to select the top like

306
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:39,500
the testing results so you can see that

307
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:42,500
your tables created sorry here we did

308
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,820
create the table and essentially over

309
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,160
here so they could the live you see

310
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:48,770
below the table you see all the clothes

311
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,480
that you have are right over there all

312
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:53,899
the homes that you have just created on

313
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:59,209
this table and see what I think for this

314
00:14:53,899 --> 00:15:03,260
show you guys is that yes I actually

315
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:04,949
used a really really cool tool 9 thing

316
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:12,439
that you're really gonna like

317
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:12,440
you have a link at the end all cloud

318
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:18,620
cloud

319
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,620
it's from Rhino security

320
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,799
[Music]

321
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:37,899
[Music]

322
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:46,050
so this digital report and what I think

323
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,780
for this is solving actually I guess of

324
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:51,410
this scenario is that what they do here

325
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:54,360
is that they automatically create

326
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,920
abominable AWS environments so you can

327
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,680
run it on your test accounts or a

328
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,360
personal account so there there are

329
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,910
scripts over here in scenarios the build

330
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,670
step by step so you don't to be any w's

331
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:08,219
guru in like that you just call which in

332
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:09,990
are going to be goes on here you can see

333
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,950
that you set up the environment by just

334
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:15,300
doing using their cloud load that by

335
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:18,150
bison speed and configure your

336
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,650
environment and then this is how the

337
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:22,829
difference in average here the double

338
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:25,890
its medium moderate hard whatever you

339
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:28,110
want to do and so the first part of it

340
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:30,420
it creates a vulnerable environment and

341
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:33,150
the second part way over here is a

342
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:34,860
tactical environment so what they do is

343
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:36,390
you create the environment WC

344
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,190
environment musical figure eight on this

345
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:42,150
environment so I can get you what do not

346
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:44,370
do and then they did you have and Sicily

347
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:49,699
that's why I in here so we can show you

348
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:49,700
guys the logs from me

349
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:57,000
so scenario we were notified that a user

350
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,979
named solo and some we're actively

351
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,810
happening with these

352
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,730
a delicious account he saw something

353
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:05,659
suspicious you and we're going to

354
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:07,310
investigate right so we just got the

355
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,890
same query and we just saying the

356
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:11,659
username does change the database that

357
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:13,640
they've over here with our newly created

358
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:16,070
that dangler we just created this a

359
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,230
Dracula and disparate to see like what

360
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:20,889
it is usable for the specific man that

361
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:24,160
we found out there are no most people

362
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:24,160
let's see wow

363
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:31,230
oh yes this bill only goes about

364
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:34,610
principle I mean I have to change to

365
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:37,830
username and I did a minute ago

366
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:40,729
all right so just have to watch what's

367
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:48,199
happening from that is what we see here

368
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:51,090
so we see and we house our sexy actress

369
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:55,950
doing some actions with quiz parameters

370
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:57,658
to our co-leaders invalidity they just

371
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,700
listed the project's over here

372
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:01,769
interesting okay then you certainly

373
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,659
didn't have any what will be this

374
00:18:01,769 --> 00:18:05,850
project let's sing this together

375
00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:08,490
irregular IP and see that lets people to

376
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:11,070
this IP we go to our say queries we have

377
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:13,200
like a suspicious activity where you're

378
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:14,610
already there for your analyst we just

379
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,169
put that thing there and we have the

380
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:19,080
query to see what happened from that IP

381
00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:21,899
just adjust it to actually do so and

382
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:24,418
what we're getting all these different

383
00:18:21,899 --> 00:18:28,289
results and not only user so what

384
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:32,309
happened here so that it be started with

385
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:35,309
user solo listing some mobile projects

386
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:37,408
and then getting access to another isn't

387
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:39,720
erasing does she said what happened here

388
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:43,500
and we will take that back is that the

389
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:45,899
user solo so picture of fact is a Tobias

390
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,629
is exposed to sovereignty if someone had

391
00:18:45,899 --> 00:18:50,959
access to this users over and then how

392
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:54,049
like someone have people from there

393
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,940
we fit from judicial the victims found

394
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:58,399
out that he had access to this global

395
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:00,590
project where he's not to use it the

396
00:18:58,399 --> 00:19:02,510
region didn't have exported meaning that

397
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:05,629
their eldest potentials but it does hi

398
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:07,850
only mobile project that was a cure if

399
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:09,830
they're like internal pressures of only

400
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:11,178
ten on users would access them that's

401
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:13,610
why we talked about we talked about in

402
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:15,559
general about serial security right so

403
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:18,408
someone was already their manager that

404
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:20,029
getting access to powering their no give

405
00:19:18,409 --> 00:19:23,110
up let's say this is for building it up

406
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:26,000
yes and got access to become recent user

407
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:28,340
access keys and as we're gonna see the

408
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,610
original user had more elevated

409
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:34,699
privileges so why didn't happen II is

410
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:36,678
that with those the days of connects us

411
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:41,090
from collision that that was able to go

412
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:44,980
and find an RBS database creates now

413
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:50,260
serves over here and there at the border

414
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:50,260
and see when I go to the right we see

415
00:19:54,020 --> 00:20:01,290
so we see actually that it was able to

416
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:03,810
create a snapshot of our databases

417
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:05,700
internally and create a new master

418
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:08,429
password because as I said the response

419
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,650
element are when something changes and

420
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:12,480
we see over here the bottom now there

421
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:14,640
was a new master bath master user

422
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,130
password said for this now so I have a

423
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,320
now over here is that we have one of our

424
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:21,360
own databases getting over an attacker

425
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:25,470
only he has access to it we don't have

426
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:28,979
access to it right now and it's been

427
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:30,990
again this is really simple example not

428
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:33,330
really fast queries just because they

429
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:35,100
were able to show you guys how quick and

430
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:40,110
easy s be used I think because it's

431
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:43,830
really the reason we have 17 years that

432
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:47,580
really no sequel database no no I'm not

433
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:49,919
really a super guru but if you have then

434
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:59,370
they can play it out to be really

435
00:20:49,920 --> 00:21:01,260
granular alright so how to make father

436
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:02,949
right we need to have our decisions I

437
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,410
didn't have another from ago

438
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:08,380
we need to partition are they telling

439
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:09,640
what that means is have them stored in

440
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,730
the beginning or you can change them

441
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:15,190
afterwards with the key name structure

442
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:18,100
so you can essentially have the

443
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:21,010
partitions based on the keys and instead

444
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:22,959
of specifying amantha you wanna run use

445
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:26,740
the partitioning scheme at you do that

446
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,330
then also W is says the compresses with

447
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,490
the passive cost be possible I just

448
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:35,260
suggest for present policies already

449
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:37,480
your new split file so I do like or they

450
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:40,330
will take back your data which is in

451
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:43,180
telling you packet your data is based on

452
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:52,720
columns or rows have similarities so you

453
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:55,300
can just wear it a specific yeah I still

454
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,010
recommend going that defecting partition

455
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,379
is enough because it's already really

456
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:01,660
cheap and cost-effective and then you

457
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,950
can always make your sequel queries more

458
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,560
efficient right

459
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:06,999
I opted amaizing all your joints or

460
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,678
order by

461
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:11,100
and try to make it as fast very most

462
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:14,350
cost efficient as possible

463
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:16,359
so now okay we describe a little bit

464
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:18,459
this is going back at something happened

465
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:20,949
something we need to investigate but

466
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:24,009
FINA and also help us do threat hunting

467
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:27,070
and also to mention so the way that you

468
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:29,350
can do threat camping you can have the

469
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:32,289
recruit where easily described before in

470
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:34,899
the stage where you stop and have them

471
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:37,509
running different terrible's in your SUV

472
00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:40,498
it's very popular and that is

473
00:22:37,509 --> 00:22:43,029
essentially you can also 1310 engines

474
00:22:40,499 --> 00:22:45,850
that's actually that's what really needs

475
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:47,739
to get new fitted evidencing and have

476
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:48,969
your data that you have in the past

477
00:22:47,739 --> 00:22:51,759
because you didn't know about these

478
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:53,559
doing together right so you can get

479
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:55,869
different diligence time for that

480
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:57,039
through your loads that you even an

481
00:22:55,869 --> 00:22:58,840
extra pocket you have stored for a long

482
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:07,749
time because they're not that expensive

483
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:09,189
to store you can automate this by using

484
00:23:07,749 --> 00:23:11,590
step back switch with an Italian

485
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:14,109
administration so you buy the WH to put

486
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:15,759
it together than the functions but I'm

487
00:23:14,109 --> 00:23:17,109
going to say I'm not gonna tell you to

488
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:19,090
do that I'm going to show you now their

489
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:21,639
solution right after this and then over

490
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:24,549
here I have a takeaway for you guys how

491
00:23:21,639 --> 00:23:28,449
to try without knowing that something

492
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:31,739
was exposed how to track a thing or an

493
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:34,149
SDS key the VEX these keys are keys are

494
00:23:31,739 --> 00:23:36,190
created and given to like one of your

495
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:36,860
resources definition to instance and it

496
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:39,620
said

497
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:42,649
of the times about six hours that is

498
00:23:39,620 --> 00:24:11,570
body but even those six hours something

499
00:23:42,649 --> 00:24:13,850
at security security so it is a token

500
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:16,428
that's really differently it's exciting

501
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:19,668
it's little you Steve yes

502
00:24:16,429 --> 00:24:20,929
and if like have a necessary for your

503
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:23,090
post

504
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:25,399
someone can attack it and get that key

505
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:28,820
and use it to do a stuff so the way that

506
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:32,000
you can actually track it and find out

507
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:34,610
if this happens is this whenever a new

508
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,970
exterior initiative instance you have an

509
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:40,490
assumed role cloud field artifact and

510
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:43,370
then that he essentially the function of

511
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:45,350
the keys to be used by three servers and

512
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:48,020
some developers may do some other will

513
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:50,059
stop using it in other places but so you

514
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,470
can write ways that take those cases but

515
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:53,870
most of the times is only gonna be

516
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:56,330
spiked with our results so now every

517
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:58,550
time that you see that key being used by

518
00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:02,030
times or any other source is going to

519
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:05,389
have an assumed role there sooner okay

520
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:08,240
means that this key was used not really

521
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:11,390
the solo means creating assumed wrong

522
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,520
means use and if you see that one key

523
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:16,760
was created by this resource but then

524
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:19,040
used by an i-beam roster or even another

525
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,540
resource that certainly use that then

526
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:25,040
this is something suspicious and it's

527
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:26,960
not even admissible so I told you that

528
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,940
you can use now the functions you can do

529
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,100
your own Python space and other main

530
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:33,770
hobbies and you can have actually really

531
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:36,080
cool it guys in the house to get access

532
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:40,220
get all three loops automatically when

533
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:42,320
they rally analyze them monitor have

534
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:45,890
indicators and query or the time of

535
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,240
Athena and get results and alert but do

536
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:49,370
you want to really bet they will

537
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,630
thanks guy no right you just want

538
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:53,330
something easy that it's out there I

539
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:56,090
think if you want a job if you have the

540
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:57,620
development power and the time and the

541
00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:00,770
resources to do that

542
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:03,860
to create that beautiful wheel over here

543
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:05,629
but I really do not do that because

544
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:10,520
there are Mexicans out there that you

545
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:12,680
can use in one of them is created by the

546
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:16,510
Airbnb security nearing thing it's

547
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:20,030
called stream under and it's actually

548
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:31,460
well develop the maintained not as our

549
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:33,830
own open source tool that we have so

550
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:36,830
they have battery alert which is a cigar

551
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:37,909
for generals yeah and host-based up and

552
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:41,629
then have three wonderful

553
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:42,500
so assuming it does is monitored all the

554
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:44,360
time

555
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,580
you're going to have different data

556
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,110
sources you can move the rig arrested

557
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:50,120
back in that you have a logs and every

558
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:52,909
time there is a new plan fail or Azadi

559
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:54,739
it's going to be analyzed pain so based

560
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:58,850
on some rules that they already have

561
00:26:54,740 --> 00:27:01,130
there for you it's really easy you just

562
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:03,169
need to actually use their routes that

563
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:05,960
they have or make your own it's based on

564
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:07,930
Python and it's really simple and then

565
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:11,170
based on

566
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:13,690
you can then send her letters to other

567
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:16,810
services is that we wouldn't be like

568
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:18,940
your planet in Islam and create an alert

569
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:23,560
for yourself you can say into a slack

570
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:26,590
you can send it to the simple message

571
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:28,720
service or extending reports the Navy's

572
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:30,610
the Little Miss has a service that you

573
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,550
can go in and learn any intuitive

574
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:34,540
message or an email opens your duty as

575
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:36,430
they have it here they have different

576
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:38,889
aggression so you can have a degree your

577
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:40,690
own it's a really cool tool that you can

578
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:42,850
whatever we discuss about doing the

579
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:44,980
lower hands before you can all make here

580
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:46,689
and have tools that they already have

581
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:48,400
they have an Operations community they

582
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:48,850
have slack channel that they help people

583
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,740
out

584
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:52,540
it's really good I definitely two men

585
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,050
sitting south it's going to help you a

586
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,000
lot

587
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:59,520
automating they are learning and

588
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:03,460
monitoring of your AWS infrastructure so

589
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:05,139
the one thing more here than to know is

590
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:08,170
that if you already have other

591
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:11,920
intelligence and you have deposit you

592
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:13,960
have like AWS gardening you know you

593
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,970
don't exactly means but these four

594
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,550
people who know how they budget to go

595
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:22,050
for it is always ready because this can

596
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:25,590
do everything that God did it does of a

597
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:29,909
cloud build an API level and even

598
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:29,909
actions if you send your exit up there

599
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:39,760
everybody goes so yeah my conclusion is

600
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:42,639
that it's fast it's cost-effective and

601
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,379
is to use a finger it's really simple

602
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,670
and you can read you're bored really

603
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,410
easily really quick

604
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:49,750
it's that particular of time for your

605
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:50,980
honors to just start running queries and

606
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:53,470
figure this all out

607
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:56,260
it's really simple and definitely come

608
00:28:53,470 --> 00:29:01,210
and going taking out your mother and I

609
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:03,550
thought oh yeah thanks I have the links

610
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:05,980
were here for block code and stream

611
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:07,629
alert go take both these guys out

612
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:11,380
so in this thing the cool thing that you

613
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:13,780
can do is go set up and available a

614
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:16,240
diverse environment goes then set

615
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:18,070
upstream alert and it has a data for

616
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,559
it's actually based on their phone so

617
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:22,419
you automatically deployed before

618
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,830
learning infrastructure you just need to

619
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:26,740
change the data sources and the

620
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:28,629
algorithms and it hasn't really talked

621
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:31,600
don't guide and it's going to stack all

622
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:33,550
the different steps and then when you

623
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,649
set that out go to club good Anabaptist

624
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:37,960
environment and see all your alerts

625
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:40,950
coming up so this is a really good way

626
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,950
of dotted out so train
