of of every uh half of the year

33
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,439
is to plan and strategize what we're

34
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,159
going to do

35
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,640
so hopefully many of you will come and

36
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,759
share your ideas or uh volunteer

37
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,479
to present which is usually hard uh we

38
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,320
try to recruit as many

39
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,360
uh well known professionals i feel it uh

40
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,000
but you know

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,159
the people like phillip are always very

42
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,439
busy and

43
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,200
it's not easy for them to just say oh

44
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,360
yeah just go and speak for two hours

45
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,479
on a saturday so uh we

46
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,880
we encourage you to participate we

47
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,399
encourage you to

48
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,119
present ideas or or request

49
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,320
presentations there's been times where

50
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,159
we have found uh new subjects and tools

51
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,680
because somebody said hey can you guys

52
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,079
talk about this or can you find somebody

53
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,840
so this year we had we have we have um

54
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,280
several great meetings uh

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,879
some of them uh during some very tense

56
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,239
and stressful times uh so hopefully

57
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,360
next year won't be as bad as this uh

58
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,400
and at one point we will go back

59
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,560
to to our meetings i don't think this

60
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,000
will happen until fall

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,360
or next year to be honest uh hopefully

62
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,959
we'll start rolling i was just seeing

63
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,480
the uh

64
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,280
the alerts from kron and the bay area

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,560
and apparently that they're going to

66
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,440
start rolling out the vaccine next week

67
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,280
so for california this this will be

68
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,280
great and and hopefully

69
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,080
uh we'll start getting some some

70
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,360
traction on this and

71
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,080
and the idea is to continue uh during

72
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,200
the meetings online

73
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,040
uh the idea is to continue creating

74
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,800
events for all of you guys and

75
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,440
eventually we we want to establish a

76
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,120
formal

77
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,440
i guess process where you get cpes for

78
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,319
this you can

79
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,879
you just so you know you can get cpes

80
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:05,360
right now

81
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,800
if you have a cisp if you have a

82
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,400
a sans that you need cpes for

83
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,879
you can claim then just send me an email

84
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,680
right

85
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,200
as long as you can prove you attended a

86
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,879
meeting that will certify that you

87
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,720
actually attended a meeting so you can

88
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,040
get your cpe so if you spend two hours

89
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,560
you can claim two cps

90
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,000
so um we also apologize we didn't do

91
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,480
a conference this year we actually

92
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,239
joined the

93
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,360
the smart cities

94
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,239
initiative uh but hopefully if we go

95
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,040
back

96
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,360
uh to in person next year maybe we can

97
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,120
we can give it another shot we talked

98
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,319
about it

99
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,480
uh and then we are actually trying to

100
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,360
recruit people

101
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,400
to help us in our new efforts and and

102
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,840
hopefully good things will come out of

103
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,560
this

104
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,680

it's kind of crazy how how well that

184
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,319
stuff helps uh

185
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,400
back in 2012 they were opening up the

186
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,280
actually 2000 yeah 2012 they were

187
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,840
opening up cfp for b-sides dallas fort

188
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,639
worth

189
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,240
and the coordinator said hey the best

190
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,759
job i got in my career was

191
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,160
presenting and so once i heard that i

192
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,080
was scared to speak in public i wasn't

193
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,319
comfortable with my speaking skills

194
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,599
so i started toastmasters and then

195
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,919
by uh 2015 i gave a talk at my first

196
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,520
conferences and been doing a lot since

197
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,080
then

198
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,440
and from doing all these conference

199
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,440
talks when i've recently made a job

200
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,520
change it was a lot easier to find

201
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,599
find jobs so get out there and network

202
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,599
the different groups like this

203
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,319
uh like you know like ron was mentioning

204
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,680
get past firewall it's like you know

205
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,759
you're evading the hr firewall

206
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,919
because hr sometimes they don't

207
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,280
understand

208
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,120
these jobs that well and they really

209
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,720
don't know who's qualified and it could

210
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,440
be

211
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,039
you know your resume could get lost in

212
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,400
the stack so if you know someone

213
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,000
internally they can refer you

214
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,680
you've got a lot better chance of

215
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,080
getting the job my last four jobs have

216
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,039
been all

217
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,720
referrals from people i knew that worked

218
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,960
at the company and i was able to get in

219
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,120
uh during the time i was moving to u.s

220
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,120
bank i'd actually sent

221
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,440
bank of america my resume and totally

222
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,160
got missed

223
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,720
passed over but i knew someone at u.s

224
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,160
bank and i got hired

225
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,080
a month later they found my resume at

226
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,280
bank of america and they were trying to

227
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,080
recruit me

228
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,599
so i mean i was well really qualified

229
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,599
for the job but i just got missed over

230
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,280
so the traditional way of uploading your

231
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,240
resume

232
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,680
going through recruiters don't always

233
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,440
work so that was some really great

234
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,240
advice

235
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,680

school project which is a meet up that's

269
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,880
focuses on cyber security and it's

people coming out of college

277
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,760
so i've been in the industry a little

278
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,480
over 23 years most of my career has been

279
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,640
a cyber security i started

280
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,920
in january 2 2004 uh

281
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,560
spent almost nine years in pen testing

282
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,240
this spring will make nine years

283
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,680
that i've been working in offensive

284
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,839
security i was fortunate to be asked to

285
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,519
be in the tribe of hackers red team and

286
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,720
that got me

287
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,399
an invitation by the publisher to submit

288
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,200
a book idea and ended up being a

289
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,680
contract so i co-wrote the book with

290
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,959
uh tim crowley she's a

291
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,360
well-known cyber security journalist in

292
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,000
the industry

293
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
and she helped me complete this book i

294
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,680
had the pen testing part down wasn't

295
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,040
really able to fill out

296
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,120
enough of the book to quite get close to

297
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,480
that 200 page

298
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,320
mark but kim come in and add a lot of

299
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,000
other security content that's helpful

300
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,079
for people getting started

301
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,040
uh i'm also also a co-host of the

302
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,880
uncommon journey podcast with chloe miss

303
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,720
doggie and alyssa miller

304
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,959
i'm an advocate i mean an ambassador and

305
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,120
champion for innocent lives foundation

306
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,360
they help unmask anonymous child

307
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,240
predators

308
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,079
so if you guys ever look for

309
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,680
organizations to

310
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,600
to volunteer they're looking for people

311
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,959
to do intel

312
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,040
and help unmask anonymous child

313
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,560
predators

314
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,240
and i'm also a member of hacking's not a

315
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,160
crime we we're trying

316
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,560
to help clean up the name of hackers

317
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,160
because the media over the years has

318
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,880
made

319
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,959
all hackers sound bad and when you know

320
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:07,920
when

321
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,680
hacking originally started out this were

322
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,200
your your people

323
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,000
like wozniak steve jobs and bill gates

324
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,800
and these people creating technology

325
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,399
create you know people writing code and

326
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,839
all this stuff and then

327
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,839
you know the media start referring to

328
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,079
cyber criminals as hackers and so we're

329
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,200
just trying to

330
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,279
to educate the public especially the

331
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,279
media because to let them know that this

332
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,320
is a useful skill

333
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,240
i mean it's just like a locksmith you

334
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,160
can use those skills for bad but

335
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,839
it's not not all people with the lock

336
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,040
picking skills use them for bad

337
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,040
so my uncommon journey started out a

338
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,600
little different as kind of an unusual

339
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,760
path when i graduated high school back

340
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,000
in 1984

341
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,519
there was computers in our school and

342
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,000
i t really wasn't really well known

343
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,760
field at that time

344
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,360
and i had no exposure to computers

345
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,399
didn't know what i was going to do when

346
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,839
i graduated high school

347
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,600
and since i was a powerlifter my friends

348
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,519
said hey you should be a pro wrestler

349
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,160
so i went to wrestling school and

350
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,920
wrestled professionally for about three

351
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,040
years

352
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,519
and had to change careers because i

353
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,160
didn't make

354
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,240
enough money as a wrestler you know i

355
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,079
was working part-time as a bouncer and i

356
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,320
needed a career that's more conducive to

357
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,279
to married life and having a family so i

358
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,360
went to trade school and learned autocad

359
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,519
so i became a cad draftsman this is back

360
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,680
in 94 i got my first

361
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,600
cab job and then i found out about

362
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,440
sysadmin work and i had more of a knack

363
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,200
for the computer side of things

364
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,839
i taught myself how to build computers

365
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:36,399
uh

366
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,120
i took a novell netware operating system

367
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,760
course

368
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,800
it was a cne back in the day and this is

369
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,240
you know novell for

370
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,800
those of you that don't go back that far

371
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,839
in i.t

372
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,440
that was like the predominant network

373
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,880
operating system

374
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,320
back in like the 90s and so

375
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,519
i went to work as a sys admin stayed in

376
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,240
that role

377
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,200
for about a little over eight years

378
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,240
moved into infosec in 2004

379
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,279
2005 i moved into application security

380
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,720
got laid off in 2012 and went to work

381
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,040
as a pen tester so i shared this story

382
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,200
the wrestling part is not really

383
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,880
relevant or the drafting just to let

384
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,560
people know if this is something you

385
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,680
want to do

386
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,200
if i could do it you could do it it's

387
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,480
just a matter of putting the time and

388
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,120
effort

389
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,079
you know taking the time to learn it the

390
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,920
important part of my journey is the sis

391
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,800
admin

392
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,240
portion because this this base knowledge

393
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,519
helped me an infosec and help me

394
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,800
eventually become a pen tester

395
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,399
so uh i'd like to to share this slide

396
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,279
with my students

397
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,600
each semester the first time i heard

398
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,440
this quote was in spiderman uncle ben

399
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,279
was telling peter with great power comes

400
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,120
great responsibility

401
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,560
so that i like to share this when i'm

402
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,000
telling students only hack if you have

403
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,720
permission and

404
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,199
even better uh written permission

405
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,440
hacking without permission is illegal

406
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,440
so be careful there are people out there

407
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,800
that will say they want you to do a pen

408
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,000
test they're just trying to get you

409
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,519
to hack into something or they want you

410
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,000
to hack their ex's facebook account or

411
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,959
that sort of stuff

412
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,119
and you want to be careful if you get a

413
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,120
a criminal record that it's hard to get

414
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,959
a job but there was someone

415
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,199
in the local community that that

416
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,160
actually got

417
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,120
got let go from a company because they

418
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,720
didn't finish the background check he

419
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,560
had a felony and he lost his job

420
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,839
fortunately he was able to get one but

421
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:26,959
it makes a little tougher if you got

422
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,360
that criminal record

423
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,560
this little sticker up there hacking is

424
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,839
not a crime this is from the hacking

425
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:32,560
it's not a

426
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,320
crime organization some stickers they

427
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,760
came out with to

428
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,199
to help socialize this group so what is

429
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,120
pen testing most of you probably know

430
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,320
what pen testing is but we're going to

431
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,959
cover it just in case those are on that

432
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:45,440
are not

433
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,240
aware of what pen testing is pen testing

434
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,519
is assessing security from an

435
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,120
adversarial perspective

436
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,720
attempting to exploit vulnerabilities to

437
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,320
gain unauthorized access

438
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,720
to systems and sensitive data also

439
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,560
referred to as hacking

440
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,160
so the role as a pen tester is not

441
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
always root or domain admin

442
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,959
the the uh information is the crown

443
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,560
jewels this is what the attackers are

444
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,079
going for this is what

445
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,560
they're going to monetize to make money

446
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,760
off of these breaches

447
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,360
so why pin testing so security posture

448
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,120
assist from adversarial perspective

449
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,639
gives you a better understanding

450
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,000
of the security risk level exploitable

451
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,519
vulnerabilities are higher risk and a

452
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,360
higher priority for remediation

453
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,440
as well as justification for budget

454
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,040
sometimes remediation can be very

455
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,920
expensive

456
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,240
but if it's exploitable then the company

457
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,000
is going to be more motivated

458
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,839
to remediate those items sometimes it

459
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,519
can be expensive it requires new

460
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,000
hardware

461
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,720
new software maybe even new staff but if

462
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,279
these

463
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,639
vulnerabilities can be breached then

464
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,639
it's going to give the company more

465
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,120
justification to do so let them see the

466
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,079
seriousness of that

467
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,839
so regulatory compliance your pci

468
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,120
dss uh is one of the things that really

469
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,600
has made pen testing popular when i got

470
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
started back in 2012

471
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,600
most pen testers were contract or

472
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,040
consultants

473
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,480
and most companies weren't really doing

474
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,560
pen tests then pci

475
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,440
required pen testing be done so a lot of

476
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,120
your financial

477
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,800
institutions are hiring their own pen

478
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,959
testers i worked at us bank we had a

479
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,120
pretty good size pen testing team

480
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,880
there was about 12 of us plus a

481
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,480
dedicated red team

482
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,240
and i believe they've grown since then

483
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,519
bank of america

484
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,639
capital one uh

485
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,360
citibank a lot of these companies even

486
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,959
outside of financial have their own pen

487
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,120
test teams because it gets expensive

488
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,800
to pay consultants to do all your pen

489
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,560
testing so uh

490
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,839
a lot of these companies are hiring

491
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,839
internal pen testers and

492
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:44,959
it's a little bit quicker to get a pen

493
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,079
test done you don't have to go through

494
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,440
the statement of work and get all the

495
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,560
budget

496
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,759
for this so um so this is a growing

497
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,040
field it's fun there's a lot of

498
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,240
opportunities out there

499
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,839
so pin testing jobs so pentester

500
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,000
is the uh short term of pin rate

501
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,759
penetration tester

502
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,599
these jobs fall into the roles of

503
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,119
security consultants analysts and

504
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,839
engineers because hr doesn't always have

505
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,559
the uh bandwidth to create individual

506
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,439
roles

507
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,439
and to manage all the individual roles

508
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,520
you know a lot of times your

509
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,319
analysts and engineers that could be dfr

510
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,280
people

511
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,959
this could be firewall people or

512
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,959
penetration testers so these are some of

513
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,400
the roles they fall under you just have

514
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,679
to kind of look at the

515
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,120
the job descriptions if you're looking

516
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,360
for a pen testing role

517
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,760
other synonymous terms with pen testing

518
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,440
is ethical hackers

519
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,559
offensive security adversarial security

520
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,080
and these sometimes fall under threat

521
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,600
and vulnerability management your threat

522
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,600
and vulnerability management teams

523
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,480
are usually the teams that are doing the

524
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,320
reoccurring vulnerability scans and

525
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,360
remediation

526
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,360
but sometimes the pen test team is part

527
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,799
of that organization

528
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,320
so just some ideas of terms and and

529
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,440
organization groups that that pentest

530
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,559
teams may be part of

531
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,039
so these pen testing skills are helpful

532
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,080
in other areas

533
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,919
so if you're a sock analyst or network

534
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,120
security analyst

535
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,760
be able to understand malicious traffic

536
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,960
is going to make you better at doing

537
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,760
your job

538
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,120
it's actually going to help anyone on

539
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,200
the blue team digital for instance

540
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,280
and incident response when you see

541
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,720
malicious traffic

542
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,240
or you see malicious items on a

543
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,760
system that you're investigating you're

544
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,919
going to have a better idea of what was

545
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:28,400
used

546
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,640
and haven't and make it your life easier

547
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,919
investigating that

548
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,640
that breach so purple teams where the

549
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,679
blue team

550
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,200
and red team are working together to

551
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,440
improve the defenses is very popular

552
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,919
this is a really great way to improve

553
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,039
things

554
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,559
in your your environment sometimes it

555
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,200
takes years of vulnerability scanning

556
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,799
and pen tests to finally get everything

557
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,799
straight but if you perform a purple

558
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,200
team

559
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,520
exercise where you're running different

560
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,880
types of scripts

561
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,880
to see if these hacking tools can be

562
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,120
exploited in the environment executed

563
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,240
and not detected

564
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,919
so you're working with the defenders to

565
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,840
tune those edrs

566
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,600
and different endpoints to detect those

567
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,960
and make sure people are responding

568
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,799
then application security this is used

569
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,480
widely there and this is actually

570
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,160
my first exposure to pen testing

571
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,760
so different types of pen testing

572
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,039
targets so networks applications

573
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,520
uh transportation people and buildings

574
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,120
are targets for pentest

575
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,679
you know internal external wireless

576
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,200
networks

577
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,200
applications from web app thick client

578
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,400
mobile and cloud

579
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,919
and then hardware anything from your

580
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,400
network devices to internet of things

581
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,400
and medical devices you know pacemakers

582
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,840
and insulin pumps

583
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,679
have been discovered in the past to be

584
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,760
exploitable so these items

585
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,039
can be hacked so we want to make sure

586
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,080
they're secure and they need to be

587
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,039
tested

588
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,520
as well as transportation you look at

589
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,880
the autonomous

590
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,400
vehicles after these self-driving

591
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,240
vehicles they need to be secure

592
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,559
so a lot of these different uh

593
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,080
automotive companies

594
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,799
are starting to hire pen testers to test

595
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:01,840
their equipment

596
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,159
test their their products and then

597
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,440
people in buildings

598
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,880
you know testing this security you can

599
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,720
have the most

600
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,640
you know secure environment the best in

601
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,120
class endpoint protection

602
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,559
and all this but if someone's able to

603
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,240
tailgate into the building get access to

604
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,760
a keyboard then to grab a lot

605
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,240
easier chance of hacking in or if

606
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,039
someone

607
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,200
clicks on a malicious payload on an

608
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,799
email

609
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,440
so that's why your buildings and your

610
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,960
your people need to be

611
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,159
educated and secure

612
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,600
so types of depth so you have three main

613
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,960
categories

614
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,480
and these are going to be dependent on

615
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,720
the amount of time you have to test

616
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,039
black box also referred to as blind pen

617
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,159
test

618
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,280
is going to take more time and

619
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,760
you're going to give the tester less

620
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,960
information this is going to be more

621
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,039
like an attacker would approach it

622
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,080
so with a network you may just you may

623
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,640
give ips you may not you may just they

624
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,400
just may know the name of the company

625
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,159
and they're trying to go in and find the

626
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,799
ip addresses and domain names

627
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,280
and then white box or crystal boxes

628
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,039
detailed system info

629
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,840
including accounts uh for app pin

630
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,559
testing

631
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,280
documentation and source code so this is

632
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,080
going to be the most

633
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,960
thorough testing method whereas uh the

634
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,120
black box is more

635
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,760
simulating an actual attacker and then

636
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,200
you have gray box this is partial

637
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,480
knowledge is this is going to what

638
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,679
you're going to see

639
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,280
most the time when your pen test is kind

640
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,720
of a combination

641
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,039
if you're having an application test

642
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:33,840
they're going to start out

643
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,919
unauthenticated and see how far they get

644
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:36,960
and then they're going to do

645
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,640
authenticated testing each level of

646
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,039
access

647
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,880
so then you have the different testing

648
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,480
depths or different pieces

649
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,080
of a pen test and these first two items

650
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,880
are labeled

651
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,000
not a pen test vulnerability scans where

652
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
you're running nessus or next bows

653
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,080
to look for vulnerabilities sometimes

654
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,520
they find false positives

655
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,600
but these are a great way to find low

656
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,640
hanging fruit

657
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,039
and find your vulnerabilities sometimes

658
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,960
your threat vulnerability teams

659
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,280
are running vulnerability scans you know

660
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,760
on a regular reoccurring basis

661
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,760
and pin testers will run vulnerability

662
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,280
scans as well

663
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,039
so the next step is your vulnerability

664
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,799
assessment you've ran your vulnerability

665
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:21,679
scan

666
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,919
now you're going to go through and run

667
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,440
other tools to see if you can find

668
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,120
vulnerabilities

669
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,720
use other methods and techniques to find

670
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,400
vulnerabilities and validate those

671
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,760
findings make sure they're not false

672
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,440
positives

673
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,039
once you validate those and find

674
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,480
anything the vulnerability scanner

675
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,760
didn't find

676
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,200
then you're going to perform the pen

677
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,799
test so you're going through

678
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,320
and this is like the vulnerability

679
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,640
assessment plus exploitation or hacking

680
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,280
those

681
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,000
those vulnerabilities you're going to do

682
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,280
you know analysis of those

683
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,640
vulnerabilities and see if there's any

684
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,640
exploits out there

685
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,360
and then the next level is red team or

686
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,039
adversarial testing this is more

687
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,000
simulating

688
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,200
a real world attacker sometimes uh red

689
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,080
team

690
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,159
is used generically for all of offensive

691
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,080
security but true red teaming

692
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,640
is more adversarial simulation pin

693
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,559
testing intel's trying to look for

694
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,440
every vulnerability and exploit every

695
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,799
vulnerability you can

696
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:17,919
where a red team you're trying to

697
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,600
simulate a breach sometimes you're

698
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,960
emulating

699
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,679
specific apts or sometimes you're just

700
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,280
using different types of

701
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,360
attacker techniques you'll go in you'll

702
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,880
find something that's

703
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,480
that's exploitable you're trying to

704
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,200
simulate a breach you get in

705
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,440
try to see if you can exfiltrate data

706
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,360
and maintain persistence

707
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,840
and with this you're also usually social

708
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,440
engineering is in scope

709
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,960
red teaming is also referred to

710
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,279
sometimes as open scope pen testing

711
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,080
with your compliance pen tests have been

712
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,360
a little more narrow scope they're just

713
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,640
wanting to do stuff that

714
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,240
passes pci and so the more narrow scope

715
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,600
pen testing has come about so this is

716
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,960
where red teaming

717
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,080
has become needed they need more of an

718
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,480
adversary simulated test to make sure

719
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,720
that you're truly secure

720
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,799
and this is something that you do as

721
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,799
your your process matures there's things

722
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,240
you can add to your program

723
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,799
as things get more mature you want to do

724
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,200
your pen test your vulnerability

725
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,400
scanning to make sure things a little

726
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
more secure and then add in your

727
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,320
your adversarial simulation and then

728
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,678
like things like bug bounties

729
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,400
so specializations this first one is

730
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,640
really not a specialization

731
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,200
this is just general it's just your your

732
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,480
normal pen tester

733
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,960
you're doing network pen test primarily

734
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,600
uh

735
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,360
sub general wi-fi light web application

736
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,039
even though it's a network pen test a

737
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,799
lot of your administrative

738
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,159
uh interfaces for print servers and

739
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,080
you know your your different security

740
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,279
software

741
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,520
and different id administrative

742
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,880
interfaces are web-based

743
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,279
so sometimes a pentester an attacker the

744
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,240
only way in

745
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,640
is through one of these interfaces so

746
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,159
you need to know a little bit of

747
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,480
white web application pen testing and

748
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,480
even a good example is look at the oscp

749
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,840
the ocp

750
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,880
tries to prepare you for the role of a

751
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,080
pen tester

752
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,600
and a lot of the stuff in their their

753
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,880
labs have some kind of web exploit

754
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,240
so they're just kind of they really show

755
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,520
the need for that type of skill set

756
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,120
they need to specialize in application

757
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,760
web app mobile cloud or api

758
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,919
thick client or your binary applications

759
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:28,960
are still

760
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,320
still vulnerable and can still be

761
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,240
exploited need to be tested

762
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,559
social engineering your people so a lot

763
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,159
of people will specialize in social

764
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,600
engineering and physical

765
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,840
you take people like jason e street you

766
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,760
know he specializes in

767
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,960
social engineering and so these are

768
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,760
these are tools that are helpful in pen

769
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,799
testing as well as

770
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,720
as red teaming so some of these you can

771
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,559
use together but some people like to

772
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:53,679
really specialize

773
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,279
i think if you really want to master

774
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,760
something someone for myself like myself

775
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,840
for me to get to the next level i need

776
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,520
to specialize because it's hard for me

777
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,279
to know everything and be

778
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,240
good at all i could be you know decent

779
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,240
at some things but you can't be a ninja

780
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,279
at all things

781
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,880
so you look at people that are writing

782
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,400
the active directory

783
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,919
exploit tools they're really good at

784
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,600
that area but maybe they're not really

785
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,320
good

786
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,039
at web app pen testing so specializing

787
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,640
can be a good thing

788
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,080
transportation this is a good area to

789
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,159
specialize in you know it's kind of new

790
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:25,600
so there's not a lot of people in that

791
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,240
area

792
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,799
and then red teaming then red teaming

793
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:29,919
can be used in

794
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,480
the pen testing realm so you can do red

795
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,919
teaming and pen test too

796
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,279
you know some companies may not have

797
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,799
enough work to be constantly just doing

798
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,000
red teaming so you're doing

799
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,760
pen testing and you know a lot of those

800
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,520
skills there's overlap there

801
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,240
just more adversary simulation on the

802
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,960
red team part

803
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,880
so how to become a pen tester this is

804
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,440
one of the more popular

805
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,520
parts of this talk so you need the

806
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,039
technology knowledge

807
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,039
you need to understand networking and

808
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,799
operating systems

809
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,360
especially windows and linux you know

810
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,000
most windows

811
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,200
servers you're going to find in your

812
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,360
enterprise environments so understanding

813
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:07,760
that

814
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,960
an active directory linux is is very

815
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,480
popular and you see a lot of that on the

816
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,200
internet

817
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,120
so you need to understand both of those

818
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,440
operating systems from a sys admin level

819
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,120
if you get a shell or command line

820
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,880
access to one systems you need to be

821
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,720
able to navigate the command line

822
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,799
and to truly be successful as a pen

823
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:25,760
tester

824
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,039
or an ethical hacker you need to

825
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,880
understand that command line

826
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,039
security you need to understand security

827
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,640
to be able to hack into something you

828
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,960
need to understand the technology the

829
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,880
security around it so you can actually

830
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,919
exploit

831
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,120
vulnerabilities and misconfigurations

832
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,799
applications and hardware is very

833
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,799
important too but these three main

834
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:45,279
things

835
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,840
the network operating systems and

836
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,279
security of the areas that you really

837
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,640
need to focus on starting out

838
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,760
so hacking knowledge once you have that

839
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,440
basic skill set

840
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,640
then you're going to need to learn how

841
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,840
to hack whenever i was becoming a pen

842
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,039
tester i knew how to run web app

843
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,799
vulnerability scanners i ran some

844
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,200
network vulnerability scanners

845
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,440
i had the sysadmin experience new linux

846
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,799
and windows

847
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,640
and some other networking technologies

848
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,000
but i didn't know how to hack so i had

849
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,679
to learn how to hack

850
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,640
so i signed up for the oscp course and

851
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,360
so that's

852
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,440
how i learned how to hack through that

853
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,399
course so

854
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,640
classes conferences your meetings and

855
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,840
meetups like this

856
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,440
you know you're able to see some

857
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,799
different tools and techniques people

858
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,240
are using

859
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,880
uh even if you're taking classes and any

860
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,240
kind of courses like that

861
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,840
you still need to do some kind of self

862
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,080
study so

863
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,000
build a home lab you know there's a lot

864
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,320
of good youtube videos out there

865
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,360
on on pen testing different tutorials on

866
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,320
those videos

867
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,720
and that you can find feel like twitter

868
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,520
and you know

869
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,960
twitter has a lot of links to different

870
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,120
blogs and articles out there that can be

871
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,240
helpful

872
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,679
twitter you can find a lot of different

873
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,240
people in the industry to learn from

874
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,240
so you also need to develop that hacker

875
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,640
mindset once you've learned

876
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,480
you know once you have the the knowledge

877
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,080
the security background

878
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,440
and you're starting to learn hacking

879
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,039
techniques you need to develop the

880
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,720
hacker mindset

881
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,159
it's so interesting way to kind of

882
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,480
describe that is after becoming a pen

883
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,520
tester

884
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,039
you know i was at an airport one time

885
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,120
getting ready to uh do a pen test i was

886
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,320
waiting for my luggage

887
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,200
and i saw a usb drive laying on the

888
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,880
ground let's thumb drive this usb

889
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,720
stick and i saw that and i was just

890
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,159
wondering if it wasn't an attempt for

891
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,159
someone to social engineer someone

892
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,919
this is because being in the industry

893
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,840
and learning these different techniques

894
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,200
i started learning how those could be

895
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,039
leveraged so you

896
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,039
adapting that hacker mindset learning

897
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,399
that is important

898
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,960
and you kind of learn this from maybe

899
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,159
you have a system that

900
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,520
has is vulnerable to unrestricted upload

901
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,760
like apache tomcat you're able to upload

902
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,039
a war file

903
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,600
that can be uploaded and creates the

904
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,720
malicious jsp

905
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,960
page that allows you to get access and

906
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,559
shell to that system

907
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,399
so you know once you've uploaded that

908
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,960
you know to look at the command prompt

909
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,520
what level access am i running you know

910
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,120
do i need to get an interactive shell

911
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,000
with this

912
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,919
shell that i have so i can see more

913
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,120
that's what i'm going on

914
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,360
so i can get like a bash shell so i can

915
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,240
see more

916
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,720
of the reactions to what i'm typing in

917
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,960
uh you look at the level access

918
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,240
and my nt system authority or root or am

919
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,039
i just some

920
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,799
you know low-level user which you should

921
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,960
be you should be looking at some web

922
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,840
service account with minimal access so

923
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,200
if you have the minimal access you know

924
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,480
you need to elevate your

925
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,640
your privileges and so just look at

926
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,240
those things and and learn how to put

927
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,840
together know how different

928
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,919
vulnerabilities can exploit be exploited

929
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,600
as you see that

930
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,279
and get more experience you see that oh

931
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:44,559
i could do this with that and the more

932
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,880
you build that base up the easier

933
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,960
it gets for you and you develop that

934
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,480
mindset the best way to build this

935
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,840
mindset

936
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,000
it takes time and repetition and the

937
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,279
best way to develop this

938
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,679
with hands-on hacking experience your

939
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,760
ctfs your bug bounties

940
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,399
your hack the box your try hack me your

941
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:05,840
different home hacking labs

942
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,480
so the formula for becoming a pen tester

943
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,159
is the technology knowledge

944
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,240
plus the security knowledge plus the

945
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,120
hacker mindset

946
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,279
and so where to start this is where that

947
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,600
this talk has helped people out because

948
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,559
and this is anything you're trying to do

949
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,840
in technology or security find people

950
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,320
that have

951
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,000
experience because they can save you

952
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,080
time vetting out resources

953
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,240
you know my first year in pen testing

954
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,519
you know i didn't have a lot

955
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,519
of resources so i learned these

956
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,279
resources on my own

957
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,720
and found some good ones over the years

958
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,240
you can go you can get some resources

959
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,360
that are not so great

960
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,919
not the optimal learning resources so if

961
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:47,440
you can learn from someone else that can

962
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,799
save you a lot of time

963
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:53,200
and optimize your learning experience

964
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,120
so what you need to do is develop a plan

965
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,320
so what

966
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,240
you need to do is perform a gap analysis

967
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,159
look at what you know and what you need

968
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,519
to know so

969
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,320
if you don't know operating systems that

970
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:06,720
well

971
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,720
then you need to learn linux and windows

972
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,640
if you don't understand hardware learn

973
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,720
hardware and networking

974
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,519
if you you know if you've worked in it

975
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,559
maybe you don't have that linux

976
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,000
background or you don't have networking

977
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,919
maybe you're on the help desk and you

978
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,640
have limited network experience or not

979
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,240
much sysadmin stuff so

980
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,919
start filling those gaps to the things

981
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:29,760
that you don't know and a lot of people

982
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,960
infosec

983
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,080
you know they may have most of these

984
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,200
skills but they just need to learn how

985
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,360
to hack at the position i was at when i

986
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,159
started

987
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,760
uh becoming a pen tester so your

988
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,480
participate ctfs and bug bounties these

989
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,240
are really great ways to learn

990
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,600
when you're going through a job

991
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,440
interview if you've done bug bounties

992
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,080
you can tell

993
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,080
how you've tested for particular

994
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,200
vulnerabilities how those were exploited

995
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,600
even capture the flags you can explain

996
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,760
to people how you hack certain things

997
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,840
you know hack the box this is good

998
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,960
experience because these are the things

999
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,720
you're doing as a pen tester

1000
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,320
and you know sometimes you know it's

1001
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,080
hard to find good hackers so

1002
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,440
if you're building these skills then

1003
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,080
that's helpful someone

1004
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,720
in the local dallas community you know

1005
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,320
had a really great success story he

1006
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,320
worked and hacked the box

1007
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,720
doing those vulnerable you know systems

1008
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,640
worked on those for like a year

1009
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,279
solid and then it only took him 60 days

1010
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,000
of lab time

1011
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,360
to pass the oscp so learning that is

1012
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,159
is a really great thing to do before

1013
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,320
even starting the oscp exam

1014
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,600
process so build a lab no matter what

1015
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,600
level you're at

1016
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,960
i'm you know i've been doing this for a

1017
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,399
while and i still have a home lab it's a

1018
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,159
way to test new tools

1019
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,799
and techniques and and have it in a safe

1020
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,240
environment because not

1021
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,760
you don't always want to test your proof

1022
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,600
of concept code or

1023
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,159
vulnerabilities exploits that you found

1024
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:53,360
in production environments you want to

1025
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,360
test it first to make sure that the

1026
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,000
the effects are not you know damaging to

1027
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,760
the systems

1028
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,679
so building your home lab so i have

1029
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,159
three main categories here this could be

1030
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,600
as detailed or as minimal as you want so

1031
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,399
minimus lab

1032
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,879
this is one one of my favorites i have

1033
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,679
the minimalist lab the dedicated lab so

1034
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,719
my my laptop i've got vulnerable vms

1035
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,918
i have like a kali linux and

1036
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:22,000
paired os attack vm running on there as

1037
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,960
well as

1038
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,760
different vulnerable vms and then on my

1039
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,119
dedicated lab i have a

1040
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,839
ubuntu system running several vulnerable

1041
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,280
vms on that so i can

1042
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,280
you know attack those systems across a

1043
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,199
network which is more

1044
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,879
simulating a real world environment and

1045
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,560
that way it just saves kind of some disk

1046
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,520
space on my

1047
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,000
my laptop and then advanced labs you can

1048
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,639
have

1049
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,320
different individual components routers

1050
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,839
and switches

1051
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,599
you know the clients and server

1052
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,359
environments and firewalls

1053
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,040
if you don't you know you can find used

1054
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,199
hardware pretty inexpensive

1055
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,040
or you can even go the raspberry pi

1056
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,560
route you can build

1057
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,960
different you know routers and firewalls

1058
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,720
and that sort of thing using raspberry

1059
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,440
pi's

1060
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,520
against all windows and linux on those

1061
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,440
so if you want something more

1062
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,640
you know uh autonomous and not all

1063
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,800
together like virtualization then that's

1064
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,240
that's a good uh method

1065
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,480
so you need your attack platform you

1066
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,040
need something to host your attack tools

1067
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,119
and so kali linux and parados are really

1068
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,640
great resources

1069
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,720
ubuntu with the pentester framework by

1070
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,760
trustedsec

1071
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,839
dave kennedy from trustedsec created

1072
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,160
this this utility or script that you can

1073
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,680
run to install

1074
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,480
the different uh packing tools that you

1075
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,280
could find on

1076
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,880
on kylie linux it's a way to really

1077
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,560
control the individual tools you want to

1078
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,440
install

1079
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,880
say if you set up uh ubuntu in the cloud

1080
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,359
then you're

1081
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,040
it makes it easier to install the

1082
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,960
pentest tools there

1083
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,839
uh commando vm is a set of scripts kind

1084
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,440
of similar to ubuntu but it's

1085
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,119
for windows so you install the different

1086
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,440
hacking tools on windows

1087
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,480
it sets up your partitions your drives

1088
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,520
where it's protected from windows

1089
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,800
defender or your

1090
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,200
your antivirus to prevent from deleting

1091
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,359
the hacking tools anytime you try to

1092
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,839
install metasploit on a windows system

1093
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:10,480
without

1094
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,400
setting up a protected uh drive drive or

1095
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,280
folder

1096
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,359
you'll see that windows defender or the

1097
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:18,480
antivirus will delete

1098
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,280
those tools because it's seen as malware

1099
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,480
and everyone you know

1100
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,560
linux is a very good hacking platform

1101
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,520
you need to know

1102
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,599
but windows has some good sysadmin tools

1103
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,040
so it's good to have

1104
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,640
a some platform vm

1105
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,160
running linux and windows

1106
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,599
so you need something to attack so you

1107
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,680
need some targets on your home lab

1108
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,520
so you can create virtual machines using

1109
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,440
targets from vault hub

1110
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,839
metasploitable 2 and metasploitable 3

1111
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,920
are good places to start

1112
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,040
one of the reasons i really like

1113
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,200
metasploitable 2 and 3

1114
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,440
is if you download you know vulnerable

1115
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,560
vms from

1116
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,119
from phonehub there may not be as many

1117
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,640
flags on there because they take a lot

1118
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,720
of all capture the flag vms and upload

1119
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,680
those

1120
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,240
and while those are good metasploitable

1121
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:06,880
has

1122
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,000
a lot of exploitable vulnerabilities and

1123
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,839
there's walkthroughs on those so if you

1124
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,280
get stuck you can look at those

1125
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,400
walkthroughs

1126
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,760
also you can learn through those

1127
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,359
walk-throughs because everyone has

1128
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,119
different ways of doing things so

1129
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,680
look at those walk-throughs

1130
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,839
metasploitable 2 runs on ubuntu

1131
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,680
and metasploitable 3 also runs on

1132
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,440
windows so you need a

1133
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,079
linux box to attack in windows so these

1134
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,280
two vms there

1135
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,040
alone will keep you busy for quite a

1136
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,280
while then os

1137
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,720
we've got web goat listed but you have

1138
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,480
choose shop damn vulnerable web app a

1139
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,839
lot of different

1140
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,920
uh vulnerable applications you can find

1141
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,440
through the wasp

1142
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,599
create your own vulnerable vms you can

1143
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:46,960
download vulnerable software from

1144
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,240
exploit db

1145
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,079
exploit db is a repository for different

1146
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,320
exploits for vulnerabilities and not

1147
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,000
only do they have exploits they have

1148
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,839
links to the vulnerable software

1149
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,400
so you can build your own vm targets you

1150
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,680
can get together if you have a study

1151
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,880
group or some people that you get

1152
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,680
together

1153
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,320
and hack with uh build your own vms make

1154
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,400
a challenge create vms and

1155
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,880
and uh you can let your your study

1156
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,880
partners check those out so that's a way

1157
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,760
to

1158
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,359
test those you know because you're

1159
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,640
building it you know what's vulnerable

1160
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,839
on there while this is a good way to

1161
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:18,800
learn

1162
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,560
if you want a system that you can you

1163
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,920
know test that you don't know

1164
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,920
what the vulnerabilities are then

1165
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,280
building those vulnerabilities

1166
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,800
and sharing is a good way those

1167
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,079
vulnerable vms is a good way to learn

1168
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,079
and study study groups are great when i

1169
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,760
was going through the oscp

1170
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,280
i found three other guys that were

1171
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,359
studying for the oscp and we shared

1172
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,040
resources because we were all getting

1173
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,640
started in that area

1174
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,720
and we would find good resources on

1175
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,800
exploitation uh reconnaissance and all

1176
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,079
that different books we found that we're

1177
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,359
good and we'll share it with each other

1178
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:49,920
so it

1179
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,599
helped the learning process along there

1180
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,000
so here are some great books the

1181
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,079
penetration testing a hands-on

1182
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,240
introduction to hacking by georgia

1183
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,760
weedman is a good one

1184
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,680
the first year of my club class i use

1185
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,800
this book

1186
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,640
and the nice thing about this book it

1187
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,400
not only teaches you the pen test

1188
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,560
it also shows you how to set up your own

1189
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,400
home lab so you can use this for the

1190
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:12,960
book

1191
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,880
so you're able to from this you'll learn

1192
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,119
how to build your own vulnerable vms

1193
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,720
because she georgia takes you step by

1194
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,400
step through how to do that

1195
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,320
we end up moving over to pentest plus

1196
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,920
curriculum to give students a

1197
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,720
certification

1198
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,119
to to prepare for but this is still

1199
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,079
still a good book

1200
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,000
some of this the systems are a little

1201
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,680
more outdated

1202
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,040
but one thing is i tell you once you

1203
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,720
learn how to exploit something

1204
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,280
it's older and outdated you can use that

1205
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:37,839
same

1206
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,760
knowledge and skills that you built to

1207
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,680
hack newer systems

1208
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,920
and uh so this that's a really good way

1209
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,160
to to learn things

1210
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,599
and the hacker playbook two and three

1211
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,760
make sure don't skip over three over to

1212
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,640
three because

1213
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,200
version two is pet testing focused

1214
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,880
version three is more red teaming

1215
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,599
so you need version two first and so the

1216
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:00,400
progression

1217
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,920
you want the pen testing book and then

1218
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,079
progress to the hackers playbook two and

1219
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,800
three and then for web application

1220
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,440
pin testing the web application hackers

1221
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,079
handbook

1222
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,880
by the creators of burp suite and the

1223
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,160
operator handbook this

1224
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,839
yellow covered book here it has a lot of

1225
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,440
handy syntax for

1226
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,760
anyone that works in security does

1227
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,520
sysadmin work there's different things

1228
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,200
related to cloud

1229
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,000
different hacking tools and powershell

1230
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,599
the red team field manual is a little

1231
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:30,640
older

1232
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,960
version of a similar book not as much

1233
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,560
content to it it was one of the first

1234
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,000
ones of his type

1235
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,640
but i still like to to to include that

1236
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,400
the operator handbook came out

1237
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,800
uh first quarter this year and it's

1238
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,400
available in ebook and

1239
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,800
printed version i actually have both the

1240
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,400
the printed and the ebook version

1241
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,480
it's the learning resources if you if

1242
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,599
you look at this list this

1243
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,359
you see a little space in between the

1244
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:58,880
top and the bottom there

1245
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,839
the top section are paid resources and

1246
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:02,560
most of these are

1247
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,160
going from more expensive to least

1248
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,319
expensive sans institute's great

1249
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:07,440
training but usually this is going to

1250
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,160
have to be

1251
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,800
company funded training their courses

1252
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,359
for a three-day course is 3 800

1253
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,720
and for a six-day course is like 7 200

1254
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,640
it's great content they keep it up to

1255
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,560
date which is one thing that's really

1256
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,599
good about

1257
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,200
any kind of learning curriculum you want

1258
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,040
stuff that's up to date so it's

1259
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,599
kept up to date it's created by people

1260
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,520
that are experts in the industry a lot

1261
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,000
of them

1262
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,160
are in consulting or came from

1263
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,480
consulting backgrounds

1264
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,040
e-learning security has a lot of great

1265
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,720
resources there they were currently

1266
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,200
they were they're currently part of ine

1267
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,040
they were acquired last year

1268
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,319
and so now elearn security is integrated

1269
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,760
into ines learning platform so now when

1270
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,440
you purchase their product

1271
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,920
you don't just purchase an individual

1272
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,800
course

1273
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,319
you can get packages where you have

1274
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,079
access to all the

1275
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,640
security tools for a very good price

1276
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,079
they have an offer going on now

1277
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,319
for like two thousand dollars you get

1278
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,800
access to all their cyber security

1279
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,560
training i think it also includes maybe

1280
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,520
some development courses as well

1281
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,599
and then offensive security this is a

1282
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:14,640
really great through the

1283
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,280
the creators of the oscp virtual hacking

1284
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,240
labs

1285
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,800
is a great pen testing course that has a

1286
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,560
nice short pin testing course and

1287
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,920
online labs that take you from

1288
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,200
easy boxes up to more advanced

1289
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,040
and the easier boxes give you hints the

1290
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,720
advanced ones get to where they don't

1291
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,839
give you hints

1292
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,079
and so they kind of bring you in easy

1293
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,760
and build you up there's even like an

1294
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,960
android device

1295
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,400
in their environment that you can hack

1296
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,640
pentester lab is a good one for web app

1297
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,800
pen testing this one not only shows you

1298
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,400
how to detect

1299
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,240
you know sql injection they show you how

1300
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,240
to get a shell to a system

1301
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,800
so that's a really great resource there

1302
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,240
uh

1303
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,920
pentester academy is a good resource

1304
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,880
they cover everything from

1305
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,640
some hardware hacking related stuff

1306
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,480
they've added some docker related stuff

1307
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,520
active directory over the past year or

1308
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,119
two they've added more some defensive

1309
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,400
stuff

1310
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,119
so it's a really good resource too it's

1311
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:14,720
a subscription-based service they do

1312
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,599
have some

1313
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,640
standalone courses but it's a good price

1314
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,200
course and most people can afford that

1315
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,599
and practical pentest labs

1316
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:26,720
is 64 or less for lifetime access they

1317
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,480
have a short pen testing course

1318
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,040
and then several uh vulnerable systems

1319
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,000
that you vpn

1320
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,560
into like you do with the offensive

1321
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,599
security

1322
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:39,280
courses then we have the free resources

1323
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,839
here bug crowd university and hacker 101

1324
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:43,680
has free learning resources because they

1325
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,599
want to educate people

1326
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,160
on web app pin testing to bring in you

1327
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,000
know web app pen testers to to perform

1328
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,680
in their bug bounty programs

1329
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,200
so they have good content sans and

1330
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,599
hackingtutorials.org

1331
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,160
have some different cheat sheets and

1332
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,319
tutorials on different hacking

1333
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:03,119
techniques and tools oh wise as we kind

1334
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:04,560
of mentioned earlier

1335
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,800
they have like the oauth top 10 the os

1336
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,400
testing guide

1337
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,839
and uh wasps app different open source

1338
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:14,079
hacking tools that you can use hack the

1339
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:16,000
box and try hack me

1340
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,520
our different vulnerable systems and

1341
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,839
networks that you can practice on

1342
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:23,760
uh hack me has been more education but

1343
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,200
hack the box is starting to add more

1344
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,880
educational stuff to theirs

1345
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,400
and expand playing off the example of

1407
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,760

1408
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,520
educational experience listed on your

1409
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,640

professional experience

1415
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,560
you still have it on your resume and

1416
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,240

that you know you do have some

1418
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,079

management

1431

worked in that area

1433
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,960
or they've kind of gotten rusty but they

i do have some questions okay

1463
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,079
uh your organization hacking is not a

1464
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:26,880
crime

1465
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,160
do you guys defend hackers yes well we

1466
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:30,800
don't really

1467
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,400
what i'll say they don't really go out

1468
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,000
and provide legal protection

1469
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,040
but what they do is this is this this

1470
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,480
the story of this organization really

1471
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,640
deserves a little more explanation

1472
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,760
because brian mcinich uh he runs

1473
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,760
north texas cyber security group he had

1474
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,800
this idea

1475
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,960
before defcon in 2018 to start this

1476
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,200
group he was a skateboarder so that

1477
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,359
sticker he had the hacking's not a crime

1478
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:56,319
design was from skating's not a crime

1479
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,319
and so he had this idea to socialize the

1480
00:48:58,319 --> 00:48:59,760
hacking is not a crime

1481
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,000
but chloe miss doggie partnered up with

1482
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,240

1483
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,040

you you know because you're doing this

1532
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,480
pen testing right so

1533
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,240
there's legal ramifications what's in

1534
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,760
scope what's other scope have you ever

1535
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,280
had an issue where you've had to deal

1536
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,880
with it you've got legal ramifications

1537
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:55,440
like

1538
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,680
something maybe you had to go back and

1539
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,720
maybe there was a little bit

1540
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:09,839
misunderstanding how did you work it out

1541
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:15,839

uh we can ask um phillip to

1558
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,280
uh to send us a copy of the

1559
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,119
powerpoint i'm sure he probably has it

1560
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:48,319
somewhere but if not

1561
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:51,839
we will make sure to share it uh

1562
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,599
this um this presentation

1563
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:58,839
is going to be posted at the pacific

1564
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:02,000
hackers uh youtube channel

1565
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
and uh hopefully uh i will be able to

1566
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,400
get the these slides as well this was

1567
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,359
an amazing way of the year can you hear

1568
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:10,640
can you hear me now

1569
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,319
yeah somehow somehow my audio got

1570
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:16,640
screwed up and started using trying to

1571
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,520
use my camera instead of uh

1572
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,480
yeah so uh to go back to the the the

1573
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,920
hacker protection

1574
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,319
so uh disclose io is a good place for

1575
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:28,800
information out there on hackers rights

1576
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,440
but uh for me most of my career has been

1577
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,440
pen testing so i really didn't run into

1578
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,440
things like that but make sure you're

1579
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,720
part of like a bug

1580
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,280
bounty program and look for bug bounties

1581
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,000
that promote

1582
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,760
safe harbor so they perform give you

1583
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,119
some kind of protection

1584
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,720
against those so going through different

1585
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,160
bug bounty programs

1586
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,319
is a good way to get protection and then

1587
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:50,079
just like going out to disclose i o they

1588
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:51,520
have a lot of information on

1589
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,520
on hackers rights and and protecting

1590
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,559
yourself

1591
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,359
and so yeah also i will share this uh

1592
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,200
this presentation afterwards i can send

1593
00:53:59,200 --> 00:53:59,760
out a

1594
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,480
pdf so sorry about the audio issues but

1595
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,359
i'm

1596
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:05,599
happy to answer more questions now since

1597
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:07,920
it's working again

1598
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,920
yeah don't worry yeah thank you

1599
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,520
uh i have another question what's your

1600
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:17,359
opinion on responsible disclosure

1601
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,440
yeah i think that's that's good i think

1602
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,800
it's that uh responsible disclosure that

1603
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,240
you should but the one thing you need to

1604
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,800
be careful and if you're testing

1605
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,400
anything make sure that they have a bug

1606
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,839
bounty or something because there's

1607
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:31,200
actually uh

1608
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,480
kevin from uh he used to set up all the

1609
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,200
the game the gaming devices the the

1610
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,559
arcade games at

1611
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:41,760
derbycon he did a a a test

1612
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:45,280
on dji's uh drone

1613
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,680
and they had a pen test they had a uh

1614
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,280
bug bounty program and they came back

1615
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,400
and tried to

1616
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,880
to swim because he found bug bounties so

1617
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,880
really be careful go through

1618
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,280
you know use look at disclose i o make

1619
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,720
sure there's bug bounty programs

1620
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,240
sometimes it's better to go through

1621
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,000
something established

1622
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,799
like butt crowd or hacker one and then

1623
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:06,160
also look at some of the established

1624
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:06,960
companies like

1625
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,599
apple is great with their bug bounties

1626
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:10,720
uh

1627
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,119
hemsec and some other people from the

1628
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:13,760
the uh

1629
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,319
bug bounty community recently did they

1630
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,160
found some bugs on apple's platform and

1631
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,599
they made like a half a million dollars

1632
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:20,000
between

1633
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,079
like five of them but make sure you're

1634
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:24,000
using companies that are really

1635
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,520
uh advocating bug bounties and be

1636
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,720
careful make sure you're staying in

1637
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,200
scope

1638
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,359
don't go out trying to hack into things

1639
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:32,240
and then

1640
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,760
come back and say i found a bug so you

1641
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,920
know just be careful what you're doing

1642
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,599
and like i said work through work

1643
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:39,440
through bug bounty programs and

1644
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,280
and just kind of understand what's going

1645
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,960
on understand your rights and

1646
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:47,200
what to do to to stay out of trouble

1647
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:52,160
great here's somebody asking if you have

1648
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,599
if you're planning to conduct more

1649
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,000
session teaching techniques or case

1650
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:56,640
studies

1651
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,640
so i'm assuming that this is probably a

1652
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:59,760
person who wants to know

1653
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,079
what your work is that so go ahead and

1654
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,799
tell us yeah as far as t as far as

1655
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:08,319
teaching go i teach at a community

1656
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:10,079
college and my courses are

1657
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:11,839
available online i teach at dallas

1658
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:13,839
college but also

1659
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:17,119
uh i teach workshops so i teach free

1660
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:19,520
workshops at the different conferences

1661
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:20,720
uh

1662
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,599
especially a lot at the texas cyber

1663
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:25,599
summit and grey hat and those sort of

1664
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,640
things so i'm

1665
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,559
i'm doing workshops all the time and

1666
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:29,839
i'll probably end up doing something

1667
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:31,520
before the years out

1668
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,200
it's probably part of a fundraiser for

1669
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,440
innocent lives foundation

1670
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,799
but as far as education for me uh

1671
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:40,720
this year i've tried to learn more about

1672
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,640
red teaming because i was in a specific

1673
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,319
red team role for a while

1674
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:46,319
but career-wise i've pivoted more

1675
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,160
recently into more

1676
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,640
education because at 0.3 we create

1677
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,640
curriculum for the us military

1678
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,400
and so my pen testing is more been on

1679
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,880
the side now to keep my skills up

1680
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,319
great i was going to ask you about

1681
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:02,319
innocent lives are you guys like the

1682
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:05,279
delivery fund

1683
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,640
yes uh innocent lives is is they

1684
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:12,000
protect they they do fundraisers to

1685
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,520
get raise money because it does take

1686
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,119
money to

1687
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:17,119
to run the organization and they cost so

1688
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:19,520
much to investigate and turn this over

1689
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,040
to law enforcement

1690
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,559
but they they if you're interested in

1691
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:24,240
volunteering they not only need money

1692
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,000
sometimes they need volunteers that are

1693
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,200
good ocean

1694
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,760
to help unmask these child predators so

1695
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,280
they work with law enforcement they

1696
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:31,680
collect

1697
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,000
information on these child predators and

1698
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,119
give that over to law enforcement

1699
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:36,799
because not always law enforcement

1700
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:38,960
is experienced with the cyber side of

1701
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,200
things and professionals in the industry

1702
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:41,920
are able to

1703
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:46,079
to help out that's great if you actually

1704
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:48,000

1705
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:48,240

1711
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,079
so that organization how do you like if

1712
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:05,520
you wanted to get involved

1713
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,079
in that do you guys have like a training

1714
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:09,359
or is it like a

1715
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:12,240
some type of how do you how do you uh

1716
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,839
basically select the people

1717
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:16,319
or can they volunteer how does it work

1718
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:18,319
yeah you can volunteer they'll do like a

1719
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:19,839
background check on you and i think they

1720
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:21,359
may provide

1721
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:22,720
some sort of training if you get

1722
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,440
selected so someone that has like an i.t

1723
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,119
or technical background will get in some

1724
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:27,839
people that

1725
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:29,760
are not in it but are interested will do

1726
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,880
that so really

1727
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,480
where you train for that is look for

1728
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:35,119
some some of the ocean related courses

1729
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:39,040
elite davis uh she does a lot of

1730
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:42,079
a lot of uh talks about

1731
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:44,079
uh elite dennis i mean i'm sorry she

1732
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:46,000
does a lot of ultimate courses

1733
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,559
and uh so does joe joe uh

1734
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:53,680
show cprojo on on twitter

1735
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,119
there's some really cheap ones and some

1736
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:56,880
people do some free osen courses so

1737
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,000
learning ocean

1738
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,680
trace labs does some of that too they do

1739
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,599
the people finders ctfs

1740
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:03,920
so going through some of those trainings

1741
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,280
like that will help because they use a

1742
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,880
lot of the people finding

1743
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,960
techniques to track down the bad guys

1744
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,880
but you just apply through there

1745
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,400
they'll do like a background check and

1746
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,160
then they bring you on as a volunteer

1747
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,480
they stay pretty busy but don't let that

1748
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,920
discourage you sometimes it takes a

1749
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,200
while to get in

1750
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,040
but a lot of people that work as pen

1751
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,799
testers red teamers

1752
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:24,400
and people in ocean other areas of

1753
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,760
security and i t work as volunteers

1754
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:31,119
hey whenever you need volunteers

1755
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:32,799
we have a lot of people that would like

1756
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:34,400
to volunteer um

1757
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,559
we actually talk to some other

1758
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:37,599
organizations

1759
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,400
the problem sometimes is the um the

1760
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,839
bureaucracy involved

1761
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:44,079
and then being able to to be certified

1762
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:45,280
to help you

1763
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,559
but but we definitely are open

1764
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:50,240

uh we'll see what we can do sure i'll

1768
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:57,200
get

1769
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:00,559
some information out to you any other

1770
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:01,280
question

1771
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,760
yeah i have a question for phillip uh so

1772
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:04,559
we you

1773
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:07,040
mentioned about the you know as part of

1774
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:10,799
the certifications entry level ceh

1775
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:13,680
what is your take on ceh is it you know

1776
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:14,000
for

1777
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,480
for many years he he has really had a

1778
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,839
bad reputation

1779
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:20,720
and you know people when they come to us

1780
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:20,960
and

1781
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,440
and and they they mention ch it's like

1782
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,839
no don't don't don't go there but then

1783
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:28,240
i know they have changed the curriculum

1784
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:29,359
throughout the years

1785
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:32,960
okay so what's your your take on that

1786
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,640
my take on it is it's it's a

1787
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,319
certification that's that's an

1788
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:37,040
entry-level

1789
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:40,240
certification and it's recognized you hr

1790
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,240
understands it some managers that's like

1791
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,440
one of the first

1792
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,359
pin testing certifications so they'll

1793
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:47,280
use it i mean it's a credential

1794
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,319
to get your foot in the door honestly if

1795
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:51,440
you're going to go if

1796
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,559
you know you're able to you know

1797
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:56,559
put in the effort and and learn

1798
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:58,000
something i would

1799
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,760
i would do like the elearn security

1800
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,520
courses like an entry-level

1801
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,920
certification there is their junior pen

1802
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,200
testing cert

1803
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,680
i would do that instead of the oscp it's

1804
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:08,720
got a lot of respect

1805
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,079
people that are pen testers and

1806
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:12,160
defensive security community laugh at

1807
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,200
the pen test

1808
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,640
the ceh i have a hard time i actually

1809
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,880
spoke at hacker halton this year

1810
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,640
that was provided by the ec council

1811
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,559
and i've kind of sometimes not always

1812
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:26,160
been the biggest fan so i have to be

1813
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,599
careful because being

1814
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:29,680
in the industry you know some of us pet

1815
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,440
testers someone say yeah i've got a ch

1816
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:32,000
we say

1817
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,040
oh cute that's cute but um

1818
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,920
it's it's their curriculum i think is

1819
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,839
improving and they've got like a master

1820
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:41,040
ceh now

1821
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:42,160
then i think you actually have to do

1822
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,480
some technical stuff but

1823
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,319
i mean it's not nothing none of those

1824
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:47,839
really compared to like

1825
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:50,640
the oscp the offensive security stuff or

1826
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,400
even elearning security e-learning

1827
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,200
security

1828
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,680
you have to perform a pen test offensive

1829
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:56,880
security you actually have to hack

1830
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,000
targets

1831
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,680
sans you don't have to hack anything but

1832
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,280
it's a tough open

1833
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:04,480
book exam so people that are hiring pen

1834
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,559
testers they're really looking for

1835
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:09,280
the sans and the offensive security

1836
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,319
certs

1837
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:13,359
so ceh might get your foot in the door

1838
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:14,960
and i've seen some consulting companies

1839
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,720
look for ch because that's either

1840
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:17,839
they're doing business with the

1841
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:21,359
government or something like that but

1842
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:23,039
but that's that's my opinion and then as

1843
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,960
far as trying to get the certification

1844
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,119
it's not a cheap certification and

1845
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:28,000
they're really

1846
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,880
weird about experience or where you take

1847
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,559
the course and how much the

1848
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:34,319
the certification cost you can actually

1849
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:37,920
do the pentest plus for less money

1850
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,520
what is your opinion of the ventus plus

1851
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,039
i thought it was pretty good

1852
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:42,960
yeah it's a good one penta plus is is

1853
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,200
more entry level it's not a hands-on but

1854
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,839
comptia has some good certifications and

1855
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:49,280
that's part of the reason i added the

1856
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,280
pen test plus curriculum to my courts

1857
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,319
that way students could get a

1858
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:54,640
certification comptia

1859
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:55,920
all their courses you know like their

1860
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,160
security plus cysa plus

1861
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,400
and casp they have some sort of

1862
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,000
offensive security element in there

1863
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,839
so it all builds on each other so it's

1864
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:05,599
really good in methodology

1865
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:07,200
so it's a it's a good one to start out

1866
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,200
with so i don't know really how well

1867
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,319
it's helping people get

1868
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:13,599
hired but it's it's good curriculum and

1869
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:14,880
you'll learn from it i really like the

1870
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,079
methodology

1871
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:19,760
heavy curriculum of the pen test plus

1872
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,359
somebody just wrote in the chat that

1873
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:24,000
pentaspots is now dod approved

1874
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,119
oh good awesome yeah and there's another

1875
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:28,720
question from jack

1876
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,680
for their resources resources listed do

1877
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:35,200
you recommend going through all of them

1878
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:37,599
not necessarily all of them it depends

1879
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:38,559
on what you're on the resources it

1880
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:40,000
depends on what your focus

1881
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,039
is if you're wanting to be you know web

1882
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:44,000
app pen tester

1883
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,359
then pen tester lab i would say the

1884
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:50,000
elearn security web app pen testing

1885
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,039
course

1886
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,880
that would be good to start with if

1887
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,160
you're wanting to be a network pen

1888
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,760
tester then your oscp

1889
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:58,000
or your elearn security pen testing

1890
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,839
search those are good to start with

1891
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:02,880
another thing too is is spend time at

1892
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:06,400
those labs like your your uh

1893
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,119
elearn security well not you learn

1894
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:10,799
security but you hack the box and try

1895
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:11,599
hack me

1896
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:13,119
i've seen people that have just hammered

1897
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:14,720
away it uh

1898
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,319
hacked the box and went and took the

1899
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:18,480
oscp after a little bit of study

1900
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,520
and passed it and another thing too

1901
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,760
don't rely just on certifications

1902
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,680
because once you get experience and

1903
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:28,480
you're in the field as a ped tester

1904
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,400
then certifications are not as important

1905
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,680
anymore you need to know what you're

1906
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,280
doing so know what you're doing

1907
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:36,160
to some people rely on certifications

1908
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,680
get through the certification process

1909
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,559
and don't

1910
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:42,559
maintain the skills and that hurts them

1911
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,920
any other questions

1912
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:53,359
seems like we'll have more questions

1913
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:55,280
