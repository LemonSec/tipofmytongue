92
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:35,920
about

93
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,799
um the container security uh i'm trying

94
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:39,680
to get

95
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,480
uh christina with some great presenter

96
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:42,959
to

97
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,040

98
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,959
there's other people on talking

99
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,239
so hopefully we'll have some great

100
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,560
content coming up but if you feel like

101
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,000
you have something together that you

102
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,879

00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,200
group

106
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,599

107
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,599

108
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,959

because i get complaints all the time

123
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,880
that

124
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,960
recruiters start reaching out to people

125
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,280
and then in journalism

126
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,639
you can speak to journalists all you

127
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,479

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,759
disclaimer that all my opinions are my

own and they do not represent the

175
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,639
opinions on my employer

176
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,319
although i have to make an exception

177
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,400
here i will have to mention

178
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,319
and it's not a sales pitch or anything

179
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,720
but i will demonstrate something with

180
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,759
uh one of my company's products but with

181
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,240
that

182
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,840
being said it's not a cell it's really a

183
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,599
sales pitch it's just

184
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,000
you know part of the presentation uh any

185
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,880
questions you know

186
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,160
contact me directly so who i am uh

187
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,400
as you probably know me already i mean

188
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,639
in pacific hackers

189
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,199
aka hacked the valley you know since it

190
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,160
was created

191
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,759
and uh you know i know and i've been in

192
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,080
the

193
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,039
industry for for a few years now and uh

194
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,360
uh

195
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,639
currently working for fortinet and i i

196
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,039
i love doing secure operations that's

197
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,240
kind of like my

198
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,360
um my expertise and

199
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,919
uh that's why i really wanted to give

200
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,199
this topic because

201
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,160
uh like rod said you know this was a

202
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,280
kind of

203
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,120
kind of like an unofficial request

204
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,880
someone proposed to

205
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,199
give a presentation on what are the

206
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,039
things that we can do at home

207
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,879
um you know to to protect ourselves

208
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,759
and um so that's why i picked this topic

209
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,039
so i'm gonna show you

210
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,319
different technologies uh today that

211
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,039
is gonna help you to to secure your home

212
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,479
from the cheapest to

213
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,639
the expensive one but you know and and

214
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,240
then at the end you will take your

215
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,440
you know um you you choose which one to

216
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,479
take so

217
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,160
with that uh the agenda for today and

218
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,080
we're gonna discuss defensive that

219
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,360
um we're going to compare the

220
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,759
technologies and lastly i'm going to

221
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,879
do a demo so why defense in that

222
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,280
so this is the reason for the title uh

223
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,800
securing the edge

224
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,680
so as you can see just from the uh the

225
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,960
firewall here

226
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,160
uh firewalls are always in the edge

227
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,080
now i have to say from a modern security

228
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,440
operations perspective firewalls is not

229
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,559
the only thing that needs to be you know

230
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,360
that was kind of like late 90s you know

231
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,040
early 2000s

232
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,080
um you know way of preventing attacks

233
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,880
uh but nowadays you know attackers are

234
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,080
using different

235
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,120
uh things you know so that's why um in a

236
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,000
defense

237
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,399
in that perspective you have to have all

238
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,200
the things that

239
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,640
at one point i mentioned you have to

240
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,959
have a firewall and that's on the edge

241
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,600
you have a you need to have an ips ids

242
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,800
system and then

243
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,240
you know authentication um you know

244
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,160
endpoint detection and response tools

245
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,279
antivirus

246
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,000
post detection all those things and and

247
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,399
again

248
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,480
uh this is a so since at home

249
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,640
i'm thinking you know um regular people

250
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,120
will not have like a web server or will

251
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,760
not have

252
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,680
any of that you know sometimes that's

253
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,160
why you know we get our modem and then

254
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,200
we get one of those

255
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,000
like linksys or you know any of those

256
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,800
routers but

257
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,200
that's not really you know a protection

258
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,080
however

259
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,160
again attackers are looking for more

260
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,440
attractive um

261
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,760
targets and and your home probably will

262
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,800
not be

263
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,920
however if you do have some servers then

264
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,080
you probably will need something else

265
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,560
um as a secure professionals we want to

266
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,519
make sure that

267
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,240
whatever we're securing we start from

268
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:58,959
from

269
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,959
you know from our house and making sure

270
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,440
our families have the best protection

271
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,120
whether it's an antivirus

272
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,320
whether it is a two-factor

273
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,399
authentication whether you know

274
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,560
you know and now even having an option

275
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,800
of having a firewall

276
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
on your home you know that is gonna

277
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,880
block any network attacks okay

278
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,920
so this is why i choose defend um um

279
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,760
securing the edge because we're gonna be

280
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,920
talking about firewalls

281
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,200
um so what are firewalls so basically a

282
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,000
firewall

283
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
and i don't really have to explain it

284
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,920
much you probably know what a firewall

285
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,279
is but basically

286
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,839
it's just you know the uh uh

287
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,920
an appliance that is gonna uh block uh

288
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,519
um connections based on rules

289
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,720
so you can allow ping you can allow

290
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,240
ssh you can allow http https

291
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,399
you know get into your house or you

292
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,279
cannot

293
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,800
um so let's say that you are at home

294
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,279
and this is very common they don't put

295
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,360
it this way but

296
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,360
what it's basically mean like on a

297
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,760
regular uh home appliance like a

298
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,320
linksys router they are poor forwarding

299
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,360
sometimes

300
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,000
if you have like um i don't know like a

301
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,240
plex server or something along the line

302
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,920
it will say you have to modify these

303
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,160
servers in order to talk to the outside

304
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,079
that's basically this kind of like the

305
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,440
same concept in

306
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,120
in a firewall when you're creating the

307
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,560
rules um

308
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,880
so that's basically it uh you're just

309
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,839
creating a rule

310
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,279
uh that is going to either block the

311
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,279
connection or not but

312
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,839
again that's late 90s you know early

313
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:36,720
2000s

314
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,760
uh you know not so much now

315
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,440
we're gonna be talking about next

316
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,120
generation fireworks

317
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,519
and why mention that is because next

318
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,519
generation firewalls is

319
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,760
all in one appliance you have a proxy

320
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,639
server

321
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,320
built in you have a uh um you know

322
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,519
application uh visibility and control

323
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,040
malware protection it's able to ssl and

324
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,320
uh the decrypt ssl

325
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,200
communications um you know and and it

326
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,240
has like uh

327
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,800
its own uh website blocker and stuff

328
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,680
like that

329
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,320
now with that being said you know

330
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,519
everybody

331
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,639
probably in in the in the room here will

332
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,680
say well

333
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,160
do i really need that at home but then

334
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,160
the answer the answer will be depends

335
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,760
depends what you have at home and you

336
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,680
why you have to secure and that's

337
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,680
basically the concept when you are

338
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,480
purchasing uh equipment for your

339
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,440
enterprises

340
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,959
obviously i'm just going to focus right

341
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,880
now on a home but then

342
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,560
this is this is just the same general

343
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,680
concept that is going to apply

344
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,880
everywhere else

345
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,160
so um buy what you need in order to to

346
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,000
secure your environment if your

347
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,200
environment at home

348
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,240
it's um you know you need so you have

349
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,959
server used to

350
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,399
you know stuff like that then you need

351
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,320
proxies then you need firewalls then you

352
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:54,959
need

353
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,600
ids ips you need stuff like that just to

354
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,079
have

355
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,680
visibility on your network so with that

356
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,760
i'm gonna give you the options that you

357
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,720
have and

358
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,959
uh also call it contenders because we're

359
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,160
gonna

360
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,680
i'm gonna guide you through some of

361
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,279
these um

362
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,440
technologies and at the end we're gonna

363
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,720
choose a winner

364
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,240
so as you can see on this picture

365
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,160
commercial products are kind of like

366
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,440
what's on top

367
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,120
and open source is pretty much an

368
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,560
airplane so

369
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,160
what once you get the uh um

370
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,720
access uh whether it's let's say on a

371
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,800
phone if you wrote your phone

372
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,600
uh you you enable capabilities that you

373
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,959
didn't have before

374
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,000
if you are um you know

375
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,279
in this case if we install a new

376
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,320
um firmware on your uh

377
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,120
home device that is just pretend to lose

378
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,240
basic stuff

379
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,680
now we're going to be able to make the

380
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,600
capability and stuff like that

381
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
but just remember with open source and i

382
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,000
think we talked about this before

383
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,440
open source is it's very nice but it's

384
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,760
by any means it's not easy uh you really

385
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,360
have to know what you're doing

386
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,320
in order to to to apply the concept

387
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,680
otherwise you're just gonna be

388
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,639
unsecured as you know everybody else so

389
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,360
with this

390
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,600
um you have three options basically you

391
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,880
have the option

392
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,839
of being very cheap almost free and with

393
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:20,639
that because

394
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,440
um again you can turn on your linksys

395
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,399
device your

396
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,680
asus your netgear

397
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,680
into a very sophisticated device where

398
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,920
you're going to be able to have

399
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,680
not pretty much almost like a

400
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,360
next-generation firewall

401
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,720
but very close um then we're going to

402
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,120
have the semi-cheap and that's basically

403
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,360
installing whether it's virtualized or

404
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,320
whether it is

405
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,680
on an actual uh box we're gonna do uh we

406
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,199
can install tfsense

407
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,560
or open uh opensense and then expensive

408
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,680
then you can buy an

409
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,480
actual uh commercial product such as a

410
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
fortinet firewall palo alto firewall

411
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,519
checkpoint

412
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,639
um so with that i'm gonna continue with

413
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,279
uh what's ddwrt i'm not gonna read

414
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:07,680
through

415
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,920
what's in here but i'm just gonna tell

416
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,839
you from experience because i i deal

417
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:12,880
with these

418
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,800
systems before ddw rt is one of my

419
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,320
favorites and the reason why it's

420
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,199
one of my favorites is because it has a

421
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,040
tons of support

422
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,480
for different routers comparing to the

423
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:26,959
other

424
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,920
contenders um pretty much all of them

425
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,279
have the same features

426
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,680
but also another thing is has it's huge

427
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,480
on uh

428
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,360
community contribution so if something's

429
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,560
wrong or

430
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,720
you know doesn't make sense you can join

431
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,000
um uh

432
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,240
groups in on facebook where you know

433
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,440
they they

434
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,680
put uh questions and people respond to

435
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,360
it and it's very helpful

436
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,560
a lot of people are you know geeks

437
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,600
are running uh the wrt in

438
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,079
at home for different purposes some of

439
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,680
them have it at the edge

440
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,680
some others they use it as a wireless

441
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,720
repeater or

442
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,800
or wireless access point or whatever the

443
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,839
case is

444
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,199
um but again uh it's an open source

445
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:09,839
product it's

446
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,639
firmware that is open source and and one

447
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,519
of the weaknesses

448
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,560
is if you're not you're new to this

449
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,480
one thing um you can break your device

450
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,800
which means that you're if you don't

451
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,560
know how to do this

452
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,120
you you will break your system and what

453
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,079
i will suggest

454
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,519
and just you know is read

455
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,920
all the documentation before even

456
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,639
applying

457
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,440
something because then at least you know

458
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,480
what troubleshooting

459
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,839
steps you can do absolute words

460
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,959
and then you know obviously with open

461
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,519
source not everything is updated

462
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,800
you know right away so you have to find

463
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,440
um you know until the uh the the

464
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,399
manufacturer

465
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,959
sends an update and then the the wrt

466
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:57,759
people

467
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,920
you know makes a change and stuff like

468
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,959
that uh next to it is tomato

469
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,319
and tomato again is just basically um

470
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,039
the same as the wrt um i like their

471
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:09,919
interface

472
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,679
i think they're very they have a very

473
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,280
clean interface

474
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,959
um but again one of the weaknesses

475
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,039
is they have a small community not

476
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,720
everybody uses that

477
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,919
um and and also the the support for

478
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,199
routers are not

479
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,240
um it's not a lot

480
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,440
so you know that's pros and cons of it

481
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,080
lastly open wrt open wrt

482
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,919
actually was the precursor of ddwrt

483
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,280
now just like any early linux

484
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,640
distributions

485
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,360
they don't look good um they look you

486
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:47,760
know

487
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,039
pretty basic um not fancy colors no any

488
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,080
of that

489
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,039
but just like any linux distribution you

490
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,400
can make uh

491
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,160
anything out of it you know uh again

492
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,799
some of the the weaknesses here is uh

493
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,559
it's not as user friendly

494
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,880
uh you need to spend a lot of time just

495
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,240
to get that going

496
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,559
versus the others they're actually you

497
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,440
know they go

498
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,320
it's easy to handle so you know and also

499
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,360
they don't support

500
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,520
they only support few routers now i will

501
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,720
have to say this

502
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,280
because i know someone's going to ask

503
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,400
open wrt

504
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,760
you can actually sell open wrt uh

505
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,039
on a raspberry pi and you can have your

506
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:29,919
portable

507
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,880
firewall you know uh every time you

508
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,280
travel

509
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,120
well not right now but when you start

510
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,200
traveling again you can actually

511
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,640
have your um you know on a firewall on a

512
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,679
raspberry pi versus ddwrt

513
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,120
and tomato they do not have the uh

514
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,760
the firmware cannot be run on a

515
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,080
raspberry pi even with the new raspberry

516
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,559
pi 4 with eight gigabytes and all that

517
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,559
they still have not have a support for

518
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,480
that not that i am aware of

519
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,600
uh if you know and and you think we can

520
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,480
do it then

521
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,640
uh please let me know because i have not

522
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,080
read about it so

523
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,120
um so again uh these are the three

524
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,080
contenders

525
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,120
when it comes to um uh linux

526
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,600
firmwares um and i will show you in a

527
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,160
second

528
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,720
you know on the demo how how they look

529
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,160
um

530
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,799
now let's talk about the other options

531
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,240
pf sense

532
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,640
pf sense again it was it's based on free

533
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,600
vsd

534
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,720
um and it was a very good

535
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,760
project um eventually was bought by

536
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,000
netgate and that's when they start

537
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,840
having like a full-time support more

538
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,280
commercial but still

539
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,480
the the software itself it's it's

540
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,799
it's free so you can actually download

541
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:45,679
it and

542
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,960
uh and try it again i'll show you a demo

543
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,919
but this one what i like about sense is

544
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,360
you can actually

545
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,679
make this as a next-generation firewall

546
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:56,960
now

547
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,280
uh why at the beginning say it's

548
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,120
semi-free or semi-cheap

549
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,720
it's because um if you have a um

550
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,159
you know a spare computer with

551
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,400
you know all computers that you want to

552
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,000
you reuse again

553
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,679
you can install um you know pf sense

554
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,280
and now basically you don't have to

555
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,799
spend any other money on

556
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,440
firewalls or anything like that um

557
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,400
however

558
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,360
if you don't then you have to buy a

559
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,159
firewall

560
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,440
um and actually well i'll i'll show that

561
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,039
in a second

562
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,080
you can buy a bare bone and and go from

563
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,880
there

564
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,000
uh open sense is uh the

565
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,600
contender for um for pf sense

566
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,120
and and the thing about this is like it

567
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,320
actually has a better

568
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,919
way than pf sense but um

569
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,840
basically what they're trying to do is

570
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,240
copy what pfsense is

571
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,640
actually opensense was because it was

572
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,720
the uh

573
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,480
deal with pfsense code

574
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,520
they end up changing 90 of the code and

575
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,760
but still the code might be different

576
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,159
but the features are the same so

577
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,799
you know figure out what's going on

578
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,000
there

579
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,640
so for for me the winners and and i'm

580
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,159
not gonna go through the 4k

581
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,600
because i'm actually going to show it in

582
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,760
the demo here here are my winners

583
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,280
um the cheapest option will be going for

584
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,559
a ddwrt

585
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,240
because it has more support for

586
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,159
different routers um

587
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,799
uh semi-cheap obviously i will choose

588
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,400
pfsense because you can

589
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,919
you can do more stuff with pf sense

590
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,600
there is actually more support for

591
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,799
from bf sense and if you actually get a

592
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,919
firewall um it's actually very cheap

593
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:44,320
from

594
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,679
netgate you can actually get um 24 7

595
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:48,720
support from them

596
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,200
and um stuff like that and for the

597
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,039
expensive i choose fortigate because

598
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:53,679
that's

599
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,400
you know not because that's where i work

600
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:56,880
but

601
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,240
um in terms of uh uh uh firewall

602
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,400
products that i've been working on

603
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,520
i have to say that fortigate has

604
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,720
you know lead the way for a while um

605
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,200
almost to the point where they knocking

606
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,000
down paulo

607
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,919
and paulo i have a lot of respect for

608
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,240
them especially because

609
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,000
they they came up with the term next

610
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,360
generation firewall

611
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,640
after paolo came up with that term

612
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,039
then a lot of companies like checkpoint

613
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,159
fortinet

614
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,120
uh uni pairs and and all those they

615
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,440
start

616
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,679
coming up with their next generation but

617
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:32,640
for many years

618
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,120
uh palo was the only one doing a

619
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,760
straight

620
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,039
uh next generation firewall features uh

621
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,000
eventually fortigate fortinet catch up

622
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,960
and now

623
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,200
you know they're you know fighting

624
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,799
against each other

625
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,919
um so now i'm gonna go with the demo

626
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,039
so let me switch

627
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,880
here to this part so what i have here

628
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,080
is i have a netgear so

629
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,559
this is just a regular um i don't know

630
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,440
if you can see it

631
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,880
hopefully you can um

632
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,799
this is just a regular uh netgear device

633
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,200
um it has it was an old device from

634
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,720
2015.

635
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,360
um so i'm gonna take a look at the

636
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,320
actual

637
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,679
um features

638
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,039
so netgear just like linksys

639
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,320
and asus and others they're trying to

640
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,000
come up with features that

641
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,840
you know to make make it easy for users

642
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,960
to use

643
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,080
but again that's pretty much saying

644
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,159
that's kind of like the same comparison

645
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,360
as an apple device and an android device

646
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,640
where you know here you have options to

647
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,840
you know to basically the basic stuff

648
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,679
versus on an android you have

649
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,279
um you can do customization um

650
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,840
again this is just the the straight up

651
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,279
um

652
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,640
um you know gui from netgear

653
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,440
and again it doesn't look bad you know

654
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,279
it has some features that you know you

655
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,559
can use

656
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,679
stuff like that but then uh let me show

657
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,080
you here

658
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,440
and let me change cables marco do you

659
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,840
think you can

660
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,840
size

661
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,720
does it look better

662
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,480
a little better yeah okay cool all right

663
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,799
um people can take a picture and blow it

664
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,640
up

665
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,760
um so what i have here now is um

666
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,440
this is a cisco you know device

667
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,520
also kind of like old and i don't know

668
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,039
if you probably won't see it

669
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,600
better but let me take this out plug

670
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,440
this in

671
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,640
throw the other one away this one

672
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,919
um this one i actually flashed with uh

673
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:14,159
the

674
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,720
wrt and i'm going to show you in a

675
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,600
second how the

676
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,750
what will your team looks like um

677
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,120
[Music]

678
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:29,840
here let's see what my type is

679
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,320
this is the part where i was you know uh

680
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,760
hoping it doesn't crash because uh

681
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,159
that was the thing with the dwrt so

682
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,080
sometimes you have to like

683
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,840
uh sometimes it works sometimes it

684
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,039
doesn't uh

685
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,640
majority of the time it it doesn't work

686
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,360
if it doesn't work i'll try to do

687
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,880
something else but

688
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,039
hopefully it will work here you go um so

689
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,360
this is what ddwrt is

690
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,000
um if you start going through the setup

691
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,840
[Music]

692
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,840
um

693
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,880
um you know you have a lot of options

694
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,080
you have you can do

695
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,440
uh dynamic dns uh you can do advanced

696
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,159
routing

697
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,679
you can do a vlan you can create uh

698
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,559
your one port you know you can make it a

699
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,200
you know

700
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,600
uh you know get make it like a wireless

701
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,480
hotspot

702
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,559
where you're gonna get the connection uh

703
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:47,520
wirelessly

704
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,000
but you can make the other the the one

705
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,799
for a

706
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,480
lan port you know something along the

707
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,919
line um

708
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,320
you know you set up your vlan tags and

709
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,120
stuff like that

710
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,080
that actually gonna work with the other

711
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,880
um

712
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,679
whatever the protocol is i don't recall

713
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,480
you don't want that

714
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,080
11 e x or something i i might be wrong

715
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,279
with that sorry

716
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,919
but basically it's it's a protocol that

717
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,279
you know

718
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,640
networking manufacturers use for

719
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,739
[Music]

720
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,200
i mean you can create bridges you can

721
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,440
create a bunch of stuff on the wireless

722
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,000
side

723
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,039
i remember uh phil uh

724
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,760
you know he gave his presentation about

725
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,080
securing your wireless connection

726
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,840
he basically said well having a

727
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,679
pre-shared key you know

728
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,159
no that's not gonna do anything you

729
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,039
really wanna

730
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,200
have something secure then create a

731
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,240
radio server

732
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,080
and use it for that well here you have

733
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,000
the option to do that you

734
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,880
have you know you just have to enable it

735
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,480
um

736
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,080
there's obviously set up that you have

737
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,080
to do but that's

738
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,360
one way to do it you know

739
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,440
you can do enterprise uh you know wpa to

740
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,039
enterprise you can do radios

741
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,240
um you can eventually like

742
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,320
set up your own hot spot if you want to

743
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,399
make it like a hot spot like a captive

744
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:25,440
coral

745
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,399
um you can do a nas because it has a usb

746
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,440
on the back

747
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,600
uh using samba stuff like that or you

748
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,799
can just create your own

749
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,840
vpn server uh you can actually uh one of

750
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,120
the things i like about this

751
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,679
is you can create your own vpn

752
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:40,399
connection

753
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,880
so you set up this one as a server and

754
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,240
when you are

755
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,480
you know you know somewhere

756
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,640
you know traveling you can actually come

757
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,240
connect to your home network

758
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,200
and uh with that you know uh with vpn

759
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,520
and it's gonna be a point to point vpn

760
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,919
you can service set it as a vpn client

761
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,039
or you can set it as a

762
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,080
uh as a server so those are the neat

763
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,360
features that it has

764
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,120
on the security side of things you know

765
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,120
it has some you know

766
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,520
um things that you can enable here but

767
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,039
that's not really the uh

768
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:18,000
um you know where this happens

769
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,720
where actually everything happens is on

770
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,760
the command line

771
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,360
um and you will see here that it has

772
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,559
a command uh uh you know

773
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,000
uh options here that you can actually do

774
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,120
uh you know stuff like that this is all

775
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,520
so

776
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,200
that doesn't work anymore so even if you

777
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,440
try it doesn't work but what i did here

778
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,720
is i used to have

779
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,480
um uh what was a torque r vpn access a

780
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,600
long time ago

781
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,650
and i what i did is i create a vpn

782
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,360
[Music]

783
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,919
connection from this device to

784
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,039
their service because i wanted to access

785
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,159
uh i wanted to have a full-time vpn

786
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,600
connection to a

787
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,880
server that has connection in mexico

788
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,200
and and you you wonder why you want to

789
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,360
do that well it's because you know

790
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,440
as you probably know there's some

791
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,960
netflix series that

792
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,360
you know that are not shown in the u.s

793
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,799
that are in mexico

794
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,279
and you know i wanted to see that or any

795
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,960
other content in mexico so that's the

796
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,559
reason why i created this

797
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,240
but this is one way to do it um

798
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,880
you have the option you know again this

799
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,440
is just

800
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,520
uh you can create your own policies here

801
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,600
you can create uh

802
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,799
you know jobs and stuff like that

803
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,159
not qa qos administration but again

804
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:42,880
that's not

805
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,679
the beauty of this the beauty is when

806
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:46,720
you actually

807
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,159
start going through the tutorials um

808
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,039
this is actually the tutorial for

809
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,799
actually setting up your firewall so if

810
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,480
you go to ddwrt or go to forum.wrt.com

811
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,320
go to the weekly section

812
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,480
and here it gives you a good explanation

813
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,320
on how to do all that

814
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,080
um one again one of the things i was

815
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,799
using it

816
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,039
uh so and that's the reason i have

817
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,399
multiple devices

818
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,600
um i have like like four of them

819
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,640
one was my vpn uh connection direct

820
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,440
connection the other one was a

821
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,640
vpn uh called i'm sorry

822
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,679
a wireless hub so you know

823
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,480
basically i i didn't have any near

824
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,080
connections i wanted to go

825
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,159
wire while i connect everything through

826
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,440
the

827
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,760
through there and work this is just a

828
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,919
basic tutorial but then also there is

829
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:40,399
you know

830
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,360
advanced tutorials um you know you want

831
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:43,679
to

832
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,960
block your um you know you're

833
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,240
at create like an ad blocker there's an

834
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,240
ad locker you can create you're using

835
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:52,880
you know

836
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,760
stuff like this it has a proxy server

837
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,720
you know it has

838
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,799
a bunch of stuff but it's really up to

839
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,880
you what you want to do out of it

840
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,720
um you know

841
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,720
again i can stress that enough um

842
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,760
but again uh this is how it looks on

843
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,440
a dpwrt um

844
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,880
and that's basically the option for this

845
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,240
and this is a broadcom

846
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,679
cheap uh chipset um

847
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,240
and actually this the ones i mentioned

848
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,159
uh open

849
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,200
open wrt edwrt and tomato

850
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,559
they are based for or they're uh

851
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:38,159
made for broadcast uh chipsets so

852
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,120
that's one thing i wanted to mention so

853
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,880
uh the other thing i wanted to

854
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,480
show you is ef sense so pf sense

855
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,679
like i said you can make your own uh

856
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,399
firewall uh next generation firewall

857
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:53,200
here is a

858
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,080
here's what it's from the just this is

859
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,519
an actual

860
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,200
um um

861
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,399
vm that i created and if you if i

862
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,440
actually click here

863
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,519
so let's say that you have a box um

864
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,760
this is what's gonna show on the box

865
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,960
nothing else

866
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,919
you actually have to connect to a you

867
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:16,720
know

868
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,600
browser in order to access the default

869
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,200
here there are still things that you can

870
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:21,679
do

871
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,279
um you can enable change the the factory

872
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:25,919
or

873
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,840
reset the factory default change the

874
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,279
other passwords

875
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,880
uh assign interfaces uh you know

876
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,760
enable secure shell you know stuff like

877
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,320
that but

878
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,640
actually if you want to start doing

879
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,519
other stuff

880
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,159
this is where you do it um so if you go

881
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:42,720
to the

882
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,840
uh packer manager here

883
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,240
here's the available packets that you'll

884
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,159
be able to install

885
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,440
in a pf sense uh again

886
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,799
you have uh h a proxy you have

887
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,480
uh nmap you have um

888
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,840
the end map you have an end top npe

889
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,239
openvp pf locker again if you want to

890
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,760
uh block your your

891
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,000
your ads you know at home you can do

892
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,918
that there's other ones here

893
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,399
so again the list goes on and off now

894
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:19,359
for that

895
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,280
again you can do it virtual or

896
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,960
let me show you here oops my camera

897
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,639
blew away my back

898
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:49,839
sorry about it give me just a second

899
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,320
i don't know who's on me but i can't i

900
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,040
can't hear your typing

901
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,440
oops all right

902
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,000
marco i'm just curious um is there

903
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
anything like groundbreaking new

904
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,119
in um um air walls these days or have

905
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,280
they kind of just really been the same

906
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,480
features well again the new thing is

907
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,320
next generation firewalls who has the

908
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,400
best generation firewalls and who can do

909
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,359
more

910
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:22,079
um that's basically where we at right

911
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:22,400
now

912
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,000
and actually i'm gonna show you once i

913
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,320
show the fully net version

914
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,040
um so this is a box i created actually

915
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,280
not created but i bought

916
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,800
and as you can see it just has basic um

917
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,800
stuff you have your two supports

918
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,320
um one for one one for uh lan

919
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,880
uh usbs um it has a serial port

920
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,520
and that's it um it has four gigabytes

921
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,320
of ram

922
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,320
and it has um um

923
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,560
64 gigabytes of hard drive space i mean

924
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,240
honestly only you need like

925
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,480
one gigabyte to run pf sends on your

926
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,920
computer uh or

927
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,200
you know device as as ram you know

928
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:07,760
obviously

929
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,359
the more ram the better because

930
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,880
depending on the processes that you're

931
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,760
running

932
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,440
you can you know that's where your

933
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,880
future is gonna be

934
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,640
okay um did i did i did that

935
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,799
answer the question uh diane

936
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,560
i'm good yeah um

937
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,560
so again uh the list goes on and on and

938
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,359
on

939
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,240
uh next contender will be a actual

940
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,240
foreign gate and let me show you what

941
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,280
a kind of like a small home device for

942
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:39,680
again

943
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,240
it looks alright

944
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,160
hey marco i think he can zoom in the

945
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,160
screen again it's i think still

946
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,200
shot a little small brother if you can

947
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,119
oh all right so this is what a fortigate

948
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,760
device is um this is a

949
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,280
40 gauge 60e and it has the

950
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,200
wireless capabilities actually yeah

951
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,760
so as you can see on the back uh the

952
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,440
neat features of this is like you have

953
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:15,920
your

954
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,320
i'm sorry if it's gonna look kind of

955
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,280
weird but

956
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,800
you have your one port you have your dns

957
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,599
dmc port and then you have one two three

958
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:26,400
four five six

959
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,599
plus its wireless um uh you have your

960
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,280
console port if you need to

961
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,480
you know put up um

962
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,079
you know through the console um

963
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,560
and that's pretty much it um this one

964
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,320
has for example one

965
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,960
one one and one two uh that's obviously

966
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,880
for high availability so

967
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,440
if something goes down uh well we can do

968
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,839
it from there

969
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,320
let me zoom in on this one

970
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,480
this is a next generation firewall by

971
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,160
default this is just a basic

972
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,280
uh uh you know setup

973
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,000
it only has switch controller vpn wi-fi

974
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,599
controller and all that

975
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,880
but technically you have proxy you have

976
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,599
intrusion

977
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,200
ips you have a web a web you have an

978
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,560
email field there so

979
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,880
you have an email server advanced

980
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,079
endpoint control

981
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,960
you have uh you're making cert you know

982
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,000
certificates

983
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,320
generating certificates or stuff like

984
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,320
that it's like a

985
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,440
certificate authority um domain ip

986
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,359
reputation so

987
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,920
the list goes on and on and on uh for

988
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,440
his sandbox is obviously

989
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,640
a sandbox malware sandbox and

990
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,640
it connects to the cloud so again i'm

991
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,640
not doing a sales pitch of how good

992
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,960
fortinet or ford gates are i'm just

993
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,680
telling you

994
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,960
what's in this one but in reality it is

995
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,760
the same thing

996
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,960
as what paulo and what

997
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,520
checkpoint and what the others are doing

998
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,320
the the thing

999
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,200
is is the race is who can make it better

1000
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,560
who can make

1001
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,960
things faster without impacting the

1002
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,920
machine

1003
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,760
i have to tell you and you can actually

1004
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,680
read that don't quote me on this

1005
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,320
not because i work for fortinet but one

1006
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:16,720
of the

1007
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,440
the reasons why 40 gates are leading

1008
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,079
against

1009
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,200
like palos for example is in terms for

1010
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,640
example um

1011
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,359
ssl decryption when they're doing that

1012
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:28,240
um

1013
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,880
it takes a lot of resources on a palo

1014
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,839
alto

1015
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,880
uh a box versus uh

1016
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,920
uh um a fortigate

1017
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,839
it doesn't do it doesn't take a lot of

1018
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:40,960
resources

1019
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,560
so again why and how they're doing

1020
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,000
things i don't know but that's

1021
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,119
one of the options they have

1022
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,300
it also has a pretty picture so

1023
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,599
[Music]

1024
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,079
right on the back you will see that you

1025
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,000
will have you know connections

1026
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,800
uh it will show you your graphs of how

1027
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,440
how

1028
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,560
um you know your internet connection is

1029
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,920
you know your resources uh if you have

1030
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,640
uh

1031
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,760
you know you're using https now

1032
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,640
here's another thing um that i i have to

1033
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,440
be honest

1034
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,760
and and this is where you have to be um

1035
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,880
you know um you have to decide what you

1036
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,240
want to do

1037
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:30,880
uh with having a commercial product

1038
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,880
sometimes you buy a subscription to a

1039
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,800
trade intelligence so for example

1040
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,400
40 40 and it has their fury guard

1041
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,200
uh security service and basically they

1042
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,119
are the ones who update the the latest

1043
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,319
antivirus the

1044
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:47,440
latest urls malicious urls my malicious

1045
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,520
ip addresses and stuff like that

1046
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,720
and um so and that comes

1047
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,000
with the box sometimes you have to pay

1048
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,280
a a fee but uh one of the things is that

1049
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,960
fortinet has a really cheap

1050
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,920
um subscription if you decide to do the

1051
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,319
same

1052
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:08,160
with a pf sense um yeah it will have

1053
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,000
that feature but you have to pay it

1054
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,800
elsewhere

1055
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,599
so uh just remember that having a

1056
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:14,480
firewall

1057
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,599
just by itself uh without

1058
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,680
having the latest updates or the latest

1059
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,640
uh you know

1060
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,560
uh trade intelligence updates

1061
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,800
it will be worthless because every day

1062
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,079
there's something new

1063
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,920
and that's what we have to do and these

1064
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,680
companies that's what they do

1065
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,560
they collect information and they you

1066
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,040
know

1067
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,440
basically provide it to their paying

1068
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,319
users

1069
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:41,040
um so then for this you have to get a

1070
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,720
subscription somewhere

1071
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,280
to get that type of report um it can be

1072
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,160
done

1073
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,200
but again you you're paying so

1074
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,920
when i said it was cheap then probably

1075
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,319
the

1076
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,480
the uh it's no longer cheap because then

1077
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,079
you still have to pay

1078
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,760
something um the uh

1079
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,200
the ddwrt will not have that feature

1080
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,560
there are some options and i don't

1081
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,880
remember which task

1082
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,240
you can block some

1083
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,440
malicious urls um

1084
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,400
but it's just giving you like a list

1085
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,319
imagine if you have to put

1086
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:21,760
every single i uh you know list or

1087
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,000
urls for all the uh the malicious

1088
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,359
uh urls out there it's gonna be like

1089
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:31,520
you know you're never it's gonna never

1090
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,040
gonna end so

1091
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,960
that's why buying a subscription is

1092
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,839
better um

1093
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,560
all right so with that let's

1094
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,880
let's talk about the advantages and the

1095
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,720
uh disadvantages so

1096
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,720
one of the advantages of using these

1097
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,000
three uh

1098
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,640
solutions are obviously they're scalable

1099
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,160
they're customizable

1100
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,560
um you can it can be uh tail or

1101
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,400
customized to your needs

1102
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,240
and and and you don't have to have like

1103
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,000
vendor locking so you don't have to pay

1104
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,680
a poll out you don't have to pay a

1105
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,560
foreign

1106
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,880
or anything at times there is a high

1107
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,720
quality software with this

1108
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,640
um but you know and and you can have a

1109
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,720
really good security but if it's set up

1110
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,920
correctly

1111
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,760
um well one of the disadvantages

1112
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,040
is uh even though these pfcents and

1113
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,480
ddwrp are

1114
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,000
kind of like security products um the

1115
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,280
the security is turned off by default so

1116
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,400
um it has actually they don't have a

1117
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,599
password when you

1118
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,079
use them the first time you have to

1119
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,319
enable like https in order to access

1120
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:42,880
them

1121
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,440
um you still have to buy the cti

1122
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,640
subscriptions

1123
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,720
uh they're not easy to set up um you

1124
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,920
need equipment

1125
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,760
regardless of how you're going to get

1126
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,520
the equipment is your choice

1127
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,280
uh for ddwrt i will say

1128
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,839
if you don't want to screw up your

1129
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:02,000
device that you currently have

1130
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,119
uh go online or actually well

1131
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:07,040
kind of hard because before i used to go

1132
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,040
to like the pound shops or

1133
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,319
or the thrift stores and there's always

1134
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:13,680
a section where they have

1135
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,800
these these devices and and

1136
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,720
that's what i used to do just got those

1137
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,640
devices for five dollars

1138
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,720
and you know obviously you don't know if

1139
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,000
they work or not but

1140
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,200
you know come home plug it in start

1141
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,560
working on them boom

1142
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,839
now i have a 600 600

1143
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,480
machine you know uh i only pay for five

1144
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,440
bucks for it

1145
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,280
um but then again it has a lot of bucks

1146
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,160
um the equipment depending where you get

1147
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,680
it's gonna be costly

1148
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,280
maintenance is always always gonna be

1149
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,720
costly and and

1150
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,119
and and this is where i said maintenance

1151
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,560
because it's your time

1152
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,680
same maintenance and training depending

1153
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,359
how much time you're putting into

1154
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,160
to to learn uh these technologies that's

1155
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:58,480
the

1156
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,520
the cost because uh maybe instead of

1157
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,880
going for

1158
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,920
you know somewhere well now you have to

1159
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,720
to sit down and learn how to you know

1160
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,960
set up these devices and stuff like that

1161
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,160
um so that's where the cost comes in

1162
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,240
uh not really like a monetary cost but

1163
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,680
it's more of you know

1164
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,880
of you um these are my references i'll

1165
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,560
i'll share that if you want them

1166
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:26,400
and i this was it

1167
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,040
it wasn't it wasn't like a long uh

1168
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,240
presentation

1169
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,520
but i wanted to you know um if there was

1170
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,119
something that you wanted to talk about

1171
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:35,520
it

1172
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,800
or uh you know i was

1173
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,800
you know i can i can answer any

1174
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,480
questions now so

1175
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,680
let me see hey marco this um

1176
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,599
that white fortinet box you have on your

1177
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,200
desk right now something like that hum

1178
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:49,839
or even

1179
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:51,839
that particular piece how much would it

1180
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:54,160
cost

1181
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,839
hey rob how much you pay for it

1182
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,160
i'll pay around seven to eight hundred

1183
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,680
dollars and that included

1184
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,839
one year of subscription what marco said

1185
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:09,520
is very important and this is a

1186
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,160
a cautionary tale for some of you if you

1187
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,040
think

1188
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,319
that you know the first um

1189
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,240
usually the first thought is oh let me

1190
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,640
go to ebay and buy it use

1191
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,720
well the problem with that is that when

1192
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,640
you check with the provider

1193
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,760
that serial number is probably register

1194
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,119
so they may choose or may choose not to

1195
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:33,119
sell you a license that happened to me

1196
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,119
with a bank device by the way they told

1197
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:37,280
me we're not going to sell you

1198
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,839
a service you need to buy a new one

1199
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:44,319
so i would say that the the the best way

1200
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,400
to go about this if you want to buy like

1201
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,079
a

1202
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,599
uh commercial brand i bought the uh the

1203
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:52,319
460e

1204
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,800
it's an amazing device yeah this is this

1205
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,000
one right here

1206
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,240
exactly and actually i can tell you also

1207
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,839
another personal

1208
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:03,839
tell uh the first night i install it i

1209
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:05,680
freaked out by seeing all the

1210
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,280
connections that i was getting

1211
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,119
uh i used to have a

1212
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,599
a nighthawk and i think that nighthawk

1213
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,520
was compromised in all honesty

1214
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,720
uh so once i started seeing all those

1215
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,720
weird connections from russia and other

1216
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,839
countries i

1217
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,040
i pretty much blocked them off and uh

1218
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:29,200
it's been better for me to be honest

1219
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,559
the throughput is one gigabyte one

1220
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:33,920
gigabit but

1221
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,720
most likely it will depend obviously of

1222
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,119
your

1223
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,760
or your last mile to call it a certain

1224
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,559
way from your

1225
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,720
from your house your apartment to the

1226
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,200
provider

1227
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:53,839
cool thank you thank you

1228
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,079
uh so um i'm just i guess i'm just going

1229
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:02,960
to read the questions

1230
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,240
oh so so phil asked about the uh the ef

1231
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:08,880
sense

1232
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,280
hardware is actually good it is it's

1233
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,119
actually not too bad and it's not too

1234
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:13,760
expensive

1235
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,920
um so if you look under products um

1236
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,119
you start with this very small one and

1237
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,640
uh also um

1238
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,720
lately they they have their own cloud

1239
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,200
version that you can install on aws so

1240
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,760
still if you're gonna host the stuff on

1241
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,800
aws

1242
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,960
google cloud and stuff like that you can

1243
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,160
actually

1244
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,960
put a pf sense and you have to pay a

1245
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,920
subscription

1246
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,640
this one obviously is a small device but

1247
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:43,520
um

1248
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:48,160
you know it really depends on

1249
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,880
on you know how much you want to spend

1250
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,720
uh if we go to um

1251
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,720
like amazon really quick and i think i

1252
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,079
have some

1253
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:58,720
um so like yeah let's say for example

1254
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,480
you can create your own box out of this

1255
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,920
this verbal device you know costs

1256
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,040
51 bucks uh but again it doesn't have

1257
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,800
anything to it so you have to buy

1258
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,680
the uh everything else you have to buy

1259
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,200
the motherboard the ram

1260
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:17,280
the whatever but if we do pf sense

1261
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,520
uh

1262
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:23,200
firewall mini pc or something then it

1263
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,880
starts giving you some of the stuff

1264
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:31,520
um 300 206 dollars

1265
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,400
um you know it really depends this one

1266
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,680
is just

1267
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,920
you know two hundred dollars lana one

1268
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,440
that's it i don't think it has anything

1269
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,160
else

1270
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,520
16 gigabytes of ram uh of hard drive

1271
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:47,200
two gigabytes of ram um

1272
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,280
yeah so let me see what are the

1273
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,680
questions

1274
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:56,400
uh what does uh 4k telemetry mean

1275
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,760
that's a good question i am i'm not a

1276
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,800
foreign foreigner guru uh

1277
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,480
but it's uh so you have to understand

1278
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,280
40k

1279
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,319
fortinet makes a lot of security

1280
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:11,839
products and that's what we call the

1281
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,680
fabric we have a sandbox

1282
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,680
we have you know the these devices are

1283
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:22,240
a they could also be a router

1284
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,440
so they have sd1 capabilities they have

1285
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,040
um you know um a lot of options that you

1286
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:29,359
can

1287
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,480
add and basically telemetry

1288
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,880
is you know how are they connected and

1289
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:35,839
stuff like that but

1290
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:38,079
again don't quote me on that i will i

1291
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,160
will definitely

1292
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:55,839
research more if you're interested

1293
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,079
okay i think that's that's hey

1294
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,559
any other questions you don't wanna type

1295
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:07,119
you can

1296
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:10,079
you can speak up

1297
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,520
well i i do the deal for amazon which i

1298
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,440

1300
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:22,800

1301
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,319

it gives you look it up uh look it up

1303
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,800

1304
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,880
um marco look up the uh the 460e

1305
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,960
and they they might see the the same

1306
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,640
deal i got

1307
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:42,559
uh the appliance itself

1308
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:46,960
is 60 i'm sorry it's um 487

1309
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,160
but right exactly but again a box

1310
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:50,880
without

1311
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,040
subscription is just another box on your

1312
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,880
environment right you have to pay the

1313
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,000
subscription

1314
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,599
um um can you can you

1315
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:01,920
do a contour plus so we so we can all

1316
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,599
see the subscriptions because

1317
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:05,680
they're enumerated there you go right

1318
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,200
here

1319
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,160
yeah that's the one i got which i think

1320
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,599
is a hundred the top

1321
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:16,839
right is that 24 7 no i didn't get that

1322
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:19,839
one

1323
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,240
i think i got the eight to five that's

1324
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,959
the one i got

1325
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,200
now um again not a sales pitch but if

1326
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,119
you get a device just a device

1327
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:34,640
it gives you um 15 days of uh

1328
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,240
everything for free so you can try it

1329
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,559
and if it doesn't work then you can

1330
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,000
actually return the device

1331
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,559
um and you don't have to pay for it but

1332
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:45,200
at least

1333
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,599
you're able to see what you know how

1334
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:50,800
does it work and stuff like that

1335
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,480
um the one i have at home

1336
00:52:54,480 --> 00:53:01,839
it's just a um

1337
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:15,839
yeah so this is the devices a bunch of

1338
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,160
this is the actual device and this is

1339
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,520
you know

1340
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:27,520
uh you know basically at home

1341
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,960
i have a very expensive product

1342
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,280
and and because i'm a foreign employee

1343
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,760
they give me the subscription for free

1344
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,200
but you know i i love the device because

1345
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,480
you can do a bunch of it um

1346
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,680
there's a lot you can do with it and

1347
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,720
and i do have servers and that's why i

1348
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,760
want to protect my stuff

1349
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,599
but again you have to really spend the

1350
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:55,280
time on learning everything

1351
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,520
and i'm not again i'm not a subject

1352
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,880
matter expert i

1353
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,079
i work for the company but i actually

1354
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:02,800
don't touch

1355
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,760
foreign products but i have to use

1356
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,040
foreign products so

1357
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,920
i have to have a familiarity but then

1358
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:10,800
when

1359
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,319
it comes to like you know asking uh

1360
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:16,160
you know questions and i i really like

1361
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,000
the actual people

1362
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,480
so the pants the pants are great too i

1363
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,680
had a i had pants for

1364
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,319
i had a pen for almost two years three

1365
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:26,880
years

1366
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,319
and unfortunately it was the pan 200 and

1367
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:31,040
it got

1368
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:35,040
um it was only 100 um

1369
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:38,880
speed wise and uh it was not good enough

1370
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:39,520
for

1371
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,960
for when but the pants are great too the

1372
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,079
thing is that is the

1373
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:47,280
the cost is way higher yeah

1374
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,480
yeah yeah and that's the thing with

1375
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,480
subscription sometimes it's not

1376
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,319
the box what you're paying but it's a

1377
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:55,520
subscription uh

1378
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,720
40 40 40 subscription is way cheaper

1379
00:54:58,720 --> 00:54:59,119
than

1380
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:02,240
palo alto and that's why a lot of

1381
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,240
companies are are

1382
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,799
are involving the government it's going

1383
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:07,520
foreign

1384
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:11,359
and leaving paulo because of the cost

1385
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:15,920
yeah so that's a good point

1386
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,839
okay um any other questions um

1387
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:25,520
like can i get discounts unfortunately

1388
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,520
not

1389
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:32,079
that's one of the things that uh um

1390
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:35,200
i wish i i could do uh in fact for me i

1391
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,160
can only get

1392
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,440
one discounted device per year but

1393
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,760
i cannot like because obviously every

1394
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,359
everything goes by a serial number they

1395
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:43,680
know

1396
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,680
where i where i purchase it or who

1397
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,880
purchase it

1398
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,079
and if i let's say you raise it

1399
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:53,040
and it doesn't match with marco then

1400
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,799
they're going to come back to me and say

1401
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:57,599
hey how come you know you have that so

1402
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:57,920
they

1403
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,119
they pretty much say it as the result

1404
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:04,640
you sold it you know for or you know

1405
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,160
to make money or something and that

1406
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,079
booth right yeah

1407
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:10,640
the stuff so right that's why i said

1408
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,319
that i made the comment that i

1409
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:15,280
highly discouraged uh that you go on

1410
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,520
ebay for example and buy a used one that

1411
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,000
it

1412
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,400
will cost you double you you you you

1413
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,920
have i have a a pan

1414
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,640
that i never used because they would not

1415
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:25,920
activate it for me

1416
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,559
yeah uh one of the questions here how

1417
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,720
often you should replace a firewall

1418
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:35,119
well um kind of like what rod said it

1419
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:38,160
really is for a enterprise obviously

1420
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,359
you know technology

1421
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:43,599
there's new technology out there every

1422
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:44,480
time so

1423
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:47,040
i will say what refresh every three to

1424
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,400
four years

1425
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,839
as long as we uh or or if let's say the

1426
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:52,160
uh

1427
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,920
um the the box is not gonna get any more

1428
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:56,799
uh

1429
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:59,599
future upgrades or or upgrades in

1430
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:00,319
general

1431
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:02,319
then at that point it's time to move on

1432
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:03,599
it's kind of like you know

1433
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:05,760
windows 7 and windows 10 well you have

1434
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,839
to move out of windows 7 because there's

1435
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,119
no more support for it

1436
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,119
so that point you have to buy a computer

1437
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:12,480
with windows 10

1438
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:15,760
same concept but

1439
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,960
for the most part um again not

1440
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,040
talking for all the companies but at

1441
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,559
least my company

1442
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:25,839
they you know they continue upgrading

1443
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:26,319
even

1444
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:28,000
older versions and that's actually very

1445
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,280
interesting here's the reason why um

1446
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,839
because there's a lot of companies out

1447
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:35,920
there

1448
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,640
that are our customers that might not

1449
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,119
have

1450
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:42,319
the uh the money to to buy new equipment

1451
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:44,240
or or for whatever reason they cannot

1452
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,640
upgrade and they need to keep their all

1453
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,119
four gate but i still they need to have

1454
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:50,720
the latest patches and stuff like that

1455
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,400
so fortinet actually

1456
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,520
um great patches for all their

1457
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:59,280
um firmwares so like right now we're on

1458
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,400
six that's four

1459
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,640
they still make for six that two they

1460
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,640
still make for six that's zero

1461
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,480
they still make four five that's five

1462
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,000
five that two

1463
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,920
i think i've seen it all the way to like

1464
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,000
four i mean obviously there's a break

1465
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:12,799
where

1466
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:15,200
they you know basically they uh they

1467
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,440
will not continue doing it but

1468
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,400
for the most part they it's very um they

1469
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,119
patch it

1470
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:25,040
you know regularly so

1471
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:27,920
um

1472
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:34,880
so christina so why you need a firewall

1473
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,520
then for

1474
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,079
okay yeah if your machine is not

1475
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:41,440
connecting to the internet

1476
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,040
why would you even buy a device like

1477
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,720
this

1478
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,880
no but what do you mean like the machine

1479
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,880
is not connected to the internet

1480
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,599
so somebody asked a question that if the

1481
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:53,040
machines were not connecting to the

1482
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,319
internet

1483
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:56,480
if you still had to pay for a license so

1484
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,000
the answer is yes

1485
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,680
and christina said what would you need a

1486
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,680
flower and i agree if you're not

1487
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,400
oh yeah yeah yeah okay now i get it okay

1488
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:04,799
yeah

1489
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:07,280
like i said it's you only apply or you

1490
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,920
only install a firewall

1491
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:13,440
depending on your needs how secure

1492
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,680
if having just a firewall because this

1493
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,440
is about psychology too

1494
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,640
if you think that let's just take it for

1495
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,240
um any other security physical security

1496
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,440
products

1497
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:30,720
if having a web not a webcam but

1498
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:34,079
a camera in your house like one of those

1499
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:34,880
rings

1500
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:38,079
will make you feel safer to live uh

1501
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:41,119
you know to to live in the neighborhood

1502
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,400
and you know that's that's a security

1503
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,960
uh something that you're applying you

1504
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,720
know to secure yourself

1505
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:52,319
uh if buying one of those um locks that

1506
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:55,200
cost very expensive versus a fifty

1507
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,400
dollar lock

1508
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,799
will make you feel more safer at home

1509
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:01,040
then do it so same concept with

1510
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,400
you know firewalls if if

1511
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,480
you are going to be surfing the net and

1512
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,520
and and

1513
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,960
you think that something someone is

1514
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,559
going to be compromising

1515
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:15,599
or or you know your your network or

1516
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:16,720
anything like that

1517
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:19,040
then you know maybe it's time to install

1518
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:20,480
a firewall but if you don't really care

1519
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:21,040
about it

1520
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,839
and and and you only use you know the

1521
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:25,119
internet for

1522
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:28,400
youtube videos any of that and and use

1523
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,079
maybe you use a vpn subscription

1524
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,920
somewhere else then at that point no you

1525
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:32,960
don't need a

1526
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:36,160
a a firewall at home

1527
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,079
again it's only depends on your needs

1528
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:42,079
and what you're trying to secure

1529
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:45,280
and what alex is saying is is also valid

1530
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,920
if you if you put yourself into this you

1531
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,440
don't need really to buy a

1532
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,000
branded device you can do your own pf

1533
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:52,799
sense and

1534
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:56,480
uh like alex says he uh he has snork

1535
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,040
that's of course to you because uh it

1536
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,799
takes a bit to learn snort and to

1537
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,799
maintain it

1538
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:06,400
yep and and and pf sense for example

1539
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,040
have that

1540
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:12,079
has that uh i think has that uh

1541
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,520
one of the applications is for snot i

1542
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,200
believe or suricata and

1543
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:25,839
search for it

1544
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,160
there you go so a pf sense that has an

1545
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,640
application that you can install and and

1546
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:44,079
you can create your own rules for

1547
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:48,079
um you know it's not right well

1548
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,000
also there is there's a caveat when

1549
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,200
using snort

1550
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,480
and or surikata which is regarded as

1551
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,599
what happens after

1552
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:59,119
it's almost like maria tv and my sequel

1553
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:02,880
when when cisco bought uh snored then

1554
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,839
uh they they created surikara the thing

1555
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:06,799
about this

1556
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:09,200
this uh frameworks they're amazing but

1557
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,799
you need two things one

1558
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:14,000
a device that can actually scan packets

1559
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,280
on the go and two you need huge storage

1560
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,960
if you if you're really processing the

1561
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,280
locks because you can be overwhelmed

1562
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,200
pretty quick in fact one of the ways to

1563
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,880
actually attack is

1564
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,520
smart defense technologies is to

1565
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,520
overwhelm them with

1566
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,599
with package because if in the back end

1567
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:32,720
there's not enough

1568
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:35,920
there's not a either lock rotation or

1569
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,520
or a a good lock setup you're either not

1570
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:40,400
going to see it

1571
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,240
or the device is going to get slower or

1572
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:49,839
even crashed

1573
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,440
um
