a non-profit association this probably

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,720
should give us a little more power to

26
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,759
to bring up stuff in the community we

27

37
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,280
a little bit of what we're aiming to do

38
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,319
and what we're trying

what we're trying to uh um

40
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,520
what we're trying to what we aim to

41
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,920
to achieve with this association

42
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,760
obviously this has been a little rocky

43
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,920
because of the pandemic and

44
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,800
uh we're trying to do our best obviously

45
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,760
uh so we there will be more information

46
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,319
as we come and there will be more formal

47
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,720
announcements as

48
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,080
probably next meeting um

49
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,840
we need more presentations we already

50
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,200

51
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,760

55
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,480
in um are

56
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,760
either in slack

57
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,000
or discord i can put the invitations

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,959
if you any of you still wants to join

59

ahead and post it so you guys can join

61
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,280
um and um uh

62
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,480
the idea is that you can join the uh the

63
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,560
channel the slack channel

64
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,560
or the disco channel and we're gonna

65
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,040
talk a little bit of discord in a bit

66
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,000
um i i understand maura posted something

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,920
about a meeting i would i would i will

68
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,080
um i will announce it in just a second

69
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,000
we couldn't hear you well i'm sorry

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,680
um and uh um based on the

71
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,599
talking about the slack and discord uh

72
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,360
there has been some resistance

73
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,440
to discord um since the discord

74
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,799
um it's a little cumbersome

75
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,439
um not sure how it went for you guys at

76
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,080
defcon but defcone fell

77
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,680
like i was personally

78
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,720
i was personally lost i will be posting

79
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,120
the

80
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,760
the links in a minute i was personally

81
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,319
lost

82
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,680
many of us were lost um so what we tried

83
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,159
to do

84
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,439
was basically put a channel uh

85
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,399
we didn't try to do what we did in vegas

86
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,079
which is usually we'll meet and say hey

87
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,959
go here

88
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,520
or this is happening here but it fell it

89
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,720
didn't feel like

90
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,560
the experience was uh was very

91
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,479
um what was close to what we're all used

92
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,040
to

93
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,639
i mean the server lighting here is i

94
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,520
guess everybody misses

95
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,639
going to vegas and seeing everybody and

96
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,960
it really sucked not to be there and see

97
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,919
everyone so

98
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,919
now we we can buy you more of the strips

99
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,479
that we do we used to take for granted

100
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,680
so this score turned into

101
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,320
er in and this had nothing to do with

102
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,080
defcon it has to do with the tool

103
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,960
uh basically it's it's cumbersome we

104
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,840
started migrating to discord and

105
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,000
i i'm not feeling the love for this tool

106
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,160
to be honest so we're working on having

107
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,400
a

108
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,160
uh a crossbow spot

109
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,080
but we're gonna keep on slack as well

110
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,840
and i'm gonna post again i'm gonna post

111
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,479
the link so you guys can join

112
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,720
uh but we're working on it because it

113
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,560
feels like we're getting disconnected

114
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,160
with this back and forth

115
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,199
um the the book that i

116
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,720
mentioned for some of you uh is blackout

117
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,520
wars

118
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,720
uh and this this book will allow you to

119
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,560
understand the context

120
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,240
of the special event that we're doing at

121
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,280
hack miami on august 29

122
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,479
and it has to be with emp emp it's a

123
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,840
it's a weapon uh that can basically fry

124
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,680
everything that's electronic

125
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,800
uh and and lead to a major blackout

126
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,320
right so this is

127
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,320
there's been some chatter uh in the

128
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,639
media there's been some chatter

129
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,000
uh in and many other circles uh

130
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,560
and uh i decided to go out and recruit

131
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,440
somebody

132
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,199
i was able to find somebody from a

133
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,440
utility uh company which is cool there's

134
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,440
he's he's not gonna talk on behalf of

135
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,520
the utility company obviously we can't

136
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,360
expect that to happen but

137
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,199
but he's gonna give us some some some

138
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,600
good info of some of the efforts

139
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,800
uh and and what can we do as individuals

140
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
which is also a very important thing

141
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,560
it's not just what are they doing what

142
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,840
are we doing

143
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,280
uh because you know they can protect the

144
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,800
the grid but if you're

145
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,520
everything in your house gets fried you

146
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,600
have to have a way to come back

147
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,080
we all it's it's like here in florida

148
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,960
when we

149
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,560
lose power we had generators we have

150
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,479
ready hand radio we have all kinds of

151
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,600
stuff so so

152
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,400

153
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,759
for you to see

154
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,479
uh what what how can we mitigate this

155
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,360
type of threat

156
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,479

trying to find jobs and that's one of

170
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,639
the main things we do here we try to

171
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,680
help you

172
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,199
uh get uh higher or

173
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,240
find any type of job that that can get

174
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:40,800
you by

175
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,919
you know considering the considering the

176
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:44,639
uh

177
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,160
the situation that we're going through

178
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,759
right now with the pandemic

179
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,479
uh there is there's some there was some

180
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,520
chatter yesterday

181
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,000
about some new remote policies some

182
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,599
companies in silicon valley

183
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,759
that imply that they will pay less so

184
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,120
those will move

185
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,400
uh and and some people are up in arms in

186
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,639
it i am because i do i do believe that's

187
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,840
a cap

188
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,680
and caps should not be you should be

189
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,520
paid for what you do

190
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,639
not for where you live so so

191
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,960
so that type of cabin i myself are not

192
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,720
not happy to hear about it hopefully

193
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,639
other companies follow through with it

194
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,919
so um all right

195
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,759
so with that in mind um

196
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,960
this meeting will be posted

197
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,399
in uh the youtube channel

198
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,679
and um if

199

the link i'm still driving now

215
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,519
um silicon valley isaka organization

216
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,320
is gonna have robin bascom talk about

217
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,000
life science and and

218
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,959
i mean and medical devices a lot of them

219
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:39,360
uh

220
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,279
concern regarding cyber security and

221
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,399
strategy

222
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,360
uh and she did a great job with the east

223
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:45,680
bay

224
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,480
ic square chapter this thursday she's

225
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,720
going to repeat the talk

226
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,519
uh this coming thursday isakka

227
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,959
it's usually from 6 to 7 p.m it's only

228
00:09:58,959 --> 00:09:59,279
an

229
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,480
hour on the ic squared event was at

230
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,160
least two hours i'm not sure how she's

231
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,880
gonna

232
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,680
you know what how she's gonna um come

233
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,920
back her presentation but

234
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,880
it it's fabulous i think it's very

235
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,760
informative

236
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,959
resourceful and i think if you

237
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,399
care about um health um and

238
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,640
and the concern about uh security

239
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,399
especially on a lot of

240
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,680
medical devices uh the needs in

241
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,160
health care uh especially if you're

242
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,120
thinking about

243
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,440
hey where what area should i may want to

244
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,200
focus in because it sounds like there's

245
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,160
going to be

246
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,959
and is a significant need in that area

247
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,079
for

248
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,040
cyber security i would go to the website

249
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,640
and register

250
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,760
it's free um if you you owe in

251
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,600
uh and if you want cpus they basically

252
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,000
pull four questions and you get cpus out

253
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,760
of it it's only doing the live

254
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,800
performance

255
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
afterwards they record it if you're a

256
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,720
member you can get the recording

257
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,640
uh but you would not be getting your

258
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,079
cpus

259
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,320
if it's if you're seeing the recording

260
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,279
of it

261
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,839
okay uh there's reference material on

262
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,240
the isc squared east bay

263
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,000
chapter that has a lot of really good

264
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,200
reference material but anyway again um

265
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,279
go to the website i will try to send the

266
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,760
link when i'm not driving

267
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,600
uh i am sort of second traffic

268
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,000
going over to the coast so anyway uh

269
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,920
anyone has questions feel free to

learning with

295
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,760
um cryptography

296
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,800
and applications and then we have

297
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,720

321
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,240
chance to talk about this

322
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,680
i'm going to talk about uh use learning

323
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,079
enough cryptography for betting securing

324
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,680
your applications

325
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,160
uh the main goal for this talk is for

326
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,360
people with a

327
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,880
software engineering background or

328
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,320
people that are just starting in

329
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,519
cryptography

330
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,160
to to learn the basic concepts because

331
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,120
there is a lot of

332
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,199
concepts in cryptography and some of

333
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,959
them are

334
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,240
some very difficult some of them kind of

335
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,079
overlap with some others and it's very

336
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,760
important to learn the difference

337
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,600
because at the end that impacts the

338
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,040
security right of

339
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,160
of your application of your data so

340
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,800
i'm going to go ahead and introduce

341
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,279
myself my name is lena levski i'm from

342
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,920
mexico i'm working here in bay area

343
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,320
i'm a security software engineer i do

344
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,000
open source at minao

345
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
a local startup and i have a very big

346
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,920
session with cyber security you can see

347
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,680
that

348
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,240
so okay fear disclaimer i'm not a

349
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,440
cryptographer

350
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,480
so please please if you have a question

351
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,040
about your production environment

352
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,760
please go and talk with your favorite

353
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,800
cryptographer

354
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,480
this is just some stuff i have learned

355
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:28,720
in

356
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,720
over the past six months for me working

357
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,160
with cryptography

358
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,000
applied cryptography in applications so

359
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,360
okay uh so let's start by defining what

360
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,160
is cryptography

361
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,720
right cryptography is the practice and

362
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,800
study of techniques for secure

363
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,959
communications against tear party

364
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,839
called adversaries and we have uh the

365
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,279
basic principles of

366
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,079
cryptography our confidentiality which

367
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,199
means

368
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,480
your data can be only accessed by people

369
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,480
that is allowed to do that

370
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,959
integrity which means you need to make

371
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,399
sure the data is not

372
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,839
tampered or is not changed

373
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,160
authentication

374
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,720
it means that when you receive a message

375
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,959
you can validate that the original owner

376
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:13,519
of that

377
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,000
message of the or or the people that

378
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,880
generate that

379
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,759
that message is the one that say a

380
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,079
non-repudiation which is basically

381
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,040
once i send a message i cannot negate

382
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,800
that right i cannot say i didn't say

383
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,519
that

384
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,600
so this is the basic principles of

385
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,800
cryptography and

386
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,079
to achieve this there is many mechanism

387
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,199
or techniques

388
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,600
techniques such as cryptography hashing

389
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,959
digital signature

390
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,360
that will help us to to achieve that

391
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,600
right in this talk i'm going to focus

392
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
more on the first two encryption and

393
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,399
caching

394
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,639
and digital signature is a whole topic

395
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,800
that maybe we can talk a little bit at

396
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,680
the end or maybe in

397
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,519
some other presentation but

398
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,560
yeah so the encryption let's

399
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,040
start with encryption so encryption is

400
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,959
the process of converting the original

401
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,240
representation of

402
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,359
information known as a plain textual to

403
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,959
an alternative form

404
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,760
called the ciphertext and then only an

405
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,679
authorized body can decipher that

406
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,919
ciphertext

407
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,199
and recover the original plaintext right

408
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,400
in general what you need to know about

409
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,319
the encryption is in general there is

410
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,559
two kinds of encryption symmetric and

411
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,079
asymmetric

412
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,679
and everyone each one has like pros and

413
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:32,559
cons but

414
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,240
what you just need to know is that

415
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,960
symmetric encryption use the same key

416
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,440
for encrypting and decrypting while

417
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,600
asymmetric encryption uses two keys

418
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,400
right one for

419
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,799
decrypting one one for encryption

420
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,320
encryption so this is the

421
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,760
the main difference uh

422
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,160
the next concept because there is when i

423
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,760
mentioned there is many different

424
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,400
concepts

425
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,760
people tend to to mix them and

426
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,200
sometimes we assume like for example

427
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:01,919
encoding

428
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,039
is a type of encryption because when we

429
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,240
apply the encoding

430
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,679
the result the result value we we cannot

431
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,120
understand that right but it's a

432
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,720
different thing so encoding is the

433
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,400
process of converting data

434
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,720
to another format and it's usually

435
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,240
required for a number of

436
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,960
information processing needs like

437
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,840
compiling

438
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,240
data transmission or storage or

439
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,360
compression or the or decompression

440
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,360
but the important thing here is that

441
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,120
encoding is reversible

442
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,880
so you can switch between formats so

443
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,520
everybody everybody can if you get the

444
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,120
base64 representation of a trick of a

445
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,679
string you can go back right so this is

446
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,559
this doesn't provide security the way we

447
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,919
went

448
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,720
uh another important concept is hashing

449
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,160
hashing

450
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,559
algorithm is a mathematical function

451
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,640
that condensed data to a fixed

452
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,400
size the result of the result is called

453
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,960
a hash value and sometimes caching is

454
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,440
referred

455
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,360
as a one-way function because

456
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,640
when you let's say you want to to get

457
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,360
the hash representation of a big file or

458
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,480
a text or whatever

459
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,280
you will get a fixed length string and

460
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:17,840
from that

461
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,919
fixed length you cannot go back to the

462
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,039
original content

463
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,440
this is that's the meaning of one way

464
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,640
function

465
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,400
another important thing as i mentioned

466
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,080
is the fixed the fixed length so it

467
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,200
doesn't matter

468
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,039
how big is the file that you are going

469
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,600
to to apply the hashing function you are

470
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:33,919
you

471
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,320
always want to get the same size

472
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,000
depending on what the hashing

473
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,799
algorithm you are using as i mentioned

474
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:41,679
this is not re

475
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,240
reversible and this is deterministic uh

476
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,600
meaning

477
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,520
if you give always the same input you

478
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,799
will get always the same

479
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,200
output so you can think of this as a

480
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,280
fingerprint right

481
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,000
and and this is very uh useful because

482
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,440
sometimes

483
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,440
in your application you want to compare

484
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,880
files but

485
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,760
you you you you can you don't want to

486
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,039
compare the whole

487
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,600
body of the file so what you usually do

488
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,280
is you compare the hashes

489
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,600
the same can be applied for for

490
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,559
passwords right

491
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,600
on as on a platform when a user

492
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,880
logins or sign up you you as a developer

493
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,200
you

494
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,280
you will not you will never store the

495
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,679
plain text of that password instead you

496
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,400
will

497
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,559
store a hash representation of that

498
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,240
password so the next time the user

499
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,559
come to your application you will

500
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,520
calculate the

501
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,720
the hash and then you will compare right

502
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,840
uh the next one is called obfuscation

503
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,280
this is star

504
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,720
this technique is a kind start a little

505
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,320
bit of a security layer

506
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,440
but again it's not enough so obfuscation

507
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,760
is a mechanism for making something uh

508
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,480
obscure or dark or very difficult to

509
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,679
understand

510
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,919
and this is mostly used when the user

511
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,080
has access to see the source code for

512
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,039
example

513
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,280
and now one case is very common single

514
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,400
page application

515
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,679
and application application has a lot of

516
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:08,400
logic

517
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,440
in the javascript so when you go into a

518
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,120
server when you do a request of server

519
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,880
you download the application into into

520
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,919
the

521
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,320
using your browser and you can see the

522
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,440
whole source code

523
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,159
so if usually people want to protect

524
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:22,799
that

525
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,919
and they use sophistication so in this

526
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:26,640
example

527
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,520
i have this javascript and then i apply

528
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,120
the obfuscation function

529
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,880
and i end with something like that that

530
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,480
looks like very weird

531
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,559
but still is code that can be executed

532
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:37,840
by the browser

533
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,320
uh the thing with obfuscation is that it

534
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:40,880
can be

535
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,159
reversible right so usually this is very

536
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,960
popular in ctf you get a obfuscated code

537
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,679
and you need to reverse engineering

538
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,480
and this can be also do in an automated

539
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,679
fashion

540
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,960
but it's not

541
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,159
call it security by obscurity

542
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,320
and and finally the last concept with

543
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,080
data masking which is

544
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,480
very related to the previous one but in

545
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,840
this case

546
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,280
data masking is being used to kind of

547
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,679
protect that or sensual some pieces of

548
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:14,960
information

549
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,320
uh by replacing the the some pieces of

550
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,080
information right the main reason for

551
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,480
applying data masking to data fields is

552
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,919
to protect data

553
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,080
that is classified like for example

554
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,120
personal

555
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,159
identity personal information that can

556
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,200
identify you or sensitive personal data

557
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,480
commercially whatever right uh but the

558
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,280
information

559
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,720
need to remain you usable used for for

560
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,440
develop

561
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,880
developer purpose or testing purpose so

562
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,919
okay now that we now the uh

563
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,960
this story let me talk a little bit more

564
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,679
about the

565
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,280
the cryptography part so in practice

566
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,280
cryptography is about choosing the right

567
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,720
tool for the job

568
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,559
and when it comes to building and

569
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:01,840
protecting

570
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,840
our application the the most common

571
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,840
tasks that we will face

572
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,120
are encrypting data data blob or data

573
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,919
stream

574
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,120
exchange secrets with appear verify that

575
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,280
some data block or that extreme is not

576
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,200
modified that's integrity

577
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,919
uh verify that some data or data stream

578
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,240
has been produced by someone in specific

579
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:22,720
that

580
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,880
authentication we we may also face

581
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,799
the generate a secret from another

582
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,200
secret that ski derivation

583
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,320
and also generate secrets from uh low

584
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,080
entropy values such as a user

585
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,280
input password so

586
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,279
there are out there many cryptographic

587
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,559
mechanism that

588
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,720
will make our life very easy when it

589
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,880
comes to application security and we

590
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,799
need to learn how to pick the right tool

591
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,679
for the job

592
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,679
i'm not saying that we should completely

593
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,120
ignore the jury and they

594
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,240
and just jump directly into the practice

595
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,080
theory is very important and we should

596
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,760
learn it

597
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,760
or at least be aware of the different

598
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,440
types of cryptographic

599
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,520
primitive which is another interesting

600
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,480
concept

601
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,039
so there is i think that is more

602
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,600
cryptographic primitives but the ones

603
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,360
that you most commonly use are

604
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,080
some of the random permutations and this

605
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,840
is the case for example of

606
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,320
aes advanced encryption encryption

607
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,360
standard

608
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,000
so this is the primitive that uh makes

609
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,559
that a

610
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,279
cryptographic scheme uses uh civil

611
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,000
random

612
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,360
function and we have for example chasha

613
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,919
and random oracles which is a the case

614
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:38,720
of the

615
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,440
hashing algorithm chat 256.

616
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,400
modern cryptography algorithm usually

617
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,679
follow a more theory

618
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,000
based approach when it comes to achieve

619
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,960
its goals

620
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,240
and test the security uh what do this

621
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,559
mean

622
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,720
like that means that they usually do

623
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,039
that by reducing the security relative

624
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,960
to the primitive they use

625
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,600
and it's very common to read things like

626
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,240
this

627
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,039
like for example the scheme x achieve

628
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,159
the security

629
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,760
goals a and b and c if the underlying

630
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,880
primitive why

631
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,159
is in fact okay what do this mean right

632
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,520
this means that primitives usually have

633
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,480
a condition

634
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,880
in the form of a a mathematical proof

635
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,360
of a very hard problem to solve like for

636
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,000
example the

637
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,360
prime factor of the representation in

638
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,799
the rsa

639
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,520
asymmetric cryptography or the discrete

640
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,320
logarithm

641
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,559
logarithm problem from the diffic helm

642
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,760
and key exchange

643
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,880
algorithm so therefore if you want to

644
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,039
break a cryptography scheme you will

645
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:45,760
first

646
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,640
need to break the assumptions used by

647
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,480
the primitives right

648
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,360
uh if no one can do that then it's safe

649
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,600
to assume that the cryptography scheme

650
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,360
is secure to use

651
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,720
so this is how it works in

652
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,960
in real life right people try to attack

653
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,559
the the primitives and

654
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,960
break the assumptions and of course it

655
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,039
will depend on

656
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,440
what primitive are you breaking and

657
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,159
what's the assumption

658
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,440
so okay enough about the theory i will

659
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,240
show

660
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,919
some examples like for example

661
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,360
let's say you do in your application

662
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,120
you have you have let's say you have an

663
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,720
application that calculates

664
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,240
the hmac a signature of a message using

665
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,559
a password provided by the user

666
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,679
uh this in the in the first example

667
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,840
this works but there is a problem with

668
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,960
this approach

669
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,080
which is calculating the hmac is very

670
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,840
trivial

671
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,919
with the help of a good dictionary an

672
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,200
attacker can easily

673
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,720
root for the password and if he succeed

674
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,960
on obtaining the original or in a secret

675
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,640
he can impersonate the user of your

676
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,440
application

677
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,640
so how can we fix this helping we make

678
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,760
it more secure

679
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,480
we need to add an extract step so in

680
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,000
order to make the job

681
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,480
for the attacker more expensive in terms

682
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,120
of

683
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,240
time or computation and memory resources

684
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,559
the recommended approach is to use a key

685
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,360
derivation

686
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,279
function or a password based evaluation

687
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,279
function when deriving a key from from

688
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,320
the user so

689
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,399
just make sure in your application that

690
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,000
whenever you receive

691
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,760
a piece of information that you are

692
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,120
going to include in

693
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,159
in some cryptographic process

694
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,559
and run the the password by easy key

695
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,279
derivative function

696
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,200
and this is an example it's actually

697
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,320
pretty easy to do it

698
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,600
and go uh go has this crypto library

699
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,679
that you can implement in your in your

700
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,520
your programs in your applications and

701
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,960
you can do it like in

702
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,919
one line of code right uh and the

703
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,000
takeaway for this example is that in

704
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,320
general we have to distinguish between

705
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,840
deriving a key

706
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,840
from a high entropy source like a

707
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,200
cryptographic key

708
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,360
or from a low entropy source like a

709
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,480
password

710
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,480
uh if it's a pathware there is a

711
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,240
password-based key derivation function

712
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,600
that we can use

713
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,640
and the main goal for this is make it

714
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,559
difficult for an attacker to break your

715
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,159
application right and

716
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,240
make it useful for for you for your

717
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,200
users

718
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,559
to to to generate whatever process that

719
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,678
your application needs

720
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,200
the next example is is a data integrity

721
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,960
in your application

722
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,559
and that in preserving that integrity is

723
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,159
a crucial part when working with

724
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,159
information the easiest way to achieve

725
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,360
this is using encryption but

726
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,480
however sometimes you don't want

727
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,440
to encrypt the information because

728
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,520
encrypting and decrypting is a

729
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,000
expensive operation and you only want to

730
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,559
per se

731
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,720
you only are interested in the integrity

732
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,679
part

733
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,159
then the most straightforward solution

734
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,520
for this is

735
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,039
a hmac with random oracle

736
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,720
and in this example what i'm

737
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,960
showing right that there is a shared

738
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,480
secret and one

739
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,120
the user alice is sending a message and

740
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,360
then he's calculating the signature

741
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,679
based on that shared secret and if he

742
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,080
intercept that message of course because

743
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,120
of the message she's

744
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,120
traveling in plain text she can modify

745
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,520
the information on that message but then

746
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,840
the signature will not match

747
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,080
so with this we ensure that integrity

748
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,880
and again in go it's very easy to do

749
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,600
this

750
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,279
we have a hmac library part of the

751
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,080
of the native libraries and you can also

752
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,960
do this in

753
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,399
two lines of code so all these functions

754
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:51,440
i'm going to

755
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,039
put it on github because you are more

756
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,360
interesting on on looking at it

757
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,200
but it's very easy right and and then

758
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,240
the the last one is data confidentiality

759
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,559
right

760
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,679
basically that encryption and for this

761
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,520
we have many options

762
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,399
so here i'm i'm showing we have a user

763
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:13,600
we have a piece of

764
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,000
data which is a hello world file and

765
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,880
then a key

766
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,760
and we want to somehow run an encryption

767
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,880
process

768
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,520
and then if a malicious user comes and

769
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,600
see the data will make no sense right

770
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,360
because he cannot read it because he

771
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,840
he doesn't have the the encryption key

772
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,600
so here we need to consider that

773
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,840
usually symmetric cryptography schemes

774
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,520
are better for encrypting data

775
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,679
or data blobs or that extreme versus

776
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:42,880
asymmetric

777
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,559
schemes because of performance

778
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,440
advantages the recommendation here is to

779
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,240
use

780
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,039
a thing is that is called authenticated

781
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,640
authenticated encryption

782
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,399
or authenticated encryption with

783
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,000
associated data

784
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,679
so uh here in this example i'm using

785
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,679
a aes gcm but you can also use another

786
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,679
one that is called shasha

787
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,720
20 and

788
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,640
authenticated encryption without serial

789
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,919
data

790
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,240
will generally provide the

791
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,320
confidentiality and also

792
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,399
authentication so this is why it's

793
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,120
better to use this kind of

794
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,559
cryptographic scheme that use plain uh

795
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,159
aes or this or whatever other mechanism

796
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:29,440
that only

797
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,360
encrypt the data

798
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,279
um yeah this is the example of how to

799
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,640
decrypt the data so

800
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,880
can you see it's very very very easy to

801
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,880
do it both

802
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,480
and yeah the summary for these examples

803
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:44,799
and

804
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,519
for all the talk that i i all the stuff

805
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,440
i was talking is

806
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,840
the main goal is to learn how to pick

807
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,240
the right tool for the job right

808
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,679
once we know the the requirements of

809
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,399
or the nature that we want to achieve we

810
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,640
we can select what is the best the best

811
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,600
tool

812
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,360
uh don't use a user provided keys

813
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,519
directly in your application instead

814
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,480
always derive new keys because you you

815
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,240
cannot trust what the user is giving

816
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,039
right so

817
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:17,440
we need to use uh key delevation to

818
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,320
create

819
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,519
more secure cryptographic keys and

820
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,320
the tier one is there is most of the

821
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,120
time

822
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,360
are ready to use that practice solution

823
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,360
for the things that you want to do

824
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,679
so don't implement your own cryptography

825
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,039
right there is a lot of

826
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,919
good resources a lot of code that has

827
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,399
been very formally verified that works

828
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,240
and it mathematically prove it

829
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,399
that is free to use and you can

830
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,159
implement in your solution in your

831
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,200
product

832
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,919
and yeah as i was saying learn the

833
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:48,880
difference between

834
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,960
encryption hashing and coding

835
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,440
obfuscation and data masking

836
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,240
and base64 is not encryption right so

837
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,840
this is very important

838
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,360
to achieve security in your application

839
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,720
and here are the resources that

840
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,360
i i've been reading during the creation

841
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,519
of this presentation

842
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,600
and yeah i think that that will be out

843
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,840
from my side if you have some questions

844
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,640
please uh

845
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,960
ask if you have some feedback some

846
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,399
comments are

847
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,120
very welcome and thank you all for

848
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,240
listening

849
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,159
and thank rod for for this space

850
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,799
hey thank you lenny uh there is a there

851
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,320
is a question

852
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,480
um from day what is the difference

853
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,679
between

854
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,559
aes gcm and aes

855
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:43,519
uh gcm i i don't remember exactly the

856
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,559
the what what it mean but what i

857
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,360
remember is

858
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,480
the way they the kind of the the process

859
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,919
the mechanism they

860
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,720
they apply when process image blocks so

861
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,080
aes is a

862
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,720
work in blocks and they applied a

863
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,080
different cryptographic

864
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,559
permutation on that block so i think

865
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,720
this is

866
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,159
apply a slightly different process

867
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,560
so yeah i don't completely know the

868
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,359
details of the

869
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,599
of the algorithm the the cryptographic

870
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:16,800
scheme but

871
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,040
most of the different that you will see

872
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,000
is like

873
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,480
the way they achieve the the the way

874
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,040
you will see some changes in the in the

875
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,320
primitives right

876
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,480
or the way they do different things like

877
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,599
for example

878
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:34,159
cha one and chatu is two different

879
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,280
families

880
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,719
but shatu is the way the difference

881
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,879
between cha1 and chatu is the way

882
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,639
they calculate the internal state so

883
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,399
in in aes and aes gcem

884
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,060
is is something very similar

885
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,839
[Music]

886
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,560
okay there is a comment from ray if you

887
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,560
can please display the resources

888
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,560
page again oh yes

889
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,240
yes yes yes yeah it's a okay yeah this

890
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,280
is very very

891
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,079
basic material that has like a very very

892
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:10,880
basic

893
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,400
foundations but it helped me a lot to

894
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,040
clarify some concepts and

895
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,000
every time i i forget like a concept i

896
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,720
go back

897
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,480
and read again and again so there is

898
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,680
this material and also in coursera i

899
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,040
think there is a

900
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,480
a course called cryptography one and two

901
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,200
that is

902
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,599
i recommend it a lot because you will

903
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,800
learn more in detail

904
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,920
like a more formal education of the

905
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,160
basic foundations of cryptography

906
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,079
so there is a lot of resources out there

907
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,000
to to learn this thing

908
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,280
and and again if you want to

909
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,280
to do apply cryptography which is the

910
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,520
thing i'm working right now

911
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,119
uh again jew is

912
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,440
i think it's not necessary to to learn

913
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,480
the very

914
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,359
embedded the mathematical concepts so

915
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:04,720
it's just enough to

916
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,960
to identify the right tool for the job

917
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,160
as i was saying

918
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,520
and yeah you can

919
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,359
protect your your data right your

920
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,920
application

921
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,000
hey uh lennon was that a really quick

922
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,599
you mentioned you can go and look at

923
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:22,640
this

924
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,880
that's a place where we can learn this

925
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,880
what was that what is it again and what

926
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,079
what link is it

927
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,119
where you can go and learn this

928
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,920
coursera

929
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,920
yeah you can go and learn this how to

930
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,079
look cryptography in a basic way is that

931
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,200
that you're mentioning

932
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,800
where do we go and get that i i don't

933
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,680
have it here

934
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,560
i don't have it here but i can i can i

935
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,320
update the presentation and put there

936
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,839
the the course i think is

937
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,280
is free okay it's a it's a free course

938
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,000
and it's a very

939
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,560
complete it has like 60 videos something

940
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,599
like that

941
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,400
uh yeah so okay you can update it and

942
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,079
put it here

943
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,720
awesome awesome thank you for that just

944
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,280
put it in

945
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,839
the chat

946
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,880
thank you okay uh any other questions

947
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,800
because we had to we had to move on to

948
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,839
the next presentation this was a great

949
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:22,079
presentation

950
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,200
thank you lennon as always uh you always

951
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:25,680
green

952
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,320
uh bring great content so you're always

953
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,160
welcome to come back

954
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,480
thank you very much of course and of

955
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,079
course i'll stop sharing

956
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:39,680
yeah uh let's see brian are you ready

957
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,240
yeah i am can you hear me okay yeah i

958

let me i'm gonna i'm gonna send you as a

960
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,560
presenter

961
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,880
uh let me find you there we go

962
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,800
okay so brian

963
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,359
uh you are a presenter now so if you

964
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,480
wanna

965
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,040
yep so today we're gonna have uh brian

966
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:01,760
powers

967
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,599
he's gonna talk about microsoft atp

968
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:06,720
defender

969
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,839
i know brian from quite a bit of time

970
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:13,119
uh brian is a a long-time

971
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,920
security presenter and i work with him

972
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,400
that

973
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,680
actually had a military contractor

974
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,040
um back then when we were doing uh cyber

975
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,240
wrenches

976
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,520
uh and uh he's awesome then i'm sure his

977
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,960
presentation's gonna

978
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,320
rock so uh brian take it away

979
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,400
all right thanks for having me rod it's

980
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,520
been a long time

981
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,839
you haven't changed a bit i've gotten a

982
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,760
lot of gray hairs i've had two sets of

983
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,079
twins since i've seen you last

984
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,119
uh so i i think i've aged uh

985
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,119
twice the amount since i've been you but

986
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,720
uh thanks for having me

987
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,480
um i wanted to go over some um

988
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,640
uh also i wanted to thank you for uh the

989
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,400
emp presentation coming up

990
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,960
i've got a lot of interest in that topic

991
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,000
from

992
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,280
history in the field and i'm very much

993
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,440
looking forward to that

994
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,920
so let's um let's go over some of the

995
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,280
things that i've been playing around

996
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:09,839
with

997
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:13,119
and um i like open forum um

998
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,520
i don't necessarily have a long time

999
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,960
there's a heavy thunderstorm and i'm

1000
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,560
hoping the power doesn't go out it went

1001
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,240
out earlier on me

1002
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,640
um i do have a generator but let's uh

1003
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,839
let's try to get through some of this

1004
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,839
material and please throw some questions

1005
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,359
at me and interrupt me as much as you

1006
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:28,240
want

1007
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,280
um but uh the best i can do is give you

1008
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:31,920
a little bit of an

1009
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,200
outline and um and a walkthrough some of

1010
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,160
this is production

1011
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,160
so so i really can't get into much of it

1012
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,119
but what i can do

1013
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,599
it should it should be kind of cool i'm

1014
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:44,720
hoping for

1015
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,480
so um what what's really

1016
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,520
taken my breath away with um

1017
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,560
advancements in microsoft defender

1018
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,800
atp platform is their

1019
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,160
investment they bought a company back in

1020
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,319
2017 2016

1021
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,720
for about a hundred million dollars that

1022
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,079
really launched this

1023
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,440
machine learning and artificial

1024
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,480
intelligence arena

1025
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,760
where their cloud

1026
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,160
based tenant world and i don't know if

1027
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,359
you're familiar with their new

1028
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:22,400
subscription model

1029
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,520
microsoft 365 where

1030
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,800
they're merging all of their um

1031
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,079
organizations into you know um

1032
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,000
azure online uh like azure active

1033
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
directory online for free

1034
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,839
essentially for most organizations and

1035
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,319
then bringing you in

1036
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,119
to the cloud more frequently as a matter

1037
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,440
of fact

1038
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:48,960
i don't know if you're familiar with the

1039
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,640
jedi contract

1040
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,160
that's the 10 billion dollar

1041
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,440
contract that was awarded i think

1042
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,079
they're still fighting about it

1043
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,720
but um

1044
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,359
the defense department decided to give

1045
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,560
this contract over to

1046
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,400
microsoft and it kind of makes sense and

1047
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,920
i'm hoping i can explain to you some

1048
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,560
reasons why

1049
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,040
microsoft has been in the business for a

1050
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,800
long time and everybody

1051
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,359
that's protected their software has

1052
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:22,000
leveraged

1053
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,760
a lot of where they made a lot of

1054
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,040
mistakes

1055
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,200
and over the years microsoft has

1056
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,000
grown their platform into what i'm going

1057
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
to walk you through today

1058
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,079
but before we do that let's talk about

1059
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:40,880
where

1060
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,160
we are so they're advent it's first of

1061
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,319
all it's windows

1062
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,440
defender antivirus the biggest problem i

1063
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,599
think microsoft has right now is it's

1064
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:52,400
just

1065
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,960
first of all not done yet they're

1066
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,359
they're building the platform into

1067
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,800
um endpoint management and endpoint

1068
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,640
management is all-encompassing

1069
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,400
and endpoint management from the cloud

1070
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,000
means they're going to manage all of

1071
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,119
your systems

1072
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,599
from endpoint management um baseline

1073
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,440
configurations managed from

1074
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,839
azure and gives you the ability to

1075
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,200
hybridize

1076
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,760
this configuration management from the

1077
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,319
cloud

1078
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:23,760
and possibly on-premises or both and

1079
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,880
that model that they're promising is

1080
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,800
kind of half-baked it's not ready yet

1081
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,440
it's not even fully implementable under

1082
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,200
the current release schedule until the

1083
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,560
end of next year

1084
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,079
with this next release of windows 10.

1085
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,359
so um where we are is sort of

1086
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,760
beta release stuff but it's um it's

1087
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,200
really cool and all i'm gonna only

1088
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,880
really be able to show you today

1089
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,800
is um the the um

1090
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,319
nothing that interacts directly with the

1091
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,160
machine but what you can do

1092
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,119
to you know evaluate threats uh and then

1093
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,280
the hypotheticals on what you can do

1094
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,640
to deter them so i'm looking at um

1095
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,040
show and and also this presentation is a

1096
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,800
little bit more designed for enterprise

1097
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,960
admins and security admins

1098
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,680
um and we're going to evaluate some high

1099
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,000
level

1100
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,359
functionality and

1101
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,839
look at the

1102
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,480
antivirus features and just

1103
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,720
barely touch the surface i can't go into

1104
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,319
the full

1105
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,480
um features of advanced threat

1106
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,760
protection because

1107
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,440
you know it's akin to these

1108
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,000
hydrochloroquine tests that are going on

1109
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,119
you know they they uh they say it helps

1110
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,640
but all the tests that are going on

1111
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,160
they're not using zinc and they're not

1112
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,040
doing the pre

1113
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,800
you know the pre-test yeah you know

1114
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,319
they're not they're not doing it uh

1115
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:45,520
pre-infection

1116
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,200
they're wait till you're on your desktop

1117
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,839
so the full suite of services that

1118
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:51,040
microsoft

1119
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,079
app provides these these

1120
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:56,560
tests aren't really um these services

1121
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,119
aren't really

1122
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,480
fully implemented um in

1123
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,480
the uh evaluations that are being

1124
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,920
performed today

1125
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,000
and when i say that i'm referring to

1126
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,599
for example mitre

1127
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,720
miter ran a series

1128
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,119
miter is a non-profit organization that

1129
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,920
runs i'm sure you're familiar with them

1130
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,200
and forgive me i'm a little nervous it's

1131
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,960
my first time in front of you guys so

1132
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,119
treat me treat me kind and also

1133
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:26,880
interrupt it makes me feel great when

1134
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,480
you guys interrupt

1135
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,160
mitre has been around for a very long

1136
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,680
time they're a non-profit

1137
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,400
and every year they do um a very deep

1138
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,599
dive

1139
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:39,680
battle with all the top

1140
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,920
antivirus applications out there and

1141
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,680
microsoft did pretty well but they

1142
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,119
didn't include

1143
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:48,240
all of the suite of services that

1144
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,160
microsoft has

1145
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,359
to to help prevent um the the attacks

1146
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:54,079
that

1147
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,040
mitre through at the the software the

1148
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,400
antivirus software

1149
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,280
um so let's get into a little bit of

1150
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,160
what they offer

1151
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,079
so the full suite offers

1152
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,240
this cloud-based email filter solution

1153
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,400
that embeds directly with outlook

1154
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,599
um it also helps you through edge today

1155
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,800
to identify you on your network as

1156
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,119
an individual in your domain um and

1157
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,960
protects you against with behavioral

1158
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,800
analysis if you click on a link

1159
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,599
and you try to log in it'll protect you

1160
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:27,119
not only because it knows you but it's

1161
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:28,800
got a safe link component that'll

1162
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,000
identify and identify the link as

1163
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,319
as a bad link and not at the network

1164
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:35,520
layer block that link

1165
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,040
on on edge and then train all the other

1166
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,960
edge browsers in your tenant

1167
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,280
to block that that particular

1168
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,319
url so

1169
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:51,119
advanced protection for office

1170
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,040
behavioral analysis through

1171
00:45:53,040 --> 00:46:00,800
outlook and then um cloud-based

1172
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,240
endpoint behavioral cloud security

1173
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,200
threat intelligence uh managed detection

1174
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,119
and response

1175
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:14,400
um and then azure

1176
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,960
you're able to integrate directly into

1177
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,480
active directory as well

1178
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,920
i don't know how familiar you guys are

1179
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,760
with this platform um

1180
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,560
but you know behavioral analysis i i'm

1181
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,319
constantly receiving notifications on

1182
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:26,800
people

1183
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,720
and and what they're doing and attempts

1184
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,800
from various locations around the world

1185
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,119
um whether they're logging into a vpn or

1186
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,400
if they're on tour

1187
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,160
it's it's pretty powerful in its

1188
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,240
capabilities um

1189
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,440
but let's take a minute and look at the

1190
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,280
platform so the organization that i'm

1191
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,319
working with right now

1192
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:45,520
doesn't have um the the product

1193
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,160
implemented

1194
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,079
and i've run a couple of test scenarios

1195
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,000
for them and i wanted to walk through

1196
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,359
that with you now

1197
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:54,960
um so here's

1198
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,000
here's what it looks like it's um pretty

1199
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,400
straightforward

1200
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,319
not a lot to it but when you get down to

1201
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,400
the dashboard for your threat and

1202
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,520
vulnerability management

1203
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,800
your your main goal here as

1204
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,560
a security administrator for the most

1205
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,640
part is to

1206
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,079
keep your exposure scores down

1207
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,240
identify systems that are at risk

1208
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,359
but if you have enabled the capability

1209
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:28,240
to

1210
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,319
um through set one of several methods

1211
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:35,280
um reach out and manage your systems

1212
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,640
whether it's through configuration

1213
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,640
manager or

1214
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,559
if you have configured what is available

1215
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,160
today through

1216
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,359
um endpoint manager configured your

1217
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,200
system to be managed through

1218
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,599
your then you you can actually reach out

1219
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,839
and update the machine

1220
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:56,240
so here here's um here's the dashboard

1221
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:00,079
your exposure score

1222
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:03,760
likelihood of breaches to occur

1223
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:07,680
value related alerts

1224
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,879
discovered on the device

1225
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:16,240
and

1226
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,280
let me show you i'm currently logged

1227
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,559
into

1228
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:25,599
a machine that's hybridized

1229
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,040
and i just want to walk you through some

1230
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,960
of the cool features and before we talk

1231
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,200
much more about it

1232
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,880
i hear some people dropping off let me

1233
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,880
see if i can capture some

1234
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,079
inspiration all right so this machine

1235
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:39,440
i'm currently logged into

1236
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,599
it's hybrid managed so it's it's an

1237
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:43,040
active directory domain controlled

1238
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:43,760
machine

1239
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,160
that's updated very frequently um it

1240
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,359
belongs to

1241
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,480
a update

1242
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,359
service configuration manager service

1243
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:53,839
and

1244
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:55,839
if you've never been in this platform

1245
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:58,000
it's got a pretty neat feature

1246
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,480
where you can check out timelines and

1247
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,480
the timeline will go back as far as you

1248
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,079
want it to a thousand days

1249
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:07,280
is typically where it's set

1250
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,960
and you can gather any level of

1251
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,440
granularity you want

1252
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,119
so if i want to see um

1253
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,839
from the cloud any little bit of detail

1254
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:19,599
that's happened on this machine

1255
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,040
all i have to do is is

1256
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,720
highlight a chunk of time

1257
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:33,040
hope that my vpn doesn't crash

1258
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,319
and i'm able to navigate through i can i

1259
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:37,520
can set up alerts

1260
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,280
for different types of behavior

1261
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,359
escalated privileges

1262
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:44,640
or um specific types of of

1263
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,280
applications um that are are not

1264
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,400
permitted

1265
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,920
i could even set up controls through

1266
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,520
different policies that we'll walk in a

1267
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,640
second

1268
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,160
um so

1269
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,200
this is one of my favorite application

1270
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,520
features but um you can also

1271
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,599
now this is just the passive mode but

1272
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:06,880
you can still

1273
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,960
initiate things like a live response

1274
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:15,680
where i'm able to uh from the browser

1275
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,359
um set up a console

1276
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:22,270
or command line console directly to my

1277
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:23,440
[Music]

1278
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,839
managed posts

1279
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,680
so

1280
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:39,200
pretty robust system all in all for

1281
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,880
what it offers now um i haven't even

1282
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,559
talked about the capabilities with the

1283
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,400
virus protection yet we're just looking

1284
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,359
at the features for auditing

1285
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,920
and uh viewing the system and their

1286
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:54,880
resources

1287
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:59,119
so those are two of my favorite features

1288
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:00,480
of the tool

1289
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,520
now um

1290
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,440
vulnerabilities you can have i think the

1291
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,440
theoretical limit on this is

1292
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,040
not yet really discovered because you

1293
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,119
can provision it in a number of ways

1294
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:17,040
um but one of the things that i find

1295
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,960
most valuable is their ability to

1296
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:19,599
leverage

1297
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:22,400
um new and emerging threats from all

1298
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,440
tenants

1299
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,400
so literally any any microsoft tenant

1300
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,440
that's out there

1301
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,240
if they've found a new zero day or some

1302
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,079
kind of vulnerability they're able to

1303
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:33,040
share that across

1304
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,480
all tenants relatively near near real

1305
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,040
time

1306
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,079
um so

1307
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,640
it's um it's fairly quick in that

1308
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,240
respect i've seen them

1309
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,440
flag for instance last cve that showed

1310
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,200
up with chrome

1311
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,319
um it was out the same day probably

1312
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:54,160
within hours of it being posted

1313
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,319
so i'm i'm actually pretty impressed

1314
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:57,599
with this tool

1315
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:59,920
um

1316
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:06,079
let's see here now one thing i haven't

1317
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:07,520
been able to set up for this particular

1318
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,599
client yet is the

1319
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,760
uh very powerful um

1320
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,240
remediation feature and that's what i

1321
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,680
was hoping to be able to provide you

1322
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,319
today

1323
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:19,839
i was working on it this afternoon

1324
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,280
there's there's a lot of missing parts

1325
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,880
to it for this org

1326
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,599
um the remediation function gives you

1327
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:27,280
the ability to set up different tiers

1328
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,079
within your organ

1329
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,599
with your your company or for the

1330
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:32,000
company you're working for um

1331
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,559
you can establish a security tiered

1332
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,800
system or embed functions here

1333
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,680
for for uh patching and security updates

1334
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,400
with your help

1335
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,599
desk um that involves you know

1336
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:47,119
strictly patching

1337
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:49,599
and tier one tier two tier three you can

1338
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:50,559
provision those

1339
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,319
those responsibilities and various

1340
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,079
levels

1341
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:58,240
of functionality

1342
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,119
um software or software inventory across

1343
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:02,640
your organization is also pretty

1344
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,680
fantastic

1345
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,480
you know at a glance real time across

1346
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,680
your company

1347
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:11,040
um one portal and now

1348
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,559
i think one of the most important things

1349
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:14,000
for a lot of organizations is

1350
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,040
identifying that

1351
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,280
you know this stuff comes with a 59 a

1352
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,800
month subscription

1353
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,000
and it's less if you're um

1354
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,359
e5 or a

1355
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:28,240
college or an educational institution

1356
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,559
right so here's your subscription model

1357
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:34,240
and so if you're an e5 subscription

1358
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,400
you're you're able to receive all of

1359
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,839
these features

1360
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,839
you know at that cost and then an

1361
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:40,880
additional 20

1362
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,640
a month per user and each user each user

1363
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,440
has up to five licenses for uh each

1364
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,400
machine

1365
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,760
um you know for five different machines

1366
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,359
and that includes

1367
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:56,559
linux apple products and

1368
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:58,960
yes this antivirus solution does work

1369
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,760
with linux on various files systems

1370
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:05,040
uh fairly fairly well so we're talking

1371
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,079
about features

1372
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:09,359
host uh host based post intrusion host

1373
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:09,839
uh

1374
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:11,680
post-based intrusion detection

1375
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:12,960
protection

1376
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:18,000
um detection um

1377
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:25,839
pretty decent tool for the money the

1378
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:29,359
full disk encryption capabilities are

1379
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:32,640
all manageable through here

1380
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,640
and again this is just what we're

1381
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,720
looking at on the screen

1382
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,559
is primarily just the security center

1383
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:44,079
features

1384
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:46,559
now i don't know if you're familiar with

1385
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,079
the subscription for

1386
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:52,079
um e5 and what autopilot

1387
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:55,119
or intune what these terms represent but

1388
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:58,480
with the microsoft 365 subscription

1389
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,920
you you receive the ability in this e5

1390
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:02,799
subscription

1391
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:06,000
to utilize you know

1392
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,920
one license um and be able to

1393
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:14,640
deploy um through the cloud

1394
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,040
to you you basically can send your user

1395
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:17,839
a laptop

1396
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:20,960
and a an email address and autopilot

1397
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,000
this this platform will will perform the

1398
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,599
rest of those features

1399
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:28,079
so the configuration is all policy

1400
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:28,960
driven

1401
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,440
um as it would be in in an active

1402
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,400
directory domain controlling world

1403
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,599
so you know and um feel free to you know

1404
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:39,119
jump in there with any kind of questions

1405
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:41,119
that you may have

1406
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:43,839
but um your endpoint security baseline

1407
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:44,960
configurations

1408
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,839
are are you know um sort of what you

1409
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:49,440
find in active directory what they're

1410
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,680
doing is provisioning out things like

1411
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,599
you know network time protocol and

1412
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,960
they're throwing them into

1413
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,280
your security baselines the things that

1414
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,559
would typically be baseline

1415
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:00,079
configuration items

1416
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:02,160
they're moving them into um

1417
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,240
security-based line configurations

1418
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,799
and and they're kind of moving away from

1419
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:07,599
this um

1420
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:09,440
you know active directory domain

1421
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,359
controlling uh on-premises

1422
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:13,520
idea and they're moving into or they're

1423
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:14,480
actually really trying to move

1424
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,200
organizations away from even a hybrid

1425
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,720
managed idea it would appear

1426
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,359
it's um it looks like it's in there in

1427
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:25,119
their future business model even from

1428
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:27,680
some of the things i'm reading

1429
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,079
there's a gigantic push for many

1430
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:32,640
organizations to move into the cloud

1431
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,960
and i'm receiving a lot of calls for

1432
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,880
disaster recovery it's another reason

1433
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,079
i'm really interested in the

1434
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:41,280
in the uh emp brief that's that's coming

1435
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,880
up here pretty soon

1436
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:47,359
um but you know as i was mentioning

1437
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:50,799
the the antivirus application is just a

1438
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:52,799
small component of the overall advanced

1439
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:54,319
threat protection tool

1440
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:57,359
and it it marries with many features it

1441
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:58,640
marries with

1442
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,040
information protection it marries with

1443
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,240
data

1444
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,520
labeling across different platforms

1445
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,400
and this tool called wip for example

1446
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,280
which

1447
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,680
prohibits you from copying and pasting

1448
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,280
across different types of

1449
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,079
applications

1450
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,319
it's it's pretty interesting it breaks a

1451
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:20,160
lot of things too it can be frustrating

1452
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,839
in that regard but

1453
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:26,319
i'm seeing a lot of push to move many

1454
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:29,520
many clients in this direction so um

1455
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,720
you know one of the reasons i reached

1456
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,319
out to rod was just to see what the

1457
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:33,440
interest was

1458
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,040
uh for my own sake i wonder i was

1459
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,640
interested to see how many people were

1460
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,280
really

1461
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,160
you know kind of motivated into learning

1462
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,040
more about this

1463
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,920
on their own um before i spent a lot of

1464
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:44,240
time

1465
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,280
investing myself in

1466
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:51,040
in um in this this technology

1467
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,559
to determine whether or not i was

1468
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:54,640
interested in mastering it

1469
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,760
i i i find that i'm i'm i can make

1470
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,400
anything work within it that i need to

1471
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,599
but um i'm not necessarily a master yet

1472
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:05,839
right that would take a a little bit

1473
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:06,880
more work

1474
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,480
on my part but um it is it is quite

1475
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,520
unique

1476
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,319
um it's not that challenging to deploy

1477
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:15,520
as a matter of fact

1478
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,240
um i started to set up a deployment

1479
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:18,880
locally

1480
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,480
to try to walk through with you guys

1481
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,119
quickly but it failed of course

1482
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:24,960
so i i'm unable to do that with you

1483
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,480
unfortunately but

1484
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,920
um i wanted to show you

1485
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,839
what are the challenges oh i see some

1486
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:33,440
questions popping up but i'm missing

1487
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,280
them

1488
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,599
let's um let me see if i can find those

1489
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:39,920
anybody wanna

1490
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,200
i you know the other thing is i'm a

1491
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,200
little okay i can i can read you the

1492
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,160
question

1493
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,280
just uh this is what are the challenges

1494
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,040
when moving from traditional ad

1495
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,119
versus i guess the sure ad hybrid

1496
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:55,040
infrastructure to a more pure

1497
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:58,880
e5 asia only environment

1498
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,720
dude i'm so glad you asked that man they

1499
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,000
don't they don't merge

1500
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,880
any policies they don't have policies

1501
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:05,280
man

1502
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,400
um so if you're an org and also

1503
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,839
you you have to query um azure ad

1504
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,520
and you're on premises say d they don't

1505
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,040
marry one to one you have to write

1506
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:15,839
queries

1507
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:20,000
and um so and those queries are complex

1508
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
and it's driven by this thing called ad

1509
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,040
connect

1510
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,040
and and that's a whole that's a whole

1511
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,640
course in and of itself

1512
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,480
and and the permissions just just to

1513
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,839
have the permissions work for the

1514
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:30,400
software

1515
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,960
you have to be a local um you have to be

1516
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,160
a local domain

1517
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,960
enterprise admin you have to be a global

1518
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:39,520
owner for your e5 account which means

1519
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,839
if you walk into a company and you want

1520
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:42,559
this to work

1521
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:45,599
you have to you have to be the owner

1522
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,440
or you have to have owner level

1523
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,440
permissions to get this thing to work

1524
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,040
right and it's a pain

1525
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:54,559
you know it so i i find that if you

1526
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:57,280
if you end up in a situation where where

1527
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:57,839
like me

1528
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:02,319
where you're dealing with clients man

1529
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:05,200
make sure make sure they know um to

1530
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,640
think about it ahead of time as a matter

1531
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:07,119
of fact

1532
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:10,319
microsoft set up a whole framework to

1533
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:12,480
try to sort out

1534
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,760
this problem ahead of time um and i i've

1535
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:16,079
got

1536
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,400
a list

1537
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,880
you know kind of where it goes wrong

1538
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,240
they built a whole framework around the

1539
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,079
idea of that question

1540
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:33,359
because this this client

1541
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:37,759
oh it's terrible so

1542
01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:43,040
um

1543
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:46,160
having so many deployment types from

1544
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,680
azure to your end point

1545
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,359
you have at least three different ways

1546
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:52,960
you can manage your end points

1547
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,720
um hybrid straight as or co-managed

1548
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,319
which is from on-premises

1549
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:00,000
you walk out the door and now you're on

1550
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,920
your own network but it's managed by

1551
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,960
either or and both so

1552
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,079
it's it's a very convoluted environment

1553
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:11,359
um to try to master but um in about a

1554
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:12,319
year and a half

1555
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,640
when they've they've got the environment

1556
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,920
complete it'll be

1557
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,440
hopefully a lot easier to deal with

1558
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,680
in my opinion microsoft has zero

1559
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,240
credibility what was that

1560
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,799
i missed the question again hey daryl oh

1561
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:28,640
would you want to ask a question or

1562
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:31,920
i can read it yeah yeah and and uh

1563
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:35,280
again to rob this is really

1564
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,119
very good information because i've been

1565
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:38,400
actually struggling for many months

1566
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,960
contact microsoft for this because i'm

1567
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,359
my work and my guys are very impacted by

1568
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:44,480
this i'm i

1569
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,160
i'm not sure if anybody from my work is

1570
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,520
on this too but uh um

1571
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,280
first and foremost brian would you mind

1572
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,640
uh sharing that

1573
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,960
website that that shows the breakdown of

1574
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,319
the license because um

1575
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:57,839
i am a state and education entity so

1576
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:01,039
we are looking at g3 g5 but actually we

1577
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:02,880
have something called a call academic

1578
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:03,440
like

1579
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:07,520
this g3 g5 e3 e5 a3 e5

1580
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,760
so we will get academics so we have 80

1581
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,119
to 85 upgrade

1582
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:12,880
and your things that you showed that

1583
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,039
comparison would be awesome

1584
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,880
if you can share that and um this word

1585
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,720
document go through

1586
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,280
all of that um why don't you call me

1587
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,799
directly because that's uh

1588
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:24,799
that i have a whole lot of information

1589
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:25,839
yeah

1590
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:28,400
please please if you can hit the flight

1591
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,319
that would be awesome

1592
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:33,440
yeah absolutely yeah i don't want that

1593
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:34,960
to go to waste that's one of the reasons

1594
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,319
that's another reason i want to do this

1595
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:36,799
too is

1596
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:39,280
that so i did so much work on that in

1597
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:40,400
particular

1598
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,920
uh i don't want it to go to waste and if

1599
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,000
you can use it the a5 and e5 are very

1600
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:44,640
similar

1601
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,880
but your state your state um has a

1602
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,480
contract has a

1603
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,039
state vendor and that state licensing

1604
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:51,599
vendor

1605
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:53,440
they have they're obligated to work with

1606
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,599
you and whoever did that purchase

1607
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:57,119
they have to give you that guy's

1608
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:59,760
information or that gal's information

1609
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,280
right you should be allowed to contact

1610
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,880
them directly but i can explain to you

1611
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,400
the hurdles i went to and give you the

1612
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:04,880
light

1613
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,920
documents that i saved dude i spent i

1614
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:08,480
spent

1615
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,359
three days and nights reviewing all of

1616
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:13,200
the licenses to understand this

1617
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,599
convoluted issue what it boils down to

1618
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:17,599
is you need a license for the machine

1619
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:19,599
and you end up needing a license

1620
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:23,119
for the user um unless you use

1621
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:26,400
in tune for education and you do it

1622
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,160
correctly which is the way that

1623
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:29,920
microsoft wants you to do it from the

1624
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:30,799
cloud

1625
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:33,119
and all all state-run organizations want

1626
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:35,280
to keep their bloated it infrastructure

1627
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,720
this is a 5-6 million dollar i.t

1628
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,440
infrastructure you know annual budget

1629
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,200
just for their it infrastructure so

1630
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,559
they're never going to come down off of

1631
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:45,680
that platform

1632
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:48,480
so you're they're kind of forcing me to

1633
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,319
help them along

1634
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:53,280
but they don't really want change so

1635
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:53,920
it's

1636
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:56,400
it's a it's just a it's a very

1637
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,760
convoluted issue but i'm more than happy

1638
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:58,559
to

1639
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:00,319
help you out man i got a lot of info on

1640
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:02,160
that stuff thank you

1641
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,319
that'd be a huge favor um yeah yeah

1642
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:06,000
awesome if you can connect thank you rob

1643
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
for bringing brian on this man

1644
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
of course uh but brian i have a question

1645
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,240
this this uh

1646
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,400
is this running is this an agent that

1647
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,680
you have to deploy and that they should

1648
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,680
do everything else or

1649
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,119
well yeah let's let's take a second and

1650
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:21,280
look at the end point um it it has

1651
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,920
a sensor that runs locally and it is

1652
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,119
agent right so

1653
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:28,720
it's this security center um agent right

1654
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,880
so i i ran a query of it to make sure it

1655
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,079
was still running

1656
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:34,480
and so this query i ran the security

1657
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:35,440
center query

1658
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,319
fence and here it is it says all right

1659
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:38,880
hey

1660
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,039
it's running its own process it's not

1661
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:42,000
stoppable

1662
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,480
you can't pause it and it ignores all

1663
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,079
attempts to shut it down

1664
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:49,359
so this in in this instance right here

1665
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:52,720
um on on this machine it's very unique

1666
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,640
because this organization

1667
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:58,960
runs um a primary called cisco amp

1668
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:02,240
and cisco amp is a great question

1669
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:05,359
cisco amp um costs like 80 000

1670
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:08,880
a month and they can't move away from it

1671
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,319
for some of the features that they use

1672
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:11,839
at a network level

1673
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:14,880
and so it's it's it's interesting

1674
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,640
um but i was able to talk them into

1675
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,319
running it in passive mode so that they

1676
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:20,240
could learn from the experience of what

1677
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:20,559
uh

1678
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:24,240
microsoft offers so um

1679
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,240
they're trying it out and it turns it

1680
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:27,520
turns out that

1681
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,200
if you want to use all of the other

1682
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,119
features

1683
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:34,720
you have to use windows antivirus

1684
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:37,359
first for example the other behavioral

1685
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:38,240
analytics

1686
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,880
sensors all of the cloud-based analytics

1687
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:43,280
the other threat intelligence features

1688
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:46,640
um the you know the neural network

1689
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,440
uh behavioral analytics stuff that will

1690
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,119
segment an entire network

1691
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:54,240
if it feels that it's in danger those

1692
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:56,079
type of things those manage detection

1693
01:05:56,079 --> 01:05:58,400
and response that part of atp when it's

1694
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,599
configured correctly

1695
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:02,160
that threat response mechanism those

1696
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,359
things

1697
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:07,359
you need to have atp antivirus running

1698
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:08,799
as your primary

1699
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:11,039
and microsoft's made it very clear right

1700
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:12,319
here you can run

1701
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:15,039
you can run you can turn it off and run

1702
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:15,520
any

1703
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,520
any antivirus this is probably a class

1704
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,520
action suit that took them there

1705
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:23,280
you can run any antivirus you want to

1706
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,880
um you know

1707
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,119
these are do you want to run it yes or

1708
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:30,480
no these are the

1709
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,559
these are the repercussions maybe i can

1710
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:35,359
bring this site up

1711
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,960
so is this is does this has any relation

1712
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:39,760
with uh

1713
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,319
with sentinel or is this a different

1714
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:44,880
interface

1715
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:47,839
on the machine or in the cloud from the

1716
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:50,559
management perspective

1717
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:54,559
well this is this um the overall

1718
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:57,680
the management perspective is

1719
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:01,599
this endpoint um microsoft endpoint

1720
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:02,720
management

1721
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,359
admin center and in the future it's all

1722
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:05,920
going to be

1723
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,640
endpoint manager and that's where

1724
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:09,839
they're moving towards

1725
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:13,599
for all endpoints but then it right now

1726
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:16,720
they've gotten it's broken down into

1727
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:21,119
security center and further into the atp

1728
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:24,400
um defender portion but in the future

1729
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,920
it's it's strictly going to be

1730
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:30,559
endpoint manager endpoint manager

1731
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:34,000
security center in particular

1732
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,880
i see this is this is pretty interesting

1733
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,599
thank you for presenting this this is

1734
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:42,240
and i'm sure this cost a lot of money

1735
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:42,640
too

1736
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:46,559
this doesn't look like it's smb friendly

1737
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:49,119
no no no i you know you can set this up

1738
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,640
with the e5

1739
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:53,680
you can get yourself an e5 account and

1740
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:56,079
set this up on your own get a trial

1741
01:07:56,079 --> 01:07:58,960
get e5 run a couple of virtual machines

1742
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,480
set up some stuff local

1743
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,720
and i mean they give you a 200 a month

1744
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:03,599
credit

1745
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:05,599
um if you have your own company i

1746
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:07,119
established my own company

1747
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:09,039
so i'm an owner and i'm just running

1748
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:10,559
through my family members

1749
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:12,319
and continuing different trials through

1750
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:14,160
my family

1751
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,238
so it's been it really works it really

1752
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:17,359
works well

1753
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:20,319
in that regard i set up so here's

1754
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:22,238
another really cool thing

1755
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:24,799
configuration manager for example you

1756
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:26,560
can set up configuration manager

1757
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,080
if you're familiar with that suite of

1758
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,759
services it's a very

1759
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:32,319
um good platform for managing entire

1760
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:33,359
organizations

1761
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:37,279
you can configure that for a cloud um

1762
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:40,560
uh based platform as well and you can

1763
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,238
configure it with the cloud

1764
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:45,040
management gateway so that it can it can

1765
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:45,839
manage your

1766
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:49,600
cloud um uh your cloud systems it'll

1767
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,960
manage all of your assure

1768
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,120
assets your azure assets so when

1769
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:55,439
somebody walks out of your building

1770
01:08:55,439 --> 01:08:57,439
uh no matter what they're connected to

1771
01:08:57,439 --> 01:08:59,120
they don't even need a vpn

1772
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,479
you're still going to have a a

1773
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:02,319
connection through 443.

1774
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:04,719
it it's it's a pretty amazing system so

1775
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:06,479
you save on any vpn costs

1776
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:09,439
you're you're leveraging you know um you

1777
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:09,679
know

1778
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:13,439
ssl 2a uh to a pki

1779
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:16,880
and it's it's legitimately managing your

1780
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,560
installations of updates and different

1781
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,158
especially now with cloven and people

1782
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:24,158
working remotely

1783
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:25,520
you're really making advancements in

1784
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,600
this technology i like the uh

1785
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,759
i like the the terminal the terminal

1786
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:31,679
when used when you

1787
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:33,839
when you did the remedy8 or action i

1788
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:34,719
think it was

1789
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:36,880
that you were able to open the terminal

1790
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,080
on the client that was

1791
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,158
that was pretty cool it reminded me i

1792
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:44,080
think carbon black has something similar

1793
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,640
oh man i'm so disappointed because i

1794
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,000
really was excited to show

1795
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,158
you the full remediation features

1796
01:09:50,158 --> 01:09:51,040
because

1797
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,359
you can you can you can drill down to

1798
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:55,520
where you can install msis and different

1799
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,520
applications directly on the system but

1800
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,040
there's there's a lot more work that has

1801
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:00,480
to be done with this tenant

1802
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:04,480
in order in order for that to happen uh

1803
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:08,000
yeah here's another question

1804
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,040
with defender atp does microsoft provide

1805
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:14,000
direct support with the implementation

1806
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,280
malware analysis

1807
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,520
and forensic or this is done by a

1808
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,560
microsoft

1809
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:22,239
authorized reseller oh that's all that's

1810
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:22,800
all you

1811
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,360
and they will help you that's all that's

1812
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:26,880
all based on you

1813
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,800
all of the other tenants in the world

1814
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,400
that are contributing to the machine

1815
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,920
learning and artificial intelligence

1816
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,199
beasts that they have

1817
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:36,719
under the under the hood um and and

1818
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:38,719
you can call them for direct support

1819
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:40,239
they're investing a billion dollars a

1820
01:10:40,239 --> 01:10:42,080
year into this infrastructure to become

1821
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,520
best of breed

1822
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,679
you know a long time ago i lost all face

1823
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:46,960
all faith in them

1824
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:50,400
but i've i've through this um

process i have

1829
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:01,600
kind of regained any any faith lost

1830
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,920
because of of what they've um what

1831
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,520
they've accomplished

1832
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,600
it with with respect to cloud-based

1833
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,520
endpoint management

1834
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:12,640
um this there are some ignite

1835
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,480
presentations and i'll make this

1836
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:17,520
this flow uh presentation flow available

1837
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:18,400
to you

1838
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,719
but there are um some microsoft ignite

1839
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:23,040
presentations made available in the last

1840
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:23,840
year

1841
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:28,159
that walk you through um you know these

1842
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:30,800
these beta released features that

1843
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:31,920
they're moving to mark

1844
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,480
rapidly the subscription models are by

1845
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:35,760
far the way to go

1846
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,080
and um the government the reason why

1847
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,159
jedi is a 10 billion dollar product that

1848
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:42,159
our project that is going to microsoft

1849
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:44,640
it's already approved in dod by the way

1850
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:47,280
is because of this implementation this

1851
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,320
implementation

1852
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:49,920
where you can push updates from the

1853
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,400
cloud remotely securely to end points

1854
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:55,199
across any network across any boundaries

1855
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:57,760
uh is is by far probably the coolest

1856
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:00,480
thing that i've seen

1857
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:04,719
in a long time yeah this looks like uh

1858
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:07,360
this looks like it did i you know what i

1859
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:09,120
at one point in my career i

1860
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,920
administered a lot of red points and

1861
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:13,679
this looks like it would have helped

1862
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:17,679
me save a lot of traveling

1863
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,560
yeah i wish i wished i had bookmarked a

1864
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:23,600
couple of these

1865
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,320
oh here might be a good part but um i

1866
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,960
haven't booked mark

1867
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:31,520
um so currently where they where they

1868
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:32,000
are

1869
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,920
they they don't have the full endpoint

1870
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,600
management integration available where

1871
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:36,080
you could

1872
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,400
are basically rdp into an endpoint from

1873
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,280
anywhere

1874
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,840
but um what they do have is a desk

1875
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,360
desktop analytics

1876
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:46,080
with the ability to pivot to pivot into

1877
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,120
real times

1878
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:50,320
to view what the user's got going on on

1879
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:51,360
their system

1880
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:54,560
and to uninstall ad ad

1881
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:58,320
features and um it's it's pretty intense

1882
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,600
for endpoint management it's pretty

1883
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,520
intense um so they've they're

1884
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,040
integrating

1885
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:06,239
help desk and also

1886
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:09,120
the features of security engineers you

1887
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:09,360
know

1888
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:12,719
right now as we speak i think i lost my

1889
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:15,920
um my

1890
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,840
vpn yeah my vpn

1891
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:23,360
yeah no worries

1892
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:27,839
um but with that you know that was

1893
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:31,520
that was that was that was the demo

1894
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:34,000
yeah yeah so we'll see if that comes

1895
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,159
back online

1896
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:39,679
anybody has any other questions uh yeah

1897
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:42,960
i have a question uh um

1898
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:46,800
if it's okay um the the um

1899
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,159
it's pretty cool that you mentioned

1900
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:50,159
because um previous job

1901
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:53,520
i was uh running um ec2 instances and

1902
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,679
the endpoint protection i put which is

1903
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:56,960
in you know of course

1904
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:01,040
purely cloud aws richard micro and i

1905
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:02,080
know trend micro

1906
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:05,199
and runs pretty much intense there's a

1907
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:05,679
very

1908
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:09,120
powerful edrs um in their uh cloud

1909
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,000
environment

1910
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,719
now uh just take a step back here at my

1911
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:13,280
work

1912
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,440
we have defender adp of course this uh

1913
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,440
what i took over from my work

1914
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:21,199
at that workstations level and so

1915
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:24,640
once we go cloud and should we stand

1916
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,480
about ec2 instance

1917
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:29,120
is defender adp also has the same

1918
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,159
capability to go

1919
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:32,960
edr just like in comparisons to what

1920
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,199
trend micro crowd strike is or

1921
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:38,960
is defender adp more best um

1922
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:42,159
kept as the local uh level as of

1923
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:43,520
in-house

1924
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,840
workstation based endpoint uh i'm not

1925
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,040
sure even if it

1926
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:48,960
to my prior question that i posted even

1927
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,880
if it's even if it is

1928
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,199
considered a full-blown edr so i'm kind

1929
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:54,960
of in a dilemma with that and i thought

1930
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,159
you could fill me in because

1931
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:58,320
when i asked this question to microsoft

1932
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,239
they give me like a hail sales pitch

1933
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:01,840
which doesn't help

1934
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,440
yeah they're not there yet no they're

1935
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,040
not they're not there yet but i

1936
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:07,280
i think they will be and i what they're

1937
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:09,520
doing is actively building problems for

1938
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:10,080
for

1939
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,199
their competitors and they're going to

1940
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:13,280
get sued i guarantee it i'm already

1941
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:14,640
seeing it with some of the things some

1942
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,560
of the things they're doing

1943
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,560
um they're built i i don't think that

1944
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,840
maybe they're not doing it on purpose

1945
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:20,719
but with the new

1946
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:24,000
with the new releases they're they're um

1947
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
either they're cutting corners or or

1948
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,199
something because

1949
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:30,719
um you know um i'm noticing that

1950
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:34,000
for example tetra is cisco's amps

1951
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:39,440
um offline scanning

1952
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:42,239
implementation and it will destroy your

1953
01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:44,000
system if you try to leave it

1954
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,480
implemented with defender even in

1955
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:47,760
passive mode so

1956
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,199
you know there's there are some things

1957
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:51,040
that are starting to not play well

1958
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:53,840
with the later releases of of defender

1959
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:54,480
anything

1960
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:57,199
and it's just kind of interesting but

1961
01:15:57,199 --> 01:15:57,679
they're

1962
01:15:57,679 --> 01:15:59,600
they're trying to be the best of breed

1963
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,719
and they're working really hard to

1964
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:04,080
elbow people out so i wouldn't be

1965
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,320
surprised if uh they catch up with trend

1966
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:06,960
micro

1967
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,560
i think trend micro is the best at ebr

1968
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,320
right now but one of the best

1969
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,880
um but these guys will catch up you'll

1970
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:13,920
see them catch up

1971
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,239
i mean this is microsoft microsoft knows

1972
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:19,199
microsoft better than anybody

1973
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:20,719
well you else the reason i asked this

1974
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:22,640
right because if you look at the state

1975
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:24,159
level of california they are very

1976
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:25,920
strongly promoting our

1977
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:28,080
crowd striking and yes i did use trend

1978
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:30,080
micro and i agree trend micro is very

1979
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:31,600
well established

1980
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,360
and yeah the reason i asked this was

1981
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:34,640
because there is a lot of

1982
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:37,760
um um i'm not sure rumor or you know

1983
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,320
enough evidence out there microsoft has

1984
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:41,440
to go out there

1985
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:42,960
and just those things are there to

1986
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,440
compete and um if it's a product not

1987
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:49,280
yet then then there's an issue

1988
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:52,239
yeah yeah you'll see things start to

1989
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:52,640
break

1990
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:55,280
eventually i guarantee it and then trend

1991
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:56,640
friend micro will start spending

1992
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:57,600
resources

1993
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,239
to update their software to conform

1994
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:02,239
it'll get messy um

1995
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:05,600
probably because the the next release of

1996
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,760
of windows that that is is reported to

1997
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,280
be and i had to build a gantt chart

1998
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,239
about this

1999
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:12,320
and the next release is due like

2000
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:15,199
november of next year

2001
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:17,120
and so that release is supposed to be

2002
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:20,080
fully uh capable of supporting

2003
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:23,360
um the full

2004
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,960
suite of services available with

2005
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,400
endpoint management and

2006
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,560
you know the full the first version of

2007
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,880
the full suite of anything is never

2008
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:33,040
is never going to work very well so i

2009
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:34,800
would assume by 2022

2010
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:38,080
february um into

2011
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:41,280
that's what come on bro we have a zero

2012
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:44,080
day went down

2013
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:46,880
exactly exactly but it's worth looking

2014
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:47,440
at man

2015

okay no doubt yeah i kind of like it the

2083
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:46,000
way you laid out

2084
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,679
because like you know i was saying

2085
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:51,840
microsoft is a very large enterprise and

2086
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,760
they make it so complicated that all

2087
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,120
these products they have it's all

2088
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:56,880
different places and and

2089
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,520
i know they like to enterprise

2090
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:00,000
themselves

2091
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,239
so large and when they try to compete on

2092
01:21:02,239 --> 01:21:03,280
security level

2093
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,639
they have all these cracks that they

2094
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:06,560
create so sometimes it's

2095
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:10,080
really a big um uh yes

2096
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:11,679
trying to understand them so but and i

2097
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:13,440
like the way you did your what up

2098
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,360

2099
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:17,360
