and we try to help people get jobs in

46
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,799
infosec we try to

47
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,079
learn ourselves by putting

48
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,640
ourselves to do research share that

49
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,520
research

50
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,200
uh we build up teams to do competitions

51
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,120
and we try to do events that basically

52
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,959
our community makes sense

53
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,440
we don't charge anything the only thing

54
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,959
that costs here is your time

55
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,400
that you're going to invest in learning

56
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,280
new things

57
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,640
in this times we we have helped people

58
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,000
uh there's been some people affected by

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,599
unfortunately by the layoffs but

60
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,519
i have to say that we as a sector has

61
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,040
been we have been

62
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,120
very lucky we haven't been affected as

63
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,400
bad so

64
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,959
those who lost their jobs had actually

65
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,319
found jobs pretty quick

66
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,599
and i'm happy to say that if you are a

67
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,760
need of help

68
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,680
and need um maybe uh

69
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,480
somebody that can guide you or or in

70
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,840
terms of of

71
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,480
infosec job uh many of us are aware of

72
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,280
the

73
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,080
opening positions i posted all the time

74
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,120
in discord

75
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,200
there's like-minded people there just

76
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,800
like you are either studying or trying

77
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,159
to find a job

78
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,360
so we try to give support to those who

79
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,519
um are basically trying to

80
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,440
get better careers and make a better

81
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,720
living

82
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,800
so with that in mind we will be

83
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,640

84
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,000
on our last meeting of the year

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,920

86
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,280

87
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,560

everybody being here

110
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,600
um i'll jump into this right away

111
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,759
just because we'll see how long it takes

112
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,720
and i've given some

113
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,360
examples that i will uh also show on the

114
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,400
presentation

115
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,400
i just suggest that if you have any

116
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,000
questions kind of hold it towards the

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,120
end so

118
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,440
my goal is to make sure that we meet the

119
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,320
slides

120
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,240
and finish the presentation so that you

121
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,240
can see the entire process so

122
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,720
uh yeah uh pii as you can see it's a

123
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,440
very much

124
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,440
personal data that we cannot get it to

125
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,880
compromise so i'll

126
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,440
show you what the presentation has to

127
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,919
speak of itself

128
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,479
as you can see yeah pii stands for of

129
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,400
course personal identifier

130
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,960
identifiable information uh it's

131
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,919
something that is

132
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,880
uh of very much for yourself you know

133
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,240
that identifies you

134
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,440
and only you as a very own individual um

135
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,320
you know and you

136
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,400
we all know in the u.s here the biggest

137
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,240
example is your social security number

138
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,960
right

139
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,560
i mean once you get your social security

140
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,400
number compromised it's

141
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,520
pretty practically impossible to clean

142
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,240
that up so

143
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,560
you have to go through a lot of hoops

144
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,360
and ties

145
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,960
um you know of course we all know the

146
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,280
pii is the primary

147
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,479
uh attack vector uh when it comes to

148
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,160
identity theft in this country and

149
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,440
that's the main thing that people go for

150
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,120
when they try to steal your data

151
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,320
uh when they wanna disguise us um

152
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,800
you of course you know the show security

153
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,759
is directly

154
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,000
related to you it's something we call a

155
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,039
primary key

156
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,360
of your personal data uh it relates to

157
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,560
you and only you

158
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,720
just like for example a vin number is to

159
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,160
a vehicle or

160
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,360
um using isbn number to a book

161
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,600
the shell secured number is only you uh

162
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,160
in this entire universe it's just you

163
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,039
the other forms of pii that identifies

164
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:07,360
you

165
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,600
uh that can carry significance or damage

166
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,120
if compromise is of course

167
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,800
driving license you know that only

168
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,199
belongs to you uh your email of course

169
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:15,600
you know

170
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,039
you'll be surprised to know because when

171
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,319
somebody sends you an email it's just

172
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,199
only you right

173
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,360
um that you know you cannot afford to

174
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,639
get compromised

175
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,080
of course your signature that's very

176
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,000
critical because signature is

177
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,319
primarily heavily used in your banking

178
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,240
financial informations

179
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,479
of course your passport number you don't

180
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,280
want somebody to

181
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,360
duplicate your passport and of course

182
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,479
most important

183
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,840
we don't want somebody to rob you of

184
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,080
your finances your bank your

185
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,600
credit card number is of course very

186
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,199
critical to you

187
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,440
you know of course medical records some

188
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,560
people may not realize

189
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,280
the the damage it can do to you of

190
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:49,599
course

191
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,759
medical record numbers falls under a

192
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,080
subcategory called phi

193
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,319
that's also very important you know you

194
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,479
want to make sure that doctor people

195
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,759
have the right you know information

196
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,680
they're doing the right surgery on you

197
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,919
right diagnosis and things like that you

198
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,280
don't want something be wrong happening

199
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,919
to you and the operating table

200
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,280
something you want to be very careful

201
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,160
about and when two things put together

202
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,400
your full name and your date of birth

203
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,800
does become your pii

204
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,479
because remember just your name by

205
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,639
itself like john smith

206
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,560
there's hundreds of john smiths out

207
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,759
there does not itself speak of pii

208
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,199
and now that is your independent date of

209
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,599
birth because for example my birthday

210
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,280
was last week november 2nd there's

211
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,039
hundreds of people born on november 2nd

212
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:33,599
so

213
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,280
those two individually by itself doesn't

214
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,199
carry any weight but when put together

215
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,319
they become very legal

216
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,639
i'm sorry oh

217
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,720
uh your phone number uh workforce in

218
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,160
active mode um

219
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,440
when your phone number is tied to you

220
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,800
of course it's very important but of

221
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,280
course if you change your phone number

222
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,440
that becomes not really apparent to you

223
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,440
certain things like your home address

224
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,000
becomes debatable

225
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,080
cannot really be considered as pii from

226
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,440
what i was reading because

227
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,120
today you can own the home tomorrow you

228
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,479
can sell that home so

229
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,479
there's certain things that will not

230
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,800
necessarily be a pii so you just

231
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,280
got away uh what's important to you so

232
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,160
um so how do you protect your personal

233
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,160
data um as you can see you know personal

234
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,160
identifying information

235
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,080
uh basically right now during the covert

236
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,599
times is

237
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,159
getting pretty much more in demand the

238
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,599
threat actors pretty much you know

239
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,440
they're sitting home being idle being

240
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,679
bored um of course doing a lot of cyber

241
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,839
attacks um here and there

242
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,839
a pi is of course very much important to

243
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,440
each and every one of us right

244
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,519
it's surprising to see how much of our

245
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,800
personal data can be found on google

246
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,720
not something that you want people to

247
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,000
have public access to

248
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,720
like private investigators they can

249
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,640
easily run your information and

250
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,560
who knows what they can use that for or

251
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,839
sell that to

252
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,040
um this webinar that i'm doing is

253
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,360
pretty much internet give you a high

254
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,680
level to see how your information can be

255
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,720
found online and

256
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,680
what you can do as a baseline uh to

257
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,200
extract your pii off

258
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,800
google you know and just kind of clear

259
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,279
yourself from a lot of data libraries so

260
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,480
something is better than nothing

261
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,440
what we're going to use is a ccpa which

262
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,160
is california consumer privacy act

263
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,880
using that as an example a driver point

264
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,480
how we can use that to

265
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,600
remove your pir online using a

266
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,800
concept called opt out from common data

267
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,240
brokers this is something that's new

268
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,160
that's coming in play

269
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,760
and what happened was you can see in the

270
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,640
past we have gdpr which is

271
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,120
very relevant to europe a regulation

272
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,640
that they follow

273
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,360
they have that but their default nature

274
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,760
is opt-in which means if you want to be

275
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,720
available for any other general public

276
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,120
you have to obtain according to gdpr

277
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,240
for here is vice versa for us

278
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,880
the ccpa came in play because of gdpr

279
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,079
that's how ccpa came into effect but

280
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,920
our default nature is opton which means

281
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,200
automatically you are

282
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,760
right there available online if you want

283
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,440
to get yourself out and away

284
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,000
you have to kind of opt out of it sorry

285
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,560
yes

286
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,640
you are basically you know sold and then

287
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,640
you have to opt out which means

288
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,760
it's little opposite than what the

289
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,320
europe is so advantageous gdpr has and

290
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,959
disadvantage to what we have but again

291
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,560
programs out there that you can use and

292
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,920
i'll walk you through the process how

293
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,959
that's a little bit

294
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,279
um that you can use to your help to get

295
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,320
yourself away from

296
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,320
online uh yeah uh so ccpa something that

297
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,839
came into effect january

298
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,640
1st 2020 it's basically your right or

299
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,200
your request to delete your pii

300
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,160
opt out basically a process and

301
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,880
the other states other residents from

302
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,800
other states can also piggyback on this

303
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,240
program as well so it's not something

304
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,560
that only california can use

305
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,880
uh because of the high population and

306
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,720
high data records in california

307
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,320
that's why ccpa was imperative

308
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,480
to come in play but there's other states

309
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,399
out there that's a little bit in process

310
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,760
that's gonna be following a similar

311
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,000
legislator and they're gonna be coming

312
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,399
in

313
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,440
um as things follow through um

314
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,959
i know this year because of kuwait and

315
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,720
other things there are other states like

316
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,640
texas i think florida

317
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,240
couple others illinois that's little

318
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,839
bits in works trying to

319
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,519
build a legislator according to like

320
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,760
similar to what ccpa has so

321
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,600
uh but again you can always use this

322
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,959
opportunity um

323
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,839
and it's not something that just type to

324
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,399
ccpa

325
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,160
why so why why do we have to worry about

326
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,680
this well your credentials as you can

327
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,000
see

328
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,800
is is very critical to you right i mean

329
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,320
last thing you want to see is this

330
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,440
being sold or being on dark web

331
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,880
so you know last thing you want to see

332
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,560
is yours information being full on dark

333
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,040
web

334
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,959
not something that you want to deal with

335
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,800
you know that your information is a lot

336
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,240
of bad hands

337
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,680
uh not something that you want to be

338
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,920
dealing with so well the prediction was

339
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,200
of course for 2020

340
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,920
um you know there will be an immense

341
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,120
data breach

342
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,200
uh in your privacy data and of course

343
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,880
it's happening you know

344
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,120
um you know if you haven't been subject

345
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,880
to that then knock on wood but

346
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,639
people those information have been

347
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,639
stolen you can probably talk to them and

348
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,360
how

349
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,839
they have to go through a lot so a few

350
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,279
advisories again i'll work through the

351
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,720
process you know search for yourself

352
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,440
online

353
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,519
the best measure uh just google yourself

354
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,680
basically your first name

355
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,360
middle initial last name or however you

356
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,519
feel comfortable and then uh

357
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,120
you know based on i'll again i'll walk

358
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,560
you through some of the data brokers how

359
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,800
you can contact them you know via email

360
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,720
or your phone number or an opt-out

361
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,800
option that's mainly the footnotes

362
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,320
uh there's many ways how can you reach

363
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,639
out to them and get yourself removed so

364
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,200
and what you call uh yes some of the

365
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,480
data brokers you can see

366
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,399
the big name ones out there i just given

367
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,519
a little

368
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,120
uh research you know um inventory of

369
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,560
some of the big ones out there you can

370
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,880
use i'll pick three from here that i'll

371
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,320
walk you through

372
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,320
each one is a little different so that

373
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,440
kind of will give you a little

374
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,279
principality of what you

375
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,800
looking at how to go about work through

376
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,320
your process and to remove them so

377
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,680
what we're gonna do is we're going to

378
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,240
look at first being verified

379
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,680
very good one to use if you look at that

380
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,200
link over there you can read about their

381
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,320
privacy

382
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,360
how the data is being used

383
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,920
and again i just took a little

384
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,800
screenshot of

385
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,800
for california residents but again other

386
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,240
states can use the same

387
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,440
process to get themselves offline uh

388
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,959
it's a very good information with the

389
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,480
privacy link over there like other

390
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,279
agencies

391
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,839
sorry data brokers have similar you know

392
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:48,320
reading

393
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,680
according to those if you want to read

394
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,519
further and learn about that how the

395
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,360
data goes online and how you can remove

396
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:53,680
them

397
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,959
and how can they be used for

398
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,959
so what you call um when we click on

399
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,160
this

400
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,959
being verified and i'm gonna just use

401
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:03,839
this example

402
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,079
um you can of course search anybody over

403
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,959
here right using first name last name

404
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,120
but what you want to do is we are really

405
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,639
concerned about how you remove yourself

406
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,160
so a lot of these websites

407
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,920
and again this is an example i'm going

408
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,440
to walk through you want to look for

409
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,959
something like do not

410
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,800
sell your personal information or how to

411
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,320
remove yourself so we're going to click

412
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,680
on there

413
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,160
and what i'm going to use is i'm going

414
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,079
to just use my data as an example

415
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,839
and i'm going to type his name

416
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,680
and and again

417
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,519
this is just an example it gives you a

418
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,279
little high level of

419
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,880
what or how to work through this process

420
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,320
i'm just going to leave the state open

421
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,160
because his name is pretty

422
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,839
common i mean not common pretty peculiar

423
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,680
and as you can see that's him over there

424
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,760
um of course he lived in sacramento

425
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,279
grove

426
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,720
your family members over there so i

427
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,320
would click on that now

428
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,760
i can just put his email or my email and

429
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,959
i'm just gonna put his email

430
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,079
and i'm gonna put this and of course

431
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,440
he's gonna get an email i'm just gonna

432
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,880
have to buzz him

433
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,279
after the webinar and let him know so

434
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,639
that he knows what to do and just

435
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,680
briefing through the process so

436
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,839
okay did we miss something here all

437
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,360
right of course you have to do this

438
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,079
thing

439
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,160
send verification okay boom so the email

440
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,279
has gone out

441
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,519
now as you can see in the slides

442
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,959
again we clicked on this link over here

443
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,320
this you can also like i was saying

444
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,320
earlier you can call these people

445
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,519
you can email them uh

446
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,040
recall here we just ran through that

447
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,959
example uh you will get an email

448
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,639
so my dad in this case will get an email

449
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,000
when i did mine i got an

450
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,160
email uh it will be something like this

451
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,839
that will show up

452
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,160
you click on that link and it will give

453
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,639
a verification to the agency and then

454
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,880
within like i would say a day or two at

455
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,160
most 48 hours

456
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,240
they'll remove information it's just a

457
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,839
pretty much a check they want to do

458
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,120
from their site to make sure that there

459
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,959
is no robot

460
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,120
or any robocall you know request coming

461
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,959
in that is a legitimate person

462
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,680
sending a request and then uh they'll go

463
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,639
ahead and immediately

464
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,120
uh remove your information so sometimes

465
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,040
it's immediately sometimes at most i've

466
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,920
seen

467
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,680
uh those list of inventory of data

468
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,680
brokers i showed you on average out with

469
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,040
three days give you three days they'll

470
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,160
remove the information

471
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,720
so you can always go back in a week and

472
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,440
so

473
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,440
check and you should be pretty much fine

474
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,120
if you do your search like that

475
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,920
um if you show up you can move that if

476
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,519
you do not show up it'll be fine and

477
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,399
then

478
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,560
i'm going to give an example for example

479
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,600
when i did remove

480
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,759
mine and

481
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,399
let me see so and i did mine like about

482
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,000
in june or something so you can see if

483
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,199
you try to look for mine

484
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,800
it sure it didn't show up because i went

485
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,399
through the process so if you see

486
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,680
something like that

487
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,800
after you've run through the process

488
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,120
you're good to go so just kind of

489
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,560
example of feel of how

490
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,040
the process works um i'm gonna run

491
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,079
through an example

492
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,720
uh this is a good one uh num number

493
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,839
and uh and so again like i said

494
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,839
you want to be careful about if you're

495
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,280
trying to search yourself or if you're

496
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,880
trying to really remove so because if

497
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,319
you're gonna be

498
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,839
and i'm gonna run through my name here

499
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,480
and i was going to ask for volunteers

500
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,880
but you know i understand the comfort

501
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,439
level for

502
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,039
everybody in this webinar so i want to

503
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,120
be respectful of that but

504
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,480
if i click myself here so

505
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,160
now the system is searching for itself

506
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,400
and as you can see i really don't see

507
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,600
myself over here

508
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,520
so i because i ran through this website

509
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,039
as well and i cleared myself

510
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,480
so i'm gonna pick a family member

511
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,160
that that i have that has not gone

512
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,840
through this process so how the person

513
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,760
shows up and how you can clear this

514
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,440
uh this is number again you can see here

515
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,880
at the bottom if you go

516
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,600
here it says remove my info this is

517
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,760
something you can click on again

518
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,840
you have the option either depends on

519
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,360
your comfort level you can either email

520
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,400
them

521
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,320
they respond very quick or you can call

522
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,600
them

523
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,880
i also went through a couple of data

524
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,799
brokers and i did try and call them to

525
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,960
just give a little sample and they were

526
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,720
very responsive

527
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,320
they were easily able to get somebody on

528
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,960
the phone it's a real life person

529
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,640
they you give them your information your

530
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,000
first name last name date of birth

531
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,080
they'll set you up and they'll clear you

532
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,520
and then when i was able to go back

533
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,280
after a couple days look for myself

534
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,080
um i was cleared so they're very helpful

535
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,520
they're effective and again thanks to

536
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,400
ccpa

537
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,039
uh this program was not there before

538
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,480
it's fairly new so

539
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,480
try and take advantage of that and again

540
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,000
like i said it's comfort level either

541
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,640
you feel like

542
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,720
calling them you don't even have to wait

543
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,400
on the phone for most part

544
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,919
uh then somebody comes on right away

545
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,840
either you email them email responses

546
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,360
pretty quick couple hours

547
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,280
i find it the best uh just doing it

548
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,600
online because you can save screenshots

549
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
so remove my information i'm going to

550
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,039
click on that

551
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,320
i'm going to pick one of my family

552
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,600
members because i saw her available

553
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,240
and let's see i'm going to type lgroup

554
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,919
here

555
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,520
okay boom and then search okay so um

556
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,840
so there you go so she's showing up over

557
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,360
there i'm gonna click on the view

558
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,039
details

559
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,280
and what i'm gonna do is give a little

560
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:25,039
time it's kind of loading

561
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,160
it's searching through the database so i

562
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,679
hope i'm not going fast enough for you

563
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:30,160
guys

564
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,160
um is the piece okay for everybody

565
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,760
so i'm gonna try it it's looking good

566
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,559
okay

567
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,600
i'm gonna try and do this again

568
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,760
sometimes my internet i just change my

569
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,760
router so it gives a little bit of

570
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,840
drag so okay

571
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,280
um so i'm gonna click on this

572
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,640
okay boom okay so if you see over here

573
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,440
that's um a family member's personal

574
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,080
information

575
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,440
not a good thing right too much

576
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,960
information out there and that's pretty

577
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,240
scary that's not fun

578
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,159
you did a better thing what i'm gonna do

579
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,760
is i'm gonna take this url

580
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,360
and copy that and then go back and

581
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,200
if you follow through what i'm doing is

582
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,799
when i go and click on remove my

583
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,799
information

584
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,640
and it makes it very simple user

585
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,080
friendly for you like i said every

586
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,440
website is different

587
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,320
but the concept and the principality is

588
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,120
same

589
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,880
you see over here says opt out of number

590
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,200
so remember the url that i cut and paste

591
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,960
i'm just gonna put them here and then

592
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,799
submit i'm not going to do that because

593
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,640
i have to talk to my family my mother

594
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,320
i don't know that i'm doing this but if

595
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,159
i click that of course

596
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,600
like the similar example that i showed

597
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,760
you in example one that person will get

598
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,640
an email

599
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,480
the person will open the email clicked

600
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,919
on opt

601
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,240
you know whatever option is and i think

602
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,960
i do have a screenshot on my option yes

603
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,960
and you can see over here so like i was

604
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,240
showing you

605
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,080
click submit that person will get an

606
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,840
email this is my example here email will

607
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,360
be something like that

608
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,799
it would take you through the hyperlink

609
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,480
you will click on that and then boom

610
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,120
there you go

611
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,039
you are all clear so that's a

612
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,640
confirmation email that shows that you

613
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,679
are in the process

614
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,280
and they will act according to your

615
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,799
request and then

616
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,200
you are removed so and of course when

617
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,400
you search for yourself you shouldn't

618
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,000
see yourself you will see something like

619
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,480
that

620
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,320
page removed some something along the

621
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,240
lines so just like i have shown you

622
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,640
when i look for myself using my city i

623
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,840
cannot find myself

624
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,600
so something like that um i'm gonna

625
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,280
quickly run through another example here

626
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,440
check people another third one a very

627
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,720
good one

628
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,320
and again like i said

629
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,640
um each of them pretty much make it very

630
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,360
easy for you

631
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,960
your comfort level either use the email

632
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,760
your phone number or your remove my info

633
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,200
my main process over here

634
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,960
is to do the webinar where i can kind of

635
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,159
walk you through the removing fold

636
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,120
because we know

637
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,640
email and phone number is pretty easy

638
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,559
right we know all how to deal with them

639
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,640
and just run through the process uh

640
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,320
remove info is a little bit different

641
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,320
um the reason i'm using three examples

642
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,840
is because

643
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,159
each of them is a little different so

644
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,760
over here if you go all the way down and

645
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,320
remember

646
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,080
you always want to hit the footnotes

647
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,760
that's where your guidance is

648
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,880
okay they will give you different

649
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,159
options like i said the wording is

650
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,039
different

651
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,039
they'll either say remove myself or do

652
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,640
not sell my information or something

653
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,400
there you just kind of have to

654
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,640
gauge and use the indication as to what

655
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,080
you want to click on to remove yourself

656
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,679
so here do not sell myself

657
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,799
okay i got this over here i'm going to

658
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,240
use my wife's information because i

659
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,760
think this is one of those that i did

660
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,520
not put my wife through

661
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,640
um so i'm gonna type her name

662
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,240
and of course she lives in el grove here

663
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,159
with me and

664
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,520
uh yes in california of course

665
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,000
you just go through your robot checklist

666
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,360
cards and i just click on this

667
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,678
okay i must admit something

668
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,679
okay bicycle i'm not a big fan of trying

669
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,360
to use this kind of examples but

670
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,880
we'll see okay cross work just bear with

671
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,159
me hopefully we can clear this

672
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,080
okay finally all right so um

673
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,159
there you go boom she shows up and for

674
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,679
example very simple reason

675
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,440
you can see my name is over there tied

676
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,039
to her right and the husband and of

677
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,559
course you know family members she lived

678
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,559
you know here and with me in el grove

679
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,240
sacramento irving she's from texas

680
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,679
oklahoma so

681
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,080
obviously that's her i'm not going to

682
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,280
click on that because

683
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,640
she's going to come knocking at my door

684
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,679
but of course i'll walk through the

685
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,200
process with this with her so she can

686
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,559
clear her but

687
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,320
if you reference back to my screenshot

688
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,080
slides over here

689
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,200
so as you can see if i were to go

690
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,960
click on of course remove record i would

691
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,720
get the screenshot over here

692
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,880
very simple straightforward again uh the

693
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,240
process of state

694
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,240
um removing yourself you would click on

695
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,760
that you would get an opt

696
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,559
out option um again you do your due

697
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,240
diligence fill out whatever is needed

698
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,559
and you search for yourself you'll get a

699
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,480
new page called selected

700
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,159
um of course you know a lot of times

701
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,600
they want to verify you

702
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,760
to see if you're a real live legitimate

703
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,679
person and real request so that it's not

704
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:02,400
a robocall

705
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,200
or robo request you put in your email is

706
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,080
needed you know

707
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,440
in this case i would put her email so

708
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,720
that she would get an email and she

709
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,480
would submit the due diligence

710
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,400
um in this case i just put mine over

711
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
there send confirmation and boom there

712
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,200
you go

713
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,080
uh he will reset back to you the email

714
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,039
has been filed

715
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,559
and then you know you would open an

716
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,240
email this is an example for me over

717
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,120
here

718
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,960
when i did mine i said hey daryl you

719
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,400
would like to request

720
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,559
you know um complete your confirmation

721
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,760
when you do that

722
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,520
um just a little bit of verification

723
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,960
again this is for your records you know

724
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,559
that this has been done so later on down

725
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,640
the road if there's any issues with them

726
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,240
if you're showing up you can always

727
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,159
reference this and again these people

728
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,279
100

729
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,880
pretty good with what they do so you

730
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,159
will not go wrong according to the

731
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,679
principalities and policies that's out

732
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:46,320
there

733
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,520
uh to protect our data so anyways

734
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,720
um so those are three examples i did um

735
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,400
based on our time i don't want to take

736
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,240
too much of you guys time but

737
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,279
you know if you get a chance this is

738
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,919
another very good one instant checkmate

739
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,120
try if you want to work through the

740
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,320
process you know while we're in this

741
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,320
presentation or maybe after this webinar

742
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,679
if you want to later tonight

743
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,520
uh do it yourself uh try instant

744
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,440
checkmates uh just walk through the

745
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,039
process if you go down the bottom just

746
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,039
click on sell my info i just follow

747
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,039
through the process very straightforward

748
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,559
and then that can work you through the

749
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,919
process so just an example of how

750
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,000
you can clear your ground um so anyways

751
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,480
again just to highlight how to opt out

752
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,039
process

753
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,640
it's very simple just run through a

754
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,320
couple checks step one you know you

755
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,640
would contact the broker that you want

756
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,000
uh either reach out to them through

757
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,240
phone email or use an opt-out form

758
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,919
uh your best gear is always using hot

759
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,360
platform is very simple straightforward

760
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,600
like i said you can get screenshots

761
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,039
search for yourself you know find

762
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,200
yourself out there verify

763
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,760
you know remove yourself uh using the

764
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,520
option

765
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,559
and then uh just follow the process

766
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,400
okay and then um what you call as you

767
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,039
can see the data brokers that i

768
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,840
went through let me show you here again

769
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,799
these are some of the

770
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,039
main ones i covered there are some big

771
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,960
websites there are some small ones

772
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,919
um the thing is i'm working with fbi

773
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,039
right now to see if there's a

774
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,320
centralized database

775
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,120
that we can use to do this right now

776
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,240
there hasn't been anything

777
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,039
significant like that but what it is is

778
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,279
if you run through majority of this

779
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,440
each data broker feeds into other ones

780
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,279
so they kind of like our interrelated

781
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,440
internet will go into tight so

782
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,200
if you go through a bunch of these it

783
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,159
will clear

784
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,320
from the other ones as well so now there

785
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,760
are some big ones like this one's over

786
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,279
here i did a good research i spent a

787
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,080
couple days

788
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,360
looking at these so if you run through

789
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,640
most of them uh you are actually

790
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,360
on a good track so uh this feeds into

791
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,960
smaller databases too so you don't have

792
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,559
to worry about those so

793
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,840
like one rep is a good one um number

794
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,679
two name is a good one these are some of

795
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,279
the big ones uh

796
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,640
if you clear walk through this process

797
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,080
like i said again the one i showed you

798
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,760
for example 123 they will clear the

799
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,840
ground for a lot of the smaller ones so

800
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,960
um something is better than nothing

801
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,720
and give me a second here let me get to

802
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,640
it so yes like i was saying earlier

803
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,840
um so if you get like about 70 to 80

804
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,840
percent of your data move using those

805
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,960
data library um as time goes by

806
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,960
you can have your information on google

807
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,880
less and less available

808
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,720
which is which is good so and eventually

809
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,279
as time goes by it will clear up

810
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,919
again you know why do you want your pi

811
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:26,799
offline

812
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,720
is because you basically last thing you

813
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,399
want to see is yourself being sold on

814
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,399
dark web deep web and that's not a fun

815
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:33,440
thing that's

816
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,000
a we all know from cyber security that's

817
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
not something where you want to be so

818
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,120
um again um thanks to ccpa effective

819
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,360
1120 um

820
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,799
they came into play because of high

821
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,640
california population as you can see

822
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,720
california population is about 41

823
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,159
million right now

824
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,159
i think we're looking at texas about 30

825
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,000
million florida is like third with 20

826
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,960
million

827
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,279
uh because of this high state population

828
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,120
uh these policies are coming in play to

829
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,720
protect our information like i said

830
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,159
again other states are

831
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,279
kind of coming behind duplicating ccpa

832
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,559
so

833
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,720
try to take advantage of this use this

834
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,840
um

835
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,679
adversaries are trying to grab your pii

836
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:12,880
as much as possible

837
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,720
to steal your data to sell it for

838
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,240
whatever reason who knows right to

839
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,480
get a new passport on their name under

840
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,360
your name

841
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,120
uh or to sp uh to open up new accounts

842
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,120
we knows for and we all know the damage

843
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,279
of additive theft so

844
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,520
um like i said again other states can

845
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,640
use a similar approach

846
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,399
just like ccpa so you're not tied to

847
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,000
again um

848
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,640
being in part of california so why we're

849
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,399
doing this again because of covet

850
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,520
there is a high spike um in global

851
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,760
survey bands and the biggest thing is

852
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,120
like phishing attacks

853
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,240
uh pip getting hijacked so uh please

854
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,600
protect your credentials you know i

855
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,000
cannot emphasize enough

856
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,440
especially california residents are

857
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,440
pretty much on a higher demand

858
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,520
there's many ways how your pii can be

859
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,120
compromised you know of course we all

860
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,440
know

861
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,559
phishing emails is big out there it

862
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:03,760
comes in your work email

863
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,760
in your personal email but there's other

864
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,440
things that are coming up to the surface

865
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,640
and getting bigger right now

866
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,039
a lot of times people are aware of this

867
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,679
something called wishing and smashing

868
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,720
and for me trust me i get about two

869
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,159
i would say to three uh texts every day

870
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,600
and i get phone calls as well pretty

871
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,840
much one phone call every day

872
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,000
and it's pretty much like you probably

873
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,480
know about nigeria phone calls uh

874
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,640
texts you know federal tax return phone

875
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,760
calls they

876
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,840
call us calling you and asking you for

877
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,480
personal data right it's just getting so

878
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,399
common and so annoying so something to

879
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:39,919
be aware of

880
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,760
anybody calling you you know on your

881
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,679
phone asking for personal stuff is no

882
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:44,799
different than a phishing

883
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,039
phishing only thing is through an email

884
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,600
and vision is through a voice phone call

885
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,760
of course third measure now is text

886
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,080
message right we are so

887
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,080
surrounded by text message right we just

888
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,679
are more easier to pick up our phone and

889
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,440
text somebody than calling

890
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,600
if the calling was old school days now

891
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,039
it's all text

892
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,720
like i said i get text messages every

893
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,880

where it's coming from what's the

913
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,640
background on that is

914
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,480

boom there you go now i have my personal

916
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,159
data that's on my all on my phone that

917
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,039
could be

918
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,039
sold to somebody or transferred via that

919
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,799
link or i could be even getting a

920
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,320
ransomware on my phone and the next

921
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,080
thing i know my phone is checked

922
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,799
right so do not click on those links and

923
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,559
those are just as dangerous as anything

924
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,000
else so

925
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,840
that's what you call a phishing is uh

926
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,519
it's gonna get more and more bigger

927
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,080
higher like i said i'm getting two to

928
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,519
three a day so

929
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,519
um again why is this happening is

930
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,880
because of recent texts

931
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,360
um three directors sub directors are

932
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,960
just sitting home

933
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,720
and wait too much time on hand and

934
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,919
they're trying to do whatever they can

935
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,760
to damage other people for fun

936
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,760
whatever reason who knows right but

937
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,279
mainly to gain

938
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,799
your personal details and your financial

939
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,279
details for their benefit

940
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,679
so um advisory what to do about this

941
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,120
well especially for visioning and

942
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,880
fishing we know what to do with

943
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,399
fishing you know we just delete them or

944
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,080
you block them but for vision and

945
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,039
smishing

946
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,519
what do you do so pretty much take

947
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,480
precautions right

948
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,480
use your mutual understanding your due

949
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,600
diligence

950
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,080
when you see such calls or text just

951
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,880
avoid them

952
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,480
and do not respond or do not

953
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,399
attempt to respond to them or

954
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,240
if you see anything unfamiliar just

955
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,320
ignore it why because the moment you

956
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,200
respond

957
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,440
what happens is these are coming to you

958
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,440
in mass

959
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,399
mail or mess phone calls or mass text so

960
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:09,919
when you are responding to them you

961
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:10,640
basically

962
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,279
are identifying yourself as a valid and

963
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:13,679
a live

964
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,880
person and now that whoever is

965
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,880
corresponding to you knows you that you

966
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,320
really exist and your phone number is

967
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:20,880
valid

968
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,799
so then you kind of have grounded

969
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,159
yourself to the person

970
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,000
and you're exposing yourself to further

971
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,760
threats on the text who knows for what

972
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,200
are their purposes

973
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,960
so that's a big reason why you do not

974
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,279
want to attempt to respond or

975
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,080
you know or even uh try to make an

976
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,440
answer to them

977
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,200
so what you call a something to be very

978
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,559
careful and this is something that was

979
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:41,440
happening around

980
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,600
summer i believe and there were like

981
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,200
instant messages that were

982
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,080
coming out through it was trying to pick

983
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,360
up your voice recognition

984
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,919
right we we are responding to a lot of

985
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,840
automated systems and so our voice

986
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,760
recognition is being recorded in these

987
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,840
so-called databases all over the world

988
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,440
in different data centers

989
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,960
so when you get a call something like

990
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,960
can you hear me now and you respond any

991
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,640
when they pick a particular signature

992
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,320
with your voice recognition that matches

993
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,760
and says yes

994
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,000
that can lead to other circumstances

995
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,279
that you may not even know in the

996
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,960
background what's happening so there is

997
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,360
like

998
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,760
business out there entities systems

999
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,279
that are keeping an account of your

1000
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,360
voice recognition and a signature to a

1001
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:21,840
yes

1002
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,600
something like that and when you put

1003
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,760
them together that can access your

1004
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,679
account settings your social security

1005
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,760
information your purchases

1006
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,519
tied to whatever databases they are

1007
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,840
connected with and that can open up door

1008
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,720
for you

1009
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,360
and there you go your information can be

1010
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,039
compromised

1011
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,279
you also have as you can some of you may

1012
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,559
know

1013
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:43,600
you know that certain people

1014
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,960
telemarketers cannot call you after a

1015
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,640
certain time

1016
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,080
you have another resource like you can

1017
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,760
go on do not call list it's a federal

1018
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,799
registry system

1019
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,519
and put information over there your

1020
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,159
phone number

1021
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,480
uh registered them so that they are not

1022
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,760
supposed to call you

1023
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,559
or they are not obligated to call you a

1024
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,320
lot of illegal telemarketing you know

1025
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,919
can be fine

1026
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,039
average finance what's up to 16 000 if

1027
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,639
you really want to follow through and

1028
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,480
make a final complaint you do that and

1029
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,000
trust me you'll be surprised to see how

1030
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,960
some of these

1031
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,440
are being brought down by the ft ftc so

1032
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,599
one of the things i've started to do

1033
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,599
more on active basis like since last

1034
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,839
year is having a google account so

1035
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,000
for example when i go to rsa or when i

1036
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,199
go to state fair

1037
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,719
and you know of course when you enter

1038
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,639
those sweepstakes right do you wanna

1039
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,839
really wanna put your real phone number

1040
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:35,599
no you always try and get a good like

1041
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:36,480
google account

1042
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,918
download a google voice and have a

1043
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,918
google account so when you go in and you

1044
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:40,719
know we want to

1045
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,480
all enter sweepstakes you never know

1046
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,800
just you may get lucky for some

1047
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,639
small gift cards here and there try and

1048
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,239
put your google number

1049
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,239
so that way at least you know you using

1050
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,359
them to

1051
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,760
enter your name so that way because when

1052
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,480
it gets sold

1053
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,119
to a third party and if the phone call

1054
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,560
gets too much you can always delete the

1055
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,240
google number and always get a new one

1056
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:00,880
so

1057
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,640
something i would suggest always try and

1058
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,160
protect your phone number like i said

1059
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,920
your phone number is one of those

1060
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,240
uh piis when it's active under your

1061
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,920
position you don't want to

1062
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,119
have people calling you three four in

1063
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,400
the morning and just wasting your time

1064
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,280
so always try

1065
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,760
and use the google number something an

1066
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,280
application that's over there to your

1067
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,560
disposable

1068
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,960
and then of course overall you have all

1069
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,079
smart devices

1070
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,280
protect your um device you know block

1071
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,440
use the block features in there you know

1072
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,680
above all guys i cannot emphasize enough

1073
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,119
if there's somebody trying to reach out

1074
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,760
to you you know reasoning a voicemail

1075
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,079
or text mail if it's important there is

1076
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,760
a message a lot of times we know this

1077
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,560
robocalls

1078
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,359
do not leave a message but if they do of

1079
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,240
course you know

1080
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,240
you know how to deal with them if it's

1081
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,520
garbage you delete them if it's

1082
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,880
important somebody trying to reach out

1083
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,599
to you

1084
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,160
they'll leave their contact back so so

1085
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,280
those are some of the things i just

1086
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,480
wanted to emphasize

1087
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,839
um and hope that was helped you uh but

1088
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:56,320
again

1089
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,040
uh thank you for attending and i don't

1090
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,880
know if anybody has any questions

1091
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,119
but uh hope that was of something of

1092
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,560
interest to you and something that gave

1093
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,320
you a little eye opener as to how you

1094
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,599
can go ahead and

1095
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,400
protect your information so this is

1096
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,000
something also important like

1097
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,079
you know if you do go ahead and try to

1098
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,200
clear yourself from

1099
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,680
online uh do it as your wills for your

1100
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,599
wife and for your teenage kids who have

1101
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:20,480
history you know

1102
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,280
on the financial market on the global

1103
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,800
because you just never know who's tied

1104
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,760
to who so

1105
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,040
hopefully this is of help to you

1106
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,760
there are some uh questions here uh is

1107
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,320
this that

1108
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,359
does opting out opting out keep you up

1109
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,000
permanently or you have to worry about

1110
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,200
other brokers so what happens is

1111
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,040
a lot of these brokers they tied to each

1112
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,800
other like i when i went and like

1113
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,480
removed myself from being verified and

1114
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,760
number

1115
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,800
i went on a couple other brokers and

1116
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,000
some of them couldn't find

1117
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,440
myself um so i cannot remember randomly

1118
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,200
most of them are permanent they will

1119
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,359
remove you

1120
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:04,560
and uh and some of them like you

1121
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,280
they may um if you do change an address

1122
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,880
they might show up again but

1123
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,960
that's where like sometimes speaking to

1124
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,440
the person can sometimes help

1125
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,880
if you do tell them like that you want

1126
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,560
to permanently be removed they will

1127
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,480
remove you because if they do not

1128
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,720
uh they're in violation of ccpa in this

1129
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,599
other

1130
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,480
legislative policy so a lot of them i've

1131
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:24,880
seen

1132
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,040
being honest because i've been trying to

1133
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,720
do this from the last couple of months

1134
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,520
and

1135
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,720
99.9 of these brokers that i've used

1136
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,119
and i've requested myself of have not

1137
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,359
shown me back up yet so

1138
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,920
they're working uh because i actually

1139
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,079
had used my friends who are one or two

1140
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,680
private investigators and i had them run

1141
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,200
me through a test and they couldn't find

1142
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,240
me

1143
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,680
i did this test i had them look for me

1144
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,119
they were able to but they said that

1145
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:51,839
this

1146
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,800
has been uh quite a good effective

1147
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,240
process so

1148
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,599
um so hope that kind of helps

1149
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,119
question if if i don't live in

1150
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,800
california what happens to those who

1151
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,880
don't live in california

1152
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,920
so um a lot of agencies are

1153
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,880
a lot of data brokers are honoring this

1154
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,359
um

1155
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:12,960
i from what i've seen a couple of my

1156
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,640
friends who are in texas

1157
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,839
they said they were able to successfully

1158
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:20,000
were able to get themselves removed

1159
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,359
a lot of times what happens is when you

1160
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:24,880
call this person when you request as you

1161
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,359
can see

1162
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:26,800
it doesn't you don't really necessarily

1163
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,560
have to put down your state if you're

1164
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,160
able to find yourself using first name

1165
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,079
last name any phone number

1166
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,119
um you you put in a request and they'll

1167
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,400
still honor it because

1168
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,880
ccpa is a ground the rule is baseline

1169
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,160
that is there

1170
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,240
but i've seen success where a lot of my

1171
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,400
friends were able to remove themselves

1172
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,200
from

1173
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,560
from the website as well and they were

1174
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,000
not even california residents like i

1175
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,480
said

1176
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,079
this is a shift that's moving to other

1177
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,920
states so this is something that the

1178
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,440
data brokers are inheriting

1179
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,720
and still honoring good

1180
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,760
um here's somebody's asking for you to

1181
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,000
put

1182
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,280
the data brokers that you had displayed

1183
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,160
before

1184
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,560
yeah absolutely yeah yeah let me put

1185
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,359
that

1186
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:10,480
so if you want to grab this

1187
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,520
and uh and like i said i put quite a lot

1188
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,400
of research into

1189
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,119
um picking some of those so those are

1190
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,000
henry um

1191
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,720
true people search is another big one

1192
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,599
and like i said

1193
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,640
ccpa is again it's like a baseline that

1194
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,359
is used

1195
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:28,800
but a lot of these brokers are um

1196
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,560
having a a uh resource where you can go

1197
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,400
on the footnotes and click on that so

1198
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,480
um it's it's gonna be more and more

1199
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,560
apparent so a lot of a lot of this

1200
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,480
data brokers aren't ordering the removal

1201
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,839
from online so

1202
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,160
here's another question what are some

1203
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,440
sites that prospective employers use

1204
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,599
does removing yourself hurt your chances

1205
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,160
in any way

1206
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,920
so the employees are now are being moved

1207
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,960
towards more doing

1208
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,880
um fingerprinting and there was a little

1209
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,800
discussion within our state here

1210
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,520
lately the employees are more now

1211
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,480
encouraged

1212
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,480
to sway away from using the stop data

1213
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,640
brokers because of financial reasons

1214
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,720
and to go more uh you have like

1215
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,079
something like live scan and more

1216
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,319
fingerprinting which is more

1217
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,480
apparent or doing more drug tests

1218
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,760
because as you can see these data

1219
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,839
brokers they cannot be

1220
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,560
tied with the life cans or the drug test

1221
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,440
this is more

1222
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,880
just to do a random search on you

1223
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,480
especially most of these are being used

1224
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,040
by

1225
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,520
uh private investigators i mean for

1226
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,280
example a common one will be

1227
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,800
a a mom that is trying to file a

1228
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,160
child child custody support right

1229
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,319
for dad who's in florida or miami who

1230
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,079
knows and it's easy to file

1231
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,960
use a private investigator and resource

1232
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,480
out one of these data brokers and to

1233
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,000
find an individual so

1234
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,079
that's why things like this come in play

1235
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,079
uh there are some

1236
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,079
employers who use some of these data

1237
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,760
brokers what you can always do is

1238
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,440
reach out to your employer uh

1239
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,960
perspective employees and see

1240
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,200
what um and they should be able to

1241
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,160
advise to you

1242
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,720
uh what data brokers they're using and

1243
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,680
then

1244
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,200
and then go and uh remove your data um

1245
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,440
accordingly and so you know that that

1246
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,040
would be one resource but again like i

1247
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,480
said a lot of employees are being

1248
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,400
advised to use more towards

1249
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,640
doing a physical drug test or life scan

1250
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,920
resources

1251
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,520
because the reason is a lot of these

1252
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,119
data brokers charge a

1253
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,240
high amount of money and if the

1254
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,440
employees are using this

1255
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,440
for quite a lot it becomes more a

1256
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,040
financial benefit so that's something

1257
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,160
that's being looked into

1258
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,079
here's a another question

1259
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,200
i opt out but they can still they still

1260
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,760
call what do i do

1261
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,280
so what you do is um it depends like

1262
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,560
sometimes you want to give it

1263
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,599
um time

1264
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,280
are you talking about like opt-out on

1265
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,280
the do not call list

1266
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,319
yes okay so yeah so so definitely that's

1267
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,079
a clear cut is a federal policy

1268
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,560
is a federal database library and that's

1269
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,400
a clear cut violation

1270
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,680
uh there is a resource on do not

1271
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,760
call list where you can go report um

1272
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,119
the communicators to the ftc

1273
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,280
uh and you you know of course when they

1274
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,400
do call you have a

1275
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,079
record history right using a phone bill

1276
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,520
or even your screenshot

1277
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,440
and you can always upload those um and

1278
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,720
report that

1279
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,839
and trust me um believe me or not like

1280
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,839
ftc will immediately follow through

1281
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,839
um and you have a i believe a case

1282
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,200
manager somebody assigned to you that

1283
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,079
you can work with

1284
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,240
and they will be dealt with so um of

1285
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,280
course like

1286
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,400
we all know there's a lot of uh data

1287
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,400
brokers out there or responders or

1288
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,400
sweepstake people who just kind of

1289
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,400
like to ban the rules and still will

1290
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,720
communicate to you irregardless of what

1291
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,240
but again there are consequences for

1292
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,760
that um so it's just a matter of you

1293
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,440
following up and just reporting

1294
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,440
um and again there will test with from

1295
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,119
from what i've learned with ftc

1296
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,440
uh one last question uh

1297
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,880
can we get the slides um yeah i can

1298
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,720
definitely um

1299
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,280
i can uh i can put this out um what i

1300
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,240

1309
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,839
you have recorded too so that way when

1310
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:37,119
they run through recording they can get

1311
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,240
slides that way too

1312
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,200
uh yeah absolutely i i i can definitely

1313

you can post them as requested

1319
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,839

1320
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,040

1321
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,359

00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,960
um okay does opting out keep you up

1328
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,560
permanently or do you need to worry

1329
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,079
about the brokers connecting

1330
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,160
collecting new information and building

1331
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,119
a new record

1332
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,480
well most of them is tied using your

1333
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,280
from what i

1334
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,119
when i from what i've seen talking to

1335
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,960
these data brokers because i've called

1336
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,560
over half of them

1337
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,599
and they will go by with your first name

1338
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:50,400
and last name

1339
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,680
um and what you call once requested

1340
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,040
even if you change your address they

1341
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,680
will still uh get it

1342
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,280
get it removed they will still keep it

1343
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,800
removed so they have they have a data

1344
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,280
library

1345
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:06,800
for next let me let me put it this way

1346
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,240
uh that they share off

1347
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,400
and when they put in a request uh from

1348
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,880
what i've seen it's it's permanent

1349
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,359
but again uh you do wanna something like

1350
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:16,960
that you might wanna call them and just

1351
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,640
make sure you put in requests because if

1352
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,560
you do opt online

1353
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,119
it goes through a pretty intense uh

1354
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:23,599
search

1355
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,760
and removes it but sometimes like if you

1356
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,520
do let them know like hey

1357
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,119
you know you can call them and say okay

1358
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:30,560
this is for six months so this is for

1359
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,119
one year

1360
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:32,480
from what i've seen like it's it's

1361
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,160
permanent request so

1362
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,680
they should not be putting it back again

1363
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:43,599
here's another question

1364
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:46,319
how do you know which data broker is

1365
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:47,760
honest

1366
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,000
if you give a data broker your name and

1367
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
email why don't you give it a bi

1368
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,400
well so again like if anything we all

1369
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,680
know there's a lot of dishonest people

1370
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,560
out there right

1371
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,760
this is the program uh that's um getting

1372
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,160
to uh surface now uh this wasn't

1373
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,839
something that was before

1374
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:09,200
um it was done more on a very slim level

1375
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,520
like i remember five days ago uh

1376
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,720
contacting like

1377
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,800
some of these like spoke or whatever and

1378
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,720
i had asked them like can you remove

1379
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,520
this

1380
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,599
and they were like okay well um we'll

1381
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:20,720
put in a request and

1382
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,599
we cannot guarantee your removal but now

1383
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,280
because of these policies coming in play

1384
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,599
like i said again ccpoa

1385
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,599
sorry ccpa and with this opt-out option

1386
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:34,400
uh they are required to follow through

1387
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,319
based on a lot of privacy laws that's

1388
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:37,920
coming in play according to state and

1389
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,400
federal

1390
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,560
level so this is something that they are

1391
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,119
obligated again but like i said

1392
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:44,720
you just never know who's dishonored

1393
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,200
who's not uh you just go with your

1394
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:47,760
instinct

1395
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,680
and um and then that's why you have an

1396
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,359
email like you know if there's something

1397
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:51,760
that

1398
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,359
they think that they have not removed or

1399
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:54,560
they've done you always have an email

1400
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,000
record and it's like hey

1401
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,520
you know i put in this request according

1402
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,599
to privacy policy that you have posted

1403
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,200
um you know you didn't do your due

1404
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,480
diligence and you can always follow

1405
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,760
through so

1406
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,760
uh again like you always hope for the

1407
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,440
best um i've seen

1408
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,119
success about 70 to 80 percent it's

1409
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,079
it's just a matter of fact um how much

1410
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:15,520
uh diligent they're gonna be but for

1411
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,760
most of them i see they do tend to honor

1412
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,280
because this is a real person live

1413
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,680
people a couple of the phone calls i

1414
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,559
call i can remember i believe truth

1415
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,640
finder or two such people this is like a

1416
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,760
concern in l.a

1417
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,760
and they're like real life people that

1418
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,119
you speak to um

1419
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,599
and then even call email communication

1420
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,440
uh they will uh

1421
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,680
you're dealing with real life person so

1422
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,119
they will uh

1423
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,559
you know you have to have that faith

1424
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:44,240
leap of faith and they will honor that

1425
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,520
here's another question how will the

1426
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,680
cpra

1427
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,599
affect things it's a very uh powerful

1428
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:52,160
law

1429
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,359
um it just came in this year so like

1430
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:56,960
because of corvette

1431
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,119
um it was good timing so it's gonna get

1432
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:00,240
more and more prevalent

1433
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,200
and more and more uh widespread uh again

1434
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,640
like i said other states are working

1435
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,400
also on the similar law

1436
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,520
so it's just a matter of publicity and

1437
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:09,920
uh

1438
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,040
just being just being going more global

1439
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,240
so

1440
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,000
uh it it's supposed to be effective like

1441
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,440
i said it's it's a uh

1442
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,440
i do not i cannot remember the assembly

1443
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,200
bill it's uh it's backed up by an

1444
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,559
assembly bill

1445
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,720
uh so that's that's something that you

1446
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,880
know is to back that up so it's supposed

1447
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,000
to be very effective

1448
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,400
like i said anything that some of these

1449
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,839
data brokers do not flow

1450
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:34,720
uh follow can be uh considered as a

1451
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,000
violation but again

1452
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,920
now everybody is different each data

1453
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,400
brokers depends on their

1454
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,760
uh business of ethics um you always hope

1455
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,520
for the best so

1456
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,319
this is just an example of your effort

1457
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:49,920
that you can use

1458
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,880
uh to minimize yourself um again you all

1459
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,520
know that nothing is 100

1460
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,040
accurate right i mean it's just like

1461
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,520
customer service you know um

1462
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,800
with anything nothing is 100 so

1463
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,720
the the the the webinar is more geared

1464
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,160
towards doing your best

1465
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,319
to minimize yourself uh and to minimize

1466
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:11,359
your damage so

1467
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:14,640
just like going on the road you know you

1468
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,079
drive a safety um

1469
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:17,839
as much as you can to keep yourself from

1470
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:19,119
getting into a collision but again

1471
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:20,640
you'll always have somebody never mind

1472
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,000
how careful you are you're gonna have

1473
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,599
always somebody that's gonna come and

1474
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:24,960
still come in your way and

1475
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,200
do a damage so it's the same concept

1476
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,240
guys

1477
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,520
so uh let me get um let me actually ask

1478
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,319
you this

1479
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:35,119
you actually tested all these removals

1480
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,119
with a pi

1481
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:39,280
yeah i went through quite a lot yes yes

1482
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,400
i actually went to

1483
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,640
remove myself from quite a lot of those

1484
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,079
and how long did it take you

1485
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:46,720
to to go through all these these things

1486
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,839
right here

1487
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:49,599
it's it's a good question uh there's

1488
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:51,599
quite a lot of research you know i

1489
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:54,240
pretty much spent a weekend and some of

1490
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,240
them are very straightforward um some of

1491
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,160
them are very clear-cut like for example

1492
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,319
spokeo i was on a phone call within like

1493
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,160
five minutes it was done

1494
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,040
and and been verified um i would say was

1495
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,880
a couple of minutes

1496
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,000
so i would say you know if you it

1497
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,240
all depends on on your time and effort

1498
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,000
you know like again it's due diligence

1499
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:14,720
right

1500
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,960
you can sacrifice your like one two or

1501
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,960
three movies from netflix you can just

1502
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,359
choose to sacrifice it and just sit over

1503
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:25,599
and just try to get them done um it all

1504
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,760
uh depends guys i mean if you're a real

1505
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,040
estate broker

1506
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,359
you know you are quite a lot out there

1507
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:32,480
on the public level

1508
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,720
then it's going to take a while to get

1509
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,319
yourself removed but

1510
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:39,680
if you're a guy who's very low profile

1511
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,960
and it doesn't have

1512
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,440
you know facebook or linkedin um you're

1513
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,319
gonna be quick

1514
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:46,400
uh just in and out being able to remove

1515
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,000
itself so it's how much you have

1516
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,520
advertised yourself online so

1517
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,079
again you know i've seen like especially

1518
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:53,119
if you're a doctor right

1519
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:54,800
i mean doctor's information are out

1520
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,559
there like they write articles

1521
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:59,440
so if you have information um you know

1522
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,800
it just all depends

1523
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,000
it's it's case to case from everybody so

1524
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,920
but i would say like for me it was just

1525
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,800
a matter of i would say

1526
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,000
what i went through i would say i don't

1527
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,520
know how many there like i would say

1528
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,000
about

1529
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,160
10 20 um 20 25. i would say

1530
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,480
i went through about 20 of these 20 21

1531
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,280
22 of these

1532
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,160
took me about i would say two to three

1533
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,920
hours but then i was doing it more

1534
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,599
because this is my passion cyber

1535
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:27,280
security is what i do

1536
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,599
uh protecting pir for me and my wife is

1537
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,119
critical we live in california i work

1538
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:32,160
for state so

1539
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,720
you know i'm very concerned so the more

1540
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,440
harder

1541
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,200
and deeper you hit the ground the more

1542
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,200
effective you can get so again guys it's

1543
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:39,839
all

1544
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:41,920
um personal preference it's all case to

1545
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,839
case and again how much you're out there

1546
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:46,240
available

1547
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:49,359
here's another question aren't data

1548
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,599
brokers

1549
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,640
yes you can alan aren't data brokers and

1550
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,119
then

1551
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:58,640
of thieves so why should they trust them

1552
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,119
well it's you just never know right i

1553
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:01,920
mean it's

1554
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,640
you know it's a hit or miss thing so uh

1555
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,000
you can say that but again

1556
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,760
it's pretty much like google right i

1557
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,680
mean you you you search google

1558
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,760
how much google can be effective for you

1559
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,520
like google can get good information

1560
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:14,720
they can give

1561
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,599
a better information so um it's again

1562
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:19,599
like um

1563
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:21,040
something like if you doubt you know

1564
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,480
that's why there's an email out there

1565
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,000
the phone number you can contact

1566
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,520
and uh you know and look at their

1567
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,680
privacy i would always best suggest that

1568
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,400
you

1569
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,640
we all know from being a cyber security

1570
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,079
uh from a security person

1571
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:34,240
if you always read their privacy their

1572
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,599
terms of conditions

1573
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,200
that can be a good guide at good health

1574
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,040
so that will give a grounding of

1575
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,680
how they stand the establishment so if

1576
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,280
all is concerned about that i always

1577
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,480
suggest and i did

1578
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,559
read quite a lot of their privacy you

1579
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,800
can see been verified i did post that

1580
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,319
uh read that that kind of gives the

1581
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:53,040
grounding of the establishment so

1582
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,280
again it's a matter of who you're

1583
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,440
dealing with so

1584
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,480
all right got a couple more questions

1585
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,559
can you delete your information from the

1586
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:06,240
various government databases

1587
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,319
so from what i know is i believe that

1588
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:09,920
the way government operates a little

1589
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,119
different

1590
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:13,760
when i was military like opm they will

1591
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,480
not post their data

1592
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,920
because of course veteran knows better

1593
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,720
about protecting you

1594
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,040
so it's it's hard to say this is more

1595
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,000
like

1596
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,160
public public data right these data

1597
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,880
brokers are public information so

1598
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,000
and of course everything google is

1599
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,480
public information so this is more like

1600
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,000
i said you know a good example is

1601
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,680
private investigators using them of

1602
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,040
course they will not be using opm

1603
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,960
databases because that's only secured to

1604
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,720
lpm or state data libraries so

1605
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,520
i from my knowledge i wouldn't think

1606
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,319
that a

1607
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:49,440
federal local or county

1608
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,640
have databases out there now i know like

1609
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,559
for state they have

1610
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,920
uh sacramento b where they advertise

1611
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,359
uh people's first name last name and

1612
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:01,200
their salaries and this you know

1613
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,720
cdt website there's a couple other

1614
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,599
websites state agencies that they post

1615
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:07,119
directory data but again those are just

1616
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,640
minimal which is pretty much people's

1617
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,720
information their phone number so

1618
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,040
uh minimal to the damage but again it

1619
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,800
just all depends guys everything is

1620
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,559
case-to-case basis so

1621
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,319
you have to use your best judgment and

1622
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:19,839
mutual um

1623
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,680
mutual i believe mutual intelligence to

1624
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,119
just figure out how

1625
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:24,800
how you want to post those but from my

1626
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,720
understand like uh federal data

1627
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,119
will not be solved for example like if

1628
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,800
you go on irs site

1629
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,839
uh you like if you want to look up uh

1630
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:37,040
your text refunds right of course if

1631
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,559
somebody really has your social security

1632
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:40,000
number your first name last name i

1633
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:40,640
believe

1634
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:44,000
date of birth and your gross agi from

1635
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,520
last year then they can only find stuff

1636
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,400
like that so

1637
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,559
let all of those are secured and that

1638
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:49,920
contingent upon what you have

1639
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,839
a prior person

1640
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:56,240
somebody here is saying the california

1641
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,480
dmv was selling private info up to this

1642
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,319
day

1643
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:02,720
well i think uh yeah we all know like uh

1644
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,680
i believe what dmv had a

1645
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,599
was at last in l.a last year or

1646
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,799
before last year um yeah those things

1647
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:15,839
they happen but again you know we all

1648
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:17,520
know that state agencies

1649
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,599
they're pretty good about protecting uh

1650
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:21,839
people's data

1651
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:24,640
i think there was a issue last year in i

1652
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,839
can't remember

1653
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:28,960
la tnp agency had

1654
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,760
a breach or something so you know we all

1655
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,079
know right no data is uh fully secured

1656
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:35,839
uh people can break into data centers

1657
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:36,720
and steal data

1658
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,760
and post them on uh

1659
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,760
deep web and things along the lines so

1660
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,839
you know um we all know mailchimp you

1661
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:44,400
know

1662
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,440
sells that data to third party so again

1663
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,960
guys we live in a very complex

1664
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:49,839
complicated world

1665
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:51,280
everything is going digital everything

1666
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,040
is going cyber um

1667
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,720
you always want to be on a positive note

1668
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,640
and work on this

1669
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:03,280
um right so it looks like they actually

1670
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,440
were selling personal data according to

1671
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,280
a link that was posted here

1672
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:17,839
um is there any other questions

1673
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,079
this was a great presentation daryl uh

1674
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,839
thank you very much this is awesome

1675
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:25,440
i actually took a picture of this data

1676
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,040
broker so i'm gonna go

1677
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,280
and try to erase myself on this it's

1678
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,319
funny because you

1679
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:32,079
you go to def com and you go to all

1680
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:33,680
these places and basically

1681
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,760
it becomes actually believe it or not

1682
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,040
it's a ctf where you

1683
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,240
you end up using this uh

1684
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,680
data brokers to dox somebody uh

1685
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,440
this is heavily used in open source

1686
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,680
intelligence heavily used

1687
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,319
right right

1688
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:54,640
oh here's the uh another question can

1689
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,480
you ask dmb

1690
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,839
not to sell your data

1691
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,000
well i believe that's something maybe

1692
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,760
what uh how can i put it

1693
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:07,440
um that's uh between you and dmv right i

1694
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,720
can definitely you can reach out to them

1695
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,319
many different ways you can take a legal

1696
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:11,440
approach or

1697
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,359
you know i'm sure like they're doing

1698
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:15,760
things to fix that it's just like

1699
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,799
is it the um

1700
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,400
like any any agency when they have a

1701
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,079
data breach i believe sony had a data

1702
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:23,040
breach some time back

1703
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,640
and a lot of people's password username

1704
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,559
was stolen whatever so so people

1705
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:29,760
reach out to you and help you

1706
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,000
to go through a certain process to fix

1707
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,520
your data some people will give you

1708
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,160
access to

1709
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,839
i believe certain amount of time where

1710
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:37,440
you can access your

1711
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,200
credit history your credit report though

1712
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,960
so you can fix the damages things along

1713
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,240
the lines i mean it's a little bit of

1714
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,680
process so

1715
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,839
i would say in this case if you feel you

1716
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:47,920
know i cannot speak for dmv i don't work

1717
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,040
for them and

1718
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,520
this is just a webinar uh giving you an

1719
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,400
idea about

1720
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,599
how certain concepts work uh

1721
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:57,839
my best approach reach out to dmv and

1722
00:57:57,839 --> 00:57:58,720
then see how

1723
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,280
they can help of course you know we can

1724
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,119
see dmv

1725
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:04,799
these other agencies out there that has

1726
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:06,640
you very much of your personal data

1727
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,720
your insurance companies and now if they

1728
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,000
get breached of course

1729
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,319
um they are there to protect you and

1730
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:14,799
help you what to do to get that fixed so

1731
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:17,839
it all matters so i act sorry i can

1732
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:18,640
speak under

1733
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:22,000
on behalf of dmv in this case

1734
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,839
