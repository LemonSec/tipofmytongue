1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,969
I'm a cyber guy cybersecurity guy so I

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:06,640
lend my skills from rod I'm gonna trade

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:13,769
that start with there we go all right

4
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,510
enjoy guys some thank you everybody so

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,610
necessarily is a free product that we

6
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,789
give out our founder and the person that

7
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:27,609
it basically invented this is Renault

8
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:30,490
and Renault basically said look I want

9
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,558
to give back to the community we're

10
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,210
going to put this out there and we're

11
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,739
gonna give a you know a certain

12
00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:37,300
limitation but certain things he did not

13
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,660
limit and I argued with him on that

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,180
greatly about it so a quick little sales

15
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,129
pitch this is essentials is free this

16
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:48,640
limitation is 16 IP addresses can be

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,230
scanned let's say deeply and you can

18
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,860
discover any number of IP address you

19
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,840
want so discovery we don't care about in

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,969
terms of limitations but once you start

21
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:03,670
using the plugins and such to go in and

22
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,369
examine that device that's where you

23
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:10,119
have the limitation of 16 so the way we

24
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:12,340
do this think of it like in map on

25
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,880
steroids once we discover things we want

26
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,789
to say what is possibly vulnerable here

27
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:20,679
and so we have these things called

28
00:01:20,679 --> 00:01:22,990
plugins which are basically the snippets

29
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,579
of code that are written in a language

30
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:29,139
we created called nasal NASL which is

31
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:32,829
basically a cut-down version of C when

32
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:34,539
they invented this way back they that's

33
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:38,259
what they used and so they created these

34
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:40,060
little plugins that will go do various

35
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,590
tests we have currently over it's over a

36
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,539
hundred thousand plugins today that we

37
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:51,069
can run against things the key thing

38
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,859
about plugins is what should be your

39
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:56,590
focus should be what has come out in the

40
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:00,789
last 30 days because that's what most

41
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:02,889
the bad guys are looking for so the

42
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:04,809
thread actors will see okay look here's

43
00:02:04,809 --> 00:02:06,429
a new CVE let's see if they're

44
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:07,029
vulnerable

45
00:02:07,029 --> 00:02:08,258
then I'm gonna go after them that's

46
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:10,419
where they get most of their your

47
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,790
success the older stuff most people have

48
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:13,590
patched

49
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,450
they're not as interested in it as a

50
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:20,099
matter of fact on Patch Tuesday

51
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:23,109
Microsoft puts out their patches the

52
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:24,879
next day you'll see a significant number

53
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,019
of plugins that we create within 24

54
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:32,409
hours and part of this in reviewing

55
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:36,280
patches is what's here we discovered

56
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,090
over a hundred zero day exploits nine

57
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,659
hour zero day exploits and by just

58
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:46,840
looking at what was patched and figuring

59
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,439
out different ways to effectively do the

60
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:54,730
same thing somebody is not somebody's

61
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:02,349
typing a lot okay thank you so what we

62
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,500
can do is with all those plugins is very

63
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,049
quickly tell you if there's other ways

64
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:11,769
to accomplish this exploit and now at

65
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:14,079
least you know what's going on yes you

66
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:16,269
may not have a patch for it but at the

67
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:19,030
same time we can probably help you learn

68
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,069
how to mitigate it because quite

69
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:25,979
honestly no tenable focuses a lot on

70
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:29,379
patching and such but in reality if you

71
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:30,909
know for those of you that are out in

72
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:32,859
the real world you know that I can't

73
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:35,650
always patch 250,000 endpoints it

74
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,359
doesn't happen even though 100 endpoints

75
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:38,979
I may not be able to patch right away

76
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:41,769
how do I stop the threat well normally I

77
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:44,409
go to my firewall or IPS system whatever

78
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:46,299
and try to put something in there to

79
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:48,879
help me block it from coming in needless

80
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,400
to say we give you all that information

81
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,310
so and this is essential free the number

82
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,989
of plugins and this is where I disagreed

83
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:58,479
with no I was saying look if you're

84
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,859
giving it away for free don't give them

85
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:03,489
all the plugins you know datum so that

86
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:05,109
they you know they can use some of the

87
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:08,199
the current stuff but up to like you

88
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:11,469
know within the last 30 let's say 30

89
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:13,719
days an older that's what I mean snortin

90
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:16,269
has that if you get snort signatures if

91
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,829
you don't pay for them they're giving

92
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,839
you old snort signatures but Reno said

93
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,150
nope I promised the community that I

94
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,490
wouldn't do that and they're gonna get

95
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,510
all the plugins and that's that are so

96
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:30,320
I was overturned good for you you you

97
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,090
can get literally the latest and

98
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,190
greatest information on vulnerabilities

99
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,730
using necess essentials limitation 16 IP

100
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,380
addresses that's where you're going to

101
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:39,850
get it

102
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,690
so prerequisites now hardware to if

103
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,390
you're gonna do 16 IP is a big deal two

104
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:50,570
CPUs basic 2 cores 4 Giga memories is

105
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,540
plenty maybe 30 gigs of disk space it

106
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,920
all depends on what you're trying to do

107
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,870
now if you're using neces Pro or one of

108
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,360
the other ones you can go online here

109
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,320
and get the requirements that we have so

110
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,000
you can look at it and saying hey I'm

111
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,860
gonna do this many IP addresses what do

112
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,330
I really need we all our stuff comes out

113
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,030
using WinPcap we're actually in the

114
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,710
process of changing that because when

115
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,740
pcap is not being updated and we want to

116
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,980
use n pcap what i want to tell you is

117
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,270
i'm going to show you as you install

118
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:27,650
this stuff go to the in mapped org and

119
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,450
you can download the current version of

120
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,880
an pcap i'll show you how to put it in

121
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,790
here so when you go to download Nessus

122
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:39,200
essentials quick let's see it's gonna

123
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,680
basically show you here all the things

124
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,190
you can buy yeah I want to download that

125
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,320
and it's gonna ask you to register

126
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,570
because you will need an activation code

127
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,980
so if you don't register and you

128
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,670
download it

129
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,860
sure no problem you just won't be able

130
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,110
to activate it so yes we are collecting

131
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,970
your information but guess what the

132
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,620
majority of people that are using nessus

133
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,860
these Ness essentials it's fine yes

134
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,330
you're going to get some stuff but look

135
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,940
you have to opt in if you say check to

136
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,100
receive updates from tenable right will

137
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,880
talk to you if you don't you know don't

138
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,960
worry about it you're going to get the

139
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,640
registration code and everything else

140
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,480
you can throw on the stand and folder

141
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:26,090
alright so once you install it what I

142
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,580
want you to do is you download it you

143
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,350
install it you're gonna see the screen

144
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,810
at some point at this point what you

145
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:37,130
want to do is stop stop the service so

146
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,570
whether it's some Linux or and window

147
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,639
stop the service

148
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:43,240
and then you're gonna look for a wind

149
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,979
pcap well windows is right so it's

150
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:46,319
windows peek-a-view like i see on linux

151
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,189
WinPcap uninstall WinPcap and then

152
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:55,599
install the NP cap and one of the things

153
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,300
you'll see is it has this will come up

154
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,419
and i'll say install and p cap with

155
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:04,509
winpcap api compatible mode so now you

156
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:06,159
have the latest and greatest when you

157
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,439
start the necessary and windows you know

158
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:10,509
be happy won't complain everything will

159
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:12,460
work just great but definitely that's

160
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,419
the one little trick install it to that

161
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:18,279
screen it says hey which one do you

162
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,680
wanna install stop there close the

163
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,560
screen stop the service uninstall one p

164
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:29,800
cap install NP cap all right this is

165
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,659
where we download it you're gonna get my

166
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,189
c mail with the activation code gotta

167
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:36,669
have that and then once you got let's go

168
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:38,400
back one more time here okay so the

169
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,860
buying area that you get actually can

170
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:45,069
run one of four different things in this

171
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:47,710
case obviously necessary one will ask

172
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:51,310
for an activation code so is exactly the

173
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,930
same binary so you go hit continue here

174
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,300
you put in your activation code and then

175
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,099
it's gonna say i'm downloading plugins

176
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:02,110
and then it's gonna say I'm compiling a

177
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,089
plugins this is where you go away for

178
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:06,039
coffee for about 20 minutes it's gonna

179
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:08,349
take a while to do so it does need to

180
00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:10,120
compile everything it all depends on

181
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,669
your bandwidth what computer your have

182
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:14,349
it takes a little while to get it

183
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:17,379
initially going so go away have fun play

184
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:21,520
some games come back one of the things

185
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,500
that we do is we're trying to make it

186
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,110
really really easy for you to start

187
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,360
using this without getting a lot of

188
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,919
training and so we're gonna step you

189
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,010
through some things at the beginning of

190
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,360
it so if you're already known s is like

191
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,789
yeah I don't need the lecture here let

192
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,740
me just go do my stuff fine just close

193
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,208
it out you can go do whatever you want

194
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,769
by the way there's a little

195
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:43,599
advertisement up here saying yeah you

196
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,510
can say 40 percent if you go to checkout

197
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,220
and upload so that's my sales pitch

198
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,649
sorry but you can start putting in

199
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:53,580
targets here and it will do a discovery

200
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,380
initially and it'll start showing you

201
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,420
hey these are the ones I'm discovering

202
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,810
and you know depending on how big of a

203
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,800
slice should give it it's going to take

204
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,970
a while 16 IP address limitation is not

205
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:10,260
applicable here discovery you don't care

206
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,820
it's when you start looking and probing

207
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,740
and using the plugins that's when it's

208
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,290
going to say something now for my money

209
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:21,070
this is about the same pace as nmap

210
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,290
doing an nmap scan versus you know using

211
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,060
this you're you're doing the same thing

212
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,080
so you could use nmap right once it's

213
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,250
discovered a bunch of them that's gonna

214
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,410
ask you would you like to now start you

215
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,030
know going and figuring out what's going

216
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,430
on with these particular devices pick

217
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,650
your 16 IP addresses that you want

218
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:41,620
select them run the scan and all of a

219
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,630
sudden you'll start seeing results now

220
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,850
this is an email that I have here you

221
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,040
know stretch at gmail if you want to get

222
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,080
a hold of me I'll leave that up for a

223
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,390
moment but I'm gonna go into the actual

224
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,070
necessary now and show you that so okay

225
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,350
here we go

226
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:07,500
let's see let me login why aren't you

227
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,260
there we go

228
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,279
lovely

229
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:17,910
pass okay so the screen shots I took

230
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,889
came from this instance that I'm showing

231
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:22,540
you right now so here's my host

232
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,050
discovery scan here's everything that I

233
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:28,240
found says hey by the way I saw a few

234
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,949
ports just let you know because it's

235
00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:31,420
using those ports as well to kind of

236
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,309
identify the operating system saying hey

237
00:10:33,309 --> 00:10:35,649
you know I see some of these things here

238
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:38,259
I know that's related to windows so I'm

239
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:39,939
going to guess at what some of that

240
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,339
stuff is without having to log in ok so

241
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:44,139
I see all of the range it's in there

242
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:45,879
it's gonna say hey there's a couple of

243
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,259
owner abilities but it's just giving you

244
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:49,959
hey this is informational that's all

245
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:54,009
we're doing nothing big I did my basic

246
00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:56,769
scan and now without even logging into

247
00:10:56,769 --> 00:10:59,980
the system it's already showing me here

248
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,480
are vulnerabilities and what's going on

249
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,670
so great what do I got

250
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:06,069
I got runner abilities I can list them

251
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:08,620
all out here if I want I got some

252
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,509
remediation advice saying hey by the way

253
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:12,579
on this particular item need to upgrade

254
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:15,100
that stuff sold why you got that there

255
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,480
and you can go into it and it can show

256
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,000
you what's out there like hey here's the

257
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,069
vulnerability here's critical here's the

258
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:25,750
thing that I like it gives you a

259
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,939
description of what's going on gives you

260
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:28,990
a place that if you want more

261
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,720
information you can go to it it also

262
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,449
shows you the risk factors what CVE

263
00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:38,250
numbers are and stuff personally my

264
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:42,490
feeling about sea V's is that over 60%

265
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:45,040
of them are high and critical I don't

266
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,459
like that so it's not giving me

267
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:50,680
necessarily as useful a piece of

268
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,699
information as I would like to have but

269
00:11:53,699 --> 00:11:57,629
for me it gives me a start I know how

270
00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:00,459
risky this particular system is and

271
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:02,110
whether it's really on the internet or

272
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,809
not my favorite part is this is three

273
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:06,759
three eight nine if you're a hacker

274
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:10,839
you'll know that eternal blue work on

275
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:13,870
this it's the the malware from the NSA

276
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,360
that keeps on giving so I know that this

277
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,399
is a very nasty thing that I need to go

278
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,379
fix right now that's why we're saying

279
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:22,509
it's critical you get all your

280
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:24,519
information there and you can go through

281
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:26,400
it that's just stuff that I have

282
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,370
even logged into the system once I start

283
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,750
finding this and I said look I really

284
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:35,700
want detail on this I'm gonna target the

285
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,730
system I'm gonna have it go to scan and

286
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,250
then let it login because now we can do

287
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,560
all sorts of really interesting things

288
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,310
once we go in Microsoft Windows first of

289
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,020
all I'm running a really old version of

290
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,240
it so you know if I was consulting the

291
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,220
first thing I would say the rest of this

292
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,800
stuff is interesting but bottom line if

293
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,940
you don't upgrade to a different

294
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,340
operating system none of this none of

295
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,590
this really matters but your system is

296
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:04,200
like so open it's it's not funny you

297
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,240
might as well just you know quit while

298
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,770
you're ahead and just tell everybody hey

299
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:11,730
come hack me so I of course I've used a

300
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:14,430
system that I can show a lot of bugs on

301
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,280
we give a lot of informational things so

302
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,260
on so forth so now these are things that

303
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:29,820
my scans how do I even run a scan yeah I

304
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,470
don't need to know about this go away

305
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,390
if I want to run my own scan his host

306
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,490
discovery which we already showed is you

307
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,500
can do it as much as you want unlimited

308
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,680
IP addresses or I can go in here and

309
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,200
start doing other types of scans now you

310
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,610
will notice some of these have a banner

311
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,910
saying upgrade so those mean that you

312
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,340
have to get neces Pro in order to do

313
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,990
that so we don't let you do any kind of

314
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:58,230
compliance scans we're gonna do scans of

315
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,180
mobile devices yes we do do mobile

316
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,490
devices you have to go buy an upgrade

317
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:06,480
for that so what I like to do is I like

318
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,250
to use the advanced scans let me show

319
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,350
you what that looks like I give it a

320
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,870
name description here's the full er

321
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,570
where I want to store it so that the

322
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,280
files that are generated the raw files

323
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,960
are actually very readable you can open

324
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,420
it up in an editor and start figuring

325
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,550
out a scrap of yourself you give it the

326
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,590
target of what you want to take a look

327
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,620
at and then you can go and say look I do

328
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,980
want to schedule it can you have a

329
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,150
limitation here you have you can

330
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:36,330
schedule one scan and that's it and

331
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,100
that's probably gonna do as many as you

332
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:38,890
want

333
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,110
once it's finished who do I want to

334
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,850
notify its asking me hey look you

335
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,440
haven't configured us some TP server

336
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,150
tell me where it is so I can do this you

337
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,280
can get a notification say yeah go run

338
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,850
let me know when you're finished what do

339
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,040
I want to discover and how do I want to

340
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,890
do it you know I do initial discovery

341
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:59,650
type things where I do ping these are

342
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:03,490
all fine things and using our poor TCP

343
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:06,730
our ICMP what I would like to see this

344
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:10,720
product use more is something called HP

345
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,240
if you're familiar with that there's

346
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,070
some better ways to do discoveries then

347
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,960
we're doing right here and then I will

348
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,880
admit that and some people have told us

349
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,800
look can you just give us access within

350
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,800
here to an IMAP and no we're not going

351
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,390
to give that to you at this point that

352
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,670
they just don't want to do I'm trying to

353
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,410
make this work a little better if you do

354
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:32,710
UDP you can take a lot of time and

355
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:35,440
remember as you do some of these make

356
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,210
sure you know your remote host spar

357
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:40,080
because if you set the wrong settings

358
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,330
you can effectively DDoS a system and

359
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,400
bring it down it's it's a very common

360
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,330
problem port scans you tell it exactly

361
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:52,660
what you want in range or we have some

362
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,540
defaults that we can do how do you want

363
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,210
to go doing it here's the sin to do net

364
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,800
port or scanner or you can do it other

365
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,260
ways we got a lot of them I'm not going

366
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,510
to go into too much stuff the thing I

367
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,250
want to mention here is when you go into

368
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,040
the port scanning depending if you're

369
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,600
doing matting or you're having to go

370
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,270
across a firewall to get at an endpoint

371
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:17,320
can be a problem and if it does we have

372
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,750
agents that you can log you can put down

373
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,370
locally again that's the paid for

374
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,250
version and be able to use agents to do

375
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:29,350
some of these requests services you can

376
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,970
look for here if you want to go through

377
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,870
SSL what is the assessment going to be

378
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:37,420
I'm gonna go to deepen this reporting

379
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,890
how do you want the results to come out

380
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,270
so that you can do stuff do you want me

381
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:44,560
to use stuff by their DNS names how do

382
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,160
you want me to give you that information

383
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,690
then there are some advanced settings

384
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,640
this is where you start getting into how

385
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,600
do I tune

386
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,720
scans so that I make sure that I'm not

387
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,069
going to DDoS somebody so how many

388
00:16:57,069 --> 00:16:59,170
simultaneous ones I'm going to do I

389
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,670
don't want to be a bother to my network

390
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:04,419
again time for that would be another day

391
00:17:04,419 --> 00:17:06,490
if you want to get into the deep dive of

392
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,089
necess

393
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:09,280
we do credentials of course so you can

394
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,980
go in and say ok give me you know what

395
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,569
Windows credentials you have how you

396
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:15,819
want me to log in now I can go in and do

397
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:19,089
a really very deep dive in to see what

398
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:21,130
vulnerabilities are there and we have

399
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:23,829
all sorts of different ways of doing it

400
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:27,789
so a lot of stuff there plugins here we

401
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:31,480
go so let's look at this there's a ton

402
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,799
of plugins out there and you're gonna

403
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,510
look at it and say well wait a minute I

404
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:37,809
am only going to do Windows devices but

405
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:40,240
you got sent OS do I really have to go

406
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,039
in here and select and unselect which

407
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:46,059
plugins now you don't when it identifies

408
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:48,250
what the host is and what type of host

409
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,770
it is it says look this isn't Windows 10

410
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:54,549
box the Amazon Linux stuff doesn't apply

411
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:57,070
I'm not gonna run it so it is smart

412
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,620
enough to know what is applicable based

413
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,690
on how well it can tell what the

414
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,370
operating system is and it will apply

415
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:06,549
plugins as needed you of course can go

416
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:09,940
and say look I know that I'm gonna go do

417
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,309
Windows and it's a bunch of them here

418
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:14,590
but you know what I only need a few of

419
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,809
them and I don't need to do everything

420
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:18,820
so I can select look only due to the

421
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,590
user management part of the Windows

422
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:24,370
plugins and that's it so you can be as

423
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,840
specific as you want you can say look

424
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,880
you you drive I want to go into

425
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,289
automatic fine no problem so that's how

426
00:18:32,289 --> 00:18:34,600
you set up an initial scan there and let

427
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:42,190
me show you that's just one template the

428
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,110
advanced dynamic scan is saying hey

429
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:47,530
listen guys I want to do everything but

430
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:50,409
I want to also focus on there's a new CD

431
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:52,299
out there today I don't know what

432
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:55,900
plugins that are applicable to that I'm

433
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,870
gonna give you a CVE you figure it out

434
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,990
go scan and tell me what the results are

435
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:04,210
so it's very nice for you to do that and

436
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,160
of course we go

437
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,160
it's not just CDs but it's a whole bunch

438
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:14,680
of different your search Elliott which I

439
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,360
never honestly I never even heard of

440
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,150
this one Elliott exploit framework so

441
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,370
there's a lot of things we track that

442
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:26,140
you can go in there and put in also you

443
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,840
can put in advanced stuff like if you

444
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,390
want to go do yarrow rules as part of

445
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,370
the assessment you can add them in there

446
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,740
if you want to look for hashes for file

447
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,870
like let's say you know here's a hash of

448
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:40,030
a piece of malware that's just came out

449
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,920
please go scan everybody to see if this

450
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,270
file exists you can do that so we have a

451
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,950
lot of things you can do even when this

452
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:51,130
was essentials there are things called

453
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,840
policies where you can create custom

454
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,700
templates so that when you're scanning

455
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,440
you can you know if you're gonna do

456
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,700
something over and over again with a

457
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,320
scan template you can create your own

458
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,840
policies of how you want to run plug-in

459
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,360
rules we'll say look you come and you

460
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,460
tell me that this thing is very high and

461
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,010
critical but for me it isn't so I want

462
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:13,960
to recast that as being low threat to me

463
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,870
not a high threat so as you go run your

464
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,670
scans over and over and you keep on

465
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,350
seeing something coming up and saying

466
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,850
hey listen this is a high threats like

467
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:24,880
no dude that's its internal this will

468
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,830
talk to the Internet I consider it low

469
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,930
so just every time you see that just

470
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,400
said I love for me I don't want to deal

471
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,220
with you again so there's ways to make

472
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,690
it easier for you to keep on running

473
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,760
these without having to go through every

474
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,780
little scan option and set it each time

475
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,820
okay we're coming up close to the top of

476
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,050
the hour here I want to make sure

477
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:47,320
there's time for questions so let me

478
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,400
break it off at this point

479
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,440
what questions does anybody have and

480
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,950
just come on up and ask them I'll try

481
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:59,080
Lincoln was it the chat yeah hi Eric can

482
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,010
you hear me yeah please so it's kind of

483
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,360
pretty cool though how much you explain

484
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,100
especially in the credentials I know

485
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,010
there's like product key this API key

486
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,290
and linking key can you elaborate the

487
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,270
difference between the three and how

488
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,190
they would be used in this context here

489
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,590
I think and untellable has those right

490
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,400
around when you start to do

491
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,470
okay let me make sure I got this right

492
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:24,770
so that we're going in here oh this is

493
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:25,790
the keys you're talking about are you

494
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,080
talking about a different one because we

495
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,180
use a API I'm thinking something else

496
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,250
yeah there's API key there's a linking

497
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,930
key I kind of noticed them around when I

498
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,290
was doing this like last year something

499
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,620
IBM data power gateway they use an API

500
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,950
gateway to do their stuff to that cloud

501
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,990
services hey there's Amazon your

502
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:47,660
favorite buddies use your office

503
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:51,530
Rackspace so they have their own way of

504
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:53,630
logging in and we had to do some stuff

505
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,790
to support that so that's what these

506
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:59,390
different keys are some on you know DB

507
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:01,880
how do you log in with that well we have

508
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,380
to do it a little bit differently so we

509
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,910
just give you that option okay you're

510
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,430
good old FTP if you're using FTP let me

511
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,170
know because I want to come in and try

512
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:16,690
out a few things on you when I set up my

513
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:19,370
terrible - you know terrible was running

514
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:22,070
on ec2 instances you know of course you

515
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,900
have to connect terrible with AWS right

516
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,520
I think there are the DevOps were using

517
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,110
linking keys I can't really didn't

518
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,220
understand that infrastructure

519
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,770
architecture because I wasn't there when

520
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:33,320
it was set up from get going so I kinda

521
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,240
always wondering about what that linking

522
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,610
Keys was that and I think the moment you

523
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:39,620
changed linking keys or break them it

524
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,590
disconnects the terrible in the AWS

525
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,000
environment so I don't know if that

526
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,630
helps yeah you know I'm sorry I don't

527
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:52,450
know enough about the ones specifically

528
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,720
to access what would the difference be

529
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,090
there between Access ID key and access

530
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:06,200
key I honestly don't know I just knew

531
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,180
that when I did the VPNs long time ago

532
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,580
and I had to do yet a Buchanan - there I

533
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,520
had to have those - you set up the keys

534
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,400
they'd say here here's your stuff

535
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,450
remember it otherwise what I kind of

536
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,820
tell you again and then this is where I

537
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,290
would you know go put them in send me

538
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:24,080
it's like a username password okay cool

539
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,880
fair enough but that's good think it all

540
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,300
other questions

541
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,700
by the way I saw somebody say go to ebay

542
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,380
to find palo alto networks unified

543
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,020
threat management box be very leery of

544
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,760
buying anything off of ebay cuz you

545
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,380
never know if it's something that

546
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,710
they'll say basically hey you want

547
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,520
support on this

548
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,230
we noticed that that thing is out of

549
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:52,090
support or somebody used it as a demo

550
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:55,150
box and it is not for resale you can get

551
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,370
screwed on ebay on doing that but go to

552
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:00,790
that virtual graffiti they sell palo

553
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:01,930
alto as well under one of their other

554
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:05,650
names but back to necess i'm also

555
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,090
curious if there are other things you

556
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,620
would like to see in and maybe a deep

557
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:12,820
dive of neces pro for another time I'm

558
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,430
happy to bring some people on and we can

559
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,500
we can go into you know how would you do

560
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,940
red teaming or blue teaming we use this

561
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,420
for red teaming at the collegiate cyber

562
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,760
defense competition

563
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,920
some people use open bass but this is

564
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:34,090
much more in-depth so it's great for

565
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,340
figuring out what the blue team has and

566
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:46,390
where I can go nail the subject for ya

567
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:48,010
just let me know and I'm happy to bring

568
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,480
on whoever I can it do you want to meet

569
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,700
Renault I can ask them if you would be

570
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,620
willing to do that and see if he's

571
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,540
important and you can meet the inventor

572
00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:03,670
of Eric on this the family of NASA's I

573
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,250
know the the hierarchy umbrella is like

574
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,280
this terrible of course ausmus's but the

575
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,960
non terrible side you know in which I

576
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,180
don't know where Nestle in you have two

577
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,710
things right here at a level IO which is

578
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,030
a cloud and then you have Security

579
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,460
Center which is the one prime

580
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,800
environment right and then net this runs

581
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,200
on both can you can you help understand

582
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,380
the the product or so-called hierarchy

583
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,880
infrastructure like you if you if you

584
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:32,860
don't mind yeah sure so I'm actually one

585
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,420
of the product managers for security

586
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:38,200
center suite and so it's all the on-prem

587
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,470
stuff so yes here we are saying we're

588
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,850
number one in management this is where I

589
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:45,380
just told you you like yeah big deal

590
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,300
right if you tell it for no comes on and

591
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,040
you said that Eric said it's not a big

592
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,180
deal you're gonna get me fired I'm

593
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:50,930
coming after you

594
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:53,960
so don't do it no problem we're number

595
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,400
one

596
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,190
[Laughter]

597
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,570
nessus is the foundation it's the one

598
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,490
that goes and does the scanning figures

599
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,080
that the vulnerabilities creates all the

600
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,550
reports and data security Center takes

601
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,950
it in and gives you reporting and

602
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,930
management of multiple scanners so like

603
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:14,810
if you have a quarter million endpoints

604
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,750
you're not going to use one necess Pro

605
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:20,960
even though it can do a lot it can't

606
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,130
scale up that you have to have multiple

607
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:26,510
scanners SC is a way to manage it

608
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:29,510
centrally and taking the reports

609
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,970
consolidate them give you whatever

610
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,020
information you need

611
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:36,560
io is specific to the cloud so what it's

612
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,210
saying hey look I want to throw

613
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:39,410
everything in the cloud I don't want to

614
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,840
have it on Prem you can still run your

615
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,540
on-prem scan so necess is sitting on

616
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,970
prem somewhere io can manage them

617
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:50,060
through a VPN and you just bring

618
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,350
everything up into the cloud because a

619
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,360
lot of people like having stuff in the

620
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,220
cloud so those are the key ones at one

621
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,660
point they were going to get rid of

622
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,790
security Center and there was such a

623
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:05,390
backlash it wasn't funny so that's one

624
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,580
of the reasons I got hired is to fill in

625
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,410
the void of some of the product managers

626
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:12,670
who left the other thing we're doing is

627
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:15,770
lumen which is more of a product that

628
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:19,250
goes into how to calculate risk we have

629
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:22,340
some our own proprietary stuff I don't

630
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,020
go too much into it but basically if

631
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,220
you're interested in learning how to

632
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:28,160
better gauge risk lumen is a new product

633
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,820
that we're pushing

634
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,600
operational technology in Internet of

635
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,910
Things this is where you get your SCADA

636
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:42,050
and your manufacturing type controls it

637
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:43,490
goes in there it's a company we bought

638
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:46,250
called NDG this out of israel really

639
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,890
really good if you're into that kind of

640
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:51,860
thing take a look at it and then we show

641
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,830
these other components like specialized

642
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:57,110
components of i/o like web application

643
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,120
scanning container security

644
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,510
to that PCI ASV which is people who are

645
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,490
specifically hey I just want to do PCI

646
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:05,600
type compliance

647
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,840
we've got like little modules that you

648
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,970
can add on into that but everything

649
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:13,370
comes from necess that's the core to

650
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:14,900
everything we do everything else helps

651
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:18,640
you manage that and make it more usable

652
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,350
it's like the or more underlying engine

653
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:24,650
right that's the dirty test ah they're

654
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:25,250
useless

655
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,750
this is the engine and this is the car

656
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,830
that we put it in this could be a

657
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,080
forklift this one here could be you know

658

659
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:43,340
coming up to the top the our rod if

660
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,710

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,980
the other companies that are under it

663
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,800

668
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:15,200
