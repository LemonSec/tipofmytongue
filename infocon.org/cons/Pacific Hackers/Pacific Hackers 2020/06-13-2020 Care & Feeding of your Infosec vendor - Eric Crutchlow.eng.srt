00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,449
in cases so the things get bad and we

17

get I don't know hopefully that won't be

18
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,420
the case but but we have to watch what's

19
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,510
gonna happen but we'll be looking at the

20

125
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,280
product that's probably the one that

126
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,070
we're most famous for the founder of the

127

company and the inventor of necess

128
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,979
Renault is still with the company very

129
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:58,310
much so and wants to contribute and give

130
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,620
back to the community as well so what

131
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,060
I'm going to do is first I'm going to

132
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,770
talk about what I call care and feeding

133
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,139
of your security vendor or dealing with

134
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:09,440
the salespeople as they come after you

135
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,400
and give you some of the insights one of

136
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,380
the things that I had done in my career

137
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,449
here is I worked as a security engineer

138
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:20,150
or a sales engineer for quite a while

139
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,490
and really know the ins and outs and

140
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,020
there's some good things to learn

141
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,310
there's also some things from the

142
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,780
standpoint of ok if you're going to

143
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,120
engage with people in sales what's the

144
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,039
best way to you know get a good price

145
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,870
make sure that you're not wasting your

146
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,700
time not making making sure than wasting

147
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,030
their time so what this first part of

148
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,770
the presentation is going to be is how

149
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,380
do you do that and then the second

150
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,750
presentation I have is using one of our

151
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,000
products called necess essentials which

152
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,760
is a free version of necess for doing

153
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,650
scanning and we can get a little

154
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:55,729
hands-on on that please feel free to ask

155
00:07:55,729 --> 00:07:57,889
questions and such I'll definitely have

156
00:07:57,889 --> 00:07:59,720
a moment at the end we'll go through

157
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,849
that and I'll give you my contact

158

161
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,610
we're gonna go over some of the goals

162
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,820

166
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,699
money how do they you know pitch to a

167
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:25,310
customer what is the the spiel for how

168
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:29,539
to set that up how to say no early if

169
00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:31,099
you really don't want to deal with

170
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:33,260
salespeople there's a good way to just

171
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,120
get out of it very quickly and I'll go

172
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,429
over that getting a good deal so let's

173
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:40,370
say ok now I do want this what what is

174
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,599
the best way to get the best

175
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,458
price what's the difference between

176
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:46,579
going from a reseller who sells you know

177
00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:48,199
various products from different vendors

178
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:50,240
are going directly to just the vendor

179
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,610
where is the the best way to do that and

180
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,009
then I'm gonna end with some marketing

181
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:58,550
fluff which is basically they sit there

182
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,990
and they say yeah we're the best in the

183
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,300
industry and Gartner says we are in blah

184
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,639
blah blah and you know let's talk about

185
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:07,670
zero day now where all these things that

186
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:11,180
basically you don't need to hear and I

187
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,920
just want to make you aware of some of

188
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,720
it you probably already are but also

189
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,670
ways to get around not having to deal

190
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,000
with that crap alright so little

191
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,870
philosophical ideas you know in this

192
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,910
industry I've done a lot of stuff and

193
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,889
I've dealt with all sorts of people and

194
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:30,199
sales people can be crazy but I I

195
00:09:30,199 --> 00:09:31,519
literally have dealt with people who

196
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,990
were paranoid schizophrenics and stuff

197
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,410
like that and and I had one who my wife

198
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,690
who I was dating at the time I called

199
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,339
her up and I said hey Laura what's going

200
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:43,850
on how do I do this just look don't let

201
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,529
somebody else is craziness become your

202
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:46,189
crazies

203
00:09:46,189 --> 00:09:48,500
so when sales people come after you and

204
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,810
do things and they get you riled up

205
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:53,180
there's no reason to don't let somebody

206
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,970
else's craisins become your craziness

207
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,019
you're not getting the Commission on the

208
00:09:57,019 --> 00:10:00,050
deal then trust is given not earned a

209
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,329
lot of people when you think about it

210
00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:05,149
you just give trust you're not saying

211
00:10:05,149 --> 00:10:06,439
this like let's try this and see what

212
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,360
happens but it comes in they have a

213
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,389
meeting you're trusting them to you know

214
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:14,750
use your time wisely so it's not going

215
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,939
to be earned until you sit there and say

216
00:10:16,939 --> 00:10:18,680
look this is how I want to have this

217
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,399
meeting run engage in dialogue by asking

218
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,680
questions so a lot of times people will

219
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,319
make statements and it doesn't really

220
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:29,180
get you very far if you really want to

221
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,160
know what somebody is thinking or doing

222
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,230
engage in dialogue and from a sales

223
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,750
standpoint that's really important if I

224
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,399
want to know what's going on I'm going

225
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:39,589
to ask you some questions to try and see

226
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:41,329
you know what's your current status

227
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:44,060
where things are but I'm also going to

228
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,310
try and do it in a way that is not just

229
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,860
the typical and I'll going this later

230
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,240
what keeps you up at night that's always

231
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,799
one of the worst things to ask

232
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,279
then set expectations if you're going to

233
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:59,099
do stuff in sales and you want to deal

234
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:00,959
with the salesperson and you want to

235
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,609
make sure you're getting what you think

236
00:11:02,609 --> 00:11:05,699
you are always put it in writing it's

237
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:08,549
key so you have a meeting and they said

238
00:11:08,549 --> 00:11:11,969
yeah this thing can do XYZ just in the

239
00:11:11,969 --> 00:11:13,739
name L and saying hey you know loved

240
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,989
your presentation this is my

241
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:17,789
understanding of some of the things that

242
00:11:17,789 --> 00:11:20,129
it can do and just want to put it in

243
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:21,599
writing just so you can confirm that

244
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:25,049
yeah that I do have it right and if you

245
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:27,059
find up putting things in writing you'll

246
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:28,649
all of a sudden see these people kind of

247
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:30,149
wake up it's like yeah I got to make

248
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:31,519
sure that that's correct

249
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,889
so you can start making sure that

250
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:37,319
expectations are set correctly way

251
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:39,269
before you get down the road going into

252
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:43,409
a proof of concept and such so when it

253
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:45,629
comes to the different kinds of people

254
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:48,689
that are out there the first one that's

255
00:11:48,689 --> 00:11:51,209
going to come at you is what we call our

256
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:53,939
sales development rep or a count

257
00:11:53,939 --> 00:11:56,849
development rep these are cold callers

258
00:11:56,849 --> 00:12:00,329
all they do is sit all day long and they

259
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:02,849
dial for dollars keep on calling and

260
00:12:02,849 --> 00:12:05,339
calling and they get your name in many

261
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:08,220
different ways if they have sales force

262
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,649
one of the most common places is

263
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:12,119
something called Raintree that they pay

264
00:12:12,119 --> 00:12:13,829
for so they have all these names they

265
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:15,689
think this is fantastic you can make

266
00:12:15,689 --> 00:12:18,089
tons of money the problem with things

267
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:21,029
like Raintree is that everybody uses it

268
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:24,329
so winds up being ok it's a lead but at

269
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:26,639
the same time if that person is getting

270
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,229
ten calls a day they're probably not

271
00:12:28,229 --> 00:12:30,329
answering the phone and I definitely

272
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:32,399
know people that do that they get your

273
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,249
name from trade shows you go to RSA you

274
00:12:35,249 --> 00:12:38,159
get a Def Con you you know getting

275
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,419
somebody your email address whatever

276
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:41,399
you're you know you're going to be a

277
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,549
victim linkedin is also a great place

278
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:47,089
for diving in you go look at who has

279
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:51,119
backgrounds and security are they a CSO

280
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:52,979
or something like that LinkedIn is a

281
00:12:52,979 --> 00:12:56,279
great place for getting leads but of

282
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,679
course this is also where if you claim

283
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,539
to be a see so you're gonna get attacked

284
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:06,060
and just get tons of email friends

285
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,080
so a lot of sales development reps will

286
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,000
start off by calling people they know

287
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,030
and you know this can be a little

288
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,470
contentious with friends and family but

289
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,210
you know hey they're just trying to make

290
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,890
a meeting because every meeting that

291
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:22,710
they make they get paid on whether they

292
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:27,600
person buys or non-spam you're gonna get

293
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,400
tons of email once you go to a trade

294
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,810
show you if you haven't seen it already

295
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,990
try it out with a fake email and you

296
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,730
will see all the crap that you get and

297
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:39,540
then those email lists will get resold

298
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,470
to somebody else

299
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,270
so it's there's all sorts of insidious

300
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,880
ways of getting leads now these guys to

301
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,160
give you a call they're not very techy

302
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,010
one of the fun parts for me is I always

303
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,990
asked like you go to school for cause

304
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,000
that most of the people I knew had

305
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,870
college degrees

306
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,360
they had 40 degrees in economics or

307
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,000
psychology or something like that and

308
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,470
it's like well what were you expecting

309
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,390
to do with that and they say well I

310
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,890
don't know but I thought I had to go to

311
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,660
college and they want them to being an

312
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,170
SDR

313
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:10,770
so they don't know what's going on all

314
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:13,020
they're trying to do is close a meeting

315
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,910
with you get you to listen to enough of

316
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:18,870
a sales pitch and get you into a meeting

317
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,120
and they have a flow chart at script and

318
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,980
if they go off script they can be in

319
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,510
trouble and it's always a lot of fun

320
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,590
than mess with some of these people at

321
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,420
times but I try to be nice to them like

322
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,680
they're trying to make some money if

323
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,090
you're not interested you can just say

324
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,380
thank you not interested

325
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,040
hang up they're not your friends who

326
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,290
cares they're not your family

327
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,480
just you know and it if it happens to be

328
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,910
a friend or family yeah um hey stop

329
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,790
bugging me and they're trying to qualify

330
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,320
you they're trying to see if you have

331
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,930
any projects out there if there's any

332
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,030
budget for they're gonna go down all

333
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,070
sorts of rabbit holes to make sure that

334
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,510
they can figure out if you're a

335
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:58,170
qualified lead that's basically a very

336
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,270
short pitch they're not going to go into

337
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,790
depth because the other thing is if you

338
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:06,090
say yes great let me get it set up and

339
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,740
then somebody will follow up with you

340
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,330
and they're off dialing somebody else

341
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,850
sells

342
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,350
salesperson works on commission so

343
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,180
they'll have a base salary let's say

344
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:21,830
it's $125,000 a year base salary that's

345
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,720
they get regardless of how much they

346
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,930
sell they will get another hundred and

347
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,910
twenty five thousand dollars if they

348
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,850
make all the sales that they are

349
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,340
assigned to make so you get a hundred

350
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,920
percent commission based for X number of

351
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,630
dollars in sales so my quota would be

352
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:43,220
let's say I have to sell five million

353
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,230
dollars in a year okay I'm making

354
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,090
hundred twenty five thousand if I sell

355
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:49,970
five million dollars and make my quota I

356
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,830
will get another hundred twenty five

357
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,870
thousand and that usually is something

358
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,830
that comes and a delayed way so if I

359
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,750
close the sale they don't immediately

360
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,520
pay me because there's a lot of

361
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,430
customers that will all of a sudden say

362
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,020
look this isn't working we're going to

363
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,770
return it so my commission comes late if

364
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:13,720
I don't make some money upfront and

365
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,320
start getting that tunnel not tell about

366
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,840
that a buffer let's say sales in there

367
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,780
I get paid later at a certain point when

368
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,090
they feel that the sale is really really

369
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:33,770
final now as a salesperson new at a job

370
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:36,500
they will guarantee me like a month or

371
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,320
two months so that I can build up my

372
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,180
sales and stuff like that but after that

373
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,600
time there's no guarantees I just have

374
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,240
to be on top of it otherwise you know

375
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,130
they're looking at me monthly and saying

376
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,230
okay where's the next sale give me your

377
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,050
forecast once they get to a hundred

378
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,240
percent commission if they're really

379
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,370
good and they go over it there are these

380
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,650
things called accelerators accelerators

381
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,180
are just saying okay instead of paying

382
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,640
you at you know a hundred percent of

383
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,109
your you know this thing we're gonna pay

384
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:09,140
you at 110 percent so you can get into

385
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,940
some really interesting accelerators I

386
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,859
had a friend of mine who is that a

387
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:16,730
start-up fantastic product everybody

388
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:19,579
wanted it he wound up making nine

389
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:22,310
hundred thousand dollars off of a base

390
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,900
of like a hundred twenty-five thousand

391
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,750
so he just ended the salesperson

392
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,240
course at 5050 they made over a million

393
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,340
dollars and we're going crazy they're

394
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,810
having a good time and then there's

395
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,060
bonuses and President's Club so bonuses

396
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,850
so sometimes they'll say look if you can

397
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,980
sell this one product that is really a

398
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,200
dog with fleas but if you can sell it

399
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,300
we'll give you a bonus and people will

400
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,090
go after that President's Club is

401
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,880
basically the top salespeople every year

402
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,820
at a company we'll go to some fantastic

403
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,300
place like a rubra you know Hawaii New

404
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,910
Jersey who knows and they'll go ahead

405
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,650
and have this great time the only

406
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,270
problem with that President's Club is

407
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,010
it's also partially you get together and

408
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:06,500
work and if you get too drunk you've got

409
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,060
to be careful what you do and say in

410
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,010
front of other people I had one friend

411
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:12,110
who got fired because he decided at the

412
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,630
middle of the night in Aruba to use

413
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,240
coconuts in the hallway of the hotel and

414
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,440
try and play bowling pins with champagne

415
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,320
bottles not a good thing sometimes but

416
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,110
sales people one of the things I say

417
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,210
they like free food free drinks they

418
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,560
like to travel for free and they like to

419
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,960
repeat that as often as they can so

420
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,910
that's kind of the life of a salesperson

421
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:37,850
they're very motivated and willing to

422
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,520
take risks the good ones like to make

423
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,350
relationships they don't want it to sit

424
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,790
there and sell you something they want

425
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,940
to help you out solve a problem the bad

426
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,240
ones one a flip sale and are gone

427
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,450
there's a large very famous de storage

428
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,610
company that they'll get in there

429
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,920
they'll try and sell you they will

430
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,600
undercut everybody else's price because

431
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,350
once you go down that route with them

432
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:06,380
buy their equipment you're stuck you

433
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,000
have to use their equipment and then any

434
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,770
sale after that you're not getting a

435
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,960
good deal so those the ones that I don't

436
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,700
like I like it when you try to make a

437
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,350
relationship you're trying to work with

438
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,820
somebody trying to help them solve their

439
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,260
problems you don't just call them up and

440
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,230
say hey can I say something today you

441
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,560
can you look at this that no it's like

442
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,180
look these people are all busy doing

443
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,340
things you got to make it worth their

444
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,160
time to even listen to you so one of the

445
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,780
things I would do is the salesperson I

446
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,340
would say hey by the way I know you had

447
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,590
this piece of equipment I just saw

448
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,960
hacker news something went wrong with I

449
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,669
just want to give you an FYI

450
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:41,869
even try and sell them anything else oh

451
00:19:41,869 --> 00:19:44,239
just try and give me an FYI that way

452
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:45,619
they know that I'm not always constantly

453
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:47,210
trying to sell but then if they need

454
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,830
something go come back to me and say hey

455
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,269
Eric by the way we're looking at this

456
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:52,730
and oh I'll tell them right up front

457
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,950
like one we don't do that but I know who

458
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,570
does and here the people that I

459
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,210
recommend so they start looking at me as

460
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:01,279
like hey this guy will treat me right

461
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:03,409
and I can come back to him and he won't

462
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:05,149
just try and abused the relationship and

463
00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:06,649
try to constantly sell me something I

464
00:20:06,649 --> 00:20:09,830
don't need so sales people we have a

465
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,019
deal with salespeople as a security

466
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:16,369
engineer I tell them I won't talk price

467
00:20:16,369 --> 00:20:18,710
if you don't talk tech so normally sales

468
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,379
people do not go deep into the tech they

469
00:20:21,379 --> 00:20:22,639
should have enough of an understanding

470
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,830
the product to be able to sell it and

471
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,929
then they have a sales engineer that

472
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:28,820
comes along with them they can be called

473
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,159
any number of names and they will

474
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:33,739
actually go into the deep techy part of

475
00:20:33,739 --> 00:20:36,139
it so sales people don't usually know

476
00:20:36,139 --> 00:20:38,419
you will find some that are very very

477
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:40,940
good at it and know that the tech even

478
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,919
better than their SEO at times but

479
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:44,929
that's rare so they normally the other

480
00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:46,429
ones that you talk to for the quote the

481
00:20:46,429 --> 00:20:48,200
price when I'm gonna get it if that

482
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,480
problem with support so on and so forth

483
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,730
the sales engineer and that can get it

484
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,320
can be called security engineer or any

485
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,580
number of things but we just call

486
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,369
Messi's normally they're supposedly the

487
00:20:58,369 --> 00:21:01,279
tech expert sometimes they are sometimes

488
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:03,679
they are not depends on how well they

489
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,940
know the product and how long they've

490
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,259
been at the company but more on that

491
00:21:06,259 --> 00:21:08,749
later their Commission structure is a

492
00:21:08,749 --> 00:21:10,879
little bit different they're usually on

493
00:21:10,879 --> 00:21:13,759
a 70/30 split or 80/20 split so they

494
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:16,429
don't get as much Commission but they're

495
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:18,710
guaranteed to get you know a larger base

496
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:23,029
and same thing as a salesperson they'll

497
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:24,320
get a hundred percent of Commission if

498
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,470
they make their quota and the sales

499
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,559
persons quota

500
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:32,179
they're usually tied with a sales person

501
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:35,149
they're working together it's very easy

502
00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:37,279
to do it when you work with one person

503
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:39,379
and you can get going with that other

504
00:21:39,379 --> 00:21:41,090
times you have customers and customers

505
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:45,049
um you have companies who they will have

506
00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:48,559
a pool of SES they're not tied to any

507
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,450
one salesperson and as a sales person

508
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,749
comes in and needs an se they take from

509
00:21:53,749 --> 00:21:54,260
the pool

510
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,930
and they go sell the problem I don't

511
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:59,200
like about that when that happens is

512
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,240
usually you need to get a relationship

513
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,190
with your salesperson to understand how

514
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,440
they pitch they need to know how you

515
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,440
pitch and do your part of it and if you

516
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,480
haven't worked with them it can be very

517
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,610
difficult so companies like that I don't

518
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:16,190
necessarily like that you may see the

519
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:19,460
effects of that remember if you're

520
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,560
trying to get technical information that

521
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,360
s-see better know his stuff and he's the

522
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,360
person that's gonna you know do all your

523
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,790
answers and he's the same way or she

524
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:32,090
whatever booboo drink travel repeat so

525
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:34,580
got a lot of people out there that they

526
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,200
like doing that that's part of the bonus

527
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,110
for them but they do like being in the

528
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:42,470
field and making the sales so the se his

529
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,930
job is if you decide to do a proof of

530
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,490
concept or sometimes they call it proof

531
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:50,450
of value they will go ahead and help you

532
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,210
organize that structure that run and get

533
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,860
you the equipment racket stack at the

534
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:57,650
whole nine yards and problems happen you

535
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,810
contact them now they should never talk

536
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,100
price and if you want to have a little

537
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,540
bit of fun you can always try to push

538
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,790
them see if they'll give you the price

539
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,290
especially in front of the salesperson

540
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,690
but you know be nice you should not talk

541
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:12,429
price salesperson should not talk tech

542
00:23:12,429 --> 00:23:16,609
now if somebody gives you a call and

543
00:23:16,609 --> 00:23:18,409
they're saying hey we got this Great

544
00:23:18,409 --> 00:23:20,600
Firewall that we want to sell you and

545
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,210
you already got all your firewalls it's

546
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,070
like look I'm not interested thank you

547
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,889
that's a real easy one to do but if

548
00:23:27,889 --> 00:23:29,330
somebody calls you and look hey this

549
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,369
sounds kind of interesting

550
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:33,590
number one were you even looking for a

551
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,330
solution like that fire I would be a

552
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,100
good example you know it's a sandbox

553
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:41,029
solution you basically tap the wire you

554
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:42,649
look at the data coming through it can

555
00:23:42,649 --> 00:23:44,659
sandbox and stuff like that maybe it

556
00:23:44,659 --> 00:23:46,220
works maybe it doesn't the bottom line

557
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,840
is are you even looking for a solution

558
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,590
like that if you're not okay is it fit

559
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,999
in any project that you currently have

560
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:55,669
hmm don't know but the key is gonna be

561
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:59,899
even if this is of interest to you do

562
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:02,899
you have budget for it all right you can

563
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,820
say look give me the three minute pitch

564
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,859
I'll consider it and if I'm interested

565
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:08,389
I'll set up a meeting later but right

566
00:24:08,389 --> 00:24:11,299
now not just say no and they're gonna be

567
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:13,970
obviously a bit pushy bottom line if you

568
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,309
want to hang up on them that's what

569
00:24:16,309 --> 00:24:18,529
phones are for right no problem with an

570
00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:20,269
email same thing you don't have to

571
00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:23,109
answer the email

572
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:27,659
now if you have something you're

573
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:29,669
interested in and you want to go ahead

574
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:33,419
and you know get a good deal make sure

575
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:35,370
that you understand what the budget is

576
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,960
what your projects are what your needs

577
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,820
are you need this thing

578
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,770
fireEye when I was first selling that

579
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,020
stuff nobody understood the technology

580
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,419
but one thing once they understood it

581
00:24:44,419 --> 00:24:46,860
one of the most common things that came

582
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,650
up after we spent a lot of time well as

583
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:52,049
well I don't have any budget for this

584
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:54,419
year but I can consider it next year be

585
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:56,070
upfront with the sales people to say hey

586
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,020
listen this sounds very interesting I

587
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,150
don't know if I can justify it right now

588
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:03,059
but our budget cycle is happening in

589
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:06,659
June and if I can do a POV at that time

590
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:08,880
and go through it and make sure that you

591
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,130
know it does what you say it does I can

592
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:14,460
then go and pitch for money for that and

593
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,350
get it budgeted this way you're upfront

594
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,090
with the sales person they can

595
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:21,360
understand and get the expectation of

596
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,890
when things are going to happen and

597
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,630
there's no like hey wait a minute

598
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,549
we went through the POC it met all your

599
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:30,890
criteria what the hell buy the thing so

600
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:35,820
the problem is if you don't have that

601
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,980
part of it you don't need to deal with

602
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,630
it just saying hey look I'm not the one

603
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:42,330
that with the money CFO is listed on the

604
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,429
website go call them I always love doing

605
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:46,919
that to see if I've always hated me but

606
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:49,020
I just said no I just I don't want it

607
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,549
and a lot of times I would just make

608
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,470
sure that I never gave out my number or

609
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,760
I always had a different number that I

610
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,580
used internally for people made my life

611
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:00,570
easy resources to complete here's a big

612
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:02,940
one I do have the budget it's something

613
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,100
I want to put in it's not a trivial

614
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,610
project and I need some resources do I

615
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:11,309
have them the worst thing for me had

616
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:14,510
been I made a sale they wanted to do it

617
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,500
make a sale but they wanted to do a

618
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,890
proof of concept it's like okay who are

619
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,299
the people that I'm going to deal with

620
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:23,250
to get this racked and stacked and set

621
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,980
up and running and they said well let's

622
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,450
just set it up for next week and come in

623
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:30,299
and we'll find some people and I hated

624
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:32,190
hearing that so if you're going to

625
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,510
commit to this you need to have the

626
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:36,299
resources you need out the time you

627
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:37,230
don't want to waste sales

628
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,429
people's time you don't want to waste

629
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:40,080
your time because if you don't have that

630
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,030
people up there you're gonna be in

631
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,500
trouble you're always gonna wind up

632
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,049
having all sorts of issues the worst

633
00:26:46,049 --> 00:26:47,520
thing is like when I used to be in

634
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,770
professional services and I would fly

635
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:53,250
out to like Euston or Dallas and it's

636
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,230
like we gave you a day of free

637
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,760
professional services to install this

638
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,620
product and they didn't have the stuff

639
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,799
wracked they didn't have a knowledge of

640
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:03,570
where things went and it's like you just

641
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:05,700
wasted your day of professional services

642
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,020
now you're gonna have to pay for it and

643
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,790
of course that I always started an

644
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,770
argument I gave it to the salespeople

645
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:14,040
it was ugly so if you're gonna commit be

646
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,929
ready to commit have your resources and

647
00:27:15,929 --> 00:27:19,440
time and know what you need to do to get

648
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,910
this thing working successfully so the

649
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,549
other side of that let's say I do want

650
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:27,960
to talk to the salesperson let's say

651
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,970
it's a firewall I want to go talk to you

652
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:32,490
about the firewalls and stuff one thing

653
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,830
that generally never ever happens is I

654
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:38,010
never see a prospect contact the

655
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:39,750
salesperson and saying hey before you

656
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:42,090
come out here here's some things I want

657
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:44,429
you to know so first of all if you have

658
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:46,679
an RFP obviously you will share that

659
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:50,040
with them but we want to go and say look

660
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,380
we know everything about security right

661
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,200
now we know what the current landscape

662
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,080
for threats are I don't want to hear all

663
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,299
that stuff we're very interested in

664
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:02,130
talking to you about these aspects of

665
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,049
the firewall this is what we need

666
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:06,690
so can you focus on that again put it in

667
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:09,450
writing shoot them an email and then

668
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:12,030
also include what you're not looking for

669
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:16,200
so sometimes people you know if you know

670
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,900
they're really big on sslvpn for example

671
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,490
and say look we already have a solution

672
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,929
in that area we're happy with it we

673
00:28:21,929 --> 00:28:24,270
don't want to deal with it we want to

674
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,850
deal with this part of the firewall

675
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:28,590
stuff you know Application Firewall

676
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:31,650
maybe you know Web Application Firewall

677
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,240
whatever like that's what we're

678
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,090
interested in and also make sure you

679
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,770
tell them what the goals are and I'll go

680
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,150
over that more a little bit later

681
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:43,110
sometimes people give you the solution

682
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,270
they think they need rather than giving

683
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,690
you the goals of what they're trying to

684
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,590
attain

685
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,659
and if the salesperson no knows what the

686
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:53,640
goals are one of the things they're

687
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,650
going to do is they're going back into

688
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,330
their company and they're going to go

689
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:00,390
ahead and talk to everybody that is an

690
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:03,690
expert in that area to help architect

691
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:06,179
the solution and be able to get you some

692
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:09,779
good idea so leverage that you know

693
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:12,299
you'd be surprised at how much time I've

694
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:14,070
spent in preparing for a sales call

695
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,559
because I knew they had certain needs

696
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,480
and I would talk to some experts in the

697
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,000
field there and get that information set

698
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,970
up so that they would could think about

699
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,320
here are the different possibilities

700
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,830
whether it is my product or is it you

701
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,870
know take this product and then add this

702
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,789
to it because that's really going to

703
00:29:32,789 --> 00:29:35,070
give you what you want I've seen deals

704
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,500
made multi-million deal was made where

705
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,350
somebody came in saying I need to do

706
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:43,140
this this and this and when somebody

707
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,029
said well what are you trying to get at

708
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:46,710
it's like oh I'm trying to get at this

709
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,630
and then there was a new solution

710
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,130
they're able to you know have a

711
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:53,279
discussion and a dialogue and a sale was

712
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,840
made when before the salesperson was

713
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,120
thinking how this is a waste of time so

714
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,580
always try and talk about goals and what

715
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,460
you're trying to solve maybe you have

716
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,779
some solutions great because it gives

717
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:06,510
you an example but then let them come up

718
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,279
with some of the other parts of that for

719
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:12,029
you all right all right so do your

720
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:14,190
hacker homework okay all you social

721
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:17,549
engineering Xand hackers going online

722
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,130
and doing reviews nothing like saying

723
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,480
you know what's going on with that

724
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,159
company and what's going on with their

725
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:25,620
product now magazines like SC magazine

726
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:28,320
for example I've rarely seen them ever

727
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,309
give a bad review

728
00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:31,950
why because how do they make the money

729
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,110
we're advertising if they're going to go

730
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:38,399
and bad reviews to a bunch of vendors

731
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,220
those vendors aren't going to advertise

732
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:43,529
so you got to be careful when looking at

733
00:30:43,529 --> 00:30:46,200
that and taking it for what it's at read

734
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,490
that understand where they're making

735
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:49,860
their money do the reviews see what

736
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,760
other people say

737
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,350
Glassdoor if you're not familiar with

738
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,440
that go check it out what I like doing

739
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,070
there is looking at people and seeing if

740
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:01,530
they're saying the company has all sorts

741
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,400
of problems

742
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,890
so I'm quitting because they don't pay

743
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:07,680
my commissions right or their support

744
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,950
really sucks this is a great way to go

745
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:13,710
and look at what's happening on the

746
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:15,930
inside and getting some some feedback

747
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:19,620
LinkedIn let me just break out of this

748
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,510
for a moment come on baby

749
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,520
you can do it I want to just show you

750
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,230
something about LinkedIn that I love

751
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:33,870
okay so when I go into Lincoln and I'm

752
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:36,390
gonna show you a few people and this is

753
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:38,700
what I like looking for when I go do

754
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,559
this so here is a sales guy that's a

755
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:44,880
tenable that I've worked with that

756
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,070
checkpoint you want to look at the sales

757
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,809
guy and what do you want to know is is

758
00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:51,000
really really simple in my mind is

759
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,190
number one how long has he worked at the

760
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:55,080
company is he new has he been there for

761
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,120
a while doesn't know the product has he

762
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,950
been in the security industry for a

763
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,080
while or you know as the last job has

764
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,200
been something totally different so you

765
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,990
want obviously somebody that has a good

766
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:10,530
background in the industry somebody that

767
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,330
that knows the stuff that can really

768
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,120
help you understand you know what with

769
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,240
how it fits with you but if they've been

770
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,830
at other places like selling

771
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,710
pharmaceuticals or something like that

772
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:25,860
it could be you waste your time on the

773
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,890
other hand this is one that he was my

774
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:31,860
mentor at far I this guy is fantastic

775
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,420
now what I'm looking for here is again

776
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:36,030
the same thing what kind of background

777
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,250

778
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,290
has he been there and some of the other

779
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:43,429
things I look at when I go down here and

780
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:46,230
this is kind of key what are the

781
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:49,500
accomplishments that he has in this case

782
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,929
this is one that is is really

783
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:53,910
interesting because as you can see those

784
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:54,990
things where I was talking about

785
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:55,830

people and gives you a better idea of is

797
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:22,920

alright so do your reviews if you have

799

classic pitches this is the stuff that I

805
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:43,180
hate every corporation that I worked at

806
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,040
always had a pitch deck and all we

807
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,410
started off with we're a company that's

808
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:49,360
been around for ten years we've got

809
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,450
5,000 employees this is the state of

810
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:54,070
tibor threats what keeps you up at night

811
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,750
everyone says we're the it's like you

812
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,390
know dude I could care less and I would

813
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,800
take that pitch deck and I would just

814
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,130
cut it up and like look I'm there I

815
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:05,020
don't have much time I need to make sure

816
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,390
that I'm focused on my customer and what

817
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:10,270
their needs are if you talk to your

818
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,790
salesperson beforehand and write them an

819
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:15,010
email saying hey listen we see a lot of

820
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:17,650
people coming in and giving us pitches

821
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:18,880
and telling us about the state of cyber

822
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,489
threats and stuff look we live this

823
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:23,500
every day we know what the cyber threats

824
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,940
are stuff we really want to just see

825
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,370
your products so please please look at

826
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,139
your pitch deck when you come talk to us

827
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:32,770
please address our needs you don't need

828
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,060
to tell us what's going on the industry

829
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:37,389
we know all that stuff if they don't

830
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:40,540
listen to you that is the red flag you

831
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,760
want to look for that's where you say

832
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,679
wait a minute I just asked you not to do

833
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,929
this why are you doing this and I've

834
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:49,780
seen this happen many times and I also

835
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,360
saw one of the founders of a company

836
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:57,550
actually tell the prospect this is the

837
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:00,610
way we're doing it you need to hear me

838
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:02,650
and you'll let me complete my I'm saying

839
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:05,710
please don't interrupt and I'm the SE on

840
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:08,050
the call and I'm sitting there it was my

841
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:09,520
sales person I would have basically gone

842
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,590
over there and you know if the

843
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,690
knucklehead over his head and tell him

844
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:16,180
to shut up but he was the founder of the

845
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,620
corporation I couldn't do anything about

846
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:17,920
it

847
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,130
life's rough but look here's this is a

848
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:23,230
good test on what you want on the front

849
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,330
dumb you don't want to hear this I'm

850
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:28,750
focused on my needs and see what they do

851
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:31,200
great little red flag right off the bat

852
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,520
okay do they listen I have a boss that

853
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,280
told me one time Eric you know you're

854
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,860
talking too much God gave you two ears

855
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,810
one mouth so they want you to listen as

856
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:47,920
twice as much as you talk so I got it

857
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,890
are they listening to you do they have

858
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:53,830
good communication skills have you

859
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,930
communicated your needs properly like

860
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,400
what I was talking about before I need

861
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,340
an SSL VPN versus look I got a bunch of

862
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,050
people that are working remote I need to

863
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:04,950
secure their access into my environment

864
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:07,750
what do you have for me now giving you

865
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:10,900
an example of SSL VPN is fine but help

866
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,390
them understand what your problem is and

867
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:15,580
let the salespeople try and help you

868
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,890
solve your problem like I said they've

869
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:19,840
got a lot of resources that they can

870
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,790
call on and they may have some very

871
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:24,600
unique ideas

872
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,839
okay time wasters I'm from the East

873
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:30,220
Coast originally and I don't know how

874
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,390
many of you you know where you're all

875
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:34,660
from but thankies we don't waste time we

876
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,869
get to pitch we talk we are not trying

877
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:40,720
to make friends in California where I am

878
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,880
I have seen so much like how was your

879
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,260
weekend it's like I just met this guy I

880
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,730
don't know is we can honestly I don't

881
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:48,069
care about your weekend okay I don't

882
00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:49,950
know you but we get into that

883
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,730
pleasantries and you kind of have to go

884
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:56,109
through it okay so be nice is fine but I

885
00:36:56,109 --> 00:36:58,150
would say look be respectful of people's

886
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,069
times and make sure that they're not

887
00:37:00,069 --> 00:37:01,510
sitting there going around trying to be

888
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,829
your friend because that's not a way to

889
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:06,849
make a deal right you can always steer

890
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,859
the conversation saying great can we

891
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:10,240
hear some of the things that we're

892
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,119
looking at we want to hear about today

893
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:16,359
you have your presentation ready so you

894
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,220
can always steer conversations away why

895
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:21,599
especially if they get to off tangent

896
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,309
having an idea about what the timeline

897
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:26,260
is so again you know your budgets are

898
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,450
you know when you're thinking about you

899
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:30,670
know bringing this in when's a good time

900
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,829
to do a POC because you know when you

901
00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:34,540
have resources and when you don't have

902
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:37,720
resources helping the salespeople set

903
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,089
set that kind of stuff up makes it a

904
00:37:40,089 --> 00:37:44,079
life easier makes your life easier be

905
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,390
polite business professional again

906
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,589
you're not trying to make friends of

907
00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:49,900
these people okay

908
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:55,380
testing in P pocs sometimes called POVs

909
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:59,770
testing is is always key want to see it

910
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:01,510
in your environment and how it works if

911
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,130
that's applicable if you can really do

912
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:05,349
that you want to get your hands on there

913
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:07,270
there's several aspects of this that are

914
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:10,780
very very important mainly when you talk

915
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,609
to the people you want to create a test

916
00:38:12,609 --> 00:38:14,859
plan with that vendor they will have a

917
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:17,619
test plan for you guaranteed they will

918
00:38:17,619 --> 00:38:20,140
they will orchestrate you down the right

919
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:25,329
path if that is what you want them to do

920
00:38:25,329 --> 00:38:27,220
they will say I got this this this

921
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:30,099
fireEye with the sand boxes I would put

922
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,390
it in and I'd say look at that first

923
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:33,010
part is we're gonna let it go for a week

924
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:35,890
see what we catch what we don't catch if

925
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:38,170
we're not seeing anything we're gonna go

926
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,520
ahead and do active tests

927
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,200
which means I'm gonna send now we're

928
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,430
down I'm gonna show I'm gonna bypass

929
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:45,250
your firewall and they love this we got

930
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,780
Palo Alto this is the greatest thing in

931
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,250
the world says look I can bypass it in

932
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,540
three seconds let me show you how I do

933
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:52,950
it and then get the malware in there so

934
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:55,900
we would have a test plan and we know

935
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,090
how to deal with it but it's best when

936
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:01,150
the customer also says look here's the

937
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:03,730
kind of things we want to see here's our

938
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:06,970
environment tell us what's going on and

939
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,590
make sure that you work with that

940
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:11,740
together because a lot of vendors will

941
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,960
go down a certain path and saying look

942
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,300
here this thing works great because I

943
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,890
put this down here and it worked in this

944
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:21,040
way it's like yeah but that's not I

945
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,690
don't understand how that's real-world

946
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:25,480
help me understand let them explain that

947
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,580
to you and when they go on and talk

948
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,050
gibberish you can just cut them off says

949
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:33,100
let's do this kind of testing that to me

950
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,960
is always the best thing is you want to

951
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,660
make sure you test what you want in your

952
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:41,200
environment talk with them about it make

953
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,120
sure that it's realistic that's going to

954
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,320
be the only key you're gonna have to

955
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,680
worry about vendors are gonna try and

956
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,020
control that as best as they can I I

957
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,960
learned so many ways not to do a POC and

958
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,140
I do try and structure it but I also try

959
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,460
to make sure the customer understands

960
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:00,040
what I'm doing and that they agree that

961
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:04,330
this is a valid test success criteria

962
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:06,430
and this is gonna be the key point of a

963
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:08,650
POC because if you meet the success

964
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:10,480
criteria great

965
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,020
now you're gonna buy right so what is

966
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,420
the success criteria to you does it meet

967
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:19,990
the technical stuff great if it meets

968
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:21,670
the technical stuff then go ahead and

969
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,080
say hey look now we talk about price

970
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,180
we're also going to do some other checks

971
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:28,650
you know references and things like that

972
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:30,910
criteria could be your reviews of

973
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:34,750
different aspects of that company and

974
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:38,380
saying look yeah POC was great but by

975
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,570
the way I checked out your support and

976
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:42,130
nobody likes your support you don't get

977
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:44,800
back to him and stuff and this is a very

978
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,480
complicated piece of equipment if I

979
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,610
can't get support on it it's just dead

980
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:51,000
equipment to me

981
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,530
so scheduling and checking meetings make

982
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:54,120
sure there's a schedule for this if it's

983
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,880
gonna be a POC that's gonna last for two

984
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,040
three weeks or even more make sure

985
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,500
there's a schedule of meetings what is

986
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,900
supposed to be done by whom so that you

987
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,330
meet these deadlines and the key to this

988
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,800
is you don't want to waste your time you

989
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,630
don't want to waste their time the worst

990
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,400
thing is to have it racked and stacked

991
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,230
sitting there and nobody does anything

992
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,970
with it if you're going to go through

993
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:16,800
this process make sure you have the

994
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,540
resources make sure you know what the

995
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,670
test plans gonna be and know what the

996
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:23,000
timeline of when you want things done

997
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:30,120
it's criterias met you by that's why you

998
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,430
want to set what that success criteria

999
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:37,950
is and it isn't just technical aspects

1000
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:39,750
of it could be hey we got this we're

1001
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,340
also going to review other aspects here

1002
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,830
and that's part of our success criteria

1003
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:46,200
oh by the way I saw somebody pull up

1004
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,320
proof of value yeah I hate the term POV

1005
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,510
because quite honestly I've seen enough

1006
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:57,090
in porn I've had to do filtering and

1007
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:59,490
sell web filtering and content and look

1008
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:00,960
at stuff and I always hated that term I

1009
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,820
liked proof of concept that people want

1010
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,440
to say but it's really proof of value

1011
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,720
said dude that's a term they use in

1012
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,720
photography go google it so sorry a

1013
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,280
little bit of a sideline test support

1014
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,140
when I was a director of IT on the other

1015
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:19,140
side of this where I was buying stuff

1016
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,570
one of the things I was notorious for

1017
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:25,080
was I would do a POC and they would say

1018
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,540
well you know part of the POC is if you

1019
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:28,770
have any problems just contact us and

1020
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:30,270
we'll help you we really don't have

1021
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:32,640
access to support and I said well I'm

1022
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,890
not going to do a POC unless I have

1023
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:36,840
access to support so if you want me to

1024
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,450
even consider it I need to be able to

1025
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:43,080
call in and try that if they said no

1026
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,840
it's like okay fine bye I didn't even

1027
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,880
have to bring their equipment or have

1028
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,470
much of a talk I could do that on the

1029
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:51,960
first meeting I was thinking about uh

1030
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,550
saying hey do we have the ability to

1031
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:55,200
contacts of work side's one of the

1032
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,810
things I want to test and I loved it

1033
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:00,570
because they always hated me for asking

1034
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:03,480
that but you know what if they're not

1035
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,030
willing to let you do that

1036
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:07,790
tough cookies on them you've got a very

1037
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:10,010
complicated piece of equipment it may

1038
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:11,750
cost you know hundreds of thousands of

1039
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:15,040
dollars I'm gonna test everything period

1040
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,660
so use those social engineering skills

1041
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,490
that's not sales engineer you use those

1042
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:21,130
social engineering skills when you call

1043
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:24,800
support and you know act like you don't

1044
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,720
know too much and see how well they got

1045
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,710
you through and how do they treat you

1046
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:33,590
all right so resellers versus direct a a

1047
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:36,230
lot of companies will not sell directly

1048
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,310
to an endpoint

1049
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:39,950
the reason is resellers and channel

1050
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,950
partners are people who have direct

1051
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:45,859
relationships with a lot of companies

1052
00:43:45,859 --> 00:43:49,490
and they will be a multiplier or sales

1053
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:53,000
for sales multiplier for them in getting

1054
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,880
their products out problem is resellers

1055
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,369
also may be selling three thousand four

1056
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:00,650
thousand different products yours is one

1057
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:04,130
of those products so there's a mix and

1058
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:05,630
mash here from different vendors if you

1059
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:09,200
go directly to a vendor and they're only

1060
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,510
selling one solution let's say set no.1

1061
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:12,740
they have an endpoint solution that's

1062
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:15,349
all they do if you go to them and you're

1063
00:44:15,349 --> 00:44:17,330
trying to find out what else you can do

1064
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:19,010
in this environment to protect yourself

1065
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:21,260
they only have their one-trick pony

1066
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:24,560
right if you go to a reseller they have

1067
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,500
a whole bunch of different products and

1068
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,630
and such that they're familiar with they

1069
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:31,280
can say well you know said no one's

1070
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,290
really good but you can use carbon black

1071
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:36,170
here and you can use this here and this

1072
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:38,030
might help you know manage all the stuff

1073
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:41,030
for you so they may have more ability to

1074
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:45,530
give you a variety of advice that stuff

1075
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:47,420
that they sell but there can be a danger

1076
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:49,310
to that as well I'll go over that

1077
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:53,000
shortly there are resellers that I call

1078
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,910
our boutique small guys that are focused

1079
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:57,950
in on a particular vertical I can let's

1080
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:00,890
say healthcare or people who are really

1081
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:02,510
good at saying look all I do is self

1082
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:05,619
ordinate and that's what I do not if I

1083
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,849
use a ssin I'll let you know so they'll

1084
00:45:07,849 --> 00:45:09,950
sell like a limited number of what they

1085
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:12,349
feel are very good products and then you

1086
00:45:12,349 --> 00:45:14,089
have the very large ones who sell

1087
00:45:14,089 --> 00:45:16,820
everything but again the salesperson

1088
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,410
from that company

1089
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:21,069
be an expert and they will only sell

1090
00:45:21,069 --> 00:45:23,599
let's say a certain number of different

1091
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,150
products and that can be a good in bad

1092
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:30,140
as well services resellers make their

1093
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:33,170
money on pro services not making sales

1094
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:35,420
to you they want to say look we're gonna

1095
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:38,059
sell you the palo alto x' we're going to

1096
00:45:38,059 --> 00:45:39,980
install them we're going to give you

1097
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:43,700
training and get you going it's it's a

1098
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,140
real good gig there's a lot of money in

1099
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:46,849
there and there's a definite value

1100
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:48,619
depending on what you're looking for and

1101
00:45:48,619 --> 00:45:50,839
what you're trying to buy this can be

1102
00:45:50,839 --> 00:45:53,569
very good such situation for you get

1103
00:45:53,569 --> 00:45:55,369
those pro services and negotiate them

1104
00:45:55,369 --> 00:45:56,839
all sorts of things so let's go down a

1105
00:45:56,839 --> 00:46:00,109
little bit they are the experts on set

1106
00:46:00,109 --> 00:46:03,619
up you want to be the expert on how to

1107
00:46:03,619 --> 00:46:06,049
use it and operate it if you want to

1108
00:46:06,049 --> 00:46:08,150
learn how to install let's say your

1109
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:09,730
retail and you're going to install it

1110
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:13,069
4000 different retail outlets this is

1111
00:46:13,069 --> 00:46:14,750
where I can say look I need training on

1112
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:17,150
how to do this setup but in general

1113
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,520
people say look you do the setup we want

1114
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,319
to know how to operate it that's the key

1115
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:23,660
so they help get it up they know your

1116
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:25,609
environment is they know what you know

1117
00:46:25,609 --> 00:46:27,500
they'll ask you the questions little

1118
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:30,589
gotchas that maybe you won't pick up by

1119
00:46:30,589 --> 00:46:34,430
reading their the manuals and stuff so

1120
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:36,529
you got to make sure that you know this

1121
00:46:36,529 --> 00:46:38,839
is worth to you if you're setting up a

1122
00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:41,869
Palo Alto and you've set up you know 40

1123
00:46:41,869 --> 00:46:43,190
other Palo Alto is already you don't

1124
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:45,500
need pro services but if it's something

1125
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,599
that you've never done before and it's

1126
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:50,859
and it's going to be a non-trivial

1127
00:46:50,859 --> 00:46:53,779
installation well like a pro service

1128
00:46:53,779 --> 00:46:54,799
it's it's something that can always be

1129
00:46:54,799 --> 00:46:57,230
negotiated as well so anything is up for

1130
00:46:57,230 --> 00:46:59,390
negotiation if you do pro services

1131
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:01,130
statement of work everything is in

1132
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:02,630
writing so going back to what I said

1133
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:05,809
before read that statement of work in

1134
00:47:05,809 --> 00:47:07,789
anything that the salesman said yeah

1135
00:47:07,789 --> 00:47:11,329
this thing can you know process 100 Giga

1136
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:14,299
bandwidth data coming down no problem

1137
00:47:14,299 --> 00:47:16,579
everything will work 24 hours a day with

1138
00:47:16,579 --> 00:47:18,680
that in the statement of work they'll

1139
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,079
hate you for it but if they say look

1140
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:22,880
there's a problem with it that's when

1141
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,779
you want to find it this is a little

1142
00:47:26,779 --> 00:47:29,180
trick I want to make sure that if I got

1143
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,950
a pro service engagement coming on are

1144
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:32,400
they an employee of the

1145
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,380
and this is the reseller that I'm

1146
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,600
dealing with or are they out sourced it

1147
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,700
they're outs tourists I'm gonna need to

1148
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,620
know stuff your crazy stuff like you

1149
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:42,750
have workman's comp are you bonded you

1150
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:44,610
know all this kind of weird stuff this

1151
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:47,760
somebody walks into my facility they get

1152
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,160
hurt I don't want to be in the middle of

1153
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,310
some stupid lawsuit so make sure you

1154
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:54,990
find that are the employees and you put

1155
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:56,400
that in standard work that you say look

1156
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,010
if you use subcontractors I have to

1157
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:01,170
approve them first

1158
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:05,280
now sometimes boutique shops will sell

1159
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,010
pro services that's not theirs so for

1160
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:11,460
example checkpoint will be that pro

1161
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:14,850
serve for a boutique vendor so they're

1162
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:17,040
basically reselling askew from

1163
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,550
checkpoint to come in and do it so yeah

1164
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:22,410
that kind of stuff again as long as you

1165
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:26,400
know who that those people are great are

1166
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,900
there other people that can do just pro

1167
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:31,230
serves absolutely but in general if

1168
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:33,120
you're going to a reseller that's that's

1169
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,560
kind of their bread and butter that they

1170
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,570
want to do you know if you want to buy

1171
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:38,700
just equipment you know you can go to

1172
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,860
CDW or Newegg or one of those and just

1173
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:42,210
buy the equipment and then you know

1174
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:44,520
arrange for a super group of pro

1175
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,130
services but in general I like doing an

1176
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:49,530
all one-stop shop makes it easier on me

1177
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:52,860
and you know there's more ability to go

1178
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,600
kind of yank on him when something goes

1179
00:48:54,600 --> 00:49:00,540
wrong incentives kickbacks so one of the

1180
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:03,630
things I absolutely hate about resellers

1181
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:05,640
and something that was very insidious in

1182
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:09,300
the industry was they would sell

1183
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:13,920
products and would get let's say $100

1184
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,660
giftcard bees a card

1185
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:18,600
the salesperson would for selling power

1186
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:19,830
I'll throw some like that and again I'm

1187
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:21,180
not saying politie did this whatever I'm

1188
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:22,950
just giving any example I probably

1189
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:24,540
shouldn't say that but let's just say

1190
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:27,810
firewall XYZ so I sell a particular

1191
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:31,290
brand that company that manufacturer

1192
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:33,660
would then give gift cards whatever our

1193
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:36,960
incentives selling their stuff and one

1194
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,090
large reseller that I know of had it

1195
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:41,610
such a bad problem with it that they

1196
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:45,570
finally said look number one you get up

1197
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:46,050
to it

1198
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:48,780
thousand dollars a quarter from this

1199
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:52,110
stuff number two we're gonna put it all

1200
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:55,380
1099 on you and you're gonna pay taxes

1201
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,960
on it and so on and so forth and number

1202
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,570
three if you are going to sell a vendor

1203
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:03,690
because they give you money and

1204
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:07,310
incentive versus who is the best

1205
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:10,530
solution for that customer at some point

1206
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:11,820
we'll get rid of you because what was

1207
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:12,900
happening the customers are saying

1208
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,460
you're selling us crap

1209
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,740
you have no value to us we heard that

1210
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:19,320
you're getting money to push you know

1211
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,960
the Schmoke product we don't want it

1212
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,190
anymore get out of here

1213
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:26,940
so it's not like you can go and ask them

1214
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,610
if they get incentives for it you got to

1215
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,950
do your due diligence and and see what

1216
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:33,780
you can find from other resources but

1217
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:36,180
bottom line make sure that if you're

1218
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:38,220
going to go to a reseller you ask them

1219
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:42,120
what do they have and what products do

1220
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,950
they sell make sure that if you're

1221
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:45,450
saying I'm gonna look at fortinet

1222
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:49,200
SonicWALL Palo Alto Barracuda they sell

1223
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,420
all those and you can ask them what do

1224
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,430
you sell the most of and is there what's

1225
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:54,960
the reason why you saw most of that and

1226
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,910
you know they'll tell you that yeah

1227
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:59,370
people like this and works for them so

1228
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:02,280
the other thing is that you know this is

1229
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,840
just something for you to know that some

1230
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,390
of this happens is not an easy way to

1231
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:08,310
find it out but bottom line just be

1232
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:11,970
aware of it all right

1233
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:15,720
so timing is everything you know there's

1234
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,870
the old

1235
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:21,420
look if I'm gonna buy a car right I'm

1236
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:22,530
gonna do it at the end of the year

1237
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:25,290
because the sales guy wants to make his

1238
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:27,750
quota and boy I'm gonna get the greatest

1239
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:33,150
deal ever not quite true it definitely

1240
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:35,910
works that way when do people go nuts at

1241
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:41,670
a company doing sales and usually it's

1242
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:43,650
like on a calendar and you can ask the

1243
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:44,940
salesperson like hey when's your quarter

1244
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:47,550
end and you know they're gonna the first

1245
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:49,350
thing they're gonna look at is like okay

1246
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:51,090
so this guy knows wants to play that

1247
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:52,710
game that's fine

1248
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:54,510
you're telling him basically I'm not

1249
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:56,390
stupid I know how this game is played

1250
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:58,650
you know they should have no problem

1251
00:51:58,650 --> 00:51:59,670
they'll tell you

1252
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:01,710
so quarter end they're trying to close

1253
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:06,299
that's their mantra close close close so

1254
00:52:06,299 --> 00:52:09,329
they're trying to close and heels get

1255
00:52:09,329 --> 00:52:13,020
better at that time if they've already

1256
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:15,930
made their quota they may not give you

1257
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:18,030
as much of a good deal but whatever your

1258
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:20,880
end is also very very good because it's

1259
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,680
like hey I want to get to President's

1260
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,500
Club so how am I gonna make this deal

1261
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:30,359
here and then also seasonal so you may

1262
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:31,890
think you're in you know that is that

1263
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:34,619
the best for me the biggest problem in

1264
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:36,780
doing a proof of concept was doing it

1265
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:40,250
during summer months so June July August

1266
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:42,540
awful because there's always somebody

1267
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:45,480
taking vacation that was the person

1268
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:48,420
that's in charge of you know X Y Z

1269
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:50,130
resource that I need if I need a rack

1270
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:52,680
and stack that person wasn't there the

1271
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,869
person that signs the the POA they're

1272
00:52:54,869 --> 00:52:57,480
not around they're on vacation so on so

1273
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,730
forth so seasonal can be a challenge and

1274
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:01,650
if you can find a sales person that's

1275
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:05,430
like dying in you know June July August

1276
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:07,290
like I gotta make some sales here

1277
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:12,000
because I have to make my number oh good

1278
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,490
deal because that so let me say look I

1279
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:16,619
want to try to get the best deal that I

1280
00:53:16,619 --> 00:53:19,020
can I know it's quarter in what can you

1281
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:20,819
do for me if I can if I can get this POS

1282
00:53:20,819 --> 00:53:25,170
signed here how much can you you know do

1283
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:27,150
for me yeah I'll tell you one other

1284
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:28,859
story I had you know one thing I never

1285
00:53:28,859 --> 00:53:32,579
do is I would never tell people what

1286
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:35,760
other quotes were so I would say yeah

1287
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,220
I'm going to multiple vendors and such

1288
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:39,329
but I would never tell him what the

1289
00:53:39,329 --> 00:53:41,900
dollars were and I had one guy from an

1290
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:44,339
was it from a switch manufacturer cable

1291
00:53:44,339 --> 00:53:45,690
Tron because they're not around anymore

1292
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:49,950
and I we had cable Tron equipment and

1293
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:52,349
they had some high price for upgrading

1294
00:53:52,349 --> 00:53:54,240
and I said yeah well we're looking

1295
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,680
around and we're looking at Cisco and

1296
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,900
they said yeah well what kind of quit

1297
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,250
are you getting I said well I can't give

1298
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:01,490
that out but I'll tell you you know

1299
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:04,230
you're you're off by quite a number

1300
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:06,690
you're off by about twenty thousand so

1301
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:08,970
it was kind of lying and went up

1302
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:10,829
happening the guy came back within ten

1303
00:54:10,829 --> 00:54:12,210
minutes

1304
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:16,700
and he gave me 25,000 off well what I

1305
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:20,970
failed to tell him on purpose was cisco

1306
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:23,490
was $20,000 more expensive than cable

1307
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:24,030
Tron

1308
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:28,800
so was that ethical or moral no did I

1309
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,010
get away with it yes so all right I'm

1310
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:34,619
kind of a bad guy once in a while so you

1311
00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:36,780
know you can play these games this is

1312
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:39,330
this is used car salesman tips sometimes

1313
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:41,520
but you want to be good to you guys you

1314
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,810
want to take care of them if they're

1315
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:44,849
doing good by you you do good by them

1316
00:54:44,849 --> 00:54:47,040
right get a fair price make sure you

1317
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,710
know what other people are paying talk

1318
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:52,589
to your friends enemies whatever and and

1319
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:55,200
make a good deal know that timing is

1320
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,210
important if it's quarter end they're

1321
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,880
usually very very motivated to help you

1322
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:03,780
out there okay so best price versus I

1323
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:05,700
got my buddy here that's going to give

1324
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,680
you the best price on that used car that

1325
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,740
probably won't make it out to the door

1326
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:13,380
how do I get the best price what am I

1327
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:16,740
looking for well you can always go and

1328
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:19,380
look online and do searches for price

1329
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:21,330
it's amazing the kinds of things that

1330
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:24,240
you can find out I'll give you an

1331
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,130
example if you're you're looking at

1332
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:28,380
firewalls there was one company that all

1333
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:36,859
my resellers hated yeah so when I was a

1334
00:55:36,859 --> 00:55:42,780
SonicWALL these guys sold everything and

1335
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:45,450
one of the things that they did in

1336
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:51,930
selling SonicWALL is they would if you

1337
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:53,220
don't like SonicWALL please don't hold

1338
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:56,359
it against me I just worked there okay

1339
00:55:56,359 --> 00:55:59,760
people would go to this site look at the

1340
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,020
products get the price and then go ahead

1341
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:06,839
and come back and say oh yeah we did the

1342
00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:08,640
POC he spent all that time and money and

1343
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,010
effort on us yeah but first Rick rafidhi

1344
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:14,099
has it for this price so I'd go in there

1345
00:56:14,099 --> 00:56:15,690
and check the prices I was like yeah you

1346
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:17,220
know call for it yeah I called him up

1347
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:20,970
this is what they told me so hated these

1348
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:22,500
guys because they'd always ruin deals

1349
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,359
but what they would do was a quarter end

1350
00:56:24,359 --> 00:56:25,720
they would come to sauna

1351
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:28,210
call and say hey I've got a million

1352
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:31,690
dollars to spend to you restock and

1353
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:33,370
replenish you know the stuff that I've

1354
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:36,700
been selling and I want 40% off and they

1355
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,670
would get 40 50 percent off because

1356
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:40,300
SonicWALL will do it

1357
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,280
well that undercut all their resellers

1358
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,680
which was always a bad thing guess what

1359
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:47,020
if I can go out there and find a better

1360
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:49,870
price let your sales person know what

1361
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:51,820
you want to make sure is like if you buy

1362
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:53,380
from this company alright you're buying

1363
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:55,450
the equipment and that's it yeah you get

1364
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:56,800
the same warranty and stuff like that

1365
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,110
but if something goes wrong yeah you got

1366
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:01,150
your support but guess what if I have a

1367
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:03,220
reseller they can give me some added

1368
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:07,270
value so make sure you look at what is

1369
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:09,010
the added value the reseller is going to

1370
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:10,720
put in there they haven't told you

1371
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,480
already and they didn't do their job and

1372
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,920
then going to a place like this nice

1373
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,900
buying it you know for next to nothing

1374
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:20,200
fine that's that's all you need bad

1375
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:23,230
thing to do but you got a value-added

1376
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:25,480
reseller yeah everybody says they're

1377
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,760
value-added reseller that's where when

1378
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,770
you talk with them they have to tell you

1379
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:31,330
what is the value that they're bringing

1380
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:36,070
to the table that's key you keep them

1381
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:41,320
honest all right all right marketing

1382
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:44,830
fluff so here's part of where I got to

1383
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:46,270
be very careful what I say because I

1384
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:47,470
have worked with a lot of these people

1385
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:51,760
and I'm not going to be nailing anybody

1386
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,320
in any way shape or form that's gonna

1387
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:56,620
give you general observations okay so

1388
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:58,060
there's a lot of independent testing

1389
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:02,170
which is good go check Gardner ICSA labs

1390
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:03,820
and SS labs or whatever when you're

1391
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:05,380
looking at their products and they've

1392
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:07,780
reviewed them take it for what it's

1393
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:10,720
worth there have been testing labs and

1394
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,590
I'm not naming anybody here okay not

1395
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:17,650
listed here and this is just totally

1396
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:20,100
anonymous okay there have been instances

1397
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:24,010
in the past where I've seen testing gone

1398
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:27,990
where there was code for a particular

1399
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:32,950
device that was purposely engineered to

1400
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:36,829
pass that test the other part

1401
00:58:36,829 --> 00:58:41,479
it is what kind of testing do they do in

1402
00:58:41,479 --> 00:58:44,029
terms of saying that I'm going to I be

1403
00:58:44,029 --> 00:58:47,479
able identify zero-day malware

1404
00:58:47,479 --> 00:58:48,890
especially when they call it zero Dame

1405
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:51,469
hour which I hate that term anytime

1406
00:58:51,469 --> 00:58:52,999
somebody says that I have a lot of

1407
00:58:52,999 --> 00:58:55,219
questions why because how can you test

1408
00:58:55,219 --> 00:58:58,999
for something you haven't seen it

1409
00:58:58,999 --> 00:59:00,709
doesn't work that way but some people

1410
00:59:00,709 --> 00:59:02,599
will market at that hey my report can

1411
00:59:02,599 --> 00:59:03,950
show you that they did this this and

1412
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:08,630
this it's BS okay take it for what it's

1413
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:10,670
worth I'd like now I will say I like

1414
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:12,529
Gartner a lot because they kind of give

1415
00:59:12,529 --> 00:59:14,690
you here's the good and bad and part of

1416
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:16,089
their research is talking with customers

1417
00:59:16,089 --> 00:59:18,859
if you're on the other side of it and

1418
00:59:18,859 --> 00:59:22,130
you're trying to get your product into a

1419
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:24,289
Gartner quadrant or whatever one of the

1420
00:59:24,289 --> 00:59:26,630
hardest things is they will not do it

1421
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:29,180
unless their customers who pay for the

1422
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:32,420
reports are asking about you so part of

1423
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:34,219
the sales pitch sometimes has been hey

1424
00:59:34,219 --> 00:59:36,650
by the way if you get gardener reports

1425
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:38,709
could you please ask them about us and

1426
00:59:38,709 --> 00:59:41,569
we get on their radar so I kind of like

1427
00:59:41,569 --> 00:59:44,119
Gardner and it's this loud ICS a read

1428
00:59:44,119 --> 00:59:46,130
the reports a lot of times the vendors

1429
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:48,140
will have them on their website saying

1430
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:51,140
yeah we're the top whatever but use it

1431
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:52,969
to ask questions of the sales person

1432
00:59:52,969 --> 00:59:54,829
saying hey what version of the operating

1433
00:59:54,829 --> 00:59:57,799
system was tested with this I want to

1434
00:59:57,799 --> 00:59:59,690
know that it wasn't a special version of

1435
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:02,719
it tested with that and it says Labs

1436
01:00:02,719 --> 01:00:04,130
will do you know if you look at the

1437
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:05,809
stuff they'll always say we're testing

1438
01:00:05,809 --> 01:00:07,009
with this version of the operating

1439
01:00:07,009 --> 01:00:11,209
system ask them how did they test the

1440
01:00:11,209 --> 01:00:13,069
zero day malware as a matter of fact

1441
01:00:13,069 --> 01:00:15,559
what I love is I will ask them what do

1442
01:00:15,559 --> 01:00:18,410
you mean by zero day malware now we're

1443
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:20,390
by definition is polymorphic which means

1444
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:22,670
it constantly changes so there's no such

1445
01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:25,579
thing as zero day malware in my mind if

1446
01:00:25,579 --> 01:00:27,769
somebody keeps on saying that you know

1447
01:00:27,769 --> 01:00:29,630
they tell me once or twice I'll let it

1448
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:30,799
go because I don't want to get into an

1449
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:33,049
argument somebody and get into you know

1450
01:00:33,049 --> 01:00:35,920
who's the expert session not worth it

1451
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,160
bottom line

1452
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,829
ask him how these came about what tools

1453
01:00:39,829 --> 01:00:43,999
did they use when I was at SonicWALL we

1454
01:00:43,999 --> 01:00:45,709
were getting private testing by NSS Labs

1455
01:00:45,709 --> 01:00:47,749
because you want third-party independent

1456
01:00:47,749 --> 01:00:50,660
testing and we actually helped them out

1457
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:53,210
using different devices called Exia

1458
01:00:53,210 --> 01:00:54,940
breaking-point we actually helped them

1459
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:57,529
learn how to use those devices back in

1460
01:00:57,529 --> 01:00:58,970
the early days when they were literally

1461
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:01,160
running out of a garage in Austin Texas

1462
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:04,579
and so it was very interesting to see

1463
01:01:04,579 --> 01:01:07,460
how their testing came out so knowit's

1464
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:08,349
tested

1465
01:01:08,349 --> 01:01:11,000
trust but verify that's always a good

1466
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,069
way to put it so yeah that sounds good

1467
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:14,480
you're in the upper part of the quadrant

1468
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,970
that's great but let me verify what

1469
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:18,410
conditions were they testing how are

1470
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:20,660
they doing it does it make sense to me

1471
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:25,058
is it germane to what I'm doing

1472
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:28,910
and my favorite anytime I had a

1473
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:30,349
salesperson come in and talk about zero

1474
01:01:30,349 --> 01:01:33,980
day malware I went after him verse ly

1475
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:35,990
when I would go in and make a pitch I

1476
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:38,000
would say look you can see that you know

1477
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,039
here's my competitor they talk about

1478
01:01:40,039 --> 01:01:41,509
zero day malware let me explain what

1479
01:01:41,509 --> 01:01:43,279
that really is because it's a marketing

1480
01:01:43,279 --> 01:01:48,589
term I hate marketing terms try and do

1481
01:01:48,589 --> 01:01:50,119
this upfront with a sales person and

1482
01:01:50,119 --> 01:01:51,380
when you write that first email saying

1483
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:53,390
hey what are our expectations ours when

1484
01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:55,069
you come in also please be careful about

1485
01:01:55,069 --> 01:01:57,559
the terminology is if you're gonna say

1486
01:01:57,559 --> 01:01:59,329
zero day malware we know that this is a

1487
01:01:59,329 --> 01:02:01,220
marketing term it's not something that

1488
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:02,900
we really want to hear because we know

1489
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:05,529
better okay so in other words don't

1490
01:02:05,529 --> 01:02:10,220
insult their intelligence right get in

1491
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:13,609
writing can't stress that enough if if

1492
01:02:13,609 --> 01:02:16,400
the salesperson says this will work

1493
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:20,119
great on any day of the week it'll catch

1494
01:02:20,119 --> 01:02:21,500
everything it doesn't matter where it's

1495
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:23,660
coming from right you write it in an

1496
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:25,039
email saying hey this is what I

1497
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:28,069
understood you said please confirm and

1498
01:02:28,069 --> 01:02:30,259
then later when you write contracts and

1499
01:02:30,259 --> 01:02:31,460
stuff like that you can even put it in

1500
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:33,920
the contract so when I went to school I

1501
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,710
went to Cal Poly Pomona and one of the

1502
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:38,809
things we had to do in our senior year

1503
01:02:38,809 --> 01:02:41,210
was read the contract from IBM and in

1504
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:43,490
the beginning of it it's stated very

1505
01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:45,799
clearly everything that sales person

1506
01:02:45,799 --> 01:02:48,380
just sets you any brochure that we gave

1507
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:51,529
you none of that matters does not apply

1508
01:02:51,529 --> 01:02:53,779
to anything that we're selling you here

1509
01:02:53,779 --> 01:02:55,789
if it's in the contract that's the only

1510
01:02:55,789 --> 01:02:58,849
place that makes sense so I would go and

1511
01:02:58,849 --> 01:03:01,099
then take every time they gave me

1512
01:03:01,099 --> 01:03:02,240
something like that and say look I'm

1513
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,549
adding this as an addendum to the con

1514
01:03:04,549 --> 01:03:06,019
tract saying that this is what you're

1515
01:03:06,019 --> 01:03:08,779
saying it can do hated me for it and if

1516
01:03:08,779 --> 01:03:09,949
they wouldn't live with it

1517
01:03:09,949 --> 01:03:15,009
I'd have to bond so get it in writing

1518
01:03:15,249 --> 01:03:17,329
relationships you want to trust it

1519
01:03:17,329 --> 01:03:19,009
advisor you don't want a salesperson

1520
01:03:19,009 --> 01:03:21,679
think long term what do you want out of

1521
01:03:21,679 --> 01:03:23,599
these people you want to build a

1522
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:25,969
relationship you want to make sure that

1523
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:27,229
the some of this gonna be sticking

1524
01:03:27,229 --> 01:03:29,089
around with you and help you through the

1525
01:03:29,089 --> 01:03:31,910
process so it's not something you can

1526
01:03:31,910 --> 01:03:34,819
necessarily pick off day one but like I

1527
01:03:34,819 --> 01:03:37,099
said if you tell them what your

1528
01:03:37,099 --> 01:03:39,589
expectations are before the meeting

1529
01:03:39,589 --> 01:03:41,329
occurs they come in and they don't do

1530
01:03:41,329 --> 01:03:43,999
any of it red flag not gonna be a

1531
01:03:43,999 --> 01:03:46,009
long-term relationship

1532
01:03:46,009 --> 01:03:48,140
that most salespeople would like to meet

1533
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:49,819
with you once a quarter if you buy a

1534
01:03:49,819 --> 01:03:51,799
decent number of things

1535
01:03:51,799 --> 01:03:53,989
what's the quarter is great it's a free

1536
01:03:53,989 --> 01:03:55,549
meal and you usually get to choose where

1537
01:03:55,549 --> 01:03:57,769
you get the that's nice they usually

1538
01:03:57,769 --> 01:03:59,869
have beta programs if you're willing to

1539
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:01,939
be a tester love it

1540
01:04:01,939 --> 01:04:03,799
salespeople love it you can see what's

1541
01:04:03,799 --> 01:04:05,449
coming out you can tell them what's

1542
01:04:05,449 --> 01:04:08,900
going on more importantly as they get to

1543
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:10,579
know you and you're doing great you can

1544
01:04:10,579 --> 01:04:13,039
also go in and wind up giving me advice

1545
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:14,630
about hey look I want to see this

1546
01:04:14,630 --> 01:04:16,130
feature or I think this feature would be

1547
01:04:16,130 --> 01:04:18,349
really good you can get in there being

1548
01:04:18,349 --> 01:04:20,420
an adviser for them and that that's

1549
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:21,559
really good if you want to have that

1550
01:04:21,559 --> 01:04:23,900
kind of relationship of course more time

1551
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:26,569
on your part it depends on whether you

1552
01:04:26,569 --> 01:04:30,079
feel it's worth it or not all right

1553
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:32,900
let's go over questions what questions

1554

01:04:40,819 --> 01:04:46,339

1557

comments not sure if somebody has a

1562
01:04:59,179 --> 01:05:02,839

comments about it the reception was

1572
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:29,510
great there's a question there by Robert

1573
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:32,190
okay so if I end up with the bad cells

1574
01:05:32,190 --> 01:05:34,320
what's the best way to to request

1575
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:42,450
somebody else just call the company tell

1576
01:05:42,450 --> 01:05:43,440
them you like to talk to somebody in

1577
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,670
sales tell them exactly what's happening

1578
01:05:44,670 --> 01:05:46,290
like I'm not really happy with my sales

1579
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:49,920
rep who can I talk to about changing it

1580
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:55,110
out and it happened a few times you know

1581
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:57,110
what again they're not your friends not

1582
01:05:57,110 --> 01:05:58,710
your family

1583
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:01,230
just call B business professionals

1584
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:02,250
saying look I'd rather have somebody

1585
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:03,600
else here's some of the issues I'm

1586
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:05,070
having and maybe you don't you don't

1587
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:06,690
even want to go into the details and

1588
01:06:06,690 --> 01:06:08,250
that's fine you say I'd rather have

1589
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:13,100
somebody else make it easy just call up

1590
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:16,200
let's see here to echo Eric's early

1591
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:19,080
suggestion getting the PIO sign has huge

1592
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:22,410
leverage that never identify as having

1593
01:06:22,410 --> 01:06:26,600
independent purchasing Authority yeah if

1594
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:29,810
we're always gonna ask you who can sign

1595
01:06:29,810 --> 01:06:32,400
who can do the the PIA because at some

1596
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,260
point as we get into it from a sales

1597
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:35,910
standpoint if we're putting a lot of

1598
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:37,800
time and effort and we've put a million

1599
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,540
dollars a piece of equipment into your

1600
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:42,390
organization we kind of want to know who

1601
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:44,040
is the person that can authorize this

1602
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:44,900
and get it signed

1603
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:49,170
so at some point you have to say who

1604
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:52,800
that is and you can always say look you

1605
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,810
have to go through me this person's not

1606
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:56,340
going to meet with you I'm the one that

1607
01:06:56,340 --> 01:07:02,820
goes to them and that's fine you can go

1608
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:04,110
through some of the stuff - and tell me

1609
01:07:04,110 --> 01:07:08,040
what you like I wanted to speak my

1610
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:11,760
question out okay hi Eric yeah I was

1611
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,380
sharing that Ellen earlier about my

1612
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:15,540
experience with AWS because my

1613
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:18,210
environment we're building AWS so we

1614
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:21,870
have a sa sales executive

1615
01:07:21,870 --> 01:07:24,240
and then also a Solutions Architect so

1616
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,330
in in you know Bennett benefit of doubt

1617
01:07:27,330 --> 01:07:29,010
right but then again sometimes you have

1618
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:30,920
to have that other mind of

1619
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,780
being a little skeptical about are they

1620
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:35,240
really honest with you are they taking

1621
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:37,130
you the route channel right Channel

1622
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:40,040
so this distinct on control tower in AWS

1623
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:42,560
which is fairly new a lot of people are

1624
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,870
learning about it so some of my friends

1625
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:47,300
who are experts in AWS they kind of told

1626
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:49,220
me that my environment because of our

1627
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:51,230
business size we don't need control

1628
01:07:51,230 --> 01:07:55,610
tower but when we did our initial you

1629
01:07:55,610 --> 01:07:58,670
know configuration our Diablo s sales

1630
01:07:58,670 --> 01:08:00,800
executive and Solutions Architect they

1631
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:04,070
con us made us go the control tower out

1632
01:08:04,070 --> 01:08:06,950
and we told them like you know we're not

1633
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:08,420
sure really whether we need this route

1634
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:10,400
or not but they kind of just kind of

1635
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,130
steered us to us there and I'm and and

1636
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:17,390
they kind of like gave me a little wall

1637
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:19,939
between me and them and my boss I I

1638
01:08:19,939 --> 01:08:21,710
think kind of feels that way too

1639
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:23,450
but you know we're just giving the

1640
01:08:23,450 --> 01:08:25,460
benefit of benefit of doubt and I'm not

1641
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:28,130
sure if I should trust them and really

1642
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:30,529
I'm not sure really sure they're there

1643
01:08:30,529 --> 01:08:33,380
for us or not if you know kind of like

1644
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:36,500
it's a very tricky situation I mean if

1645
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:39,140
you were me what would we do what would

1646
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:39,620
I do

1647
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:41,930
I am taking some measures for example

1648
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:43,580
like you know another stated you see

1649
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:45,140
sustained Jessie we're gonna have a

1650
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:46,790
conference call with them and learn from

1651
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:49,390
them their lessons learned talk to their

1652
01:08:49,390 --> 01:08:51,100
solutions architect

1653
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:54,560
I'm sorry their environment ur prized

1654
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,870
architect but that's the my situation my

1655
01:08:56,870 --> 01:08:59,600
dilemma we have at AWS you know so what

1656
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:02,720
are your thoughts so I would go a few

1657
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:05,149
routes number one I would ask them

1658
01:09:05,149 --> 01:09:08,149
questions and saying okay so I'm seeing

1659
01:09:08,149 --> 01:09:09,950
this isn't this but I'm I'm honestly I'm

1660
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:11,450
not very comfortable feeling that this

1661
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:14,569
is the right solution and I'd like to

1662
01:09:14,569 --> 01:09:17,689
know you know answers to these questions

1663
01:09:17,689 --> 01:09:20,990
if you gut tells you something doesn't

1664
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:24,830
feel right it's not right the second way

1665
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:27,140
to do it is to go online to different

1666
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:29,800
forums that people who are experts in

1667
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:32,930
AWS start posting questions just make

1668
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:35,680
sure you use a different email address

1669
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:39,920
and you put on mail address so they

1670
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,229
can't quite directly link you up and

1671
01:09:42,229 --> 01:09:44,389
then

1672
01:09:44,389 --> 01:09:48,049
the if there's a lot of money on the

1673
01:09:48,049 --> 01:09:50,540
table yeah that's where it may be worth

1674
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:53,299
saying look we're gonna bring in a third

1675
01:09:53,299 --> 01:09:56,030
party consultant and have somebody

1676
01:09:56,030 --> 01:09:58,869
consult for an hour two hours whatever

1677
01:09:58,869 --> 01:10:01,159
see if this is the best solution because

1678
01:10:01,159 --> 01:10:03,170
normally if you can get an independent

1679
01:10:03,170 --> 01:10:05,090
consultant that's like look all you're

1680
01:10:05,090 --> 01:10:08,030
doing is giving me advice you're not

1681
01:10:08,030 --> 01:10:09,770
making any money on the sale whatsoever

1682
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:12,739
right reason that they're there even

1683
01:10:12,739 --> 01:10:14,690
going to possibly come back is because I

1684
01:10:14,690 --> 01:10:17,000
gave good advice and will use you again

1685
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,460
later on that's where you say look I'm

1686
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:21,320
just getting a second opinion right you

1687
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,020
don't go to the same doctor like an

1688
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:25,340
opinion unless he has multiple

1689
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:28,280
personalities and then you know I don't

1690
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:29,389
know if you really want to do that I

1691
01:10:29,389 --> 01:10:33,590
would say consultant forums other people

1692
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:35,330
you know but go with your gut if it

1693
01:10:35,330 --> 01:10:39,080
doesn't feel right then you know you got

1694
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:40,760
to tell them you know I'd be very honest

1695
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,170
with them Stan look I'm not feeling very

1696
01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:43,489
comfortable with the solution it doesn't

1697
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:45,409
sound right can you help me understand X

1698
01:10:45,409 --> 01:10:49,489
Y or Z the more you can define the

1699
01:10:49,489 --> 01:10:51,800
question as to what's really bothering

1700
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:55,280
you that they can address yeah that's

1701
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:58,130
always gonna be good but the problem is

1702
01:10:58,130 --> 01:10:59,960
when it's something that you don't know

1703
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:01,460
it's like you're telling me I have to

1704
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:06,170
yeah I really don't get why yeah exactly

1705
01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:08,750
that's where you know you're really in a

1706
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:10,520
bind right because they're trying to

1707
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:12,020
make money and it's like yeah upsell

1708
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:14,659
upsell upsell in-depth oh and my problem

1709
01:11:14,659 --> 01:11:18,530
is yeah okay so you can sit there and

1710
01:11:18,530 --> 01:11:21,980
say look I really like you guys I'm I'm

1711
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:25,369
not understanding this can we sit down

1712
01:11:25,369 --> 01:11:27,320
and draw this out and I need to have

1713
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:28,880
these questions answered because I don't

1714
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:32,540
know this and if they don't try and be

1715
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:34,310
honest with you and straightforward with

1716
01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:36,080
you or if they try and be shifty about

1717
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:40,730
it and it's like run away run away the

1718
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:42,800
third party in there somebody that knows

1719
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,929
the stuff that make sure like look guy

1720
01:11:44,929 --> 01:11:47,900
I'm paying you for your opinion first

1721
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:49,429
thing I need to know is you have no

1722
01:11:49,429 --> 01:11:51,020
connections with these guys in terms of

1723
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:51,889
direct connections with these

1724
01:11:51,889 --> 01:11:53,750

other other

1727
01:11:57,599 --> 01:12:00,359
and more importantly all you're using

1728
01:12:00,359 --> 01:12:03,659
them for is a consultant not potential

1729
01:12:03,659 --> 01:12:05,999
sale there's a moment that they think

1730
01:12:05,999 --> 01:12:07,260
that they can sell something to you they

1731
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:09,179

1753
01:13:06,570 --> 01:13:07,979
a lot of success people call me all the

1754
01:13:07,979 --> 01:13:08,609
time

1755
01:13:08,609 --> 01:13:15,479
I ask them immediately sure what that

1756
01:13:15,479 --> 01:13:19,769
last part is if your phone number is out

1757
01:13:19,769 --> 01:13:21,419
there it's time to change your phone

1758
01:13:21,419 --> 01:13:23,999
number if you can or just you know

1759
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:26,639
screen calls you know for me I know my

1760
01:13:26,639 --> 01:13:28,139
phone number has been out there for a

1761
01:13:28,139 --> 01:13:29,879
while and if I don't recognize that

1762
01:13:29,879 --> 01:13:30,689
phone number

1763
01:13:30,689 --> 01:13:33,030
I just don't answer it I don't know that

1764
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:36,919
it's a hard hard thing to do but I think

1765
01:13:36,919 --> 01:13:41,519
worked with some major customers that

1766
01:13:41,519 --> 01:13:44,639
were constantly being pounded and they

1767
01:13:44,639 --> 01:13:46,229
had internal numbers that they wouldn't

1768
01:13:46,229 --> 01:13:48,119
even give me that was just for their

1769
01:13:48,119 --> 01:13:49,679
people so that they can get some stuff

1770
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:53,909
done so don't know how much to do but

1771
01:13:53,909 --> 01:13:57,329
know is easy always to say what do you

1772
01:13:57,329 --> 01:13:59,699
need it throws them off guard and they

1773
01:13:59,699 --> 01:14:01,679
will tell me what their product is

1774
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:03,749
usually immediately and then I can

1775
01:14:03,749 --> 01:14:06,709
decide of anyone yeah

1776
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:09,780
whatever you you can do to get them to

1777
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:12,270
the point the thing I hate is having the

1778
01:14:12,270 --> 01:14:14,250
prepared speech and I'm listening to

1779
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:15,720
this thing and it's sounding like well

1780
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:18,210
wait and if you buy this offer you're

1781
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:20,730
gonna have this but if you you know you

1782
01:14:20,730 --> 01:14:24,030
go through a whole lecture and I always

1783
01:14:24,030 --> 01:14:25,680
cut them off it's like look what do you

1784
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:27,870
got what are you looking for thank you

1785
01:14:27,870 --> 01:14:36,060
no I'm not interested all right if the

1786
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:37,550
product is free you're the product yeah

1787
01:14:37,550 --> 01:14:40,920
no that trick a lot of salespeople are

1788
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:42,690
now using us to send you a message or

1789
01:14:42,690 --> 01:14:44,570
call you claiming they didn't respond

1790
01:14:44,570 --> 01:14:48,810

1791
01:14:48,810 --> 01:14:51,600

1793
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,640

1797
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:09,180
