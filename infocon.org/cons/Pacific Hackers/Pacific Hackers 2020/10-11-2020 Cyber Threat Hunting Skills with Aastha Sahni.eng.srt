gotten at one point um

92
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,000

hunting and we'll be focusing on

140
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,880
one specific methodology and thread

141
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,000
hunting which is known as

142
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,600
ooda loop so before starting uh

143
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,039

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,280
so i teach students sim which is

147
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,600
security information and even management

148
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,000
and

149
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,160
the basics and foundations of cyber

150
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,199
threat hunting

151
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,319
i'm an active member of owasp nyc

152
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,120
i am part of a community known as

153
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,120
infosec girls which is globally headed

154
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,479
by vandanawarma

155
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,400
so for the new york chapter i am the

156
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,880
lead here with zoe pritamin

157
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,520
and i have started a small initiative

158
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,280
educational initiative known as

159
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,560
cyberpreserve

160
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,600
where uh what i do is like uh

161
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,840
i provide a learning platform to

162
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,759
individuals who want to transition their

163
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,039
korean into cyber

164
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,120
and sometimes things happen like this

165
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,360
like we are already into cyber we are

166
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,120
touching some part of cyber

167
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,639
but we are not aware about it so

168
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,800
basically i provide a small foundational

169
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,520
course

170
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,120
about like from the learning of my

171
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,280
master's program in information security

172
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,240
management

173
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,479
so i've created a foundational course

174
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,400
and some professionals based on

175
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,240
invitation whenever i start

176
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,479
the mentorship program in certain

177
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:01,360
intervals

178
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,639
they join me through this mentorship

179
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,440
program

180
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,039
and through that they learn some of the

181
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,360
foundations about the cyber security

182
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:09,919
area

183
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,479
and we connect the dots so basically the

184
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,560
educational program and initiative is

185
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,639
mostly about connecting the dots among

186
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,800
individuals about cyber security

187
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,319
so that they are not only learning

188
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,560
skills about cyber but they are also

189
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,919
learning that somehow

190
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,160
somewhere in their career at some point

191
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,759
they have touched cyber

192
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,120
so this isn't about my introduction

193
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,759
so let me move forward about today's

194
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,479
concept

195
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,800
so today first of all before discussing

196
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,880
about ooda loop we are going to discuss

197
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,599
about what is

198
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,160
trade hunting okay then what are some of

199
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,440
the requirements

200
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,199
we are going to discuss about a very

201
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,120
important term in threat hunting which

202
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,800
is known as dwell time

203
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,840
and then we will like eventually we

204
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,120
move into the direction of ooda loop

205
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,560
so uh before moving forward i will be

206
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,240
discussing all these topics

207
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,400
and once i'm done with the session i am

208
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,639
open for any questions you have

209
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,520
so once i complete this session i'll be

210
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,160
happy to take

211
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,000
your doubts so let's start

212
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,120
so basically what's threat hunting so

213
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,160
in cyber whenever we are actually

214
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,000
identifying threats so basically what we

215
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,440
are doing is we are trying to protect

216
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,240
data

217
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,879
okay and cyber comes from a super

218
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,759
superset

219
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,080
of information security so actually what

220
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,840
we are doing is we are trying to protect

221
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,840
sensitive data we are trying to protect

222
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,799
information

223
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,760
so all the tools all the areas different

224
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,679
different areas of cyber which you come

225
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,479
across

226
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,479
the aim is main like we are trying to

227
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,120
protect data but these different domains

228
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,399
are actually contributing their part

229
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,120
for protecting information so what's

230
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,040
threat hunting threat hunting term

231
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,720
is not new to us we know we are

232
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,399
identifying threats everybody can say

233
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,120
that hey

234
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,959
we are doing threats we are identifying

235
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,800
threats and we are hunting for them

236
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,640
identifying them and that's how we work

237
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,640
in cyber we are identifying threats

238
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,040
okay that's cool everybody knows now

239
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,880
what's the whole concept about threat

240
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,160
hunting why it is

241
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,240
so separate and talked about so

242
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,000
basically in threat hunting what we are

243
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,720
doing is

244
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,519
we are proactively looking for anomalies

245
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,959
in our environment

246
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,000
what does that mean so in the last few

247
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,360
years when cyber

248
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,880
has grown into a specific named domain

249
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,160
in past 20 years when cyber had not

250
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,200
emerged as a separate domain it was

251
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,320
already part of information technology

252
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,440
which is i.t

253
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,920
now how it grown from a diff like how it

254
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,480
grow

255
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,320
into a separate domain the reason is

256
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,640
that earlier we were able to detect

257
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,160
threats like we learned

258
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,200
as cyber attackers and hackers

259
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,640
as they moved on in in actually um

260
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,880
i would say successfully accomplishing

261
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,839
their goals

262
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,800
of either stealing information doing any

263
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,399
kind of compromise

264
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,880
as they moved across like as

265
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,760
professionals

266
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,399
as we found them as we saw we named them

267
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,200
as threats

268
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,360
okay small threats big threats whatever

269
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,360
the name we gave it to them

270
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,079
the point here is that when we are

271
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,279
identifying threats

272
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,480
these threat actors are becoming equally

273
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,560
strong they are becoming equally

274
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,360
advanced in the past 10 years we have

275
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,320
identified

276
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,200
those kinds of advanced threats where

277
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,000
attackers were sitting in your network

278
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,079
for a longer period of time and that

279
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,440
longer period of time

280
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,839
trust me it's not just few days or

281
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,079
months they were like close to an ear

282
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,040
and this was the startling point from

283
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,440
where we try to identify that

284
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,920
even though we are implementing skills

285
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,440
like we are implementing

286
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,040
different tools like vulnerability

287
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,040
assessment we were into

288
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,399
identity access management we were into

289
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,560
application security network security

290
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,839
cloud security okay

291
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,720
every domain has its own place now why

292
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,640
threat hunting has become so important

293
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,279
in the past

294
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,600
five six or eight years because in

295
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,720
threat hunting

296
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,120
we are act we are not actively we are

297
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,040
proactively looking for threats in our

298
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,839
environment

299
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,760
we are trying to think from an

300
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,200
attacker's point of view

301
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,680
or a hacker's point of view okay and

302
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,279
what we're doing here is

303
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,120
now when we know they have grown

304
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,600
advanced in their techniques

305
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,279
we have to become one step ahead of them

306
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,079
until or unless we are like we are not

307
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,600
one step ahead of them

308
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,880
we will be always finding them like like

309
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,640
you will be always detecting them when

310
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,240
they have already compromised

311
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,160
like in the last few years we have heard

312
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,040
about threats like we heart bleed

313
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,360
uh wannacry ransomware is nothing new

314
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,200
everybody has heard about wannacry ran

315
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,760
somewhere

316
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,040
so what actually happened why somehow

317
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,000
in all these attacks we were not able to

318
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,200
identify

319
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,279
threat actors and how they were

320
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,560
performing these attacks

321
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,040
in some situations we were ignoring

322
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,639
maybe we can say that we were not

323
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,560
protecting our environment properly

324
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,040
but in some situations where advanced

325
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,639
persistent threats

326
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,760
like apt-1 zero-day attack so apts are

327
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,519
known as advanced persistent threats

328
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,800
where attackers are

329
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,959
dwelling and living in your environment

330
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,440
for a very long period of time

331
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,200
so how can we just protect our

332
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,600
organization

333
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,560
by being reactive that we find something

334
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,480
we are finding some compromise

335
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,000
we are finding some indicators of

336
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,399
compromises and then we are taking some

337
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:30,880
action

338
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,800
we identify something and then we are

339
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,760
taking actions so how we can be

340
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,839
strong enough to protect our

341
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:38,959
organization

342
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,519
just after just being like after just

343
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,240
using tools and becoming reactive only

344
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,240
so we come up with the technique of

345
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,920
cyber threat hunting

346
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,440
where we are not only implementing

347
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,320
reactive

348
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,360
areas of security we are using some

349
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,519
proactive methodologies

350
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,320
and tools in order to become more

351
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,279
efficient

352
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,560
or i would say for example if if we

353
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,440
consider

354
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,320
stages of attack so if like is it not

355
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,880
easy

356
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,760
like it's is it not good if we detect

357
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,800
some attack or

358
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,839
threat uh at a very early stage then at

359
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,839
a stage when we have already found that

360
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:18,399
some

361
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,360
part of our internal network has already

362
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,800
been compromised

363
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,720
so all in all the aim the the main aim

364
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,160
of threat hunting is to first of all

365
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,519
exp expedite our detection process of

366
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,240
threats

367
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,399
at the same time reducing our

368
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,480
investigation and forensics cost

369
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,480
so what we are doing is we are trying to

370
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,800
identify threats at a very initial stage

371
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,120
or

372
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,480
as soon as possible so that we are

373
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,440
not only detecting them before time but

374
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,160
also

375
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,040
we are taking necessary steps

376
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,160
immediately

377
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,639
so that we have minimal business

378
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,920
disruption

379
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,560
now when coming to dwell time this dwell

380
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,160
time is actually calculated

381
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,560
as the number of days an attacker is

382
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,399
present in a network before they are

383
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,440
detected

384
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,800
so according to fire mandiant so fireeye

385
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,519
is a cyber security solutions provider

386
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,800
organization

387
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,800
they they are provide they provide

388
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,040
solutions for like proactively detecting

389
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,639
threats and mitigating them

390
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,800
so they every year they come up with a

391
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,079
mandiant report

392
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,560
which talks about this dwell time so in

393
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,839
2011

394
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,720
the dwell time for an attacker inside a

395
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,440
network was 416 days

396
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,480
and now after implementing some of the

397
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,360
proactive cyber threat hunting skills

398
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,240
we have reduced that dwell time to 56

399
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:42,959
days

400
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,240
so see it's not about like eliminating

401
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,480
everything which can be possible

402
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,600
it's about like at a situation how first

403
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,519
we can improve ourselves

404
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,440
so cyber threat hunting is about

405
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,560
continuously

406
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,120
improving ourselves it's like a loop

407
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,040
where we're continuously trying to

408
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,560
improve ourselves from the current

409
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,360
position

410
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,519
to reach to a situation where we are

411
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,079
smarter than the attackers

412
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,399
so this is like a basics and like

413
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,800
background about why threat hunting

414
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,440
uh what's the basic definition why it

415
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,279
came up

416
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,399
now let's move on to the

417
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,760
methodology of ooda loop so first of all

418
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,480
uder loop is one of the proactive

419
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,240
technology proactive

420
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,120
practical methodologies which can be or

421
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,320
which should be and a lot of

422
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,480
organizations are implementing them

423
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,959
in their day-to-day routine so basically

424
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,959
how it came up but what's actually this

425
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,000
term udolu

426
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,480
so uder loop was developed by united

427
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,880
states air force colonel

428
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,839
john boyd okay and they were at a

429
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:48,720
military

430
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,480
uh i would say military operations at

431
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,959
that time and why did he came up with

432
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,360
came up with this uh terminology of uder

433
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,320
loop wife

434
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,160
so udo loop is like a proactive strategy

435
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,399
where according to your current

436
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,600
situation

437
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,720
you are taking some necessary actions

438
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,440
which are not only immediate but they

439
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,600
are effective also so for example when

440
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,959
you are in a battlefield

441
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,800
and your enemy is in like isn't the

442
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,480
opposite you're fighting

443
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,040
so you don't have you do not have time

444
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,040
to actually think about the possible

445
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,480
solutions and decisions

446
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,800
you have very less time to come up with

447
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,839
good techniques

448
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,079
implement them and at the same time

449
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,839
making sure they are effective

450
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,639
in your direction okay so whatever

451
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:33,600
techniques

452
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,560
whatever i would say implementation in a

453
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,560
battlefield like for example if we are

454
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,079
in a battlefield okay

455
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,160
and we know what are the possible

456
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,920
weaknesses of our enemy

457
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,079
and suddenly we are in a situation where

458
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,160
we can immediately identify

459
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,399
what immediate actions we could we

460
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,759
should take so that

461
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,399
we are in a win-win situation so

462
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,000
basically this

463
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,120
loop came from military operation

464
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,320
strategy

465
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,680
where militants they have minimum time

466
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,079
to

467
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,400
take good decisions and as well as

468
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,679
implement them

469
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,720
so why oodaloop is being used in case of

470
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,919
threat

471
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,559
cyber threat hunting because in threat

472
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,199
hunting

473
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,319
again we are in an attack situation

474
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,000
though that is not a physical attack and

475
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,919
we do not have an enemy but attacker is

476
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,959
our enemy okay

477
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,240
if they are trying to attack our

478
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,319
organization comp they are trying to

479
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,720
compromise our information steal our

480
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,039
sensitive information they are enemies

481
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:31,840
so if we

482
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,160
identify okay so the very important

483
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,360
thing for us

484
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,919
in case of our pro in case of our

485
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,200
organization is

486
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,960
that if we are trying to protect our

487
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,520
organization it becomes important for

488
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,799
us to identify attackers

489
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,880
in a very less period of time at the

490
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,559
very initial stage

491
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,640
when the attackers are in the very

492
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,679
initial stage of

493
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,559
attack it becomes really important for

494
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,640
us to identify them

495
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,720
and not only identify them and take

496
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,960
necessary actions against them like

497
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,799
whatever possible remediations we can

498
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,559
take removal we can take

499
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,240
investigations we have to do if we

500
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,320
identify something so how do

501
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,480
how to do that in a very short period of

502
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,360
time because

503
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,679
if somebody is in your network okay if

504
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,360
you find any enormous

505
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,600
network how would you take immediate

506
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,120
actions so uder loop

507
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,160
actually helps you take necessary

508
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,880
actions

509
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,200
right actions and effective actions in a

510
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,760
very short duration of time

511
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,280
so the very first stage of ooda loop is

512
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,840
observe so basically if i like sorry let

513
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,039
me go back

514
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,000
so the full form of uder loop is observe

515
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,720
orient

516
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,520
decide and act okay so observe orient

517
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,440
desired act will flow in a way like for

518
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,160
example

519
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,640
you observe something okay through any

520
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,440
alerts

521
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,640
or through your real like uh in cyber

522
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,640
we use some real-time monitoring tools

523
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,640
and sim which is a secure

524
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,960
information and even management is one

525
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,840
of the uh

526
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,000
domain of cyber in which we are

527
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,919
performing some real-time monitoring

528
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,160
analysis investigations okay

529
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,320
or same is with your ids ips tools like

530
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,160
real-time alerting and stuff so

531
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,960
basically

532
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,120
in the observed stage we are trying to

533
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,200
observe something in our environment

534
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,480
in orient stage we are trying to like we

535
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,520
are trying to make

536
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,160
our position in our direction where we

537
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,720
we

538
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,440
are now investigating and decide means

539
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,280
like finally the stage when we have

540
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,160
observed something

541
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,000
oriented ourselves we are taking some

542
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,160
necessary decisions and acting upon them

543
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,080
so let's discuss them one by one

544
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,679
like what are the things what are the

545
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,120
possible tools involved in each stage

546
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,200
so in the observed stage what we are

547
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,120
doing we are continuously

548
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,400
detecting changes around us

549
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,120
so for example if we are using a sim

550
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,799
tool okay and basically

551
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,559
in a sim tool what we do is we are

552
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,160
collecting logs from

553
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,640
all possible sources like possible

554
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,320
sources which is your assets in your

555
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,280
organization

556
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,679
which are important to us from security

557
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:02,480
point of view

558
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,799
okay so what does that mean so basically

559
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:05,600
logs are

560
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,799
like real-time records which are

561
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,520
generated in systems in network devices

562
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,640
and stuff and why we

563
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,559
why we are using like the same

564
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,080
methodology because

565
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,400
uh using sim tools we can perform some

566
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,240
real-time monitoring on

567
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,880
our data okay on or sorry on our

568
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,559
environment using log data

569
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,640
and then we have like ids ips tools we

570
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,880
have vulnerability assessment tools

571
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,120
to assess real-time vulnerabilities in

572
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,080
our environment

573
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,200
okay so now in case of the observe phase

574
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,200
what we are trying to do we are making

575
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,159
sure

576
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,280
that our tools okay are

577
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,480
configured properly okay alerts are set

578
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,600
up in our tools

579
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,240
we are doing proper uh we are doing like

580
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,720
for

581
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,880
monitoring we have everything in place

582
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,960
so for example in case of sim tool

583
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,360
we have collected all the required logs

584
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,360
okay and at the same time we have

585
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,280
created necessary alerts

586
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,840
we have create we have incorporated

587
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,880
necessary

588
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,880
functionalities in our sim tool for

589
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,159
real-time monitoring

590
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,240
same is with your ids ips and

591
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,159
vulnerability assessment tools

592
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,480
where you are making sure for exceed the

593
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,480
important thing is in order to observe

594
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,159
something in your environment

595
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,480
through your cyber security tools first

596
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,240
of all we need to configure them in a

597
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:20,960
right way

598
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,640
in order to observe them you should be

599
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,559
getting right kind of log data

600
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,240
you should be set upping up some right

601
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,080
kind of alerts so that

602
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,919
in a real-time environment you are

603
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,000
continuously monitoring changes what's

604
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,440
happening in my network what's happening

605
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,559
in my applications

606
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,000
what happening in my various network

607
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,559
devices and systems how certain users

608
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,520
are performing

609
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,280
what's their use for example what kind

610
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,679
of email a person is downloading

611
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,679
what action is being done on that email

612
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,120
is it a phishing email

613
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,520
so all these activities are tracked

614
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,320
through to

615
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,280
like through these tools so we are in

616
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,159
real world

617
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,799
observing malicious activities or

618
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,880
abnormalities in our network

619
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,720
through these tools so the very first

620
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,320
step of the loop is to

621
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,520
continuously detect changes around

622
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,200
us now next step in ooda loop is to

623
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,840
orient

624
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,440
for example in your network you found a

625
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,320
packet

626
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,720
which which like okay let's let's say

627
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,240
let's see a situation

628
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,159
where in your network you found that a

629
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,080
user downloaded a file

630
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,480
and after that in that particular user

631
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,360
system through logs you identify that

632
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,000
a new executable file is now running

633
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,919
okay a new process is running in that

634
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,039
particular system

635
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,799
eventually just after when they

636
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,080
downloaded an email

637
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,000
so now you identified something like

638
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,919
something is fishy like this person

639
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:40,720
downloaded some

640
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,440
email and suddenly a new process is seen

641
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,640
in their system

642
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,799
which is running which is looking as a

643
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:47,919
normal process

644
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,919
in our like windows operate like in any

645
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,600
operating system like we have

646
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,200
some of the processes which are by

647
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
default running in our operating systems

648
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,440
but they look legitimate but somehow

649
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,559
it's rare

650
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,720
a process which usually does not run

651
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,600
every day

652
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,000
you found out that or to make it more

653
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,720
simple

654
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,200
for example you saw in your firewall

655
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,840
logs

656
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,280
that um an ip address

657
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,760
outside your network is constantly

658
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,280
trying to connect with your network and

659
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,960
your firewall is denying it

660
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,640
so your firewall is denying it is

661
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,640
actually a point where you observe

662
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,360
something

663
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,400
okay now in the orientation phase

664
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,960
you are performed like you are making

665
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,720
yourself orient in that

666
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,240
or orient yours you are orienting

667
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,919
yourself in that direction because you

668
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,039
observe something

669
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,360
now your focus is going there okay now

670
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,320
at this stage

671
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,400
if you see a particular ip address

672
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,000
trying to reach your network and is

673
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,159
being denied by the firewall

674
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,919
then you start investigating on that

675
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,520
particular ip address so for that

676
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,279
purpose you would be doing some security

677
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,000
research

678
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,600
you would be using some open source

679
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,039
threat intelligence tool

680
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,640
and you will be performing analysis and

681
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,240
investigation here like what is this ip

682
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,919
address is it blacklisted

683
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,559
does this ip address is a is a bot it's

684
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:58,960
like

685
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,840
it's a bot or it's a command and control

686
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,960
ip address

687
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,760
so what is it so then you start to

688
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,720
evaluate

689
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,559
what's happening in your real-time

690
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,760
situation so

691
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,400
now from your observation you have

692
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,919
oriented yourself

693
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,559
once you have oriented yourself and

694
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,480
after an investigation you found out

695
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:18,799
like

696
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,279
no this ip address is wrong it can be

697
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,720
malicious and we should take some

698
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,080
necessary actions

699
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,880
now when you know like when you are in a

700
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,240
situation

701
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,159
of deciding okay now decision is that

702
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,640
part where when if any security incident

703
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,960
happens in your organization

704
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,360
and you know like in your investigation

705
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,520
part like in your orientation part you

706
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,120
have done all the investigation you have

707
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,159
found out the

708
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,720
uh root cause like how a particular

709
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,080
security incident

710
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,919
happened and once after the

711
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,679
investigation now you have to take some

712
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:54,960
decision decision

713
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,039
and this decision here would be what

714
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,520
should be our plan of remediation okay

715
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,320
so if some systems are affected by an

716
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:02,960
attack

717
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,440
or they are in a situation where they

718
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,440
can be affected by an attack

719
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,520
what should we do should we remove those

720
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,279
systems from those networks

721
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,760
if we need to keep some information and

722
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,679
definitely in most of the situation it's

723
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,840
recommended do not switch off or plug

724
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,039
off those systems

725
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,880
so then what should we do what should be

726
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,400
the necessary actions should we place

727
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,520
some honeypot

728
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,279
should we segregate them from our

729
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,000
network and at this particular time we

730
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,720
have to look

731
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,120
at our organization's policies and

732
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,240
procedures okay

733
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,640
so we have to be aligned with all the

734
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,640
documentations policies and procedures

735
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,320
so that any action

736
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,520
which we are taking in response to a

737
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,640
attack situation it should not be

738
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,960
i would say uh it should not be anything

739
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,159
which is illegal

740
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,559
and we should be taking all the right

741
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:51,200
steps

742
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,760
so that there is a minimal business uh

743
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,120
disruption also

744
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,840
at this point we uh we like we are in a

745
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,679
situation we are consulting

746
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,279
like if we have consultants in our

747
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,679
organization so meetings happen we come

748
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:04,320
up with a

749
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,279
remediation plan incident response team

750
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:07,679
they

751
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,120
they come into picture at this

752
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,720
particular situation

753
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,279
that when we have like either we have an

754
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,600
in-house incident response team

755
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,120
or we uh actually hire some third-party

756
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,840
uh companies for performing incident

757
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,720
response

758
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,679
so like do we have an incident response

759
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,039
team in picture

760
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,120
or do we have an incident response

761
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,320
checklist

762
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,720
do we have everything ready in order to

763
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,840
take action

764
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,760
against this particular security

765
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,520
incident so all this

766
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,880
is done at the stage of the decision

767
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,559
which is decide

768
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,760
now our last stage

769
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,799
of act what does that mean so now

770
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,440
after all the analysis which we have

771
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,520
done in the orientation stage and when

772
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,080
we come up to the decision so decisions

773
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,840
involves a lot of actions like according

774
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,000
to company every organization is

775
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,720
different

776
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,240
and every organization might be affected

777
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,039
by a security attack in a different way

778
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,880
and all organized like different

779
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,480
organizations have different standards

780
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,080
and procedures which they follow

781
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,400
so based on that when they come up with

782
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,159
a remediation plan

783
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,440
now incident response team okay so

784
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,520
they are acting on it okay so what does

785
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,600
we do what do we do at this stage

786
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,840
first of all who like what whatever

787
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,480
systems were impacted by certain attack

788
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,360
we bring the we bring back we bring them

789
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,039
back to our normal functioning what does

790
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,320
that mean for example

791
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,559
if any malicious software was installed

792
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:37,840
in certain systems

793
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,799
so we'll clean them okay if we found out

794
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:41,279
that

795
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,520
during our investigation in our odin

796
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,440
phase if some of our systems

797
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,159
needed any kind of upgradation we will

798
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:48,559
be

799
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,200
uh doing an upgradation here as well so

800
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,159
acting is

801
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,360
when we are completely removing

802
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,320
our attacks like attack like threat uh

803
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:58,720
um

804
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,600
any like it's like whatever uh in

805
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,159
whatever

806
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,559
way okay uh our systems have been

807
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,480
impacted through any malicious files

808
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:06,880
okay

809
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,039
if certain ports were open then we need

810
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,799
to close certain ports through which

811
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,640
attack was happening so basically in

812
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,640
your orientation phase what you're doing

813
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,039
is

814
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,520
you are trying to identify investigate

815
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,720
and find out that

816
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
first of all what is the attack from

817
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,760
where it is coming

818
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,840
from where it is started in decision

819
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,880
phase you decide

820
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,799
you decide on what necessary actions we

821
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,360
can take and in the act stage whatever

822
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,039
decisions you have taken

823
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,919
you do you actually implement on them so

824
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,440
basically if you found out in your

825
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,120
investigation that certain

826
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,520
ports were open due to them some remote

827
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,440
code execution was being done

828
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,600
or somebody installed a phishing mail so

829
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,919
some malicious file was being installed

830
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,279
so whatever was impacting we we will

831
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,760
undo everything okay so we will be

832
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,039
cleaning our system

833
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,080
closing some ports permanently then

834
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,440
um then after that we'll be making sure

835
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,240
that um uh these systems are working

836
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,520
back normal so we will

837
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,520
we'll perform a validation also so in

838
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,960
validation we'll be performing

839
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,480
vulnerability assessment again for

840
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,120
example

841
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,240
if we took some necessary steps in order

842
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:12,960
to

843
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,440
remediate an attack so in the action

844
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,320
stage

845
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,399
we perform vulnerability scanning again

846
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,720
here so to check that whatever

847
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,880
uh we have done to make our system

848
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,039
secure affected system secures

849
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,200
do they still have some vulnerabilities

850
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,559
are we missing something

851
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,760
is there any gap so we identify them and

852
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,600
the action stage perform all the

853
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,640
validations

854
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,840
cleaning this is the stage where we do

855
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,240
some kind of lessons learned like for

856
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,840
example once we have

857
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,080
come out of an incident then we have

858
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,360
several meetings

859
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,520
meetings with the team where we identify

860
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,880
what was the gap

861
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,279
do we have sufficient security controls

862
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,679
do we need to create some additional

863
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:54,640
alerts

864
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,360
in our in our some real time tools okay

865
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,120
what kind of alerts should be there

866
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,880
what was the gap do we need more

867
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,320
professionals in our team

868
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,480
so these are the lessons learned then

869
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,320
secreting security trainings and

870
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,320
awareness so for example if certain

871
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,399
insecurity incident happened

872
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,919
due to negligence or lack of awareness

873
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,080
of certain employee then it becomes

874
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:16,960
nowadays

875
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,120
very important to train your employees

876
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,799
about common threats

877
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,799
so that they identify for example if

878
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,320
they receive a phishing mail they would

879
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,080
be able to identify it they will not

880
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,279
open such mails

881
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,760
so that becomes an important part so

882
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,559
basically

883
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,520
uder loop is like a continuous learning

884
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,000
loop

885
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,320
okay so whatever you have learned here

886
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,240
okay so whatever you have learned

887
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,520
in this whole process of remediating an

888
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,320
incident

889
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,880
you kind of improve yourself like what

890
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,799
are the things that we should not be

891
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,320
doing from the next time

892
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,480
do we need to increase our budget do we

893
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,440
need to

894
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,760
get some more tools like what are the

895
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,080
ways in order to protect our internal

896
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,640
network

897
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,120
more uh should we should we be

898
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,640
implementing some kind of active

899
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,360
defenses like installing honeypots

900
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,840
using some defenses where we are

901
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,919
installing honey active directories

902
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,919
so what what are the techniques we can

903
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,399
use for the next time to identify

904
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,159
these kinds of threats which we have

905
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,919
just gone through

906
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,080
uh in a very initial stage and we are

907
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,279
not again

908
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,080
the same victim of it so this is the act

909
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,039
stage

910
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,159
so basically as i mentioned

911
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,960
uder loops helps us in uh in kind of

912
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,679
building

913
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,320
a continuous intelligence pro like a

914
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,679
continuous intelligence

915
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,799
to our security uh program so here

916
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,600
see when we say threat hunting we are

917
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,679
basically focusing on three areas

918
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,200
okay so first of all first of all if we

919
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,399
are proactively trying to identify

920
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,080
threats in our environment

921
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,159
okay so first of all three things are

922
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,120
very important

923
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,760
situational awareness how much you know

924
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,760
your organ like how much you know

925
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,919
uh the environment of your organization

926
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,279
and it's not it's not about

927
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,720
no it's about knowing because every day

928
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,720
changes are occurring in our environment

929
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,360
so we

930
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,519
should be uh it's like we should be

931
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,600
updated with the situational changes

932
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,159
okay

933
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,880
then threat hunting again is based on

934
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,760
knowledge

935
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,880
okay so if i say we are trying to

936
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,960
proactively detect threats

937
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,919
somehow we are taking some advanced

938
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:24,960
knowledge

939
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,519
professionals who are in the domain of

940
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:28,960
cyber threat hunting

941
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,039
they are continuously in the process of

942
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,080
learning about

943
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,799
more advanced threats they are trying to

944
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,559
think from the point of view

945
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,039
what can be the possible tactic

946
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,880
techniques and procedures

947
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,279
which can be used by threat actors in

948
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,640
the coming future

949
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,200
this is one thing second thing is like

950
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,360
currently we have observed nonprofit

951
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,760
organizations like mitre attack org

952
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,919
which is the uh non-profit organization

953
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,480
which focus on identifying tactic

954
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,919
techniques and procedures

955
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,840
of some advanced level threats which are

956
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,519
known as apts

957
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,919
now how it like how we can leverage

958
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,760
these kinds of areas like these

959
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,840
organizations and information provided

960
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,720
by them

961
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,360
definitely if a certain organization

962
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:11,919
which is

963
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,720
similar to your organization or certain

964
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,440
threats which can which are common to

965
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,760
all types of organizations so basically

966
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,120
what we are trying to do is we are

967
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,799
trying to identify

968
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,799
tactics techniques and procedures about

969
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,880
the latest advanced threats

970
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,200
based on those tact those on those

971
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,960
techniques and procedures followed

972
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,399
followed by the attackers

973
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,720
we are trying to identify those patterns

974
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,840
in our environment

975
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,559
in our in our locks so basically what we

976
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:38,880
are

977
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,159
not able to do from our real time tools

978
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,080
using our knowledge using our

979
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,320
situational awareness and plus using

980
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,120
automation

981
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,120
automation and analytics it's very much

982
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,640
important but like it

983
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,000
it's very much important from the point

984
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,240
of view of detection so machine learning

985
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,120
algorithms

986
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,399
then uh including automation tools like

987
00:33:58,399 --> 00:33:58,720
we

988
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,360
currently we have security uh

989
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,519
orchestration automation and response

990
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:04,000
tools

991
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,080
so for example how these tools are

992
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,159
helping they are trying to reduce a lot

993
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,918
of manual effort so if something has

994
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,040
been alerted

995
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,560
in these sim tools so in like logs and

996
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,560
basically they are sent out to these so

997
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,320
tools these so tools are taking some

998
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,440
necessary actions on

999
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,159
investigating them so basically a lot of

1000
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,440
your manual effort

1001
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,800
is being uh i would say saved by using

1002
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,480
some automation and machine learning

1003
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,359
algorithms

1004
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,839
where we train like for example if you

1005
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:32,800
are using

1006
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,040
some machine learning uh algorithms i

1007
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,000
would say

1008
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,159
uh there are platforms like in splunk we

1009
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,679
have splunk qba

1010
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,960
so once you start using these tools

1011
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,280
in integration with your sim tools so

1012
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,639
what you're trying to do

1013
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,280
so and what a loop is trying to tell you

1014
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,560
that in order to be

1015
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,280
proactive okay in your approach of

1016
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,639
identifying threats

1017
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,399
so what what things you can include in

1018
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:57,839
your observe

1019
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,800
orient decide and act stage for example

1020
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,480
in the observed stage

1021
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,200
how you can include tools for real-time

1022
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:05,920
monitoring

1023
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,960
in orientation stage how you can include

1024
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,960
uh open source threat intelligence

1025
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,119
platforms how you can integrate

1026
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,520
them with your existing tools to help

1027
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,040
you identify

1028
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,440
threat patterns more easily then in your

1029
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,560
decision stage

1030
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,800
what can be the possible best decisions

1031
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,760
we can take

1032
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,920
based on the nature of the organizations

1033
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,000
and the environment of the organization

1034
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,880
plus again in your orientations uh stage

1035
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,119
using some automation tools which can

1036
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,520
provide i i'm not saying that automation

1037
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,480
tools will

1038
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,880
give you all the kind of analysis like

1039
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,880
for example if we are investigating if

1040
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,560
we are analyzing a threat

1041
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,720
using automation automated tools and

1042
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,160
they would be providing us hundred

1043
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:46,880
percent

1044
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,200
result no that's not possible for small

1045
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,720
threats they can do that

1046
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,119
but for complex threats they will

1047
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,119
actually perform a job for you like

1048
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,800
for example if you're doing hundred

1049
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,400
percent of work invest in an

1050
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,320
like kind of an investigating threats

1051
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,520
and analyzing them

1052
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,280
fifty percent work would be done by

1053
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,040
these thought tools for example

1054
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,320
if a alert has been generated uh

1055
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,960
for a firewall denial okay so for if a

1056
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,720
firewall is denying a packet for more

1057
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,400
than five times an alert is

1058
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,640
generated that is being sent to us so

1059
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,800
tool so that so tool will first of all

1060
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,800
identify what's the ip address

1061
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,280
on its own a lot of your manual effort

1062
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,320
can be

1063
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,960
uh i would say reduced by using store

1064
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,960
tools where we can write some workflows

1065
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,320
automated workflows

1066
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,880
and we can implement orchestration where

1067
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,560
a lot of manual efforts which you have

1068
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,480
to do in person like finding out what's

1069
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,160
an ip address is doing

1070
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,280
and some generic info like some generic

1071
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,119
information analysis which which we

1072
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,960
which we perform on logs

1073
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,040
as part of manual analysis can be done

1074
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,400
by automation

1075
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,320
and at the same time these automation

1076
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,520
tools can help you

1077
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,040
raise some automatic tickets like

1078
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,720
servicenow tickets if you want to raise

1079
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,240
some tickets and those tickets would be

1080
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,839
assigned to the incident response team

1081
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:58,960
for further action

1082
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,760
so a lot of your work can be reduced by

1083
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,599
using machine learning algorithms and

1084
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:04,720
automated tools

1085
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,119
and uder loop is actually actually

1086
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,240
telling you to do that

1087
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,119
like in first stage how to be more fast

1088
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,320
in detecting threats

1089
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,720
like in observing them what changes we

1090
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,400
can make in our environment so after

1091
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,480
acting upon a security incident

1092
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,240
where i mentioned where we discuss about

1093
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,760
the lesson learned and where we talk

1094
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,000
about

1095
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,079
the gaps so maybe the gaps can be that

1096
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,480
the organization didn't implemented

1097
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,880
or didn't implement automation yet so

1098
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,560
now they would be thinking to implement

1099
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,040
some kind of uh security or restoration

1100
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,599
and

1101
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,880
uh response tools then then include then

1102
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,240
after that including some machine

1103
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,800
learning algorithms in detection of some

1104
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,040
advanced threats using deep learning

1105
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,680
so all that can be done with the help of

1106
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,160
the

1107
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,000
uh practical methodology of ooda

1108
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,920
so we are done with the session

1109
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,240
so if you have any questions so

1110
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,440
definitely you can

1111
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,839
ask now you can reach out to me on my

1112
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:00,640
gmail id

1113
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,320
you can connect with me on linkedin and

1114
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,960

00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:19,839
any questions

1118
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,180
no questions

1119
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,480
[Music]

1120
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,000
okay i actually posted the discord

1121
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,240
in my if you guys want to join it is in

1122
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,560
the chat

1123
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,200
and uh i'll thank you very much for

1124
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,480
attending this meeting

1125
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,160
we this meeting will be uh uploaded

1126
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,119
to our youtube channel well somebody

1127
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:49,520
hasn't

1128
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,000
have a question

1129
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,720
okay what are some steps uh what are

1130
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,560
some tools tips i can take if i notice a

1131
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,040
domain

1132
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,720
here is same ad okay so we can use some

1133
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,320
open source threat intelligence tools

1134
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,079
which have some

1135
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,400
by default list of ip address which are

1136
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,440
malicious

1137
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,599
and for domain names for example we have

1138
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,440
a tool known as a website

1139
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,880
like software which is known as

1140
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,480
virustotal we can identify some

1141
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,960
malicious url hashes

1142
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,520
using virustotal can you suggest a few

1143
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,240
ways to

1144
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,000
stay current on the latest threats being

1145
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,280
used by attackers

1146
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,320
so definitely you can ref like there are

1147
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,160
many uh i would say um companies like

1148
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,320
i i just forget some some of the names

1149
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,640
which are very consistent in providing

1150
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,400
cyber news about various kinds of

1151
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,400
attacks and again linkedin is a good way

1152
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,079
like if you are connected to all the

1153
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,280
cyber professionals

1154
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,560
and you connect with them on linkedin so

1155
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,560
that's the uh stage like that's the

1156
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,720
point where a lot of us are sharing news

1157
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,320
like the latest i saw was

1158
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,720
an uh ransomware attack on a coffee

1159
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,839
machine

1160
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:03,440
so that that was very weird and that was

1161
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,480
very insightful so i can share like some

1162
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,040
of the

1163
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,599
news articles which are like with which

1164
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,000
are definitely riding on cyber only

1165
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,960
i can share that on linkedin so and i'm

1166
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,520
discord as well so i will do that

1167
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,280
and dave has a question that what is the

1168
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,280
difference between orient and decide

1169
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,079
so dave actually in orient see if you

1170
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,280
identify

1171
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,319
some abnormal pattern it can be a net

1172
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,800
it can be an abnormal network traffic it

1173
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,680
can be

1174
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,520
some kind of anomaly in your application

1175
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,359
or it can be some kind of anomaly in

1176
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:38,720
your system through logs

1177
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,359
so if you identify something abnormal

1178
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:41,839
then

1179
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,720
it's like like in the observation phase

1180
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,480
basically what we are trying to do is we

1181
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,520
are first trying to identify if

1182
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,599
something is wrong right or wrong okay

1183
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,160
then once you observe something then you

1184
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,480
go to the orientations orient means you

1185
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,280
are

1186
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,960
like you're actually moving your

1187
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,200
direction okay you're directing yourself

1188
00:40:59,200 --> 00:40:59,680
in

1189
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,720
in that particular uh direction okay so

1190
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,280
it's like

1191
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,880
once you observe something now you're

1192
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,040
looking into that direction into more

1193
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,680
detail

1194
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,520
so orient means where if you find

1195
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,880
something abnormal

1196
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,119
then you try to uh dig deep down

1197
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,560
basically investigate

1198
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,800
now in the investigation phase we would

1199
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,560
be including

1200
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,800
like net intelligence platforms so for

1201
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,680
example if i

1202
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,160
if i think a particular pa a particular

1203
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:24,800
log

1204
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,359
has some kind of malicious url or a file

1205
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,800
hash or an ip address

1206
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,040
so definitely here at this stage i would

1207
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,200
be doing a deep dive investigation in

1208
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,319
order to find out

1209
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:36,319
if whatever i have observed and i'm

1210
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,000
thinking is right or wrong

1211
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,240
okay so investigation is not only about

1212
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,000
finding out what are the root causes of

1213
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,920
an attack but always to find out if it

1214
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,040
is a false pause

1215
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,160
if it's a false uh false it's a false

1216
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,240
positive or not so false positive means

1217
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,040
if if some uh alert or some of your

1218
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,319
observation you think

1219
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,599
you identify is malicious or if you feel

1220
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,280
that it's it can be related to a

1221
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,680
cyber security incident or it can be

1222
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,520
initial stage of an attack

1223
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,400
where you just observe it and you are

1224
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,319
you are using your intuition

1225
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,319
and your knowledge your situational

1226
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,599
awareness about the

1227
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,680
environment of your organization you

1228
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,680
observe something and in the orientation

1229
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,280
phase you are performing deep dive

1230
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,720
investigation

1231
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,880
so that's orientation and in decision

1232
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,560
once you have identified

1233
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,200
what's happening then you necessary

1234
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,359
decision like each organization as i

1235
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:28,640
mentioned is different

1236
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,280
so what's the best decision plan for you

1237
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:31,920
okay

1238
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,319
what should we do with the systems which

1239
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,240
are already been affected

1240
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,319
should we remove them should we clean

1241
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:39,760
them what get what are the possible

1242
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,720
situation

1243
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,960
of according like what's up what are

1244
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,720
what's our current situation

1245
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,720
okay if we are in a in a situation of

1246
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,920
attack so

1247
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,440
what are the possible actions we can

1248
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,359
take what's the road to be taken which

1249
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:51,760
is

1250
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,160
not only best for remediation but for

1251
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,640
the company's reputation and business as

1252
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,040
well

1253
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,400
so that's the decision part

1254
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,400
yeah i do have some books with me as

1255
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,720
well on cyber threat hunting guide

1256
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,599
so i can share that as well

1257
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,160
okay so is it correct to say that oreo

1258
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,920
is focused observation

1259
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,680
see orientation see orientation is based

1260
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,599
on observation it is depending or

1261
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,359
dependent on observation

1262
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:28,000
if you are not configuring your tools

1263
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:28,800
properly

1264
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,520
for monitoring definitely your

1265
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,440
orientation can also be wrong

1266
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,920
okay you can be missing something but

1267
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,760
you can be guessing something right as

1268
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,160
well

1269
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,960
so basically the major i would say the

1270
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,040
major stage where we have to be very

1271
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,280
cautious is the observation stage

1272
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,599
it all depends on our observation if we

1273
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:49,520
are configuring our tools right

1274
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,599
then definitely our observation will

1275
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,119
like our observation will be right and

1276
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,480
our orientation will also be right

1277
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,400
so orientation is like a direction which

1278
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,720
we take if you like for example if in a

1279
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,640
sky you're looking for a bird okay

1280
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,960
and you and you start observing it and

1281
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,640
then you orient yourself in the

1282
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,560
direction of the birds movement

1283
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,279
so it's like that

1284
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,960
i was also going to say that we do have

1285
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,040
a thread intel channel

1286
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,160
in a discord in a slack and uh

1287
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,200
it's basically like a crowd source

1288
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,560
um a channel where

1289
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,800
members post things that they believe

1290
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,440
they're relevant

1291
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,839
any other questions

1292
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:47,759
