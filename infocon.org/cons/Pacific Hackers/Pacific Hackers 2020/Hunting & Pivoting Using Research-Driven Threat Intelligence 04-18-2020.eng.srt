1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,040
a kind reminder to meet yourself we're

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,490
gonna open space for questions

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,740
where I let it I like the percent to

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,809
decide that but try to meet yourself so

5
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:13,730
you don't interrupt the the rest of the

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,759
meeting thank you for being here this

7
00:00:16,759 --> 00:00:20,419
will be recorded and it will be a place

8
00:00:20,419 --> 00:00:25,730
in the Pacific hackers YouTube page as

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,749
we all know and we always begin the the

10
00:00:29,749 --> 00:00:33,829
meetings with a little bit of odd if I'm

11
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:36,230
not sure I hope all of you guys are

12
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,760
doing well and staying safe based on

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,120
what we've been gauging I guess on the

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,469
situation it hasn't been really big lair

15
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:54,769
now if you where layoffs request access

16
00:00:54,769 --> 00:00:57,260
to slack there's tons

17
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,859
I repeat tones a remote work there's

18
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:03,949
lots of work so if you're working in

19
00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:06,860
full sec and you were laid off we could

20
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,290
probably help you again join our slack

21
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:14,300
if you send me an email info be hack org

22
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,930
i will add you to our slack channel

23
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,360
which you said the percent - 27 slack

24
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,210
calm and we have multiple channels there

25
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,560
one of them is the current disaster

26
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,970
which there's a lot of chatter a lot of

27
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:31,040
what's going on and we have job postings

28
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,820
or body training we have multiple

29
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,480
resources that can be used for your

30
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,340
advantage so recapping a little bit

31
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,680
unfortunate we have to cancel the Bay

32
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,230
Area CPF which was going to happen in

33
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,340
Santa Cruz Santa Cruz's

34
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,460
I read it was a reopening their beaches

35
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:56,480
and it looks like there's hope that we

36
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,030
will start reopening soon we will

37
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,290
continue doing these meetings online

38
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:06,680
until we think is safe to go back I will

39
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,899
communicate with the with the library or

40
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:13,160
Marco and and we'll make a decision

41
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:20,720
be careful not and you know not to make

42
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,360
a mistake you know looking back or at

43
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,840
least some of you we want to RSA and

44
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,270
then we saw people getting it from our

45
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,960
city so we want to be careful once we

46
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,130
start the process or coming back

47
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,790
hopefully this will happen I I think

48
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:42,680
somewhere between maybe June July or

49
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,020
even earlier but as of now that's that's

50
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,790
how it looks like

51
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,940
other than that Markel you were say

52
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:54,140
something yeah you say reminder for

53
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,470
everyone to meet yourselves and also for

54
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,440
Paul do you one I'll keep monitoring the

55
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,470
the chat for questions do you want

56
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,690
people to ask the question directly or

57
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,970
do you want me to want breathing the

58
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:12,530
questions I'm sorry the options were

59
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,090
asked the questions are equity or you

60
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,520
are going to you yeah so the people can

61
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,680
ask the quit interruptin and ask the

62
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,810
questions directly or do you want to

63
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,870
call the questions for at the end how do

64
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,960
you want to do it well we could try

65
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,530
interrupting if there's if it turns out

66
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,570
to be a lot maybe we can just start

67
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,940
holding at that point for the end is I'm

68
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,440
going to demo a fair number of things so

69
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,920
then I can have her questions I'd say

70
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,510
how we could try with the interruptions

71
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,340
everybody this is Paul and he is with

72
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,700

hosting this everyone see my screen

81
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,870
I guess just one person needs to respond

82
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:24,970
I have a slide up cool great so yeah so

83
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,650
thanks for inviting me

84
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,130
so today we're going to talk about

85
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,930
hunting and pivoting using

86
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,940
research-driven threat intelligence on

87
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,940
the poly scoring platform so if you've

88
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,260
never heard of poly swarm but you've

89
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,840
heard of virustotal you already have a

90
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,250
pretty good idea of what poly songs

91
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,699
about virustotal obviously you can

92
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:48,100
upload a file as you can scan it search

93
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,760
for hashes you can do you know some

94
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,289
searches as well and we're going to show

95
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:55,000
you how to use some of those features on

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,050
polished chrome today and hunt for

97
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,240
emergence new and emerging threats and

98
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,889
find samples that you're not able to

99
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:06,160
find elsewhere and critically as part of

100
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,080
this and one of the reasons why you know

101
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,449
I'm really excited to present this

102
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:13,449
everybody here is we have free accounts

103
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:16,180
and those free accounts allow you to do

104
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,090
everything that I'm going to demo today

105
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,400
with one exception and I will I will

106
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,780
note that when I get to it

107
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,340
but yeah so it's great to speak with you

108
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,810
all unfortunately I haven't been able to

109
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,419
meet with you in person but you know

110
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:33,310
maybe June or July timeframe I can meet

111
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,550
you all in person so a little bit about

112
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,280
my background before we get started you

113
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,900
may have seen the me link I go my starts

114
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,380
kind of in burner ability analysis

115
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,400
Brianna reverse-engineering

116
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,710
I worked for the Department of Defense

117
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:54,010
for a few years left and then I worked

118
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,080
for a contractor that primarily did work

119
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,430
for the u.s. government and fortune 100

120
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:04,090
companies and then myself and other

121
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,250
members of this contractor called mark

122
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,460
industries as created police worm

123
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,150
co-founded college swarm as a way to

124
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,840
bridge the economic gap I mean everyone

125
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,520
that's doing really cool stuff in the

126
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,610
malware detection space as individuals

127
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,370
and small information security companies

128
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,310
and the large kind of anti-malware

129
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,340
antivirus enterprises right so what we

130
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,500
wanted to do is we built we built Polly

131
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,900
swarm to allow to an equal market access

132
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,210
for those that would otherwise be

133
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:41,200
published in UNIX or some academic venue

134
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,229
and go sit on a shelf on github forever

135
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:47,380
and not actually help anybody

136
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,050
so we wanted to provide a way for people

137
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:55,810
to make money and also improve their

138
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,870
their skills and test out their mouth or

139
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:02,340
detection ideas on real address traffic

140
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,530
all right so here we go so I have a

141
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:09,250
little agenda here first time it you

142
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,990
know I kind of went through the intro a

143
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,310
little bit I'm gonna tell you about poly

144
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,560
axe in a moment here and we'll speak a

145
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,520
little bit about how poly swarm works

146
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,680
and then we'll get into the meat of the

147
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,930
conversation which is we're gonna take a

148
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,719
look at some recent headlines

149
00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:27,700
some blog posts by the likes of Trend

150
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:32,020
Micro and look out on ZDNet and take a

151
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,000
look at some malware that they published

152
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,760
about well during that malware August 1

153
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,659
and then pivot using attributes of that

154
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:42,639
malware to find additional malware it

155
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,310
wasn't even published in this article

156
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:48,010
so again anybody that's a you know it's

157
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,380
listening today or you know anybody

158
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,690
anybody anywhere and create a free

159
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,070
account and do everything that I'm doing

160
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:57,520
today and you but very quickly as

161
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,909
something to publish and of yourself you

162
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:02,650
know beyond what these these headlines

163
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,740
are showing after that I'm going to dive

164
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,479
a little bit deeper into what we call

165
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:10,659
metadata searching the way that this

166
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:13,479
works is when a file is uploaded to

167
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:15,969
Polly swarm we run a lot of different

168
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:19,389
static analyzers on that file and which

169
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:22,210
analyzers are run are dependent on the

170
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,700
type of file but in the case of for

171
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,490
example Windows peas will extract things

172
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:30,909
like what's ideal Wells does it import

173
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:33,549
what functions does an export and all of

174
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:35,409
those attributes about the particulars

175
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:38,620
file become searchable in an elastic

176
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,099
search cluster that we have so very very

177
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:44,049
rapid and you can form really complex

178
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:46,360
queries the links of which are show me

179
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,670
below all the windows executables that

180
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:51,280
you've gotten from the last week that

181
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,940
were detected as malicious that export

182
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,050
this regular expression of functions vs.

183
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,520
so it's quite flexible and I'll dive

184
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,920
into that a little bit as well and then

185
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,690
then we'll wrap up and do some Q&A

186
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,339
before we do any of that I want you to

187
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:11,800
learn everybody let's do this community

188
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,220
that we have only acts so we have this

189
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,319
it's a it's a slack group and it's a

190
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:20,290
little bit more where if you joining

191
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,630
public X and all you have to do is load

192
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,270
up boys from Dino slash poly X those who

193
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,819
you are and you get a free upgrade it

194
00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:31,150
accounts on Polly's for free accounts

195
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:34,470
even without the upgrade can do

196
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,819
everything I'm going to show today but

197
00:09:36,819 --> 00:09:38,110
with the upgrade you get double the

198
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,110
number of $3 so if you are interested in

199
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,829
finding now we're reverse engineering it

200
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:46,449
and you know improving your skills in

201
00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:49,089
that area we'd love to have you as part

202
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,720
of the community okay so you know what

203
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,329
we get out of it is potentially some

204
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:58,120
people are interested in taking their

205
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,740
malware detection ideas and building an

206
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:04,300
engine out right so unlike virustotal

207
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,880
makes it really easy for people to plug

208
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,440
in their own engines into the

209
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,680
marketplace and by doing so you get

210
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,150
access to all the samples that are being

211
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:16,930
submitted so we have documentation we

212
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,130
have you know

213
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,620
profiles we we try to make it as simple

214
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,410
as possible to get started and if

215
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,860
anybody has any interest in essentially

216
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,230
detecting some malware with bias a new

217
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,810
idea I would be great to hear from you

218
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,100
and it would be great to support you in

219
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,300
that we have some we have some big names

220
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,520
in this community as well we have the

221
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,640
head of anti network from Google Play we

222
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,069
have they have innovation at 7:01 we

223
00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:46,569
have a bunch of people from his first CD

224
00:10:46,569 --> 00:10:50,800
a vast ISA Ernst and Young and probably

225
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,240
a you know if you're in the

226
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,360
tracking outdoor space you're probably

227
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,440
you're probably following a lot of the

228
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,910
people on Twitter they're in this

229
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,940
community so we have about 400 members

230
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,070
right now it's cranberry language they'd

231
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:09,650
be great to have everybody here is Tom

232
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,480
before I kind of show you do some of the

233
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,890
how polish won't work so I want to talk

234
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:19,770
a little bit about the host I believe I

235
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,320
noticed that SAP and then top right I

236
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,720
think you can meet everybody if if you

237
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,020
want to do like me hopefully don't let

238
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:33,690
me in so okay so how Polly swarm work so

239
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:37,740
there are a few things different from

240
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,320
what we're doing compared to with the

241
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,150
likes of iris total drop squad or

242
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,670
reversing labs are going and one of the

243
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,300
core pieces is we actually incentivize

244
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,230
engines to ooh

245
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,840
can anybody else see these slots anybody

246
00:11:54,840 --> 00:12:00,870
having trouble seeing slots can see this

247
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,240
light okay somebody mentioned they

248
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,410
couldn't so so yeah so a big

249
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:08,670
differentiator is we actually

250
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:12,630
financially compensate engines for low

251
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,550
false positive and false negative rate

252
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,770
so engines that perform better in the

253
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,720
sense that they accurately detect

254
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,370
whether or not a file as malicious

255
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,490
number nine stands to gain more profit

256
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:28,890
than engines that maybe fell behind on a

257
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,170
particular file right so what we're

258
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,550
trying to include with this is

259
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,170
particularly by reaching out to you

260
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,720
small engine providers small companies

261
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,970
and even individuals interested won't

262
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,350
lean engines is they'll bring something

263
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,020
unique to the table you know we have

264
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,690
people that's for example we have an

265
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,160
engine and I'm going to highlight a few

266
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,730
here they only take a look at PDFs

267
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,370
Microsoft Office documents and then they

268
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,110
try to detect mal-intent inside

269
00:12:55,110 --> 00:13:01,350
JavaScript and macros in respectively in

270
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,940
those documents but that's all they take

271
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,470
a look at great they're not interested

272
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,680
in becoming a

273
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,899
Eric sort of antivirus product they have

274
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:10,130
their nature they have what they're

275
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,480
interested in and they do a really good

276
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,959
job at tackling that so that's one big

277
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,440
difference we do have large antivirus

278
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,660
companies of order but we also have

279
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,970
smaller individual security experts

280
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,070
bringing something unique on the fringe

281
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,399
of what traditionally it's detected by

282
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:31,040
anti-malware products it's a continuing

283
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,709
on here another big difference is we

284
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:36,139
actually we create statistical models in

285
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:38,449
terms of how engines have performed in

286
00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:42,079
the past against similar files so if you

287
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,699
upload something of our soul today you

288
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:45,800
might get 60 to 70 different responses

289
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,440
for engines let's say 15 of them sent

290
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,500
malicious and read the rest of the nine

291
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,250
okay what do you do with that

292
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,839
information you now need to make a

293
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,079
decision based on it so polysporin helps

294
00:13:57,079 --> 00:13:59,779
make that decision for you we track how

295
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:01,670
mentions are performed against various

296
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,250
different verticals in terms of outside

297
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,070
or in terms of but that's five tips what

298
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,470
we're doing right now but in the future

299
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:11,510
things like you know malware family and

300
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:15,500
things like that so we we actually

301
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,990
maintain this model and when you get

302
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,760
results not only do you get results from

303
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,130
what the engine set but it's you get a

304
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,870
what we call a poly score which is

305
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,760
distillation of all the engine results

306
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,360
into a single value between zero and one

307
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,170
that it where zero is benign whom one is

308
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:35,720
totally malicious so I'll show that a

309
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,260
little later too

310
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:42,500
okay any questions on that so far

311
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,910
otherwise I'm going to jump into the

312
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,519
meat of this right now okay I see a

313
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,230
question and that's a question we get

314
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,240
often how do you establish ground truth

315
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,190
in terms of UI right it's a great

316
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:52,760
question

317
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,199
so what I've spoken about so far is

318
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:58,430
engines on the platform and engines

319
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,920
anybody can write anybody forget we also

320
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,720
have a class participants on the market

321
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,380
place called arbiters and arbiters are

322
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,139
already established companies we have

323
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:11,660
some large names already on the platform

324
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,630
that we haven't announced yet

325
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,370
that are helping us with our readership

326
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:20,240
but what we're what we're doing is well

327
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,860
so what we observed in the marketplace

328
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,900
or in the industry in general is it

329
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,140
takes about two weeks before the entire

330
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,660
antivirus industry to agree that's a

331
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,300
particularly

332
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,840
set of files malware family is malicious

333
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,220
you know somebody might detect it first

334
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,960
publish a blog post get that marketing

335
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,080
bump it might take on the order of about

336
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,820
two weeks before the industry as a whole

337
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:47,360
is second unit what we do is while

338
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,190
engines need to respond on the order of

339
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:52,430
seconds to scan files because people

340
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,140
need to make decisions based on what to

341
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,300
do with these files arbiters actually

342
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,350
have weeks to return a verdict and what

343
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,780
that allows for is that allows one

344
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:06,500
deeper analyses one of the arbiters upon

345
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,990
poly swarm is developed by the lead

346
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,970
developers behind cuckoo sandbox for

347
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,880
example they got their own company

348
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,770
called hatching they have a product

349
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:18,140
called triage that's kind of an

350
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,830
evolution of cuckoo sandbox and that are

351
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,690
using that on our back end is one of the

352
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,210
arbiters so they can actually detonate

353
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,730
files and go through the full execution

354
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,280
where as engines need to do something

355
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,770
that fits within you know several second

356
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:36,800
time window so we're we're partnering

357
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,540
with you know well-established people in

358
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,570
space and giving them a bunch of time to

359
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:45,710
come up with a better answer that's not

360
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,940
perfect but that's what we have right

361
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,270
now where we're going from is we are

362
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:53,360
going to dynamically select orders based

363
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,290
on the particular file in question so

364
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:59,840
for example Caleb Fenton the head of

365
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,740
innovation at 7:01 in his free time is

366
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,500
writing an Android banking Trojan in

367
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,829
detecting Polly swarm engine right and

368
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,810
he's really good at detecting Android

369
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:15,800
banking presents no surprise so you know

370
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,930
if he continues to perform if his engine

371
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,540
continues really well in the future if

372
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,880
an Android application comes through

373
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,829
perhaps his engine is show

374
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:27,740
dynamically as the arbiter for that

375
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,450
engine and I got another okay cool

376
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,950
answer it got another question how do

377
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,919
you apply to become an engine I can go

378
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:38,120
over that a little bit later you

379
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,179
actually don't need to apply anybody can

380
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:42,890
build an engine I encourage you to check

381
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:46,370
out Doc's Poli swarmed at i/o that's

382
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,690
where you can get started under the

383
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:52,549
suppliers tab but you know we're happy

384
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:54,220
to have anybody and everybody on board

385
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,740
and you get access to files and you can

386
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,510
test out your ideas against real

387
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:02,899
enterprise files so big difference there

388
00:18:02,899 --> 00:18:07,630
relative to other brands and platforms

389
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:13,639
okay so let me get out of this all right

390
00:18:13,639 --> 00:18:17,950
okay so now we're going to go hunting

391
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:21,350
all right so I have a few little stories

392
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:29,990
here rather before I do that let me just

393
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,360
show you real quick so you may have seen

394
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,840
police worm die at home always wormed on

395
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,720
Io it's really just our marketing site

396
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,179
the meat of what we're doing is on in

397
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:42,889
the application itself is on polished

398
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:45,019
more about network so anybody can go

399
00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:46,309
here right now and it looks like the

400
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:48,200
bottom of my screen cut off for some

401
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:54,139
reason let me do this that's looking

402
00:18:54,139 --> 00:19:00,200
better let me try this one more time so

403
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,519
I'm always for that network you'll see

404
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:03,649
on the front page we have this new

405
00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:05,840
feature that we call merging threats

406
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,419
under the discover header where you can

407
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:11,690
see it's some examples of the benoît

408
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:14,179
that's recently in the news some kovat

409
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:17,029
19 related samples these are things that

410
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:19,100
are being pushed to people in turn with

411
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,289
phishing emails and web pages I

412
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:23,690
mentioned you know coronavirus trying to

413
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,880
get people to install these things we

414
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,500
know when we have it before other

415
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,309
vendors so that's you know interesting

416
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:32,750
zoom related malware and we're going to

417
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,399
be hunting a lot of these so I'm going

418
00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:35,740
to come back to this later

419
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:39,940
trick bottom Imhotep this this interface

420
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,830
right here you can drag it drop a file

421
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,290
you insert the hash I'm just going to

422
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,460
blow through this real quick because

423
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,140
we're gonna go through specific examples

424
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:50,559
a little bit and again and particularly

425
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,570
for anybody who joined late all this is

426
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,700
free so we'd love to have you on board

427
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,280
searching things everything I'm gonna

428
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,830
show you here with the one exception of

429
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:03,429
the are based on time is great so going

430
00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:05,440
over here we can search for hashes we're

431
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,030
going to do a lot of metadata searching

432
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:10,360
here and I'll show you hunting later and

433
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,590
you can see the current engines on the

434
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:18,280
platform over here so I wanted to

435
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,990
highlight I kind of highlighted it

436
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,920
already

437
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,430
but to highlight another infants that

438
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,650
kind of provide some unique insight here

439
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:30,740
we have something called consider the

440
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,050
risks which is actually a company that

441
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,510
sells risk metrics to cyber insurance

442
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:39,620
companies and part of where they derive

443
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,600
their intelligence is a track or two

444
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,170
currency addresses used for ransomware

445
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:48,140
payments for example so they actually

446
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,940
have like you know large graph database

447
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,340
of you know various block chains and

448
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,340
they can see when funds move into and

449
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,960
they have you know some heuristics for

450
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,110
what appears to be a malicious address

451
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,000
or where like you know the games from

452
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,030
ransomware are going so they have an

453
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,770
engine on poly swarm and what that

454
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:09,110
engine does is when a file comes through

455
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:12,320
they check that file for any of their

456
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,440
known bad you know ransomware sort of

457
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,840
cryptocurrency addresses and if it

458
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,880
appears in the file that's a pretty good

459
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,950
indication that that file isn't lifted

460
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,350
specifically ransomware comes that's

461
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,720
that's kind of a unique aspect and then

462
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,790
I I mentioned before although I didn't

463
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,090
name it

464
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:32,360
iris h is the one that takes to look at

465
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,330
pdfs and Microsoft Office files they

466
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:38,000
actually detected some previously

467
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,490
unknown malware inside of a Microsoft

468
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:43,730
Excel file four days before anybody else

469
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:46,460
I'm Holly swarm did and then it took

470
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,410
another three days before that I file a

471
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,510
Burin Barkus total so there's about a

472
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,570
week lead time and then I mentioned kill

473
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:57,410
offense in this building and engine

474
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:00,400
called Android judge that looks for

475
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:06,280
Android banking charges okay so let's

476
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,990
let's dive into let's go to this vlog

477
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:20,110
here real quick alright so just a few

478
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:22,870
days ago yeah just a few days ago three

479
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,300
days ago

480
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,590
look I'll publish this blog post about

481
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,750
nation state no malware targeting

482
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:33,160
Syrians with koban 19 lures so they

483
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,290
attributed this campaign to the Syrian

484
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:40,090
electronic army this campaign seems to

485
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:43,780
be active since the beginning the start

486
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,420
of January 2018 so only recently did

487
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,940
they start a dot adapting Kovac nineteen

488
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,950
wars to spread this malware but this

489
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:53,140
malware family has been around since

490
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,780
that long none of the apps were in

491
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,370
Google Play Store so they're probably

492
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:00,310
installed by third-party app stores or

493
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:03,310
directly in a large portion of the

494
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,670
malicious applications are spying out

495
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:08,830
samples so let's scroll through here a

496
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,750
little bit we're kind of picking out

497
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,520
some of the key details in this blog

498
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:17,740
post and the malware actually drops a

499
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,020
fake app that allegedly takes your

500
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,430
temperature through your phone screen

501
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:26,260
when you put your finger on your phone I

502
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,880
don't know I guess that tricks some

503
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,740
people so yeah so if we scroll down to

504
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,960
the bottom so this is a great example

505
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:39,220
you know a malware company publishing a

506
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,960
blog post you know getting that

507
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,170
marketing bump and you know sharing with

508
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,780
world what they found helping other

509
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,540
people detect these malicious apps if we

510
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,300
scroll down to the bottom you do here's

511
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,060
the here's the fingerprint read your

512
00:23:55,060 --> 00:24:00,670
temperature 35 degrees Celsius that's

513
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:03,000
probably

514
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,750
scrolling down here did you do okay so

515
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,750
at the bottom they list a bunch of sha-1

516
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:15,640
hashes of of applications that they

517
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,210
observed at

518
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:21,590
part of this campaign right so let's

519
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,990
take the very first hash in this list

520
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:31,940
and let's go to ballet smart and let's

521
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,580
search it

522
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:38,510
hey we have it so and a lot of the

523
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,120
engines identified it has Spiner I'm

524
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,919
going to show you what this looks like

525
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:46,100
both by the webinar face CLI I mentioned

526
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,140
earlier about poly score that's not

527
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,179
currently on the web UI a little will be

528
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:53,000
soon but you're going to let me just

529
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,070
show you real quick if you search the

530
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:58,309
same thing on the CLI you'd be able to

531
00:24:58,309 --> 00:25:03,559
see it applies for now let me increase

532
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:15,040
my font size certainly it's a poly score

533
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:19,360
of 0.9 nine nine nine nine so we're

534
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,620
quite sure it's malicious you know I'll

535
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,280
show some more command line stuff later

536
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,780
what we can do here is we sort of see

537
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,710
Sean lon

538
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:32,110
we found it we can download the file now

539
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:35,170
again even for us can download files and

540
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:36,850
if you join Paul they actually get

541
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:39,780
double the number of downloads for free

542
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:43,090
so but another thing I want to show is

543
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:45,850
this final details tab so this is what

544
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:48,610
engines thought about the file but as I

545
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:51,040
mentioned before we have a lot of

546
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,410
different static analyzers that run on

547
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:56,590
files as a guest so we look for things

548
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,990
like strings that look like domains

549
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,820
where strings that look like your else

550
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:06,190
and then we also have or not just

551
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,680
the cryptographic hashes but also fuzzy

552
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:12,460
hatches like SS deep and TLS H now this

553
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,530
is actually because this is an Android

554
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,030
application it's actually detected us

555
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:20,290
archive because apks or zips so we're

556
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:22,030
not looking so much in the Pacific yet

557
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:25,690
I'll show you a Windows executable where

558
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:28,230
this is just pages of results later on

559
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,430
but I wanted to show you some of these

560
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:35,160
URL like extracted so if we go back to

561
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:39,400
this blog post one of the things I

562
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:49,300
mentioned it's in red values one of the

563
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,029
things I mentioned

564
00:26:50,029 --> 00:26:52,099
all applications in this campaign were

565
00:26:52,099 --> 00:26:53,539
completely scrubbed of sensitive

566
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:55,309
information when they are created a

567
00:26:55,309 --> 00:26:56,869
large portion of the malicious

568
00:26:56,869 --> 00:26:58,489
application goes find out samples which

569
00:26:58,489 --> 00:27:01,519
store situ information along with user

570
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,049
inputted names version numbers and other

571
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:07,429
information Reds values strings okay

572
00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:11,239
cool so we have we just searched the

573
00:27:11,239 --> 00:27:13,489
first shot one on that and we have it so

574
00:27:13,489 --> 00:27:17,599
let's download it okay I've downloaded

575
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:21,499
it let's do I'm just going to call this

576
00:27:21,499 --> 00:27:25,940
spy note copy this for my downloads

577
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:32,029
folder let's make it and an apk because

578
00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:36,799
apk to a little X anymore okay

579
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,960
so let's pull this apart using apktool

580
00:27:43,509 --> 00:27:46,399
blends of the original source code and a

581
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,769
directory structure before packaging at

582
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:49,869
an android application

583
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:53,019
so we produce a folder named after the

584
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:55,909
name of the APK so let's take a look at

585
00:27:55,909 --> 00:28:03,379
register values strings just like they

586
00:28:03,379 --> 00:28:07,940
said in the in the blog and we don't

587
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:11,299
really know what each of these keys mean

588
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:15,649
necessarily mt ben is a embedded jar

589
00:28:15,649 --> 00:28:17,539
they mentioned this in the blog post as

590
00:28:17,539 --> 00:28:19,609
well within the application that's

591
00:28:19,609 --> 00:28:22,039
obvious gated a little bit more but we

592
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:24,259
can see in clear text what the values

593
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:26,749
are they go along with these keys so if

594
00:28:26,749 --> 00:28:29,389
you take a look right here that looks

595
00:28:29,389 --> 00:28:32,929
like an IP address this this offset

596
00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:36,229
within mt pin is probably the c to

597
00:28:36,229 --> 00:28:39,139
address argument so we have this IP

598
00:28:39,139 --> 00:28:44,749
address here 80 2.13 7.2 185 185 they

599
00:28:44,749 --> 00:28:47,239
did not publish this as part of the blog

600
00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:49,759
post lookup and publishes this IP

601
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:54,379
address so let's copy this now we're

602
00:28:54,379 --> 00:28:56,450
going to we're going to ask Polly swarm

603
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:59,320
to find

604
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:04,160
so yeah before we do that let's check

605
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,840
our let's check our assumptions here

606
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:18,280
okay yes who is this IP address Syrian

607
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:23,320
telecommunication est located and

608
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:32,050
you

609
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:56,460
of these results I did at home work

610
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:01,270
before this presentation 23 of them were

611
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:06,430
not included in lookouts IOC lists so if

612
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,650
you were to do this exact same thing you

613
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:09,880
would already have something to tweet

614
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,660
about something to show the world this

615
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:18,400
is malicious Android application same C

616
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,680
to address so 23 of them were not to

617
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,530
look out I Oh see list and find those

618
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,180
that were not to look at is you list

619
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:30,010
also are not on virus football that's

620
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:35,410
pretty great and as part of this let me

621
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:37,510
just pull up another one again you can

622
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:40,360
kind of take a look at the file details

623
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:44,080
here and under the final details

624
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,770
oh here's ipv4 like strings thankfully

625
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:50,110
even though it's inside of a zip

626
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:54,310
I guess ipv4 type strings don't compress

627
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,390
very well with the deflate algorithm so

628
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:00,130
this this strings utility it's literally

629
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,770
us running strings we're incorporating

630
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:05,860
additional static and others like blares

631
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:12,910
flocks for G aqua skating yeah so for D

632
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,550
obfuscating strings inside of files and

633
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,860
again thankfully you know we have

634
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,810
actually peer inside the zip that's just

635
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:23,650
appeared by strings so if it had not

636
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:26,170
appeared just by running strings there's

637
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:27,700
probably a lot more examples on here

638
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,680
that we're just not finding by searching

639
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,650
for string output that matches this IP

640
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:38,950
address so any questions on this

641
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:58,240
particular example moving on here Syria

642
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,320
didn't want to be a loan in there go bid

643
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,760
nineteen related malware Android now

644
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,240
let's take a look at

645
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:11,559
this article is on ZDNet so Iran

646
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:15,549
published an official coded 19 detection

647
00:32:15,549 --> 00:32:16,450
app called

648
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:19,480
AC 19 and it was in the Google Play

649
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,520
Store for Abed Google removed it and

650
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,659
people believed because it had some

651
00:32:25,659 --> 00:32:28,720
misleading description about it in terms

652
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,590
of it can detect coded 19 which you

653
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:38,830
can't scan but it also tracks whoever

654
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:42,220
installs it in real time and this app

655
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,960
will it's still available if you want to

656
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,179
take a look at it the latest version is

657
00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:50,830
at AC 19 are so although it's not on the

658
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,450
Google Play Store anymore

659
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:55,510
a lot of antivirus engines anti-malware

660
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,649
engines are identifying this as

661
00:32:56,649 --> 00:32:58,630
malicious because it is something that

662
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:00,789
is deceptive in the sense of how they

663
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:04,149
describe it and you know persistently

664
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:06,760
always collects location data and sends

665
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:12,850
it back to the Iranian government so if

666
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,470
we go down to the bottom again

667
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,870
you typically find is sees some of these

668
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,720
sort of posts oh and here's something

669
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:29,409
worth mentioning the Iran minister of

670
00:33:29,409 --> 00:33:30,610
information communications technology

671
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:33,159
actually did that it's already quite

672
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:34,179
they have already collected two

673
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:35,740
locations plants reported four million

674
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:39,549
Iranians but to help the app you know

675
00:33:39,549 --> 00:33:42,880
quite a quite a rich data set here but

676
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,010
if we take a look at the bottom and

677
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:47,620
actually link to well actually link to

678
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:50,860
virustotal here we're not going to do

679
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,899
anything it aside from just take this

680
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:57,669
shaw hash out of that link and let's run

681
00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:03,149
the same thing again scholars for 256

682
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:10,480
cool so now what we want to do is okay

683
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,210
so this eating at oracle published a

684
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:19,440
single hash of this malware or spyware

685
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,889
and we want to

686
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:22,809
other copies of it maybe we want to see

687
00:34:22,809 --> 00:34:25,929
how this malware or spyware has evolved

688
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:29,199
over time for example what your features

689
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,109
are added what was removed things like

690
00:34:32,109 --> 00:34:34,779
that so why don't we take a look at the

691
00:34:34,779 --> 00:34:37,719
file details and one thing I want to

692
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,849
emphasize here is everything that is in

693
00:34:39,849 --> 00:34:41,829
the final details tab and more because

694
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,210
you actually see more by the command

695
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:47,710
line is what we call pivotable so you

696
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,779
know the topic of this conversation that

697
00:34:49,779 --> 00:34:51,460
we're having today is hunting and

698
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,279
pivoting using research driven threat

699
00:34:54,279 --> 00:34:56,409
intelligence so anything that you see on

700
00:34:56,409 --> 00:34:58,720
this page you can formulate a metadata

701
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,470
query for and and do boolean logic in

702
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:06,010
terms of having ands and ORS and nots in

703
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,599
between these conditions to find

704
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,490
additional samples here's here's a

705
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:14,049
domain like string that looks pretty

706
00:35:14,049 --> 00:35:18,640
interesting I would say so there's Cove

707
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:24,069
in 1995 7xy calm and they actually have

708
00:35:24,069 --> 00:35:25,920
the same thing that firebase at i/o

709
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,240
which tells me they're using Google

710
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:34,000
Google cloud platform I chose the back

711
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,069
end for their back right so II 9 0 5 7

712
00:35:39,069 --> 00:35:41,109
is unique I've done prayer and their

713
00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:44,380
project name is probably coded 19 so

714
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,730
they're reporting back to your website

715
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:57,160
and firebase the hub so if we take a

716
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:03,369
look at this let's do so here's one

717
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:06,220
potentially interesting domain let me

718
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,019
see if there's there's a lot of strings

719
00:36:08,019 --> 00:36:11,589
in there let's formulate a metadata

720
00:36:11,589 --> 00:36:18,910
query or strings dots let's actually go

721
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:25,269
with URLs yes and we don't really care

722
00:36:25,269 --> 00:36:27,789
if it starts with HTTP or issue yes we

723
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:30,400
want to find anything here so what we're

724
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,809
going to search for here is give me all

725
00:36:31,809 --> 00:36:32,960
the files that have

726
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,150
you are looking strings in them let's

727
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:39,369
start with anything and end in this

728
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:50,869
manner all right we have four results so

729
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:57,650
one of them we already saw but and the

730
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,910
other three were not published as part

731
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:02,570
of this blog post we can again you can

732
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:03,680
download these files you can

733
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,330
reverse-engineer them and take a look at

734
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:06,950
what might have changed perhaps over

735
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:09,500
time maybe one was built earlier when

736
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,849
it's built later if you go to the file

737
00:37:10,849 --> 00:37:13,730
details you can see that's yes it has

738
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,890
the same sort of domain like URL like

739
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:19,460
strings in them 11 and you could publish

740
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,930
some interesting research on that in

741
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:23,000
terms of you know what kind of features

742
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,830
are you adding or removing to this

743
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:30,440
application what go do they fix okay any

744
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,280
questions on that I have another other

745
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:38,710
fun news story go through your next

746
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,650
okay so we've been

747
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:45,110
a bunch of Android specific things let's

748
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:47,630
switch gears a little bit and go for

749
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:51,290
some windows-based threats so in a

750
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:56,030
different two koban 19 a lot of malware

751
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:58,520
authors have been using this hubbub

752
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,830
around zoom everyone seems to be

753
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:03,400
blocking a zoom saying things about soon

754
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,810
so malware authors are trying to inject

755
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:08,390
themselves into the conversation bundle

756
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:10,330
their malware as part of installers that

757
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,530
look like they're installing zoom or

758
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:14,870
maybe they maybe they actually do

759
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,310
install zoom but they install a few

760
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:19,520
other things as well so Trend Micro

761
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,720
publish this blog post about a fake zoom

762
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,050
Windows desktop installer that's also

763
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:30,470
drop sorry point liner so for those not

764
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:33,740
familiar point miners are you know

765
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,470
you're just my name cryptocurrency I

766
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:38,930
said this but in this case you're not

767
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,250
mining cryptocurrency for yourself

768
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:42,380
you're mining cryptocurrency for whoever

769
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:46,880
owned you so this this fake installer

770
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,820
will drop a coin miner will drop the Tor

771
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:52,610
binary and will drop a few other things

772
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:54,050
and we'll see what they are in a second

773
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:56,360
here but we'll connect it to the Tor

774
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,030
network and start mining coins on behalf

775
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,500
of the attackers so that's how the

776
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:05,030
attackers are making money okay

777
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:08,630
so let's again let's kind of scroll down

778
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,190
here there they're talking about some of

779
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:12,710
the things that are part of this fake

780
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:16,250
installer and for those familiar with

781
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,510
this sort of script it kind of looks

782
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:20,800
like and it looks like PowerShell right

783
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,170
so let's scroll down here it lists some

784
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,670
of the names of the things that are

785
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:28,280
dropped along with it it's a good blog

786
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,530
post you know to go through what's

787
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:33,200
unpacked they have they actually bundle

788
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,190
the 7-zip extractor along with their

789
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:39,050
installer and then extract something

790
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,640
that is Simmons of compressed within it

791
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:45,680
well the dll's here's another snippet of

792
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,890
the power show that they're using let's

793
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:51,910
scroll down and it does some things like

794
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,660
detecting whether or not you're running

795
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,700
some antivirus solutions and

796
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,910
you are just don't do anything bad I'm

797
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:01,970
interesting this is some situational

798
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:06,380
awareness down okay continuing to scroll

799
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:09,099
typically IFC's are found at the end

800
00:40:09,099 --> 00:40:11,720
these blog posts but when it maintains

801
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,240
persistence so it creates a scheduled

802
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,950
task that will kick off the mining

803
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:19,400
process each time the computer boots and

804
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,750
it also actually checks to see whether

805
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:24,200
or not the beer as access to GPUs and if

806
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,310
it doesn't it doesn't do anything

807
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:27,740
malicious if your remaining coins

808
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,150
nowadays you're doing a lot of Stewie

809
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:31,869
you you're going to have a bad time so

810
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:34,700
it's not really worth it and people

811
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,500
might notice if your CPU is running hot

812
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:41,450
all time anyway okay scrolling down okay

813
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:44,240
so we have a few shot to do two sixes

814
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,470
here the installer of the payload and

815
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:52,160
also of some URLs my indicators are

816
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,849
compromised so we're gonna take a look

817
00:40:55,849 --> 00:41:01,670
at let's take a look at this one let's

818
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:04,190
go to five smart this is similar to what

819
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:10,190
we did before metadata we have something

820
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:14,240
that looks like a URL of course it's not

821
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:19,369
H X XPS it's HTTP and we're going to

822
00:41:19,369 --> 00:41:25,280
obfuscate this and let's search that did

823
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,290
that wrong it's because I have the

824
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:34,849
colons near you okay so we found a

825
00:41:34,849 --> 00:41:43,430
sample here let's pull this up now

826
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:44,780
interestingly

827
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:48,410
EF starts with the F - ah - it starts

828
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:50,900
with the FNX and Cee if we go back over

829
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,440
here

830
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,450
that's not one that's mention on the

831
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:55,970
Trend Micro report so we have a

832
00:41:55,970 --> 00:42:00,170
different one why don't we

833
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:01,970
let's make sure that this is actually

834
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:04,010
what Trend Micro's talking about let's

835
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:13,100
let's download this let's do already

836
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:17,180
have the same folder 30 downloaded and

837
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,700
moved it here and renamed it to dot ps1

838
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:23,270
because it's a PowerShell script let me

839
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:26,470
open up vs code

840
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:45,940
let me just do it in the script that

841
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,559
kicks off there's a few things that they

842
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:49,089
mention in the block pros that are kind

843
00:42:49,089 --> 00:42:51,190
of telling that this is the same thing

844
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:53,259
that they're talking about one of them

845
00:42:53,259 --> 00:42:56,200
of course is the callback address let's

846
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:03,910
search for that okay dollar sign s URL

847
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:06,730
equals exactly what it is that Trend

848
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:09,880
Micro published it's probably probably

849
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,670
the same thing now Trend Micro mentioned

850
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:15,130
that they also bundled the 7-zip

851
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:18,039
extractor and swore in here

852
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:20,410
so I scroll through here so you didn't

853
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:26,650
have to this is ugly but you can include

854
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:29,500
binaries inside of PowerShell scripts by

855
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,329
just having a bunch of hex values and

856
00:43:31,329 --> 00:43:34,779
handing them together so they have 7-zip

857
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:38,859
bin equals this massive array and it

858
00:43:38,859 --> 00:43:42,099
together out of hex values and that'll

859
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:46,170
be dumped there just let me go back

860
00:43:52,109 --> 00:43:55,839
they'll be dumped to disk and then used

861
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,569
to extract other things including say

862
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:08,529
for example torben we'll call them so

863
00:44:08,529 --> 00:44:11,920
tour bin is if I recall correctly use

864
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,650
7-zip compressed as well so it will it

865
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:17,019
will dump the 7-zip I agree to this the

866
00:44:17,019 --> 00:44:20,740
unarchive err in on archive tool I use

867
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:23,019
the tour binary to connect to tor on

868
00:44:23,019 --> 00:44:24,430
archive their coin miner

869
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:28,919
run that I start at an order execution

870
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:33,130
so that it runs on each each boots and

871
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:36,180
they're on their way

872
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:39,040
yeah this

873
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,170
definitely looks like the same thing

874
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:45,070
that Trend Micro stormy map and again

875
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:47,710
you can play along at home a lot of

876
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:49,990
other kind of outlets don't let you

877
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:51,550
download files like that so that's

878
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:55,710
that's one thing they wanted to show you

879
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:59,560
any questions on that I'm at that

880
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,910
article and what we can do with that

881
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,980
okay so one question one is that we just

882
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:16,720
got is for the static analyzers does it

883
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,570
include things like - if I saw one

884
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:22,930
correctly as well as you know what other

885
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:24,550
kind of things that imports let me just

886
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:32,890
show you and he wants to annotate the

887
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:39,910
shared content fuzzy hash okay I don't

888
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:41,890
know about in fuzzy hash if we don't

889
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:49,000
have it in fuzzy - we have impact let me

890
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:49,720
show you that

891
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,840
so impassion so I'm going to upload a

892
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,330
file here right now this file is putty X

893
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:59,890
dot exe and what it is is the SSH client

894
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:04,710
putty that we injected with medicine

895
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:09,600
so what's benign and so we modified it

896
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,730
and we injected with meterpreter so

897
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:14,700
let's scroll down here so we have the

898
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,200
normal artifacts and their file details

899
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,480
we have the normal hashes but we also

900
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,980
run because this is a PD file we run no

901
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:27,360
surprise here we run the tool PE file to

902
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,160
extract some things about this file so

903
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,560
you'll extract things like hey here's

904
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,660
all the import functions from the

905
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:36,850
windows PE here's the DLLs that it

906
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:38,770
imports even says things like does it

907
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:43,450
use a SLR things like that he files not

908
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:45,130
the only one we also grind that belief

909
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:47,920
which provides admittedly a lot of kind

910
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,780
of overlapping information but there are

911
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:51,970
a few things that leaf provides

912
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:55,359
vice versa and of course under strings

913
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:59,260
you can see it's referencing OpenSSH

914
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:01,990
calm but we'll see in a second when we

915
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:04,300
switch over to details how a lot of

916
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:05,530
engines identified this as an

917
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:10,630
interpreter so it's part of if I recall

918
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:13,030
correctly as part of Leafs output they

919
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:16,530
have a name let me just scroll down here

920
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:23,859
maybe it was Peas long yeah important so

921
00:47:23,859 --> 00:47:27,880
PE files import hash what it is is it

922
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:31,690
takes the imported libraries source them

923
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:34,480
alphabetically and then runs a hash

924
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,430
function I don't remember which one over

925
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:40,450
that list so you can often you can find

926
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:43,840
similar samples perhaps even from the

927
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:47,200
same family by searching for the import

928
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,900
hash you know even if you have like some

929
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:53,890
polymorphic sort of malware you know one

930
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:55,330
thing that now our authors may not

931
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,130
change when they generate multiple

932
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:59,740
copies that look different on disk is

933
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:02,020
what sort of libraries are importing

934
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:04,900
right so that's that's one example of a

935
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,760
fuzzy sort of hash but not sure if it's

936
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,520
the same thing as in fuzzy hatch but it

937
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,080
is a fuzzy hash in the sense that it's

938
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:14,740
not a cryptographic hash and it's meant

939
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:18,130
to identify other samples that at least

940
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:22,510
have the same deal all imports so be

941
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:24,670
something that we can search by metadata

942
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:26,740
searching so I haven't done this fun but

943
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:31,119
I'll show you how to do this let's see

944
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:32,770
if we wanted to search this in - I'm not

945
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:34,210
actually sure if we have another sample

946
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:36,780
that has this in cash but let's find out

947
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:41,099
Keith low-impact

948
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:53,839
well we do the demo gods are with me so

949
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:57,079
that might be well let's just scan one

950
00:48:57,079 --> 00:49:00,950
of them there is what it is it might

951
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:06,799
just be a bunch of different amount much

952
00:49:06,799 --> 00:49:09,650
different interpreters anyway let's

953
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:12,349
switch back over to here and as you can

954
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:14,240
see only Baba that says hey it's an

955
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:18,410
interpreter generic sort of backdoor

956
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:20,150
stuff rising says hey this is

957
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:23,030
interpreter again let's take a look at

958
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:24,230
the poly score the probably score is

959
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:27,280
probably going to be Barry

960
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:40,030
yeah it's great question do we capture

961
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:42,790
the debug output or do we capture debug

962
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:45,369
information that if sometimes embedded

963
00:49:45,369 --> 00:49:50,740
within Windows executables we do and I

964
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:52,809
actually wasn't going to demo that but

965
00:49:52,809 --> 00:49:58,000
now I will so thank you let me show you

966
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,329
so here's another there's another

967
00:50:01,329 --> 00:50:02,049
article

968
00:50:02,049 --> 00:50:06,369
this one's from fire I published this

969
00:50:06,369 --> 00:50:09,059
article back in August of last year and

970
00:50:09,059 --> 00:50:11,619
what they were what they were showing as

971
00:50:11,619 --> 00:50:13,869
part of this article is a lot of malware

972
00:50:13,869 --> 00:50:16,630
authors are very sloppy when you build

973
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:19,329
malware or when you build a application

974
00:50:19,329 --> 00:50:23,680
on Windows in Visual Studio Visual

975
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,960
Studio can generate what are called PE

976
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:31,329
or program debug files as part of the

977
00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:33,010
build of binary and this helps with

978
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:35,260
debugging the files before you know

979
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:38,170
release but sometimes malware authors

980
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:40,839
forget to strict references to these PDF

981
00:50:40,839 --> 00:50:44,049
files included in their malware before

982
00:50:44,049 --> 00:50:46,599
they go out to their targets right so

983
00:50:46,599 --> 00:50:48,910
let's scroll through here and some of

984
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:51,520
these are pretty flying so I'm actually

985
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:56,559
really glad you brought this up here we

986
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:02,440
go this guy or girl to be a girl in d :

987
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:06,760
/s Miller maybe it's around Steve Miller

988
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,920
from the Steve Miller Band slash project

989
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:15,210
slash super evil stuff show code so

990
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:17,349
there was some malware that they caught

991
00:51:17,349 --> 00:51:20,260
that have a reference here you see right

992
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:27,609
here to super evil stuff not great off

993
00:51:27,609 --> 00:51:31,780
sec actually i think that i made maybe

994
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:33,069
miss feeding there i think that might

995
00:51:33,069 --> 00:51:38,570
just be their example that's our exam

996
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:42,080
the actual the actual mistakes are no

997
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:46,040
less money let's scroll down there is

998
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:58,850
one in here in operation shadow hammer

999
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:01,190
which uses a myriad of connections to

1000
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:05,000
have 41 1 cent sample that is simply a

1001
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,650
descriptive PDB pad

1002
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:12,070
d : z past c++ asus shell code release

1003
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:17,630
HS shell code PDB ok cool let's see if

1004
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:24,310
we have it let's go back to you

1005
00:52:27,509 --> 00:52:29,110
we're going to do a mad

1006
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:32,770
search now and we're going to look for

1007
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:36,270
so PE file pulls out information about

1008
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:39,580
PD bees that are resident within any

1009
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,650
references to PD bees referencing

1010
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:44,200
reference within the PE file they've

1011
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,090
taken a look at so let's look for

1012
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:49,420
anything that so this is going to be a

1013
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:53,140
PD path that starts with anything but

1014
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:57,490
ends in shellcode FPV we have a lot of

1015
00:52:57,490 --> 00:53:00,090
them not all of them have been scanned

1016
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:05,830
but a lot of them have let's just pull

1017
00:53:05,830 --> 00:53:17,870
up one that has Chris actually think

1018
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:21,140
as an interpreter but you get the sense

1019
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:24,410
here I think that answers a question if

1020
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:27,470
I go back here gonna file details part

1021
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:30,880
of PD file will have a PD section

1022
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,560
actually we won't okay well this is a

1023
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:36,920
good example of just for the sake of

1024
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:40,670
brevity we don't export and like and we

1025
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:41,870
don't want to crash upon the black

1026
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:44,000
browser we don't put everything on the

1027
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,550
web UI so let me show you how to find

1028
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:52,660
pdbs interactively online so let's do

1029
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:57,250
I'm going to do the same metadata search

1030
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:06,500
I'm going to ask for the output none in

1031
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,930
human readable format but I'm gonna do

1032
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:13,750
it in I'm gonna do pretty printed JSON

1033
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:19,340
okay well that's returning a bunch of

1034
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:23,180
results so hold on let me just actually

1035
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:24,740
just search this hash that I have the

1036
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:30,890
exact one we're hearing all those

1037
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:45,930
results perhaps yes so

1038
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:50,000
so everything that it just spit out is

1039
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,530
what it spit out is more than what's on

1040
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:53,970
the webpage right and this is just

1041
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:57,030
outputting in a JSON format so it's

1042
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:59,520
really easy to integrate with whatever

1043
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,800
processes you currently have all very

1044
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,319
programmatic and you don't actually have

1045
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:06,390
to use our CLI we actually have a very

1046
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:10,290
cool feature UI as well that sports both

1047
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:13,589
Python to seven unfortunately and also

1048
00:55:13,589 --> 00:55:17,220
Python 3 so you can integrate with that

1049
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,559
as well and this this is made I wasn't

1050
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:20,940
necessarily gonna go in the yeah so

1051
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:23,309
today because that's a deeper dive than

1052
00:55:23,309 --> 00:55:25,440
just actually doing the hunting but

1053
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:30,240
let's scroll up here so here we go this

1054
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:38,190
PDB or list actually has within it and

1055
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:41,190
this this list is underneath he file so

1056
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:43,770
the PD file tool returned information

1057
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:46,109
about PD bees and in this particular

1058
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:49,349
sample it had a reference to a PDB file

1059
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:52,940
that was day one taiga shell code tech

1060
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:56,040
CP shell code release comm shell code on

1061
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:59,940
TV there you go so yes you can get

1062
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:04,200
access to PD files references to them as

1063
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,710
pulled out a PE file so if there is some

1064
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:09,480
field that you would expect likes a PE

1065
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,640
file or leaf or something to not should

1066
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,920
be exporting but it is not on the web UI

1067
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,319
it's probably on the COI but we just

1068
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:18,960
don't want to crash the browser just be

1069
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,980
too much data

1070
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:25,200
and to get a sense for it linked to

1071
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,549
different fields you can search the

1072
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:27,780
metadata searching we have some

1073
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:31,010
documentation at box number

1074
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:34,680
but we also have this other project we

1075
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:37,589
go to consumers here real quick Emeline

1076
00:56:37,589 --> 00:56:47,369
orang searches rather let's do your some

1077
00:56:47,369 --> 00:56:49,109
metadata terms although this is not the

1078
00:56:49,109 --> 00:56:50,579
complete list we're working on auto

1079
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:52,470
generating this there's actually a lot

1080
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:54,270
more that you can get out of this so if

1081
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:56,160
you play with toys form after we were

1082
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,859
chatting today basically if you search a

1083
00:56:58,859 --> 00:57:02,250
hash take a look at you know what things

1084
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:03,780
are spit out as part of that and you can

1085
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:06,510
formulate queries based on any of the

1086
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:12,960
fields in there okay well that was a

1087
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,400
little bit of a diversion but let's go

1088
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:19,950
back okay so I'm going to get a little

1089
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:21,510
bit more in the weeds here on metadata

1090
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:22,890
searching for people that want to do a

1091
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:27,210
little bit more advanced searches but

1092
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:29,460
before I do that you know email sets in

1093
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:31,890
the news we have some both automated and

1094
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:36,450
manual processes or tagging known

1095
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:38,849
malware samples based on both attributes

1096
00:57:38,849 --> 00:57:41,520
of that sample maybe it's ransomware for

1097
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,490
example and family name maybe it's red

1098
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:48,869
or why you why why sorry our wide UK

1099
00:57:48,869 --> 00:57:51,000
however you pronounce that so the family

1100
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,569
could be right and be tagged with

1101
00:57:54,569 --> 00:57:57,059
ransomware so if you take a look at that

1102
00:57:57,059 --> 00:58:00,150
form that list you can see what our

1103
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:03,180
current tags are and we have a lot of

1104
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:06,599
them and this is actually what we use

1105
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:08,670
internally for putting things on the

1106
00:58:08,670 --> 00:58:10,770
front page in terms of American emerging

1107
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:15,000
threats so why don't we take a look at

1108
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,750
ice warm and then we're going to see

1109
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:22,559
what samples are linked and list those

1110
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:26,180
samples linked with the family

1111
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:37,060
and it's just it's going night terminal

1112
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:39,010
because there's too many results so why

1113
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:45,370
don't we instead just ask figure out how

1114
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:46,060
many there are

1115
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:48,070
so again this is this is a combination

1116
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:50,860
of manual and automated processes and

1117
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:52,720
we'll get a certain number of known

1118
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,850
definitely known about to have samples

1119
00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:57,190
here including Iman set samples that

1120
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:59,350
were unpacked you see at the bottom of

1121
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:01,780
the terminal right there the last one

1122
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:03,220
that stood out the apartment we'll see

1123
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:05,920
get that is actually an unpacked Motel

1124
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,520
sample so we have one hundred and forty

1125
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,500
eight which is fine that's not a lot so

1126
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:15,490
let me show you let's let's formulate a

1127
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:18,400
different metadata query ATAR what we're

1128
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,380
gonna do here is we're going to search

1129
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:26,650
tomorrow that's where identified it has

1130
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:31,840
like by any of the engines as part of a

1131
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,700
malware family that starts with any

1132
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:36,370
string then contains you know taya then

1133
00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:39,250
ends in any string and what we're going

1134
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:40,750
to be asking for is just a list of

1135
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:42,570
sha-256

1136
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:49,000
let's go to the end here let's just

1137
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,630
redirect that

1138
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:12,920
library loans and

1139
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,240
shut up you can just looking where that

1140
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:19,600
that's not big you okay any second now

1141
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:28,480
well let's see what we have so far

1142
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:34,850
absolutely for you we have something

1143
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:36,620
over 5,000 so I'm tight control see this

1144
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:39,350
I don't waste everyone's time so we have

1145
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:41,020
five thousand six hundred and forty five

1146
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:46,460
results for that query last thing I want

1147
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:48,290
to show in this kind of section is we

1148
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:52,970
actually started labeling so some

1149
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:55,370
engines label samples that exploit

1150
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:58,490
various lower abilities as having CVE

1151
01:00:58,490 --> 01:01:01,100
and their family name so if you want to

1152
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,860
find exploits you can do that on Bali

1153
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:08,900
swarm let's take a look at samples that

1154
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:12,770
were detected as malicious by engines on

1155
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:14,660
police worm that had a mill our family

1156
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:18,710
that contain the string CV those samples

1157
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:20,270
almost certainly are exploiting the CDA

1158
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:23,270
that detect and again I won't

1159
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:26,030
necessarily waste your time here there's

1160
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:28,640
two and a half thousand of these so you

1161
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:29,660
really die okay

1162
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:35,780
that one was faster device plates it

1163
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:37,250
looks like a bunch of shell three sixes

1164
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:40,850
so I could count exploits into Polly

1165
01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:47,410
swarm download read from standard in and

1166
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:53,649
let's download to lead

1167
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:09,910
all right so I'm going to control see

1168
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:10,840
this because I'm not actually gonna

1169
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:17,890
downloading that boss files and we have

1170
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:19,800
a bunch of files already downloaded so

1171
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,630
this is great for trying to find things

1172
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:24,090
that were exploiting various sea beads

1173
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:26,230
and one thing that we actually did

1174
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:29,710
special taste here is we added detection

1175
01:02:29,710 --> 01:02:35,130
to a file or the NSA reported

1176
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:37,720
vulnerability and windows certificate

1177
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:40,360
checking if anybody remembers that so

1178
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,640
you could pass you know their

1179
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:46,860
certificate validation anyway we have 22

1180
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:49,600
samples that that exploit that model as

1181
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:58,289
well okay any questions so far

1182
01:02:58,289 --> 01:03:02,069
else have any questions in terms of this

1183
01:03:02,069 --> 01:03:04,099
would be a cool thing to search or

1184
01:03:04,099 --> 01:03:07,439
something like that not show a few other

1185
01:03:07,439 --> 01:03:10,489
things so kind of the strength of it

1186
01:03:10,489 --> 01:03:14,489
let's take a look at this search so what

1187
01:03:14,489 --> 01:03:19,410
we're doing here is we're asking for hey

1188
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:21,929
give me all the files that were first

1189
01:03:21,929 --> 01:03:28,130
scanned on April 14th at 0 100 hours UTC

1190
01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:32,759
to April 14th at 0 hundred and 15

1191
01:03:32,759 --> 01:03:37,049
minutes April 14th and that three

1192
01:03:37,049 --> 01:03:39,479
engines detected at least notes are a

1193
01:03:39,479 --> 01:03:41,489
greater than three engines detected as

1194
01:03:41,489 --> 01:03:43,949
malicious and give me those shots of you

1195
01:03:43,949 --> 01:03:52,109
sixes okay so there's question demoing

1196
01:03:52,109 --> 01:03:56,039
the CLI somebody mouth talker I am NOT

1197
01:03:56,039 --> 01:03:58,410
in a docker image right now you could of

1198
01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:00,029
course do this within a docker image I

1199
01:04:00,029 --> 01:04:02,999
just have a virtual environment and you

1200
01:04:02,999 --> 01:04:06,299
can all you have to do is if you're

1201
01:04:06,299 --> 01:04:09,019
running Python 3 yep install - you

1202
01:04:09,019 --> 01:04:17,429
always warm well I kind of like it's not

1203
01:04:17,429 --> 01:04:20,249
quite you all seen anything I keep so

1204
01:04:20,249 --> 01:04:23,539
the first step is go to your met network

1205
01:04:23,539 --> 01:04:26,069
if you haven't created an account create

1206
01:04:26,069 --> 01:04:28,229
an account and go to settings in your

1207
01:04:28,229 --> 01:04:30,089
account and now will display your API

1208
01:04:30,089 --> 01:04:33,599
key and then what I did is I just

1209
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:39,289
sourced my API key from uh a file I had

1210
01:04:39,289 --> 01:04:41,640
it's actually just in my environment so

1211
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:44,759
that the poor man just using my key

1212
01:04:44,759 --> 01:04:53,309
otherwise you'd do something like hey ok

1213
01:04:53,309 --> 01:04:54,749
so we gotta listen to those files of

1214
01:04:54,749 --> 01:04:56,400
match that criteria let's take a look at

1215
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,249
hash cool it's a bunch of shot to g6

1216
01:04:59,249 --> 01:05:01,349
hashes now let's do something else kind

1217
01:05:01,349 --> 01:05:05,819
of complex with that final so we're

1218
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:07,829
going to search hashes by ingesting that

1219
01:05:07,829 --> 01:05:11,589
half text type that into Jake Hughes or

1220
01:05:11,589 --> 01:05:13,319
parsing the JSON that's coming out and

1221
01:05:13,319 --> 01:05:16,229
we're looking at the shot 256 and

1222
01:05:16,229 --> 01:05:20,170
pairing it with the poly score we're

1223
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:21,700
going to output that to poly score that

1224
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:23,739
text so this is really quickly kind of

1225
01:05:23,739 --> 01:05:26,710
amassing a correspondence between shot

1226
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:30,900
256 is and how malicious you know our

1227
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:33,069
statistical modeling thinks these files

1228
01:05:33,069 --> 01:05:35,349
are now the vast majority of these will

1229
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:38,019
be quite malicious because over a three

1230
01:05:38,019 --> 01:05:40,420
engines to check them is malicious but

1231
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:41,769
let's just let's take a look and see

1232
01:05:41,769 --> 01:05:44,189
what it looks like

1233
01:05:46,259 --> 01:05:56,920
well that's right who recognizes yes hey

1234
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:04,150
buddy that is the moniker

1235
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:07,690
Swisher man so if you want to find a

1236
01:06:07,690 --> 01:06:09,250
bunch of samples wanna cry

1237
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:24,220
that's great way to do it yeah this is

1238
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:25,650
probably done nope

1239
01:06:25,650 --> 01:06:28,630
all right well someone wrong here I may

1240
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:44,950
do this actually write out this scream

1241
01:06:44,950 --> 01:06:53,110
and now you have the scream you're

1242
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:56,350
breaking up a lot I can't really

1243
01:06:56,350 --> 01:06:59,620
understand what you're saying

1244
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:02,080
would it be possible yeah the question

1245
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:07,020
and maybe he can read it

1246
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:15,190
you

1247
01:07:16,869 --> 01:07:18,640
yes can you see if a certain hash has

1248
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:19,930
been scanned before yes

1249
01:07:19,930 --> 01:07:22,089
so I mentioned and I showed it on the

1250
01:07:22,089 --> 01:07:24,460
web UI a few times we searched various

1251
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:26,049
things that not everything was scanned

1252
01:07:26,049 --> 01:07:29,710
yet like here's a good example so what

1253
01:07:29,710 --> 01:07:31,359
we're doing right now is we're kind of

1254
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:34,779
doing lazy scanning so we're ingesting

1255
01:07:34,779 --> 01:07:36,779
on the order of we're bringing in about

1256
01:07:36,779 --> 01:07:41,890
300,000 samples a day uniques not all of

1257
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:43,479
them are being scanned quite yet we're

1258
01:07:43,479 --> 01:07:45,819
working on improving the throughput of

1259
01:07:45,819 --> 01:07:49,960
our scan process when that throughput is

1260
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:52,989
improved then we're going to be scanning

1261
01:07:52,989 --> 01:07:55,539
everything as it comes in but for the

1262
01:07:55,539 --> 01:07:59,319
moment if you know we we want to have a

1263
01:07:59,319 --> 01:08:01,049
lot of files in the air so you can find

1264
01:08:01,049 --> 01:08:04,380
you can metadata search them metadata

1265
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:06,640
sorry the static extraction that goes

1266
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,440
into metadata search are always wrong on

1267
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:10,869
every file whether or not they've been

1268
01:08:10,869 --> 01:08:12,789
scammed so you can still find these

1269
01:08:12,789 --> 01:08:14,559
files but actually getting scan results

1270
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:16,089
for some of them you're going to have to

1271
01:08:16,089 --> 01:08:19,299
actually kick off the scan that being

1272
01:08:19,299 --> 01:08:21,310
said once we improve this you know we're

1273
01:08:21,310 --> 01:08:23,469
overhauling some there's some

1274
01:08:23,469 --> 01:08:25,210
infrastructure on the back that's Lee

1275
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:27,549
gonna run through our entire backlog the

1276
01:08:27,549 --> 01:08:29,139
files that happened in scan so in the

1277
01:08:29,139 --> 01:08:33,368
future this shouldn't even really even

1278
01:08:33,368 --> 01:08:35,679
be a concern because everything will be

1279
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:38,469
scanned but that's that's where we are

1280
01:08:38,469 --> 01:08:41,170
right now so if you want to see things

1281
01:08:41,170 --> 01:08:43,599
that haven't been scammed that's a good

1282
01:08:43,599 --> 01:08:47,738
question let me you have a query that

1283
01:08:47,738 --> 01:08:50,519
would do that for you

1284
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:09,609
so you could do something like just try

1285
01:09:09,609 --> 01:09:17,670
to come up with it exists scam

1286
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:31,569
if these scores are based on statistical

1287
01:09:31,569 --> 01:09:34,840
model is a changing constantly yes when

1288
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:39,630
you request a poly score as part of the

1289
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:42,700
results each time you request supplies

1290
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:44,529
for it will be different because the

1291
01:09:44,529 --> 01:09:47,020
statistical models will be updated with

1292
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:49,120
the scans that is that the models have

1293
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:52,479
seen since you last requested to give

1294
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:54,400
you a sense for how often we're scanning

1295
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,590
things

1296
01:09:55,590 --> 01:09:58,830
let's do

1297
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:12,340
yes I just came up with this before I

1298
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:15,460
switched gears back to that so anything

1299
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:16,840
that you put in this metadata querying

1300
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:19,210
if you know I just have to be valid

1301
01:10:19,210 --> 01:10:20,980
occurring to elasticsearch is boolean

1302
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:25,390
search criteria so we can do not then we

1303
01:10:25,390 --> 01:10:27,610
can do this special property underscore

1304
01:10:27,610 --> 01:10:30,160
exists underscore then I'm looking for

1305
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:32,650
the scan object it's part of the results

1306
01:10:32,650 --> 01:10:34,570
so that's going to list everything that

1307
01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:36,969
hasn't been scanned whereas if I take

1308
01:10:36,969 --> 01:10:43,420
away not these have all been stamped

1309
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:46,330
right not all the malicious but you know

1310
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:49,900
they've all been scan okay so let me

1311
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:52,000
show you this real quick so what I'm

1312
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,260
asking for is

1313
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:56,660
give me all the artifacts that were

1314
01:10:56,660 --> 01:11:00,070
uploaded in a five-minute time window

1315
01:11:00,070 --> 01:11:05,450
and they have they were detected as

1316
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:10,940
malicious by at least one engine that's

1317
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:12,040
what I'm asking for

1318
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:47,900
let's do 499 so that kind of gives you a

1319
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:49,340
little bit of a sense so even though

1320
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:50,510
we're not seeing everything that's

1321
01:11:50,510 --> 01:11:53,420
coming through in a span of five minutes

1322
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:56,570
on the 15th we scanned

1323
01:11:56,570 --> 01:11:59,420
499 files at least one engine and

1324
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:01,370
identified them as malicious so we stand

1325
01:12:01,370 --> 01:12:05,780
for more than that but those you know

1326
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:07,370
that's the number that were deemed to be

1327
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:16,540
malicious okay

1328
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:25,740
the end of you know what I was going to

1329
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:29,400
show in terms of hunting I hope some

1330
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:32,670
people are are interested in trying this

1331
01:12:32,670 --> 01:12:35,540
out I know it's I think it's pretty fun

1332
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:36,780
again

1333
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:38,640
you know you can you you can download

1334
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:41,070
these files you can publish results from

1335
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:44,130
what you find on here we really have no

1336
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:46,380
restrictions in terms of weight so

1337
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:49,050
obviously we we'd love to have some sort

1338
01:12:49,050 --> 01:12:50,730
of link back or say like hey I got a

1339
01:12:50,730 --> 01:12:53,700
thousand or something like that but yeah

1340
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:54,630
we don't have any kind of restrictions

1341
01:12:54,630 --> 01:12:57,180
like that so if we get some people

1342
01:12:57,180 --> 01:12:59,810
interested out of this conversation and

1343
01:12:59,810 --> 01:13:02,160
hunting on voice warm and uploading more

1344
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:08,130
files then we can improve this whole

1345
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:10,020
ecosystem together okay

1346
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:11,520
I think I got a question can you say

1347
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:15,780
something about sorry yeah so we have a

1348
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:19,710
telegram bot and it's in our telegram

1349
01:13:19,710 --> 01:13:23,270
channel and it will automatically scan

1350
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:25,650
it's not just in our telegram sure how

1351
01:13:25,650 --> 01:13:27,450
it's actually in over 300 telegram

1352
01:13:27,450 --> 01:13:31,140
channels at this point and it will scan

1353
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:33,060
files that are posted to the telegram

1354
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:35,400
channel by submitting them to Boston and

1355
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:38,790
will return results you know in a text

1356
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:40,770
alarm this body talks back to the

1357
01:13:40,770 --> 01:13:43,860
telegram channel we're developing slack

1358
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:45,510
BOTS as well we're not quite there yet

1359
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:49,110
we have a private one but we haven't

1360
01:13:49,110 --> 01:13:52,800
released it yet we're looking at Twitter

1361
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:53,280
bots

1362
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:54,630
so one thing that we're interested in

1363
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:56,840
doing is you know part of my daily job

1364
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:59,010
and some of their people have all these

1365
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:00,330
murmurs follow the people on their

1366
01:14:00,330 --> 01:14:02,820
active on Twitter and see what they're

1367
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:04,080
saying about different you know new

1368
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,150
threats and things like that I'm

1369
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:07,800
sometimes it goes to i/o sees and we'll

1370
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:09,300
take a look and see what we have and

1371
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:10,760
where we can improve

1372
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:13,650
and you know our bots going to be on

1373
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:15,750
clearing it offer free downloads to

1374
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:18,060
people as a response to a lot of those

1375
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:22,140
posts because you know unless you pay a

1376
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:23,820
lot of money divide the links are solely

1377
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:28,230
you can't down the clouds right sir so

1378
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:29,730
yeah the thing that we did recently on

1379
01:14:29,730 --> 01:14:32,370
that front is we've partnered with the X

1380
01:14:32,370 --> 01:14:33,750
underground

1381
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:37,290
and they are sending us many many files

1382
01:14:37,290 --> 01:14:40,440
and in exchange where we are hosting

1383
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:42,930
their files for them for free ice or

1384
01:14:42,930 --> 01:14:44,520
engaging with the community on that side

1385
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:45,720
as well

1386
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,790
we haven't started ingesting their files

1387
01:14:47,790 --> 01:14:52,380
they're not searchable yet yeah thank

1388
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:53,760
you somebody just link to more

1389
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:56,930
information about each other grandma

1390
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:01,620
yeah is there a concept of reputation

1391
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:05,310
police want great question so the there

1392
01:15:05,310 --> 01:15:07,650
is a concept of reputation it's not

1393
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:10,800
anything that's exposed verbatim to

1394
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,560
users we've kind of gone back and forth

1395
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:16,530
on that what we what we've landed on

1396
01:15:16,530 --> 01:15:18,930
it's the statistical model that weights

1397
01:15:18,930 --> 01:15:20,790
output of different engines based on

1398
01:15:20,790 --> 01:15:23,070
file outside and past performance but

1399
01:15:23,070 --> 01:15:25,980
not exposing that's verbatim that

1400
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:28,680
statistical model to users the reason

1401
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:31,110
for that is a lot of engine developers

1402
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:32,910
particularly you know upstarts people

1403
01:15:32,910 --> 01:15:35,370
don't want to get their feet wet trying

1404
01:15:35,370 --> 01:15:36,990
to detect malware they don't necessarily

1405
01:15:36,990 --> 01:15:39,180
want to be compared or have it would be

1406
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:43,140
real easy to compare them against what

1407
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:46,380
is essentially their competitors so you

1408
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:48,060
know we're we're building the

1409
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:49,950
statistical model to distill down to the

1410
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:54,360
best sort of results that we can provide

1411
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:56,040
single result that we can provide but

1412
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,780
we're not in the business helping people

1413
01:15:57,780 --> 01:16:00,570
do serve a Navy comparative comparatives

1414
01:16:00,570 --> 01:16:03,470
sort of thing so we're not exposing that

1415
01:16:03,470 --> 01:16:08,190
directly so the other aspect they don't

1416
01:16:08,190 --> 01:16:11,640
speak on is okay cool the other aspect

1417
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:14,430
it will speak on is so everything I've

1418
01:16:14,430 --> 01:16:16,710
discussed so far today is in what it's

1419
01:16:16,710 --> 01:16:20,370
called our public community public

1420
01:16:20,370 --> 01:16:24,300
community is open anything like I said

1421
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:31,980
you can we store - 3 so the public

1422
01:16:31,980 --> 01:16:33,420
community and actually when you click

1423
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:35,280
download but you're downloading is

1424
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:38,880
assigned at s3 link that's not like for

1425
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,489
a certain amount of time

1426
01:16:40,489 --> 01:16:45,360
so yeah so what we're doing is

1427
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,130
everything that I mentioned so far is at

1428
01:16:47,130 --> 01:16:49,199
the community anybody can build an

1429
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:50,369
engine okay

1430
01:16:50,369 --> 01:16:53,159
search techniques and also what that

1431
01:16:53,159 --> 01:16:55,919
means conversely is anybody who's

1432
01:16:55,919 --> 01:16:57,449
capable technically capable of building

1433
01:16:57,449 --> 01:16:59,880
engine can get access to do the feat of

1434
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:03,689
files coming in so you know for cut for

1435
01:17:03,689 --> 01:17:06,179
customers of ours that's files they need

1436
01:17:06,179 --> 01:17:08,880
to be scanned that's that potentially

1437
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,260
confidential information in them

1438
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:12,899
obviously it doesn't work for those so

1439
01:17:12,899 --> 01:17:15,510
we for paying customers we set up what

1440
01:17:15,510 --> 01:17:18,059
are called private communities that only

1441
01:17:18,059 --> 01:17:20,369
have their vetted their shows and

1442
01:17:20,369 --> 01:17:22,229
engines as a part of that private

1443
01:17:22,229 --> 01:17:25,139
community so anybody can pull the plug

1444
01:17:25,139 --> 01:17:27,149
into the public community make a name

1445
01:17:27,149 --> 01:17:29,729
for themselves build up a reputation at

1446
01:17:29,729 --> 01:17:31,949
least in our eyes we can introduce those

1447
01:17:31,949 --> 01:17:34,619
engines few these customers and see what

1448
01:17:34,619 --> 01:17:36,780
enough to customers want them as part of

1449
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:38,280
their private community for scanning the

1450
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:40,409
subset of files that they have that are

1451
01:17:40,409 --> 01:17:42,030
potentially malicious if that makes

1452
01:17:42,030 --> 01:17:45,149
sense and there's you know higher

1453
01:17:45,149 --> 01:17:51,499
payouts in the community as well okay

1454
01:17:51,499 --> 01:17:56,699
nice yes back to this let's go back to

1455
01:17:56,699 --> 01:18:01,469
you presents okay we just went hunting

1456
01:18:01,469 --> 01:18:04,949
so here we are a bit of a metadata

1457
01:18:04,949 --> 01:18:08,699
search deep dive I can have you know I

1458
01:18:08,699 --> 01:18:11,219
can sit along some links one thing

1459
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:14,760
actually before i yeah if you go to

1460
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:15,840
github.com

1461
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:18,929
i believe this is public now - holy

1462
01:18:18,929 --> 01:18:19,550
smarm

1463
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:27,510
- fully examples all right it's not that

1464
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:34,250
right okay well that will be probably

1465
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:38,510
very soon my apologies there are a lot

1466
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:42,080
of docks at dock supplies from Gaia okay

1467
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,700
that covers a lot of like heavy use

1468
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:45,680
cases of metadata surgery but we're

1469
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:48,170
publishing a lot more data on that front

1470
01:18:48,170 --> 01:18:49,910
coming very soon so a lot of things at

1471
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:52,070
demo it's day that's going to be in

1472
01:18:52,070 --> 01:18:58,490
there and you know I kind of want to

1473
01:18:58,490 --> 01:19:00,350
bookend this conversation with again

1474
01:19:00,350 --> 01:19:02,570
encouraging anybody that finds like we

1475
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:05,420
chatted about today to go to go to

1476
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:08,930
polish firms on IO slash poly axe engage

1477
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:11,570
with other people like yourself you know

1478
01:19:11,570 --> 01:19:12,980
there's a lot of sample sharing there's

1479
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:14,510
a lot of threat intelligence like chat

1480
01:19:14,510 --> 01:19:16,910
going on and it would be great to have

1481
01:19:16,910 --> 01:19:21,080
you all as well so I'm with that I've

1482
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:24,880
gone on for about an hour and 25 minutes

1483
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:27,980
I'd like to thank everybody and open up

1484
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:33,890
for any kind of questions thank you Paul

1485
01:19:33,890 --> 01:19:36,310
thank you for for the great presentation

1486
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:40,870
hopefully you will get a lot of uh-oh

1487
01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:43,670
excited and collaborating researchers

1488
01:19:43,670 --> 01:19:48,170
there's a question there yeah thank you

1489
01:19:48,170 --> 01:19:50,210
and again thank you for having me and

1490
01:19:50,210 --> 01:19:52,430
one last thing I did mention I did

1491
01:19:52,430 --> 01:19:54,470
forget to go over one thing this is a

1492
01:19:54,470 --> 01:19:56,270
thing that is not free which is why I

1493
01:19:56,270 --> 01:19:59,030
didn't go over it but for paid accounts

1494
01:19:59,030 --> 01:20:00,620
if you have it you work at a company or

1495
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:03,560
something that I'd be interested in you

1496
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:05,690
can search for things using the are

1497
01:20:05,690 --> 01:20:08,390
rules right so here's like an example

1498
01:20:08,390 --> 01:20:10,670
your rule detecting you know tab you

1499
01:20:10,670 --> 01:20:12,500
actually run these URLs against our

1500
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:16,340
entire hundreds of millions of files get

1501
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:19,010
results so that's very costly for us to

1502
01:20:19,010 --> 01:20:21,530
do so it's only available on paid prime

1503
01:20:21,530 --> 01:20:23,420
plans but I wanted to mention that as

1504
01:20:23,420 --> 01:20:33,520
well questions

1505
01:20:36,350 --> 01:20:38,850
there's one here do you support thread

1506
01:20:38,850 --> 01:20:41,690
hunting based on network indicators

1507
01:20:41,690 --> 01:20:49,440
great question so yes and no so network

1508
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,180
indicators you know some of the demos I

1509
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:52,650
went over today obviously we're taking a

1510
01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:54,180
look at CPU addresses we're taking a

1511
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:59,630
look at commands but you know one of the

1512
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:35,739
[Music]

1513
01:21:47,260 --> 01:21:50,399
[Music]

1514
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:01,470
yeah so but one thing that you may have

1515
01:22:01,470 --> 01:22:04,860
noticed as part of that is you know

1516
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:06,570
these are statically extracted c2

1517
01:22:06,570 --> 01:22:11,280
domains and IP addresses if it was

1518
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:12,690
something that was dynamic ly computed

1519
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:15,360
by the sample that's not something

1520
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,430
that's going to be extracted today and

1521
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:18,840
it's not going to be something that is

1522
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:21,540
searchable by a metadata search that

1523
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:23,550
being said you know the way that the way

1524
01:22:23,550 --> 01:22:26,070
to address that is really by a full

1525
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:29,280
sandbox integration and I had mentioned

1526
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,130
way back at the beginning that we have

1527
01:22:31,130 --> 01:22:34,710
triage acting as an arbiter on poly

1528
01:22:34,710 --> 01:22:37,530
swarm but the output of triage and and a

1529
01:22:37,530 --> 01:22:38,820
few others Santa Bob we actually have

1530
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:43,650
several unannounced sand boxes what are

1531
01:22:43,650 --> 01:22:45,180
those are not actually being made

1532
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:48,080
available yeah it's on

1533
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:50,900
now we're hoping to get to it you know

1534
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:51,980
we have a lot of things we're building

1535
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:55,100
right now but we want to get to that

1536
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:57,830
probably sometime in quarter three this

1537
01:22:57,830 --> 01:23:00,860
year so when we have execution traces

1538
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:03,740
when we have the output of like say what

1539
01:23:03,740 --> 01:23:06,140
files are written to what registry keys

1540
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:08,990
are edited on Windows and what network

1541
01:23:08,990 --> 01:23:11,120
domain to reach out to those will be

1542
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:13,580
metadata searchable the same way as

1543
01:23:13,580 --> 01:23:15,310
everything else

1544
01:23:15,310 --> 01:23:18,860
based on those dynamic executions but

1545
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:21,020
again right now it's limited to what can

1546
01:23:21,020 --> 01:23:22,690
be statically extracted from the files

1547
01:23:22,690 --> 01:23:35,780
unfortunately all right so there's no

1548
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:38,890
more no more question

1549
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:41,450
good catch somebody said that Kali man

1550
01:23:41,450 --> 01:23:44,570
police swarmed on our not poly warm I

1551
01:23:44,570 --> 01:23:46,580
don't know what poly warm dot network is

1552
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:49,760
don't go there huh yes

1553
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:51,290
poly swarm this should be probably

1554
01:23:51,290 --> 01:24:00,440
swarmed I never all right so before we

1555
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:03,790
leave just want to share this we do have

1556
01:24:03,790 --> 01:24:07,340
some very exciting content and meetings

1557
01:24:07,340 --> 01:24:10,490
coming up we have the always top 10 for

1558
01:24:10,490 --> 01:24:15,290
API on this will be our next meeting on

1559
01:24:15,290 --> 01:24:18,650
April 25th then we're going to have Sam

1560
01:24:18,650 --> 01:24:25,130
bones cobalt CTF heard they had eight

1561
01:24:25,130 --> 01:24:27,380
issues in the state of New Jersey

1562
01:24:27,380 --> 01:24:29,420
mostly I believe was the unemployment

1563
01:24:29,420 --> 01:24:32,060
side because it was quoted in COBOL

1564
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:34,190
I'm not sure if you guys heard about it

1565
01:24:34,190 --> 01:24:36,530
or some of you are too young for to

1566
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:39,290
remember y2k but should be exciting to

1567
01:24:39,290 --> 01:24:41,390
look at Collin and play a game with it

1568
01:24:41,390 --> 01:24:44,060
and then on Saturday May 9 we're gonna

1569
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:48,220
have the piranhas Gucci Prada Gucci is

1570
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:51,050
this specifically the pond Itachi is a

1571
01:24:51,050 --> 01:24:53,830
very proper for some of us that are in

1572
01:24:53,830 --> 01:24:57,770
high intensive Wi-Fi environment so we

1573
01:24:57,770 --> 01:25:01,199
have some some cool stuff line up and

1574
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:03,360
we'll be publishing this meeting soon

1575
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,909
and you do and hopefully we'll have a

1576
01:25:05,909 --> 01:25:10,469
copy as well of the the extra slides so

1577
01:25:10,469 --> 01:25:12,659
I'll thank you all for coming and we'll

1578
