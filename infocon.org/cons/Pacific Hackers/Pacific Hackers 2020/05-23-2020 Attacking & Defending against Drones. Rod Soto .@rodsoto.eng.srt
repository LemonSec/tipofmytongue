1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,080
okay well thank you very much for

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,630
staying it's been a long day and I am

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,810
the last one usually not a very easy

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,220
spot to fill so today I'm going to speak

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,380
about attacking and defending drones

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,779
there's been there's several plenty of

7
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:24,539
presentations in the internet on the

8
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,710
internet about defending or attacking

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,289
drums I get a particular point of view

10
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:36,480
and I have two demos for you today hats

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,600
on videos obviously have to have to do

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,449
this record it right because one of the

13
00:00:44,449 --> 00:00:47,699
basically the demos one is an indoor

14
00:00:47,699 --> 00:00:50,789
drone that I was able to compromise use

15
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:53,699
an exploit during this pulley framework

16
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:55,140
and then the other one is it's an

17
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,749
outside drone that I was able to

18
00:00:57,749 --> 00:00:59,249
basically I created what I call a

19
00:00:59,249 --> 00:01:02,940
postman drawn fence and um we're gonna

20
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,080
look at this proof of concept we're

21
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,030
gonna talk about what the implications

22
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,040
for this things are for our environment

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,430
for our companies for our society

24
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,640
there's a lot going on with drones and I

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,880
believe there will be part of our lives

26
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,830
even more in the near future so let's

27
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:28,670
get started most of you know who I am

28
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,530
you talk to me in slack or you talk to

29
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,220
me in Pacific a curse or whatever I'm

30
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,030
very out in the community on brought

31
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,150
sorrow and I I'm a researcher with hack

32
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,790
Miami and Pacific hackers I worked at

33
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:50,760
Burrell x'q cos PETA which was a AI you

34
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:57,180
be a startup and now I work a Splunk and

35
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,850
I also worked at Akamai Technologies

36
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,530
kamae technologies a company that sees

37
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,780
around 30 percent or plus on the

38
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,380
Internet

39
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,920
so I have quite a bit of a experience on

40
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,229
security operation centers penetration

41
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,180
testing I still do penetration testing

42
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,569
and and Brett Demian

43
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:17,620
per time and I don't also quite a bit

44
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:23,109
above Trento and I also do a lot of

45
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:27,010
investigations in my spare time I won

46
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,969
the black hat catching flack in 2012 you

47
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:32,319
can google that it will see the picture

48
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,730
or my tweet and I could found it hack

49
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:42,219
Miami uh and Pacific hackers and usually

50
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:47,799
me and Marco and Kevin or Tyler we're

51
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:50,799
we're trying to move this on and in the

52
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:53,049
California and California and hopefully

53
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:54,909
we will have good news for you and new

54
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:56,530
things

55
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:01,689
soon in the future so let's talk a

56
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:04,419
little bit about drones or they're

57
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:09,040
called sometimes UAB or UAS so UAB is

58
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,829
uncrewed a aerial vehicle and UAS is a

59
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:17,230
unmanned aircraft system so the acronyms

60
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,829
are used differently depending on the

61
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:25,180
context but we can all agree is usually

62
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,810
an aircraft without a human pilot and

63
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:34,479
it's a an aircraft that sometimes have

64
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:36,430
different autonomy the autonomy can be

65
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,220
isolated autonomy or connect autonomy

66
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,540
for the most part is connected and

67
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,439
usually based on ground based

68
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:47,139
controllers the system communications so

69
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:48,329
the communication goes back and forth

70
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:52,870
and we are gonna look at it and how the

71
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,489
grace of autonomy can be more dangerous

72
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:57,790
and increase the amount of risk that we

73
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,439
look at on this devices a little brief

74
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:05,680
history there's plenty of history up

75
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,099
there

76
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:08,889
these are Nick Nick picks that I did for

77
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:11,859
my presentation on 1800s is the earliest

78
00:04:11,859 --> 00:04:14,889
recorded use of a UAV for war fighting

79
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:18,190
and basically was balloon carriers that

80
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,009
were used in the eighteen hundreds and

81
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:22,010
and

82
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:27,200
offensive manner in the 1900s in World

83
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,060
War two

84
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,070
and I put this in the tone during the

85
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,560
Vietnam War they were use for recon and

86
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,500
attack it's important it's important to

87
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,810
understand some of the dry the drivers

88
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:43,040
behind the the drones like the USA only

89
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,640
lost around 5,000 Airmen during the

90
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,130
Vietnam War that itself is a big driver

91
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:56,380
right it also came along with a

92
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,780
miniaturized components right the

93
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,780
development of how we shrunk electronic

94
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,310
components were able to put them

95
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,770
together and the development of RC

96
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,050
controllers in the fifties sixties and

97
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,420
seventies is also the commercial spread

98
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,400
like in hobby RC planes and stuff like

99
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,360
that then in the 1990s obviously we had

100
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,060
the US and Israel collaboration and we

101
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:24,950
got Gulf War One the late 1990s 2000 who

102
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,070
started seeing the weaponization use and

103
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:31,670
enhance the command and control

104
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,970
capabilities and obviously you know

105
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,880
since the war on terror which is posed

106
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,670
9/11 the drone said then a fundamental

107
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:46,360
piece of a weapon against other serves

108
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,230
the 2010s

109
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:52,190
we saw increased autonomy we saw the the

110
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,900
first aircraft carrier takeoff and

111
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,480
landing the application of stealth

112
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,820
technology can increase the moisture

113
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,550
availability and during the 2020s

114
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,550
which is right now where we are there's

115
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,490
a lot of the testing and deployment in

116
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,140
the commercial sector so things such as

117
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,930
delivery transportation surveillance

118
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,150
media and home use the leave it or not

119
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,410
there are there are right now in data

120
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,930
drums that will patrol your house will

121
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,450
patrol your house call the cops or send

122
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,700
you pictures of your outside this is

123
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,070
part of the future they're about to see

124
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:35,580
and there is definitely a a component of

125
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:40,290
of pervasiveness because components

126
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,150
usually like any industry components get

127
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,810
get cheaper the products get cheaper and

128
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,220
that's a growth the product is cheaper

129
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,860
and easier use then you become

130
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,800
widespread and with a weather widespread

131
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,220
this products then then a lot of new

132
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:00,890
applications come on so here's some UAS

133
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:05,070
milestones right 1917 first Ron Rustin

flying systems November 5th 2002 was

137
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:20,460
according to to some historians it was

138
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,090
the first American lethal drone attack I

139
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,790
didn't get into these specific of discs

140
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,770
the links are there for you I will be

141
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,950
shared a lot so you can click on it and

142
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:36,240
more in 2060 FAA issues the first

143
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,930
commercial drone permits you have to for

144
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,430
specific drone you have to register with

145
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,460
the FAA there are some restrictions we

146
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,570
look at it a little bit in 2010 friends

147
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,970
company name parrot releases the first

148

commercial Wi-Fi controlled drone parrot

149
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:57,000
is a very popular brand they actually

150
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,680
have some sort of an open-source drone

151
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,290
that many people are working on it and

152
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:05,010
we're gonna look at it today so this has

153
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,340
definitely helped the the adoption of

154
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:13,740
this type of assistance in February 2012

155
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,120
better 2012 we hacked Miami did a

156
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:24,210
created a prototype of a drum and I put

157
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,220
the link there you can actually see it

158
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,500
this was February 2012 we're trying to

159
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,110
actually submit for the dark back dot

160
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,690
back talent we actually submitted a

161
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,880
proposal for that for challenge and I

162
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,549
will tell you more about it later in

163
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,590
this presentation

164

00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,020
by a drone I don't know why this is not

168
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,430
happening right now this is one of the

169
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,870
things that actually I discovered as I

170
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,460
was doing this research

171
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:01,740
20:18 first air kill and by developed by

172
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,410
the United States and in 2020 we have

173
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,600
things such as the development or the

174
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,470
delivery of drones of carbon 19 kids in

175
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,560
Ghana for example and many others um

176
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,350
many other situations by the way I

177
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:19,170
actually research on that famous couple

178
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,020
that supposedly was in a cruise in Japan

179
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,760
and they got wine by a drunk apparently

180
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,760
that was a prank that was not true uh so

181
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,430
so yeah so that was not true so they the

182
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,190
drunk did not get to the to the cruise

183
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,190
and they're not deliver one so here's

184
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,700
some of the general components of the

185
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,490
UAVs obviously you have to have a body

186
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,380
the body obviously has to be aerodynamic

187
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,120
you need a power supply in a platform

188
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,460
you need a computer unit which is most

189
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,510
of the processing and the the actual

190
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,220
coordination of the things the sensors

191
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,530
actuators and obviously with the

192
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:59,040
software resides you can see that

193
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,050
diagram that I took that diagram for

194
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,550
Wikipedia it this is an overview here

195
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,740
are some of the general components of a

196
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,360
drone they may vary depending on the

197
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,720
brand

198
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,820
depending on the size depending of the

199
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,610
usage so most of them have some sort of

200
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:18,350
a rotor it's no more than a fixed-wing

201
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:22,020
some of them have flight controllers

202
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,590
some of them have GPS some of them have

203
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,030
satellite communications some more than

204
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,610
are controlled by a Wi-Fi or are see

205
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,790
some more than half what is called fpv

206
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:35,130
first-person different which is it's

207
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,140
some sort of a goggles allow you to do

208
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:41,070
pilot and a maneuver the the drones so

209
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,680
there's there's plenty of differences in

210
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,750
components but in general you have a

211
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,430
structure some sort of a rudder or

212
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:54,110
propulsion system so sort of our dynamic

213
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,700
they're based on weight and materials

214
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,570
and some sort of a unit that will

215
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,259
control the rotors and

216
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:04,119
and the sensors to keep this thing

217
00:11:04,119 --> 00:11:06,669
moving and going against something that

218
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:10,410
controls it that's that's pretty much it

219
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:14,279
here the some of the used examples

220
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:17,169
mostly divided military and civilian in

221
00:11:17,169 --> 00:11:18,970
the military we have things that recon

222
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,449
logistics combat surveillance that we're

223
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:24,039
very familiar with military and

224
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:27,129
disability we have in this show which we

225
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:29,889
had the drones that are surveying for

226
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:33,879
example of power lines or utilities or

227
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:36,939
construction like for example I know of

228
00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:38,410
some companies that for example if they

229
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,049
do your roof inspection you will

230
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:44,169
probably be done by drawing you will not

231
00:11:44,169 --> 00:11:45,609
see this guy like climbing on whatever

232
00:11:45,609 --> 00:11:47,919
they're nowadays they they bring a drone

233
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:50,979
and the drum goes up and and and you

234
00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:53,319
know how to pilot it in fact our last

235
00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:56,499
video at Miami conference that we did in

236
00:11:56,499 --> 00:11:59,529
Miami Beach parts of it was filmed by

237
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:03,160
drone the the actual photographer was a

238
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,829
drone pilot and this is again this is

239
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:12,039
again the adaptation of new tech and to

240
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:15,160
new up into businesses so expect more of

241
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,239
these we also have delivery inspections

242
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,910
and photography just like a name it

243
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:24,939
photography also is becoming sort of

244
00:12:24,939 --> 00:12:27,519
popular there are some available

245
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,350
commercial courses would you get

246
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,359
certified as a pilot and then you can

247
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,949
you know if you know you can offer the

248
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:39,100
to the pilot for events and some news

249
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,949
channels actually have higher drone

250
00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:44,919
pilots and of course you have home for

251
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:47,109
security entertainment which is

252
00:12:47,109 --> 00:12:50,139
obviously everybody wants to have fun

253
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:51,519
with these things or photography

254
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,829
personal photography all right so of

255
00:12:56,829 --> 00:12:59,439
course there are risks about it and now

256
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:01,899
we did not come here to just hear about

257
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:04,989
the knives and and the Rosie thinks

258
00:13:04,989 --> 00:13:07,089
about these devices where we're trying

259
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:09,579
to look at this on the from the

260
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:12,279
perspective of risk from the perspective

261
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:14,829
being weaponized in using malicious

262
00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:15,590
manners

263
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:18,980
so so basically in if we're looking at

264
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,920
risk here's some of the the general

265
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,150
known risks associated with with drum

266
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:33,140
usage right so one of them is civilian

267
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:36,370
misuse so in Sevilla misuse you have

268
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:39,470
things that have for example drones that

269
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:45,160
had hit airplanes you have things that

270
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,690
invasion of privacy we have a lot of

271
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,840
people that have used drones to play

272
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,780
Devon for example on nudist beaches

273
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,930
there's actually you throw for people

274
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,540
throwing sandals at it there's some some

275
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,790
person that actually basically flu and

276
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:07,190
he drawn into a if a nudist beach and we

277
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:11,960
do have things such as smuggling by

278
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,330
criminal gangs this has happen in jails

279
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:19,180
far away it has become survey a more

280
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,910
prevalent and used NGOs because they

281
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:26,660
they procure forms that procure food

282
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,920
that procure drugs

283
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,350
so so this things are able to bypass

284
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,840
defenses and in at times even civilians

285
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,450
from this from jails and they're able to

286
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,920
do it and one of the things they're

287
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,420
doing is actually doing it about the

288
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,790
across the border there they're sending

289
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,320
drugs as well this is just happening

290
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,210
everywhere bow and only here it's it's

291
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:51,890
it's becoming a unfortunately in the

292
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:55,730
usage of this type of devices we do have

293
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,690
a recent case of alerts done by the

294
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,240
Department of interior's were which been

295
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,670
Chinese made drums and DGI

296
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:11,810
which is say a Chinese company has been

297
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:16,970
has been pointed out by some agencies

298
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:21,250
including some security agencies as

299
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,230
possibly send in telemetry data that may

300
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,480
indicate

301
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,860
sensitive information to a foreign

302
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,310
intelligence sir

303
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:33,600
so this this they uses this of this

304
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,009
devices had been actually forbidden and

305
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:39,660
there was some a company that was

306
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,480
actually donating this devices so the

307
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,250
problem with this and we're about to see

308
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,290
that in the tread surface is that we

309
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,930
many times these things can connect back

310
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,509
call back home but we don't know and

311
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:56,370
that is a definite effect and of course

312
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,300
we have the weaponization on the

313
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:03,209
terrorists using drones and I put a

314
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:04,560
picture there as you can see you can

315
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,410
actually even by a flamethrower when you

316
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:09,660
have time you go in and watch the bee is

317
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:13,529
pretty funny this thing is like throwing

318
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:15,870
flames at everything and and you know

319
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,660
you you put the tag the humans are gonna

320
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,440
find a way to make it crazy so here's

321
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:29,399
some recent drone instance the one in

322
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,519
2019 which is the attack against Saudi

323
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:35,250
your uncle I and I do have a take on

324
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,370
this of what happened and and I'll leave

325
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:42,990
this for the end obviously we saw this I

326
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,660
think everybody looked at it which is

327
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,120
what happen in Chile during the the

328
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,819
protests which is as you can see in the

329
00:16:50,819 --> 00:16:53,000
picture there's a number of people

330
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,149
directing lasers this lasers borrow it

331
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,160
can be bought in Amazon you can you can

332
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,589
get the slicers III did research on this

333
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:05,220
and if you see the video you you should

334
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,959
take the time see the video as well you

335
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,909
can see how it overwhelms this drawing

336
00:17:08,909 --> 00:17:11,220
the drone eventually crash so that was

337
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,609
kind of cool to see but it tells you

338
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:16,619
that there are ways to counteract these

339
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,799
things and and just like there used the

340
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:25,169
there is a number of ideas and people

341
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,809
using things to counteract the use of

342
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:30,390
this machines and of course we would

343
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,760
with the unfortunate pandemic we're

344
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,510
going through the Chinese where the

345
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,179
first ones to use drones to talk to

346
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:42,320
people and encourage them rotation mark

347
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,049
to go back home the Chinese led with

348
00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:47,399
this we're leading with this because

349
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,260
there was repeating in the u.s. it was

350
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,549
forbidden in Italy it was repeated

351
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:53,909
everywhere so it is there the

352
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:56,520
Republicans are using drones across the

353
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:02,010
world to enforce quarantines and enforce

354
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:07,169
security obviously so here's a another

355
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,679
servant notorious but also an example

356
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:13,740
that these things can be used for very

357
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,960
nefarious purposes though the one to the

358
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:22,440
left is a drone basically carrying a gas

359
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:28,049
grenades in Afghanistan and the right

360
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:33,090
one is the the recent incident happened

361
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,940
in Venezuela where apparently there were

362
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,620
some drones that were targeting the

363
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,960
president the countermeasures worked by

364
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,610
the way if you actually look at the

365
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,720
video you can see how the drones to

366
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,529
start moving crazy

367
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:46,679
those are countermeasures and you can

368
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:47,880
see how exploded

369
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,570
II still still caused quite a bit of a

370
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:54,270
of a rumble when this was used but this

371
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,890
tells you that these things can be used

372
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,580
and it was also discovered that most of

373
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,840
these drones for commercial and that's

374
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,010
what about to get into it

375
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:10,230
here's a category of drones I know you

376
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,130
had the Nano

377
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,669
which is something that is this is

378
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:20,429
something less than that 200 grams there

379
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:26,580
in the places metric sorry for for you

380
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,940
can do your compressions to Imperial but

381
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:33,120
the operating altitude is usually less

382
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:40,919
than 90 meters the range is less the 100

383
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,830
meters the payload is obviously less

384
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,750
than 200 grams then you have the micro

385
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,360
the mini the small in the tactical right

386
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,340
here we're gonna talk about the the the

387
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:54,299
small what what I found a major caused

388
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:55,950
this mall

389
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:00,840
a unmanned aircraft vehicles right so

390
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,899
this category is less than 55 pounds

391
00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:08,340
Chito quarter you can buy this in Best

392
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,279
Buy you can buy this in anywhere fries

393
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:14,519
i'ma tone any better already and easy to

394
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:17,220
fly many of them have pre-programmed

395
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:22,200
flying functions do a 360 return to

396
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:28,260
launch takeoff from my hand stay static

397
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,690
some of them even have GPS we're gonna

398
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,850
see one today which is the one that I

399
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,330
used the demo for the demo

400
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:38,399
they are commercially available no

401
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:39,120
restrictions

402
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,820
nobody there's you had to register but

403
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,769
the registration is almost like an honor

404
00:20:46,769 --> 00:20:47,309
system

405
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:51,269
I mean if we have somebody that takes an

406
00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:53,610
identity or uses or impersonate somebody

407
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,940
I'm not sure how accurate that is once

408
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:01,799
the person acquires the system some of

409
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:04,409
them can carry a few pounds to pay looks

410
00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:06,330
like you could see in the last picture I

411
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:09,630
this mall the very small ones like the

412
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,460
Nano or the micro so the main they may

413
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,490
not have much of the payload bunch of a

414
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,580
payload there's still Mike Harrison but

415
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,950
the the bigger ones

416
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,710
I definitely able to do so they can

417
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,389
evade most of the current come to

418
00:21:24,389 --> 00:21:27,450
Mistress there is no way to detect these

419
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:30,330
things they fly too low the fingerprint

420
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:34,710
is also very small and they're easy to

421
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,289
conceal deploy and actually that's what

422
00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:39,450
happened and apparently in the plot in

423
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,399
South America where these things were

424
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:43,950
shipped they were that were assembled

425
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,200
there were carry in different places

426
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,659
different different operators stupid

427
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:50,730
assemble them together and put together

428
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,429
the operation that's a danger that's one

429
00:21:53,429 --> 00:21:56,429
of the dangers of distance and they can

430
00:21:56,429 --> 00:21:59,549
be used in multiple numbers with no

431
00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:03,029
infrastructure you can actually manage

432
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:09,420
this with Wi-Fi or RC controllers and

433
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:12,210
you can actually get a phone with the

434
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:17,750
app and that's it you're ready to go and

435
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:22,820
we're about to see the implications of

436
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:27,120
the of this I guess items I just spoke

437
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,670
about but remember we're trying to look

438
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,140
at this from the wrist perspective

439
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,700
obviously you look at this from the

440
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,230
market perspective and you're a person

441
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:36,330
you're a law-abiding citizen you

442
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,760
obviously this things are pretty Austin

443
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,400
you can fly then I purchase several of

444
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,700
them and I had a lot of fun and my kids

445
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,010
love them and it teaches in technology

446
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:49,500
but unfortunately there's another use of

447
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,340
this so here is something that I've

448
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:57,990
found from Michael miker basically has

449
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:03,000
an aspect of the unmanned aerial systems

450
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,630
so this spectrum goes from the operators

451
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:10,260
in can't the technical complexity the

452
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,680
the standardization the flight controls

453
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,010
the number of aircraft the command and

454
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:19,620
control links and the cyber productions

455
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:23,670
so so basically you can have a person

456
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:26,550
that is on inform and basically flies

457
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,990
the drum close to the air for the

458
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,750
airport clay gets closed

459
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,760
that is something unintended that's me

460
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:37,080
shoes you can buy a parrot like a like a

461
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,220
Matic for example or a any other in the

462
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,570
same category and they will fly up to

463
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:48,180
over a thousand feet so you could if

464
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:51,720
you're close to an airport you can cause

465
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,980
a lot of issues here including flying

466
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:59,040
aircraft as well so the the the

467
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,410
technical complexity he goes from toys

468
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,420
to highly sophisticated so we have

469
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,500
consumer great things that you can buy

470
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,480
things that are commercial graded for

471
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,210
example the drone there are photographer

472
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:13,530
years it's a little more expensive

473
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:17,340
usually those drones cost above the

474
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:21,090
thousand dollar mark and we had things

475
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,919
that

476
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,529
flight control for example that some of

477
00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:26,909
the additional navigation you can use

478
00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:28,590
the the the Goebbels

479
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:31,739
you can use GPS waypoints and some of

480
00:24:31,739 --> 00:24:34,559
them you have automatic return to launch

481
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,330
we're gonna see that today and one of

482
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:39,600
the demos and remote controller and also

483
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,100
we have a number of aircrafts the

484
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,429
concept of swarms which is sending a

485
00:24:47,429 --> 00:24:51,629
bunch of drones in a coordinated manner

486
00:24:51,629 --> 00:24:53,609
or a coordinated manner the pencil

487
00:24:53,609 --> 00:24:55,440
number of operators you missed you pull

488
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,559
it off it can definitely cause a lot of

489
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,389
trouble and depending on will not drawn

490
00:25:00,389 --> 00:25:02,639
you're using and what type of balaam you

491
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:04,919
can you can you can carry that's

492
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:08,070
something you have to consider and then

493
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,340
of course cyber protections if you have

494
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,799
anything that is Wi-Fi connected

495
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:16,919
obviously Wi-Fi is an attack vector if

496
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:19,440
you if you disconnects by an RF RF is

497
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,059
the attack vector if you have satellite

498
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:23,999
and satellites attack sector so so we're

499
00:25:23,999 --> 00:25:28,440
gonna see this in a minute of how on the

500
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,129
tech surface this is sort of extensive

501
00:25:32,129 --> 00:25:35,539
but it's interesting how these

502
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:38,549
researchers divided this then basically

503
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:43,739
we in between the CI a confidentiality

504
00:25:43,739 --> 00:25:46,559
integrity and availability so as you can

505
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,909
see here there is a number of attack

506
00:25:50,909 --> 00:25:56,480
vectors that target network staff target

507
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,379
kinetic stuff target humans target

508
00:26:00,379 --> 00:26:06,059
communication links and the tread

509
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:08,879
surface can definitely be quite

510
00:26:08,879 --> 00:26:12,029
extensive bending on the number of

511
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:16,139
either components sensors and features

512
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:19,350
of the machine that we're looking at the

513
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,700
ones that we're looking at here are

514
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,789
pretty simple mostly controlled by Wi-Fi

515
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:26,549
the outdoor we're gonna look today at

516
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:33,080
GPS and that those type of drums

517
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,849
according to what I research are not

518
00:26:35,849 --> 00:26:36,860
really

519
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,950
major tread can they can be useful

520
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:41,510
option like for something was wrong case

521
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,340
that somebody flew a drone and there was

522
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,559
a president speaking in Europe and they

523
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:47,390
had to stop the summit because obviously

524
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:49,429
they don't know that this drum has

525
00:26:49,429 --> 00:26:52,220
something in it or whatever but think

526
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:56,480
about it a commercial something that you

527
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,170
can order from Hamas on disrupted a

528
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:04,690
president's meeting so that is actually

529
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,679
one of the problems with this things

530
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:08,030
because they're small and they're easy

531
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:12,290
to conceal and about to show you not

532
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:16,240
easy to detect they can represent a

533
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,760
serious threat mostly I would say in in

534
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,270
the when we're talking about small small

535
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,460
drones they can they can be used for

536
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,960
something to disable things like

537
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,990
turbines and that things are there the

538
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,580
have brothers or things that have

539
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,040
engines with the what the the drone can

540
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:38,120
get in and and and damage it or even for

541
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,799
assassination depends are clever and and

542
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:48,049
how sophisticated the plot can get so

543
00:27:48,049 --> 00:27:50,840
here's some of the examples right how

544
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,210
will attack control obviously we we need

545
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,429
to look at sensors and the sensors we

546
00:27:55,429 --> 00:27:57,860
have video audio navigation you can

547
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:02,540
blind the drone with lasers you can one

548
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,520
of the theories that are read about what

549
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,429
happened in Chile was that the heat from

550
00:28:07,429 --> 00:28:09,950
so many laser pointers eventually

551
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:13,370
overloaded the sensors same thing as the

552
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:15,980
cameras and you will see actually doing

553
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,570
and doing my first demo you will see

554
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,460
that the drum actually wants you to say

555
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:23,660
hey I can't see very well the the vision

556
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,030
of the disability is not very well so

557
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,970
I'm not sure if I should there might be

558
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:32,059
a malfunction satisfying you see that I

559
00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:35,120
found that very interesting so that

560
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,830
tells me that if I pointed something

561
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,110
doesn't have to be a laser

562
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:41,929
but-but-but-but a visual stimuli that is

563
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:44,030
strong enough that overwhelms the camera

564
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:47,929
I might be able to in fact disrupt the

565
00:28:47,929 --> 00:28:50,480
flight of this for this

566
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,870
air pack the physical labor kinetic

567
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:56,720
write kinetic you can shoot you can

568
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,110
shoot you can throw a net you can always

569
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:03,140
do it I so there's been cases people are

570
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,660
actually being charged because a shot at

571
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:10,630
a drone with a shotgun the link layer

572
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:14,990
basically what we want is telemetry in

573
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:17,179
the lemon tree we want to destroy things

574
00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:22,250
like things such as line of sight or we

575
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,020
want to overwhelm in like jamming or

576
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,720
DDoS it which is distributed and ILO

577
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,669
service may be sent several points of

578
00:29:28,669 --> 00:29:30,830
stimuli that basically confuse the

579
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:34,040
sensors and then if there is not enough

580
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,400
of a countermeasures but what we're

581
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,140
sending the drum might be able to keep

582
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,540
this strap or basically we'll decide to

583
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,000
do an idea which is referred to to

584
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,020
launch on encases or crash network layer

585
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,710
we have basically we have to target

586
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:54,049
either the RF component the Wi-Fi

587
00:29:54,049 --> 00:29:56,570
component satellite or even mobile which

588
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:59,360
is some of the things that are being

589
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,350
implemented with the attainment of or of

590
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:09,070
the the beginning of bringing cellular

591
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:13,120
either cellular networks and things like

592
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,549
fine key so so those are definitely

593
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:20,809
things that we have to consider if we're

594
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:23,720
going to attack this in on the network

595
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,850
layer in this case what you're gonna see

596
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:28,580
basically when a compromised Wi-Fi over

597
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:32,390
if it was an if' based controller you

598
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:34,580
can overwhelm it or you can use a jammer

599
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,590
or there are certain problems where I

600
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,580
will go in in a minute

601
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,929
and then of course there's a traffic

602
00:30:38,929 --> 00:30:42,169
controller the traffic control you had

603
00:30:42,169 --> 00:30:44,840
this thing's the things like the GNSS

604
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,110
GPS or a DSP so then you can jam or

605
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:52,760
support GBS you can create objects would

606
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,690
ideally for example that will trigger

607
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:58,610
collision avoiding collision mechanisms

608
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:01,730
or if they're using radar it will force

609
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:02,309
the

610
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:08,279
the the actual aircraft to to divert so

611
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:10,649
that's these are some of the vectors

612
00:31:10,649 --> 00:31:14,669
that we'll be looking at so let's look

613
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:18,450
at how we will defend the consistence

614
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:21,570
number one is usually its embedded in

615
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:22,889
some of the commercial drones to deal

616
00:31:22,889 --> 00:31:25,369
fans your friends is basically embedded

617
00:31:25,369 --> 00:31:27,929
geofencing software meaning there is a

618
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:31,940
number of coordinates where one's the

619
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:35,580
the the aircraft the tech stars nearby

620
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:40,289
on the only flying system it will not go

621
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:42,479
in it or it will retreat from it because

622
00:31:42,479 --> 00:31:45,719
it's basically marked as no flights on

623
00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:48,749
and this is being used or in the airport

624
00:31:48,749 --> 00:31:50,879
and it's being used for many other

625
00:31:50,879 --> 00:31:55,099
events where they do not want obviously

626
00:31:55,099 --> 00:31:59,249
drawn intrusions of course there's again

627
00:31:59,249 --> 00:32:01,889
the manufacturers have done some effort

628
00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:04,049
and that this into their products

629
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:07,200
however as we saw recently on Heathrow

630
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,169
heater was paralyzed for I believe a

631
00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:12,749
couple of days because somebody was just

632
00:32:12,749 --> 00:32:17,549
flying a drum around the texture of

633
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:22,739
Raiders which are specifically designed

634
00:32:22,739 --> 00:32:26,070
for you a beat UAVs are usually smaller

635
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:30,690
and very hard to detect by traditional

636
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:33,839
Raiders so there is a new generation of

637
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:36,450
Raider assistance are being adapted or

638
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,210
created for the sole purpose of

639
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:43,559
detecting UAVs all the detection systems

640
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:47,249
that I was every she's rustic basically

641
00:32:47,249 --> 00:32:50,309
detecting the sound of the rotors this

642
00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:53,759
things cannot stop fixed-wing or free

643
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:59,129
fall rotors or or sound that can be poof

644
00:32:59,129 --> 00:33:02,159
and replayed to actually confuse the the

645
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,769
detection systems so this is some sad

646
00:33:04,769 --> 00:33:06,960
sort of weakness and it cannot be

647
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,369
deployed as a single as a single measure

648
00:33:10,369 --> 00:33:15,540
radiofrequency most of the

649
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,600
look at that were commercially available

650
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,010
we're using sort of about RS

651
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:26,520
command-and-control Inc and this can be

652
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,190
detected by different means and they can

653
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:34,230
be attacked we would see that this can

654
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:37,050
also be evaded by going radio silent and

655
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:39,210
using some sort of a inertial navigation

656
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,730
system which is I won't get into this

657
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:44,580
yet and it's also electro-optical

658
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,130
electro-optical is basically optical and

659
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:50,340
thermal sensors that may detect sort of

660
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,370
a heat signature what happens

661
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:54,540
unfortunately with the system since

662
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,910
today they may confuse and do false

663
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,760
positives with actual birds because of

664
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:05,390
the heat that they produce so here's a

665
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:09,000
defense of some of the tools for defense

666
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,100
and we had things here such as the

667
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,139
jamming the c2 you can jam the c2 by

668
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:18,929
using a some sort of icon this this is

669
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:20,399
actually available you can look at it

670
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,820
and in it and usually the frequencies

671
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,199
that some of these drones fly is

672
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,330
actually two point four or five point

673
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:30,360
nine gigahertz so basically what you

674
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,149
have is some sort of a a device and that

675
00:34:33,149 --> 00:34:34,969
looks almost like a yagi antenna

676
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:38,760
attached to some pump stock that's

677
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,850
basically targeting a drone and and and

678
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:45,540
attend to to basically an excitement lit

679
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:48,449
like I said before depending of the

680
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:49,800
system that you're targeting this may

681
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:59,550
work or not also like I said before you

682
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:05,340
can attempt to tamper with a global

683
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,890
navigation system jamming the problem

684
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,240
with doing this is there might be

685
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,200
collateral damage like people are

686
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,780
driving around will be affected

687
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,050
airplanes are they rely on this might be

688
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:22,350
affected a lot of this stuff by the way

689
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:26,670
that I'm saying is borderline can get

690
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:29,190
you legal trouble so I

691
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,540
personally wouldn't do these things

692
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:34,020
unless there is a rules of engagement

693
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:37,740
and illegal in a legal context that

694
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:41,880
allows to do this so always considered

695
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,069
that in mind I get our sometimes calls

696
00:35:44,069 --> 00:35:48,839
from from friends and colleagues they

697
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:50,670
tell me hey I had this problem at one

698
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:53,310
time somebody caught me asked me we got

699
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,079
this person that's constantly flying

700
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:58,349
their drama Bob close to our building we

701
00:35:58,349 --> 00:36:03,359
think he's trying to crack Wi-Fi or some

702
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,990
of our products when you do this type of

703
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:09,660
things you always have to consider the

704
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,420
legal framework because the one I get in

705
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,910
trouble obviously and if you use a

706
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:17,460
condom measure that is overwhelming

707
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,589
they're my vehicle aural damage they've

708
00:36:19,589 --> 00:36:22,250
met and the collateral damage may bring

709
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:24,660
legal consequence so be careful with

710
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:29,730
this also you have the ABS B which

711
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,680
basically I think somebody spoke today

712
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,130
about this doing the SDR talk at hack

713
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:39,359
Miami you can generate fake aircraft via

714
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,160
SDR there are several as they are

715
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,660
available I will show you picture some

716
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,240
of them two over one vertebrae there

717
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,550
trigger collision avoidance systems we

718
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:50,040
had a presentation hack Miami 2017 by

719
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,810
wills neck

720
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,089
there's the youtube link so you can see

721
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:56,640
it and it's something that you that you

722
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:02,160
should definitely review course the

723
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,380
kinetic defense and you can you can't

724
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,569
shoot the drone point cutter you get

725
00:37:06,569 --> 00:37:08,460
that looks very silly but hey you still

726
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,950
do it there is you can throw like a net

727
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:15,359
on it and then you know who knows maybe

728
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,740
there's an extra concept when you go to

729
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,780
pick it up so I'm not sure about these

730
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,420
things but they still record you can see

731
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:26,640
using here's something that I wanted to

732
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,599
talk to you about and that is you have

733
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:31,920
to be careful on the counter

734
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,260
countermeasures

735
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:36,690
so the count accomplishments are things

736
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:39,420
that can be used to bypass many of these

737
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,569
defenses that we looked at you can put

738
00:37:42,569 --> 00:37:43,300
on those defenses

739
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,080
together but there's still there's still

740
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,340
encountered countermeasures that may

741
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,860
allow malicious actors to go through and

742
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,200
do success for their attack I put a

743
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,150
picture there or what you see there is

744
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:57,900
supposed to be a movie

745
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,480
kamikaze drawn now as you can see there

746
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,050
is fixed win right so when you have

747
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:08,220
things like fixed-wing inertial

748
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:12,880
navigation system is embedded autonomous

749
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,100
navigation multi-layer sensor um

750
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,100
bod that mesh like resilience we

751
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,130
actually proposed this in DARPA

752
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:26,770
challenge in 2012 in 2012 we made a

753
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:31,300
proposal the body of drones that we're

754
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,250
gonna use basically we're gonna

755
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,920
emulating what sues the Sioux smog were

756
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,570
did that Sue's p2p which basically as

757
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:42,070
one of the sea toots balls then the

758
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,170
other one takes over and then if you

759
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:46,450
have a mesh network you can always

760
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:50,290
bounce around the situ in a way that the

761
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:53,530
botnet continues to be operated that it

762
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:57,930
this is a bonnet type of countermeasure

763
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:01,390
technique which is not new and we

764
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:03,970
propose do this in doing the DARPA

765
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,650
challenge we're gonna make a bunch of

766
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:10,480
drones off the shelf and and develop the

767
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,280
software based on some of the fondants

768
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,900
that we were looking at we were not

769
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,610
effective so unfortunately never so

770
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:17,860
fruition of this but that's definitely

771
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:20,830
something that will if you're using for

772
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,600
example a group of drums or what I call

773
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,730
the swarm if you use something like a

774
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:31,300
mesh like C to peer-to-peer command and

775
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,160
control where you can actually extend

776
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,890
the range of it even if one of them K

777
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:40,270
gets taken down or the the C to blink to

778
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:41,710
controller gets taken down

779
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:44,080
that's that definitely increases the

780
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,780
chances that attack will be successful

781
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:51,880
same thing with fixed-wing fixed wing

782
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,690
systems can for example glide even if

783
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:56,800
you turn off the

784
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,610
entire system it would still fly and he

785
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,800
was still go through which is what I

786
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,640
think happened in the incident in Saudi

787
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,330
Aramco I believe that these individuals

788
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:13,300
use drones that were fixed-wing that had

789
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,820
embedded navigation systems they had

790
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:18,730
they had to have some sort of a recon a

791
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:23,050
target and then once they got close to

792
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:26,100
it they must have turn off every kind of

793
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:29,310
signature what are the signatures he

794
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:33,640
repulsion noise and they bypassed a

795
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,500
number of confirmations including a

796
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:40,720
Patrick a patriot defense system so this

797
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,770
is to tell you that these things can

798
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:50,580
succeed and can bypass defenses of

799
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:54,040
against or content measures against

800
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,650
alone so this is a clear and present

801
00:40:56,650 --> 00:41:00,160
threat that can see that can be used for

802
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,740
malicious actors and we had pay

803
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:05,380
attention to this the head I'm sure

804
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,820
there will be a market develop around

805
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,370
these things there is already but right

806
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:14,830
now several of this devices can be

807
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:20,100
successful if if we have a clever and

808
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,790
sophisticated

809
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:23,740
Adolphe adversary to perform an attack

810
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:27,670
and the the Houthi Kamikaze promise a

811
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:30,580
proof of that then you couldn't get you

812
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:34,800
can get more more defenses that the

813
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,340
saudi aramco have right so all right so

814
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:42,430
here's some of the tools I told you I

815
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:48,780
was gonna give you some pictures the

816
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:52,060
available stuff in the in the market so

817
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:54,760
obviously hack RF is one of them I have

818
00:41:54,760 --> 00:42:00,190
one it's a nice research tool I don't

819
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:03,280
think is that powerful to create for

820
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,980
example a drone fans or or to emulate

821
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:08,830
out a gun shooting put like a yeah

822
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:09,910
Guiana and

823
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:16,230
drum my my research did not produce a

824
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:19,660
let's say successful results using this

825
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:22,780
as a contour measure there are yeah

826
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:25,210
jammers you can you can use jammers as

827
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:29,680
well again the jammers be careful with

828
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,480
jamming jamming can get you in trouble

829
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,140
so if you're gonna use this or you're in

830
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:39,760
a place there's a security context and

831
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,680
legal context that allow you to do this

832
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,220
things like that this has to be in a

833
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:48,430
context what is lawful so you just can

834
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:50,650
get and say I don't want people to fly

835
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:52,720
above my house it's just gonna put a

836
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,270
jammer that you can't do that by the way

837
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:57,309
doing it might capture the flag games I

838
00:42:57,309 --> 00:43:00,609
seen people Jam the actual spectrum like

839
00:43:00,609 --> 00:43:02,950
I could impose the Twitter that people

840
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:07,119
do not actually do research either Wi-Fi

841
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,210
and I had warned people this is illegal

842
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:12,819
you can't do that so I don't all the

843
00:43:12,819 --> 00:43:14,200
know you might be in one country with

844
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,940
this is legal but in the United States

845
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,890
this is not legal be careful again I

846
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:22,510
cannot emphasize this enough so so these

847
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:25,450
are some of the toys I guess I call some

848
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:27,130
of the toys because they're not really

849
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:29,829
production don't rely on this you wanna

850
00:43:29,829 --> 00:43:32,140
do some research and you are like for

851
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,819
example a law enforcement organization

852
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:36,849
or you're in a big organization you you

853
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:39,220
wanna use commercial grade stuff and you

854
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,890
want to test it if you want a researcher

855
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:44,260
and you you you want to test these

856
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:46,720
things against certain things then yeah

857
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,049
there's a value put but I my experience

858
00:43:50,049 --> 00:43:51,910
is that these things even though they're

859
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:54,819
available they are not how can I say

860
00:43:54,819 --> 00:43:58,510
this they're not equal to the tray the

861
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:01,900
were facing and there's a presentation

862
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:05,170
from Henry's a coffee in hack Miami that

863
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:08,230
I that I suggest you to watch where he

864
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:10,660
goes more than that of some of the the

865
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:13,900
things that are available for contouring

866
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,420
drones so here's some of the interesting

867
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,460
tools one of them I'm gonna use today

868
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:21,609
and one of them is drones flooring which

869
00:44:21,609 --> 00:44:23,640
targets in attack wrong

870
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:27,270
mostly nano if you remember the category

871
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:29,700
that we have we're gonna be targeting

872
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,320
nano drones

873
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,330
there's also drone Jack and there's also

874
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:35,810
sky Jack some of these target obviously

875
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:40,020
manufacturers and these are things that

876
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,790
you can look at we may give you some

877
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:45,600
ideas for attack vectors and it may give

878
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,600
you some educational knowledge about how

879
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,370
some of the things that we have this

880
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:54,780
cost about targeting this systems so

881
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:58,020
here's let's go on the demo so here's my

882
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:01,830
first demo my first demo is a DJI tell

883
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:04,730
which is a Endor

884
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:10,680
it's an indoor drawn nano as a video

885
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:14,760
resolution is 720p can fly up to 100

886
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,700
meters it weights around 80 grams it can

887
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,890
fly it around 10 minutes not 30 around

888
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:27,570
10 minutes then go up to 29 km/h that I

889
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:30,030
haven't tested and you can you can fly

890
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:32,760
up to 100 meters that I did not test

891
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:36,720
either but it depends mainly on Wi-Fi so

892
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,360
here's the screenshot so you understand

893
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,400
the video well what you see in the top

894
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:46,050
left this me you've seen Callie on the

895
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:48,720
top prize is drums ploy you know the

896
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:53,130
bottom right is the the actual video

897
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:56,580
from the drama so let's watch it see if

898
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:01,260
I can just go straight into it see my

899
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,440
screen

900
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:08,280
just yes we can see it okay all right

901
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:14,100
cool so here's a video let me so here we

902
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,680
go there's no audio so I think I can go

903
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,290
and talked about it so what you see it

904
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:21,480
below is basically the operator new

905
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:25,110
operator which was my girlfriend Angie

906
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:28,130
very not super to help me basically

907
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:30,480
connects to the drone the drone is on

908
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,890
top of the tables you can see now we

909
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:35,820
have connection we can see the video it

910
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:36,960
gives you a warning it's just you the

911
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,360
ambient light is too weak and now I ask

912
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:43,620
you to take off Ron takes off and as

913
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:45,150
soon as the drone takes off

914
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:50,130
I run the the attacking framework with

915
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:51,840
the attacking framework basically what

916
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,900
I'm doing is trying to find the link

917
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:59,160
between the cellphone and the drum right

918
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:04,380
sir this is a Wi-Fi attack basically the

919
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:09,540
most of this off the shell in door and

920
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:12,300
someone out there drones have passwords

921
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,950
that are too easy that's one two three

922
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:15,840
four five six seven eight so you can use

923
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,960
things such as Wi-Fi the word or you can

924
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,520
use aircraft and G and basically you can

925
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,040
be authenticated or you can even guess

926
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:29,220
the password and with a framework like

927
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,920
what you see him there you can take over

928
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,620
the drone and as you can see the drone

929
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:41,250
is flying and I am basically changing

930
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:45,030
commands and changing my my neck in

931
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:47,100
order to be able to connect to the drum

932
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,950
I connect to the drum as you will see in

933
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,170
just a second and then eventually I

934
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:55,860
issue a command to to do an emergency

935
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:58,290
landing and once that happened you see

936
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:01,050
the dr. drum drop and then you see how

937
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:05,850
the video goes away so this should

938
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:08,250
happen soon you notice that there's a

939
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:11,880
warning about interference right that is

940
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,070
basically the network I'm you can use

941
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:16,170
this with a network card that you can

942
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:17,550
enjoy a package

943
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:19,770
or basically a non-fun would some of

944
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:21,360
those TV links are actually pretty good

945
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:26,000
and we should be able to see the drop

946
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,800
the drop of the drone in just a second

947
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,380
watch how the the video goes away and

948
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:35,720
the drop falls and there's the commander

949
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,550
this is available and github you can

950
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:42,020
download and run it and um Callie

951
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:45,780
obviously this was done within my home

952
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:51,570
this is a proof of concept again and as

953
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:54,300
you can see it wasn't that easy it took

954
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,090
several attempts but eventually I was

955
00:48:57,090 --> 00:48:58,980
able to connect and then execute the

956
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:02,430
command so you see the drone drops you

957
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:04,700
can also connect and turn it back on so

958
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:07,170
why did this happen this happened for

959
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:11,220
two reasons the authentication was weak

960
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,710
even you can actually perform all their

961
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:17,130
Wi-Fi attacks and you can still be

962
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:22,470
successful in two they rely only in

963
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:27,540
Wi-Fi so that is my my first proof of

964
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:33,660
concept let me go back to here's the

965
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:37,170
link it will be available tonight here's

966
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:40,730
my second demo so in my second demo I

967
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:43,890
wanted to use an outdoor drone I don't

968
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:47,610
have enough budget to buy myself like a

969
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:51,420
big big drawn and mostly use RF and I

970
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:53,040
really didn't want to get into the RF

971
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,830
business for now I wanted to I wanted to

972
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:57,750
target the Wi-Fi first and then I want

973
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:00,300
to look at the RF I know the PRF needs

974
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,940
to be done in a much more controlled

975
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:07,500
environment so I was able to find this

976
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,720
drone which is pretty cool by the way

977
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,540
this drone is called the semi drone

978
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,640
unfortunately that company went out of

979
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:19,170
business but it has GPS and Wi-Fi and

980
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:22,200
then we're gonna see here this wrong was

981
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,320
producing 2017 and I don't actually I

982
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:28,380
don't take I gone out and talked some

983
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:31,320
nice taking some nice

984
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:34,350
shots and it is it's actually pretty

985
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:38,310
nice drawn but relies on Wi-Fi right so

986
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:41,070
although it relies for Wi-Fi and also

987
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:43,860
relies on GPS so there's two what that

988
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:47,670
vectors are you can address their I like

989
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:49,920
I said again I we looked at the GPS

990
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,140
a-gps

991
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:54,630
did not work and I believe because if

992
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:56,220
our nice a lot of what the phone is

993
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,560
sending and I believe the the hakka

994
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,800
reference is simply not it's not there I

995
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:05,100
mean like you actually poem and look at

996
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,960
some of the the stuff that you can do

997
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,850
with GPS with the hacker a few basic

998
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:10,290
they had to put the target right on top

999
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:13,200
of it so so there's no much like I said

1000
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,700
before be careful when you're using to

1001
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:17,010
think so as is it's not really what

1002
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:21,110
sometimes advertise for so in this case

1003
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:28,050
we I car gated a a outdoor GPS Wi-Fi see

1004
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:32,580
me drawn I put the the actual links so

1005
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:35,430
you can I eat yourself do you want to

1006
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:37,530
experiment and play what it is it's like

1007
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:40,080
strong actually does the nine 360 you

1008
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,150
can take pictures it would allow you

1009
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:44,130
actually do to connect to phones to wear

1010
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:48,240
one of them can navigate it the other

1011
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,130
one can look at the camera so this is

1012
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:53,700
cool stuff so with this let's look at

1013
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:58,290
the second one so the second one once

1014
00:51:58,290 --> 00:52:05,820
again some packs at stuff here so in

1015
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:13,140
this case on the top left camera

1016
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:16,110
we put this we did this outside and we

1017
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:20,630
put a ride into a close to a a pound

1018
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:23,580
conserve a little late so in case if my

1019
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:25,680
crazy went to the water we didn't want

1020
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,010
to affect anybody or hit anything

1021
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:33,150
so then you see on the top left the the

1022
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:36,660
camera the camera of the drawn and then

1023
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:38,820
you would see that eventually the drum

1024
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:42,650
hits the top high I execute the attack

1025
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:45,210
which is basically a disabled one

1026
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:47,070
by you will see how to walk fighters

1027
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:49,320
disabled and then the drawn per dozen

1028
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:53,520
RTL which basically goes back and Lance

1029
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,940
again you see this is outdoor mode drone

1030
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:00,690
goes up that's me and that is the

1031
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:03,180
antenna that I use I use at out an

1032
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,340
outdoor Wi-Fi and I think I overwhelming

1033
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:07,590
to be honest and there's a drum landing

1034
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:11,850
again and that's where called push

1035
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:16,530
mayhem drum fence so this thing can go

1036
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:19,650
actually way higher but again you know I

1037
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:21,810
only have one drone not much of a budget

1038
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:25,410
so we sort of did this we wanted to

1039
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:28,530
research what's gonna happen but I also

1040
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:30,570
couldn't afford to start buying drums

1041
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:41,700
it's expensive so so that's my second

1042
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:44,190
drone this will be published and there's

1043
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:49,020
the the the link and with that I will

1044
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:50,790
open it for questions you know thank you

1045
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:54,350
very much this was worth your time

1046
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:06,750
no questions I think some of them you

1047
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:09,940
already cover like first one I see here

1048
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:12,579
is why the multiple green lasers caused

1049
00:54:12,579 --> 00:54:14,589
a drone to crash in South America thank

1050
00:54:14,589 --> 00:54:14,950
you

1051
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:20,579
your I can answer that one is basically

1052
00:54:20,579 --> 00:54:22,300
overwhelmed there there are several

1053
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,520
theories one of them is that the

1054
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:28,900
operator could not see the the other one

1055
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:34,690
is the other one is the the sensors to

1056
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:36,819
heat up and that was kind of crazy

1057
00:54:36,819 --> 00:54:37,960
because if you actually look at the

1058
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,630
video there's so many of them that it

1059
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:44,349
must have gotten very hot and that may

1060
00:54:44,349 --> 00:55:03,730
have taken the actual drone down talk

1061
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:06,309
about the last one from Lennon is there

1062
00:55:06,309 --> 00:55:07,930
a restoration to transport drones from

1063
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:11,200
the airport like in your carrier no no

1064
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:15,880
there's no no that I know no actually I

1065
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,730
do have two drones as well but they were

1066
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:21,280
actually expensive trunks and I'll tell

1067
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,880
you a funny story there there used to be

1068
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:30,780
a balloon race where I used to live and

1069
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:34,930
recently I'm talking about like - 2014

1070
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:39,910
2013 I recently bought one of the B he

1071
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:44,619
gave DJI drone to me whatever and I was

1072
00:55:44,619 --> 00:55:46,540
so smart to take it to the balloon race

1073
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:50,020
and did a flyover and serve you know

1074
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:52,990
basically recording 4k all the balloon

1075
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:55,660
races until suddenly I got from the

1076
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:56,920
speaker

1077
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:02,319
you know we noticed a drone you please

1078
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:06,160
take it down and I did but they actually

1079
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:11,349
they did push it like he came back to me

1080
00:56:11,349 --> 00:56:13,540
and I at that point I didn't have

1081
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:15,410
control of it

1082
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:21,530
that my drum stopped working and I

1083
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:23,270
couldn't make it fly anymore

1084
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:27,349
so I took it to be a I support they have

1085
00:56:27,349 --> 00:56:31,400
to change the whole motherboard until

1086
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,020
now I still don't know what exactly

1087
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:35,030
happened what they did to it I mean I

1088
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:38,299
can't understand they they there was a

1089
00:56:38,299 --> 00:56:42,049
jammer other than that I I don't know

1090
00:56:42,049 --> 00:56:45,410
what exactly they did to actually kill

1091
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:47,359
the motherboard because after that the

1092
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,490
the drone was not useful you know I

1093
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:55,700
can't use it and then going back to the

1094
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:57,890
question I mean I I I traveled with that

1095
00:56:57,890 --> 00:57:01,849
drone to two different countries like

1096
00:57:01,849 --> 00:57:04,520
Mexico for example I did some video

1097
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,319
shooting over there and and two

1098
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:08,750
different states in the US I never had

1099
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:09,890
any issues I mean they're always

1100
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:12,289
obviously they always questioning what

1101
00:57:12,289 --> 00:57:14,690
it was and I'm back in the day it was

1102
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:17,000
kind of like a new new thing on drones

1103
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,940
so they always you know was talking

1104
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:23,119
about you know ask me what it was and

1105
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:26,150
stuff like that but um that's basically

1106
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:30,710
it no no major issues right the same

1107
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:32,150
thing with the batteries or berries or

1108
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:36,740
consider it's almost like when when I

1109
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:39,049
travel a for most of us travel Def Con

1110
00:57:39,049 --> 00:57:41,059
you know if there are things there that

1111
00:57:41,059 --> 00:57:45,380
much more dangerous dead drums okay all

1112
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:47,510
kinds of electronic equipment badges and

1113
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:48,650
stuff but they usually treat that like

1114
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:51,289
TSA would check it but if there is then

1115
00:57:51,289 --> 00:57:52,910
we check it for explosive and stuff like

1116
00:57:52,910 --> 00:57:54,950
that but other than that there's really

1117
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:57,109
no restrictions there's just really not

1118
00:57:57,109 --> 00:58:00,170
restrictions the airspace above you I

1119
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:03,170
think there is a limitation and and

1120
00:58:03,170 --> 00:58:05,329
that's how the paparazzi's get around it

1121
00:58:05,329 --> 00:58:08,359
just so you know there is a limitation

1122
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:11,660
of how high is your space I don't have

1123
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:13,430
it with me I can look I can look it up

1124
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:16,130
but I did look up that I noticed that

1125
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:18,980
some of the the paparazzo were actually

1126
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:21,470
playing with that limit in order to fly

1127
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:26,119
above some celebrities so back when da I

1128
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:28,700
started gaining like

1129
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:31,280
you know being noticeable about their

1130
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:31,849
drones

1131
00:58:31,849 --> 00:58:34,130
you know people surveying them so I

1132
00:58:34,130 --> 00:58:37,040
remember that's also about the time the

1133
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:41,150
FAA started asking people who were

1134
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:43,400
buying drones to basically raising them

1135
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,650
otherwise you couldn't fly them also

1136
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:48,760
back in the day there was a case where

1137
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:54,050
someone a guy and this is this guy was

1138
00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:58,520
actually filming these teenager you know

1139
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,980
swimming in the pool so the dad went out

1140
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:05,990
and shoot the drone well the the the the

1141
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:08,630
guy who actually chatted the drone

1142
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:13,849
filming for purposes that for his own he

1143
00:59:13,849 --> 00:59:16,010
he did not get in trouble but the dad

1144
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:19,280
did because he shot drone so there's

1145
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:23,869
always a gray area between what you're

1146
00:59:23,869 --> 00:59:25,670
filming I mean actually if you go to the

1147
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:27,560
FAA now there's actually more

1148
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:30,770
explanation of what you can do where

1149
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:32,270
you're not working you're flat at work

1150
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:34,640
and you not also you mentioned the

1151
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:38,390
geofencing so now all the software that

1152
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:41,810
comes with the you know you know they

1153
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:43,579
have like the GPS coordinates like you

1154
00:59:43,579 --> 00:59:47,300
mentioned but about you cannot shoot the

1155
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:53,240
drone however you can put a jammers like

1156
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:56,000
to basically not to to go to that area

1157
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,970
basically but again it's almost like the

1158
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:01,310
same thing if you ask me uh it's in the

1159
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:08,500
gray area so that's how you steal a lot

1160
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:10,700
there you go let's click on that

1161
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:23,540
yeah so here's a so rather to use a

1162
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:25,700
drone to capture photographs or video of

1163
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:28,160
a person that violates their privacy

1164
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:33,790
such as final celebrities that's yeah

1165
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:35,900
obviously that one that's because you

1166
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:39,650
know Hollywood right so that was pretty

1167
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:42,080
much like the first one

1168
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,790
arrested somebody during the Super Bowl

1169
01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:46,160
by way Miami Beach that was flying a

1170
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,430
drum because they were trying to get all

1171
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:51,680
this footage is a lot of money

1172
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:54,020
exactly and that was that the other

1173
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:56,030
thing too I mean then first the first

1174
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:58,100
time when they come up with their the

1175
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:01,010
laws they said it was because so you

1176
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:03,500
know you can cause harm like physical

1177
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,990
harm not really about copyright or

1178
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:08,450
anything like that but as you know the

1179
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:11,270
last progress and as you know people

1180
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:13,970
with money and Sarah you know I'm saying

1181
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:16,040
all these things now you became like a

1182
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,500
copy dry and we came like something

1183
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:25,420
along the line and yeah I can imagine so

1184
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:29,450
posting that also a Alec T there that it

1185
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:34,130
says the low past in 2016 makes it a

1186
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:36,200
misdemeanor to interfere with any

1187
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,960
emergency services well if you guys so

1188
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:43,910
my my action my first slide is it's

1189
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:48,200
about a an ad from California that

1190
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:51,440
basically says if you fly we can't which

1191
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,740
is this one and it's because during the

1192
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:56,530
fires

1193
01:01:56,530 --> 01:01:59,210
doing the wildfires there was a lot of

1194
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:02,990
amateur people filming and flying drones

1195
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:04,310
and then there was a problem for in the

1196
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:10,280
helicopters so that's that's important

1197
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:12,010
and thank you for bringing that up

1198
01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:15,520
any other questions

1199
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:29,180

01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:48,730
is a continuation of Phil Morgan's on

1222
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:53,329
Wi-Fi I you know that there was a for

1223
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:56,450
the people who attended that meeting you

1224
01:03:56,450 --> 01:03:58,670
know some people were asking things you

1225
01:03:58,670 --> 01:04:03,890
can do with your current Wi-Fi web

1226
01:04:03,890 --> 01:04:06,289
access point and you know there was a

1227
01:04:06,289 --> 01:04:09,529
discussion on he did all your tea and

1228
01:04:09,529 --> 01:04:11,510
and some people didn't know about it and

1229
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:13,970
so that's when I said well basically I

1230
01:04:13,970 --> 01:04:16,400
did all your T's turning your you know

1231
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,670
hundred and hundred dollar web access

1232
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:22,309
point to a thousand dollar web access

1233
01:04:22,309 --> 01:04:24,440
point you know because now it will give

1234
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,390
you more capabilities so it looks like

1235
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:29,779
people where you know we're asking about

1236
01:04:29,779 --> 01:04:32,630
it so I'll do a presentation on that now

1237
01:04:32,630 --> 01:04:35,059
