1
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:08,960
okay

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,759
welcome to my talk

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,080
my name is christian fellini

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,560
i have 15 years of production experience

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,760
running mod security and i'm a co-lead

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,160
of the always mod security coral set

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,080
so as it goes i'm no longer an attacker

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,640
it's unless the exciting talks we just

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,640
heard that is going to be relatively

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,600
boring because this is a blue team

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,480
talk in blue font and we try to defend

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,920
stuff and it's unfortunately a very

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,600
boring work and i'm

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,600
sorry you have to endure this before

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,039
lunch because everybody wants to go to

16
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,480
lunch but there is a talk and we'll see

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,600
okay

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,520
let's get going

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,920
mod security is a web application

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,000
firewall the always small security call

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,559
rule set is a rule set on a web

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,399
application firewall now web application

23
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,640
firewall that's highly commercial it's

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,559
highly contested it's a lot of web

25
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,720
reward it's a lot of around and

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,600
there is a single open source offering

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,640
that is

28
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,400
my opinion because i'm leading one of

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,920
these projects it's very different for

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,680
the commercial offerings because this

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,159
actually brings value

32
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,240
at a really decent cost while all the

33
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,280
commercial competition is very expensive

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,520
and as we'll see is not bringing any

35
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,000
value we're looking at internet voting

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,680
here which is

37
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,000
kind at least in theory should be

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,159
high security

39
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,799
and the only way to pull off a high

40
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,520
security setup with the help of a web

41
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,159
application firewall is the osmotic

42
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,000
security core rule set

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,320
not only my opinion but that's also what

44
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,159
my customers wanted

45
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,079
uh i came to the conclusion this is our

46
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,880
only way to protect this

47
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,960
so what i'm going to do today i'm going

48
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,960
to introduce you to this coral set

49
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,360
project i'm going to introduce you to

50
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,240
internet voting in switzerland which has

51
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,960
a long and adventurous history

52
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,439
and we're going to apply this

53
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,560
for a high security setup

54
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,800
good

55
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,640
now as i said web application firewalls

56
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,640
are highly contested

57
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,480
they add some value

58
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,360
if done right or not

59
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,800
they were

60
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,840
pushed around 2005 when the

61
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,160
pci dss standard so payment card

62
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,400
industry standard enforced

63
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,959
having a web application firewall

64
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,760
they're not forcing you to run it

65
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,599
they're not forcing you to configure it

66
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,680
successfully they're not forcing you to

67
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,440
protect anything but you rather just

68
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,720
need to have it

69
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,879
and that's what ma that is what the

70
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,319
industry of publication fires is

71
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,000
actually addressing that just give you

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,040
something and then we'll see

73
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,160
still

74
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,879
web application files are used

75
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,200
in a way they use a seat belt in a car

76
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,000
and i advocated to use as use a seat

77
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,680
belt in a car

78
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,560
because you're not driving around with a

79
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,800
seat belt and the idea hey i'm immune to

80
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,400
car crashes now if i'm going to the

81
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,239
crash nothing will happen to me no

82
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,599
that's not the case

83
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,000
the case is they give you decent

84
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,400
baseline protection should the bad thing

85
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,319
happen should he end up in a car

86
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,200
accident then you're better off with the

87
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,599
seat belt and that's the same thing with

88
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,000
a decent web application firewall it's

89
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,239
no protection it's no silver bullet for

90
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,239
security you still have to fix your

91
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,480
source code you still have to patch your

92
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,040
systems however when you have a bug and

93
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,040
chances are you have a bug even apache

94
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,200
has a bug and even solaris still has

95
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,760
bugs after 30 years of development 40

96
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,080
years actually i think so

97
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,680
chances are in your application not

98
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,959
equally having bugs so putting

99
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,360
a new security layer in front with

100
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,120
decent configuration

101
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,280
will actually improve your security

102
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,439
posture it's no silver bullet

103
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,280
but it buys you time

104
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,280
and chances are if an attacker is

105
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,439
attacking you and he sees that you're

106
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,879
well protected with the raf and he

107
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,360
cannot even attack the backhand system

108
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,760
he'll walk off to the

109
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,760
competing system to your competition

110
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,839
actually to the other bank around the

111
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,320
corner or maybe to the different country

112
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,680
with their internet voting

113
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,320
ideally so that's why you use a web

114
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,560
application firewall not because it's

115
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,520
perfect because it's good return on

116
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,120
investment

117
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,160
okay

118
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,639
so we had introduction talk on apache

119
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,199
already i'm using mod security on apache

120
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,440
uh in antonio's presentation there were

121
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,680
third-party modules on the bottom on the

122
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,800
right side

123
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,280
uh mod security is one of these so mod

124
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,320
security is a module that you add to uh

125
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,000
apache and it turns apache an apache

126
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,960
reverse proxy or gateway server into a

127
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,039
web application firewall

128
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,800
so that's a third-party module to put on

129
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,120
top and there is a lot of competition as

130
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,759
i said there are 80 commercial offerings

131
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,919
around the globe or the last time i

132
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:10,800
checked

133
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,880
there was a list about 80 of them i

134
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,680
would say half of them are probably

135
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,160
based on mod security so that is people

136
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,400
had an existing product typically a

137
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,320
loadable answer or something and then

138
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,639
customers act for more security and say

139
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,560
they we need a vaf now how we can get a

140
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,560
web and let's take mod secured and put

141
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,240
it on top or a load balancer now we have

142
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,400
a vaff offering for the huge market

143
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
so that you that's how you end up with

144
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,919
the 80

145
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,680
global commercial offerings were

146
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,199
application firewalls half of them

147
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,120
probably based

148
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,800
in mod security

149
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,039
and very often that's all they do they

150
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,680
just put mod security hands off your

151
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,240
customer you're in charge now

152
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,720
so mod security is a decent piece of

153
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,400
engineering it's uh it gives you

154
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,039
granular control down to the byte level

155
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,120
so it inspects the traffic coming into

156
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,560
the web server going out of the web

157
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,319
server it's built for apache but it's

158
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,680
running an alternative system as well

159
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,840
you can run it on nginx successfully

160
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,240
these days and it does pattern magic

161
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,680
http requests as antonio demonstrated

162
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,600
it applies regular expressions or other

163
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,680
rules to the requests and then if it

164
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,080
sees something bad then it can react

165
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,800
it's relatively simple uh in theory and

166
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,479
in practice of course it's

167
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,720
horrendous it's really complicated it's

168
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,479
ugly stuff it's ugly irregular

169
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,960
expressions we have variable expressions

170
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,120
that spread thousands of bytes and you

171
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,960
don't want to read them by hand it's

172
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,720
really rough uh but mod security is

173
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,800
is transparent

174
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,639
uh there is no artificial intelligence

175
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,479
here this is not crowd enabled this is

176
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,400
not next generation

177
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,520
this is

178
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,319
just

179
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,400
it's like a clock in the end it's a lot

180
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,560
of wheels and you have tiny screwdrivers

181
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,080
that you adjust stuff

182
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,919
so you can get the hang of this you can

183
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,720
understand this and if you don't then

184
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,960
you can join one of my courses i teach

185
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,039
people more security usage

186
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,960
so that's the baseline that's the engine

187
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,080
and now we're putting

188
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,800
rules on top and this is when the always

189
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,800
mod security coral set comes in so we

190
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,400
have the engine and now we need the

191
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,919
rules on top

192
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,080
most people don't want to write the

193
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,759
rules themselves that's relatively

194
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,319
complicated and ruling the rule language

195
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,800
is really annoying so

196
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,479
they take a standard rule set and the

197
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,720
most widespread rule set is the call

198
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,360
rule set the overs call will said

199
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,360
i said half of the commercial offerings

200
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,800
are based on mod security and i would

201
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,639
say two-thirds of the commercial

202
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,400
offerings on the globe are

203
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,080
using crs

204
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,520
meaning

205
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,280
mod security is only the engine i mean

206
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,360
you can replace the engine with an

207
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,520
alternative implementation and still run

208
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,800
the same rules

209
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,560
and that's what a lot of commercial

210
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,080
offerings are doing they hate mod

211
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,479
security for various reasons it's

212
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,720
resource hawk it does a lot of things

213
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,639
that you're not interested in so you can

214
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,800
do it a leaner implementation that's

215
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,840
still able to run crs

216
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,520
so we have like two-thirds of the

217
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,479
commercial market running crs and would

218
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,160
be nice if these commercial offerings

219
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,199
would sponsor our projects in case you

220
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,000
have to work for one of these

221
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,160
so that's the coral set i'm running this

222
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,800
project uh together with several friends

223
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,960
and we have andrea in the second row

224
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,159
he's one of our team hey andre

225
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,240
good so does it actually help yeah it

226
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,039
does

227
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,839
what you see here is burp attacking a

228
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,760
vulnerable application

229
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,000
the application has lots of bugs on

230
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,399
purpose because it's meant to test

231
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,559
security standards the idea is to run

232
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,760
the security scanner against a

233
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,480
vulnerable application and then see how

234
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,720
many of the bugs can burp discover

235
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,640
here burb did four and a half million

236
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,640
requests that's a really strong burp

237
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,959
it's a pumped up burp with lots of

238
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,279
plugins enabled and the guy running burp

239
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,880
was really an expert

240
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,399
and he discovered around 40 bucks here a

241
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,480
thousand requests

242
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,680
reported a bug and behind these thousand

243
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,040
findings more than 40 individual

244
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,160
um

245
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,240
individual box in the application

246
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,279
discovered in the second column you can

247
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,839
see a default crs installation that's

248
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,600
the five minute installation that's the

249
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,240
opt-get install or a git clone

250
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,640
installation of crs mod security is

251
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,800
installed rules on top and then we run

252
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,680
the same four million requests again and

253
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,839
you see that over 80 percent of the

254
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,200
vulnerabilities can no longer be

255
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,959
exploited

256
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,120
availability class that burp is not able

257
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,120
to exploit anymore is sql injection for

258
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,240
example

259
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,720
now i'm not promising you

260
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,480
that

261
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,560
this is removing escull injection of

262
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,519
course not it's merely hiding it

263
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,920
and i'm not promising you that a skilled

264
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,920
attacker a persistent attacker is not

265
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,760
able to exploit escola bugs anymore

266
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,839
antonio and marco would still be able to

267
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,360
pull this off but they would have to

268
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,160
invest a lot more time maybe not two

269
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,240
weeks but let's say a couple of days and

270
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,240
they will probably radially give up in

271
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,680
the meantime

272
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,360
so a standard

273
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,600
software vulnerability scanner is no

274
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,760
longer able to exploit existing bug

275
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,079
which buys you time of course situations

276
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,360
that will be different with cross-site

277
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
scripting because they're harder to

278
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,839
detect they're harder to protect against

279
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,440
and

280
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,079
while as the local file inclusions here

281
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,120
and not

282
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,959
present in this volume application are

283
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,800
remote command execution box they're

284
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,440
relatively easy to detect for us even if

285
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,519
the best shell is really a pain in the

286
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,440
ass

287
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,360
but we're pretty good on that side

288
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,360
cross-side scripting bit weak but the

289
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,519
general rule of thumb is

290
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,480
what can be detected in http traffic

291
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,760
we do detect by at least 80 percent of

292
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,240
the cases there are numerous

293
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,839
exploit cheat sheets around for

294
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,079
cross-site scripting

295
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,920
payload all the things is a famous

296
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,320
github repository

297
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,680
uh

298
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,279
that lists a lot of payloads and we

299
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,560
generally do like 80 90 by default

300
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,680
and by default is of course not yet

301
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,680
high security

302
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,519
as you imagine

303
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,399
for a high security setup we want to be

304
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,240
more aggressive with rules and this is

305
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,399
where the additional columns come in and

306
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,320
we call this paranoia levels and a

307
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,079
default installation gives you baseline

308
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,440
security

309
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,000
and then we're adding more rules in

310
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,160
higher paranoia level this goes up to

311
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,440
four

312
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,360
and the more rules you get the more

313
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,160
aggressive the rule becomes and the more

314
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,320
false positives you're getting so it's

315
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,480
like in a decent in default installation

316
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,320
you we try to

317
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,160
keep you without false positive your

318
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,839
application is supposed to continue to

319
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:54,639
run

320
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,560
but then if you have a bigger security

321
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,720
appetite then we're adding more

322
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,880
aggressive rules for you and that brings

323
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,600
you

324
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,639
false positives

325
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,519
good

326
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,120
here is a

327
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,839
is a report from thomas mcconan yeah

328
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,800
he's a finnish guy he compared several

329
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,240
offerings

330
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,360
uh cloud offerings based on crs are not

331
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,040
based on series and they're

332
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,399
their efficiency against um

333
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,560
against standard attacks thousands of

334
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,079
attack requests it's not four million as

335
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,120
in the birth case but 10 15 000 requests

336
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,000
by the way i'm linking all the resources

337
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,760
here on my twitter account so you may

338
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,880
want to follow it and i've scheduled

339
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,720
the tweets so you have the links there

340
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,720
you don't have to type them

341
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,680
um

342
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,480
so

343
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,040
he is confirming uh if you see the red

344
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,560
dot the escort injection line the third

345
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,839
line here

346
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,240
i told you burp is no longer able to

347
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,880
pull this off and he he reports an

348
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,760
efficiency with google cloud armor based

349
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,600
on crs of 1990 so the second column to

350
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,519
the end this one

351
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,680
so this is almost the same that we

352
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,079
reported in the previous slide s colin

353
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,519
jackson is really good if you're using

354
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,880
a crs based cloud buff offering however

355
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,680
if you're going with the abs buff or the

356
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,200
fortinet management that's the

357
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,320
commercial competition and they're

358
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,360
they're

359
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,079
really violet or red originally we have

360
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,800
a bit off callers here so they go like

361
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,959
20 of sql injections detected and you

362
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,639
pay money for this

363
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,639
while as this uh the sierra the naked

364
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,000
crs offerings for free and it does 99

365
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,120
so uh

366
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,760
choose wisely here so why is that why

367
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,839
are commercial solutions

368
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,399
so widely worse that the open source

369
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,240
solution and if you choose an open

370
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,560
source solution based on a commercial

371
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,440
offering you have to make sure that the

372
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,279
commercial offering is not crippling you

373
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,720
i don't know what cloudflare is doing

374
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,320
with the remote command execution but

375
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,480
we're pretty good and they crippled this

376
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,399
at 23 of the detection rate i don't know

377
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,440
what these guys are doing

378
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,199
but uh

379
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,360
you really need to evaluate this

380
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,760
when you're choosing one of this why why

381
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,560
is that happening

382
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,800
i need to tell you a little story here

383
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,480
and you probably know the story but i'm

384
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,720
putting it in new context we start with

385
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,160
a boy

386
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,560
and this explains why the commercial

387
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,199
competition is so bad so we start with a

388
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,839
boy and the boy has some sheep you know

389
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,000
where it is going so the guy has to go

390
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,680
to the pasture with the sheep and

391
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,920
protect them as a shepherd

392
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,760
and then the wolf comes in the wolf's

393
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,839
probably wearing a dark hoodie and he

394
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,279
wants to eat the sheep so he's the

395
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,720
attacker

396
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,600
and

397
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,360
the idea is that the boys raises the

398
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,360
alarm and then the hunters come track

399
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,360
down the wolf they have a big party in

400
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,720
the village everybody's happy with

401
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,240
struck down well of course the wolf is

402
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,240
not happy but everybody else is very

403
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,199
happy

404
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,079
and

405
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,760
that's what your

406
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,800
what the

407
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,199
promise is when you buy a buff of course

408
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,120
now the problem is the wolf and its

409
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,440
detection and the alarm

410
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,480
because you

411
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,040
you can never really really tell if the

412
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,279
wolf is real or not or if it's a false

413
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,440
alarm if your pattern matching

414
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,959
identified

415
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,399
a real attack

416
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,959
or if it was a false alarm something

417
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,040
resembling an attack

418
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,240
as it comes

419
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,800
this is really hard it's really hard to

420
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,120
do this in hdb traffic there are obvious

421
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,000
cases but then a lot of not so obvious

422
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,079
cases and developers do crazy things to

423
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,360
their code

424
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,160
so

425
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,959
it's hard to tell if it's a real attack

426
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,480
or it's not if it's a real attack we

427
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,240
call this a true positive and that's

428
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,199
nice everybody's happy in that situation

429
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,199
the problem of course is

430
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,519
if the boy calls wolf and there is no

431
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,720
wolf

432
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,000
then the system in this raid will be

433
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,440
pissed security team will be really

434
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,440
pissed and you do this step several

435
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,920
times and then they switch off the buff

436
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,800
and that's really bad

437
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,240
and

438
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,079
we do this in a quantitative measure

439
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,000
false alarms can be thousands you can

440
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,560
have 50 000 false alarms on a standard

441
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,639
application a single day

442
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,360
so that's really bad

443
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,959
and

444
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,519
we earned that sign crs does that we do

445
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,440
false alarms

446
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,279
why do we false alarms because the

447
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,440
alternative is even worse

448
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,399
the alternative is a false negative

449
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,120
the wolf is coming and no alarm

450
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,120
and why is the commercial competition

451
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,600
erroring on that side

452
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,639
i tell you

453
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,800
i explained to you why

454
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,040
if the commercial

455
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,720
vendor install this for you you're

456
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,199
installing a commercial solution

457
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,600
and then the boss or one very important

458
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,120
customer is blocked by the buff because

459
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,279
of a false alarm traffic is blocked

460
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,040
benign traffic traffic is blocked that

461
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,759
person is going to be extremely pissed

462
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,320
and the commercial vendor is risking to

463
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
lose you as a customer

464
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,320
they're no longer prolonging the license

465
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
they stop using the product they're

466
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,440
stopping giving money to the vendor

467
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,279
because of a false positive that is a

468
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,839
direct impact block the ceo and your

469
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,439
solution is out

470
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,559
of course

471
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,439
one is the false negative is

472
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,079
the wolf gets in and eats the sheep

473
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,679
and who is going to blame the buff

474
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,039
nobody's going to blame the valve

475
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,160
they're going to blame the other

476
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,160
application developers

477
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,520
and if you have been exploited

478
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,679
successfully the last thing that you're

479
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,480
going to do is stopping the buff

480
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,240
what you're going to do is throw more

481
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,960
money at the buff so i think

482
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,280
there is a strong commercial interest in

483
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,919
avoiding false positive at all costs and

484
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,919
there's relatively little commercial

485
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,200
interest in providing a functional valve

486
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,640
now the solute

487
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,960
the point with the open source coral set

488
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,640
is entirely different

489
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,400
our skin in the game is different we're

490
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,000
not making money

491
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,880
on

492
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,440
this product if you have false positive

493
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,480
we try to help you but we're never going

494
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,200
to go a compromise on the detection rate

495
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,120
because of a false positive

496
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,840
so we're in for higher education for

497
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,160
system administrator security officers

498
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,640
should understand the solution we have

499
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,280
guides for you we have documentation to

500
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,000
avoid false positives but we're not

501
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,679
compromising on the detection rate

502
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,760
because our money is not in here it's

503
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,320
only our spare time and our reputation

504
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,320
to be the strongest web application

505
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,080
firewall out there

506
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,160
on the internet

507
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,559
so what can you do exactly

508
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,360
uh where's that slide yeah this line

509
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,000
false positive so what can you do uh you

510
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,360
have to expect false positive in the

511
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,720
default installation but namely at

512
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,480
paranoia level two when you have a

513
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,440
higher security appetite as soon as you

514
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,919
have real data involved

515
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,120
we suggest you enable paranoia level two

516
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,360
and then at paranoia level three that is

517
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,880
aimed for uh

518
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,799
more like online banking and then

519
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,320
paranoia level four for stuff like

520
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,960
nuclear power plants or internet voting

521
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,240
if you go

522
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,559
and then you need to work around this

523
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,320
false positive and you do this with

524
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,400
so-called rule exclusion so include

525
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,720
exclude a certain rule for your service

526
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,360
in a certain situation or a certain uri

527
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,960
is not applying that rule for an

528
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,720
individual parameter

529
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,799
perhaps so these are rule exclusions and

530
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,440
you write this by hand or you use a

531
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,240
software like c-rex and nia.com that we

532
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,799
de-developed for you in my company you

533
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,880
find lots of tutorials and my website

534
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,720
india.com are you join one of my courses

535
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,520
good so you have four paranoia levels up

536
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,280
to nuclear power plant level or we

537
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,799
scratch that for this presentation and

538
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,480
call this the internet voting level

539
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,039
security apparently

540
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,080
this is advanced this is rough this is a

541
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,919
lot of testing and this is no default

542
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,480
installation anymore

543
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,160
good

544
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,559
i'm summing this up the always coral set

545
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,000
is the first line of defense against web

546
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,880
application attacks it's a generic set

547
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,679
of deny rules so it's generic it works

548
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,600
everywhere

549
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,880
it blocks

550
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,799
at least 80 percent of application

551
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,400
attacks by default

552
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,480
so when you read the os top 10 we do

553
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,600
like 80 of that stuff

554
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,679
paranoia levels can push these up into

555
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,240
the plus 95 percent region

556
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,200
and you retain granular control

557
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,520
over your entire traffic down on the

558
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,799
byte level

559
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,360
first part of my talk now let's move

560
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,679
over to the internet voting in

561
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,280
switzerland

562
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,760
so this is how internet or no this is

563
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,080
how physical voting verse in switzerland

564
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,240
you go to the voting office and place

565
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,360
your ballot

566
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,280
but that is not what swiss are doing

567
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,679
over far over 90 percent are using

568
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,159
mail-in ballots because we're a

569
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,320
semi-direct democracy where we vote at

570
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,400
least four times a year so we're not

571
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,240
electing a parliament four times a year

572
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,120
but we do yes no referendums constantly

573
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,159
um actually tomorrow is a yes no

574
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,440
referendum in to allow

575
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,240
a marriage for gay people for

576
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,240
homosexuals they get marriage tomorrow

577
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,600
by a margin probably 60 70 yes vote is

578
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,280
expected that's happening tomorrow we do

579
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,039
this four times a year so this is

580
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,880
streamline process and everybody's all

581
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,640
constantly in election or referendum

582
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,280
mode and we do this by may

583
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,400
and mail comes with a lot of problems

584
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,919
this is

585
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,440
a process

586
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,400
design it was the first really mapping

587
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,960
of the mail ballot voting process in

588
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,360
switzerland by a friend of mine called

589
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,760
christian killer that's his real name

590
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,760
christian killer and his professor mr

591
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,880
stiller they developed this process

592
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,640
look up the paper don't try to read the

593
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,159
small font here

594
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,400
it's super complicated and of course it

595
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,960
has a lot of security weaknesses mail-in

596
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,960
ballots even in switzerland have

597
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,400
security weaknesses and what is

598
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,600
protecting us it's so then decentralized

599
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,280
you would have to exploit

600
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,919
hundreds of thousands of voting offices

601
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,360
probably uh to provide or exploit the

602
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,799
process

603
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,080
good

604
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,919
this is how an election ballot for a

605
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,679
real uh election looks like in

606
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,120
switzerland it's probably familiar to

607
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,799
you i don't know especially in

608
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,520
switzerland you can edit stuff you can

609
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,360
strike through names you can put in your

610
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,679
friends uh you can do all sorts of

611
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,120
things on an election balance

612
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,039
switzerland makes it very complicated

613
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,240
and of course it makes it very

614
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,000
complicated to count it

615
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
because if you count this by hand you

616
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,320
see however prone that is

617
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,919
bonus points if you spot the content

618
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,000
manager from butt will

619
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,960
uh

620
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,559
next slide

621
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,640
and of course if we move to internet

622
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,280
voting so we take the mail in thing and

623
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,440
then we move to internet then this

624
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,559
becomes

625
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,320
inherently insecure

626
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,799
i mean we don't need bruce to tell us

627
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,880
that you cannot really do internet

628
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,799
voting in a secure way

629
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:51,679
that

630
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,760
this quote by bruce schneier

631
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,320
sums up all the counter arguments

632
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,880
against intervoding the net voting and

633
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,120
the core argument is you want to have

634
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,520
voting secrecy you want to make sure

635
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,320
that everybody gets a secret vote that

636
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,400
rests in the secret ballot

637
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,720
and if the ballot is not secret then you

638
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,080
can beat up your neighbor because he

639
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,760
voted for the wrong party

640
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,480
or you can pay somebody to to vote for

641
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,760
your party

642
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,799
uh and prove it by

643
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,039
confirming that he really or she really

644
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,039
voted for the party and that is really

645
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,679
bad so we need secret ballot in a

646
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,320
democracy and of course we need to

647
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,520
encrypt this

648
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,520
and when we encrypt this to get the

649
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,000
secret ballot then it's very hard to

650
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,159
prove that the election was done

651
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,520
properly to redo account to redo to

652
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,400
telling and make sure hey this was a

653
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,880
clean election so we have two

654
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,799
contradictions we want secrecy with

655
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,640
encryption and we want transparency

656
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,240
without any encryption

657
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,080
and that doesn't go together as bruce

658
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,400
put it very famously so they're very

659
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,080
good arguments against internet voting

660
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,320
as it happens with all complicated

661
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,600
things in life they're all the good

662
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,760
arguments in favor of internet voting

663
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,760
here's the swiss perspective the first

664
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,159
one is we have ton of citizen livings

665
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,000
abroad we have 10 of the voting

666
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,640
population not living in switzerland

667
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,880
now everybody or not everybody around

668
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,360
the globe is profiting for a good

669
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,760
post system as italy or switzerland

670
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,320
they're people living in south america

671
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,520
asia

672
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,000
and they just shrug at the idea of male

673
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
imbalance

674
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,240
paper letters being transmitted and

675
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,840
arriving in time

676
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,159
never works if you happen to live in

677
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,159
mexico voting a swiss selection give up

678
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,200
immediately

679
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,120
you're never going to get you get the

680
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,520
voting material by mail the moment the

681
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,440
voting is already over

682
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,000
and the process takes for uh you have

683
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,679
they send out the letter four weeks in

684
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,840
advance and it's never getting there

685
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,080
uh let alone being returned so forget

686
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,279
about that and it's ten percent of the

687
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,840
voting population disinfect franchising

688
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,559
ten percent of the voting population is

689
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,840
relatively rough that's a lot of people

690
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,240
so internet voting

691
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,480
becomes more attractive doesn't it

692
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,960
then we have handicapped people

693
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,679
visually impaired or quadriplegics those

694
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,320
people cannot fill in about on paper

695
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,000
they need an assistant

696
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,640
do they get a secret ballot no

697
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,880
the assistant writes it for them

698
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,640
and the blind person

699
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,960
is not able to check on the assistant

700
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,559
depending on the municipality that

701
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,960
you're living the municipality sends the

702
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,320
assistant you see where i'm taking this

703
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,240
and that is wrong on a constitutional

704
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,880
level everybody is guaranteed

705
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,039
the secret ballot but not the blind

706
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,440
people so internet voting with the

707
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,799
screen reader proper hardware equipment

708
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,640
makes internet voting

709
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,159
again more attractive on a

710
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,480
constitutional level so

711
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,799
they have good arguments in favor this

712
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,880
third one formally invalid balance you

713
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,120
see how the swiss ballot look like

714
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,000
and we miss count constantly if they

715
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,120
have to do a recount they count about

716
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,039
half percent of the votes are wrongly

717
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,559
counted

718
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,480
and a half percent it doesn't sound much

719
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,679
but hey it's substantial and very often

720
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,240
we have up to 10

721
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,720
of ballots that are invalid and because

722
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,640
of the secret ballot nobody's telling

723
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,600
these people you can fill out a ballot

724
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,520
in the wrong way your own your whole

725
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,000
life it's always abandoned and nobody's

726
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,400
ever telling you hey you need to do this

727
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,679
differently

728
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,600
so invalid ballots are no longer

729
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,279
possible

730
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,039
on a conceptual level because there is a

731
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,880
gui and you click and then it's a

732
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,000
formally

733
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,159
ballot in internet voting

734
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,880
so with elections if we lose another 10

735
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,039
percent of the voting population because

736
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,039
the ballot is invalid then we're already

737
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,360
disenfranchised 20

738
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,559
the handicapped people are a lot lower

739
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,480
probably but we're talking about the

740
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,120
range of 10 20 of the votes that are

741
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,919
abandoned invalid not coming on in time

742
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,840
or people not even attempting to vote

743
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,440
because it's never working from south

744
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,679
america

745
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:08,640
so

746
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,760
final point the security issues of the

747
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,799
physical protest we just had uh two

748
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,440
months ago the biggest voting fraud in

749
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,720
switzerland where an election official

750
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,559
replaced

751
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,880
uh 200 ballots

752
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,679
in a voting office nobody noticed until

753
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,240
the party receiving the vote said hold

754
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,480
on this is not possible the result is

755
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,880
statistically incorrect you're not

756
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,120
telling us that we made this number vote

757
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,279
in that city because that doesn't add up

758
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,600
at all we should have made a different

759
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,520
number by a large margin

760
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,159
and politicians refused of course they

761
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,080
went on and on and hammered the doors

762
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,679
until somebody said yeah maybe you're

763
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,080
right let's recount and then it all blew

764
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,799
up

765
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,240
so the boss of the voting office

766
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,840
was just charged

767
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,919
as the biggest voter fraud ever in

768
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,919
switzerland and that was physical that

769
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,760
was physical balance

770
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,399
and when you look at the process i

771
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,039
showed you before that is so complicated

772
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,960
there are lots of weak spots around male

773
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,640
imbalance

774
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,799
on the transport level

775
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,960
where you can manipulate votes or steal

776
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,120
votes or submit votes for somebody else

777
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,640
etc etc and that adds up it's hard to

778
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,320
pull off on a scale

779
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,120
but all combined these four reasons make

780
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,520
internet voting uh relatively attractive

781
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,600
so switzerland is investing in internet

782
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,919
voting and has been doing so for many

783
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,320
many years and that is an adventurous

784
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,520
tale

785
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,480
this is all based on uh on the swiss

786
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,320
federal organization

787
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,919
i think switzerland is even more

788
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,960
federally organized than italy it's more

789
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,679
on the united states level so we do a

790
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,520
ton of things on the province or region

791
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,960
level uh namely voting boatling is

792
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,399
almost entirely in the authority of the

793
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,480
canton as you call the province that

794
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,799
you're living in in switzerland so the

795
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,559
central government has very little to

796
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,039
say in votes and elections

797
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,679
with the exception of internet voting so

798
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,360
when they started to do this like 20

799
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,520
years ago they thought hey we need a

800
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,360
general security oversight and we

801
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,360
assigned this to the swiss government or

802
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,200
the federal administration and that was

803
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,480
a smart move

804
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,000
and

805
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,600
as you probably know in the united

806
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,120
states that's not the case and there was

807
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,640
a lot of discussion last year because

808
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,880
federal government has no say whatsoever

809
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,880
in switzerland at least the federal

810
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,600
government can impose rules on internet

811
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,600
voting and that's a good thing

812
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,399
as we're going to show

813
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,399
so this is the start of our timeline

814
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,159
and 2000 was the first project in

815
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,159
switzerland and this is running for 20

816
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,200
years apparently and uh to take a bit of

817
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,039
the suspense out we still don't have

818
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,399
internet voting in switzerland but at

819
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,480
least we tried for 20 years

820
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,240
uh 2004 uh geneva did the first trial so

821
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,919
geneva is second u.n place and geneva

822
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,760
had this historical mission to bring the

823
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,919
world internet voguing they really

824
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,919
understood this as their mission they

825
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,080
brought enlightenment to the went to the

826
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,919
world they brought calvinism to the

827
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,760
world so

828
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,840
for protestants geneva's very

829
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,520
important and i thought we're going to

830
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,520
bring internet voting to the world as

831
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,880
well and they made huge investments

832
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,840
2008 a spanish company cycle entered

833
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,640
switzerland in a canton of nurse hotel

834
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,440
and 2009 a consortium was founded that

835
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,399
unified eight swiss cantons we have 26

836
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,480
of them 26 regions so eight of them

837
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,080
joined and commissioned american unisys

838
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,919
of the swiss branch to develop an

839
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,080
internet voting system for them

840
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,799
in 2011 the government established a

841
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,039
steering committee a steering board to

842
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,760
direct the security regulation

843
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,600
that is very typical for switzerland you

844
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
have cantons doing the first step and

845
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,679
government going a bit behind

846
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,760
experimenting phase and then when they

847
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,679
think yeah this is ripe now this is

848
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,600
mature they're bringing federal

849
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,840
oversight and then there was supposed to

850
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,240
be two or three years and we settled but

851
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,159
that's not how this turned out

852
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:14,159
2015 government announced the unisys

853
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,679
development you've been working on for

854
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,320
six years eight cantons it's no good

855
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,840
it's

856
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,919
they didn't phrase it like that but it

857
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:22,720
said

858
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,519
we need major rewrites in a new security

859
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,519
architecture to allow it for federal

860
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,519
elections that was two months ahead of

861
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,440
the federal election so system died

862
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,120
immediately everybody abundant ship

863
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,720
uniset is dead

864
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,480
eight cantons without

865
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,080
the net voting

866
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,159
uh 2016

867
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,039
uh swiss post entered the market and

868
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,039
they joined with the spanish cycle

869
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,919
company from catalonia and the the

870
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,480
spaniards they are the internet voting

871
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,159
experts their commercial internet voting

872
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,559
company doing uh voting around the globe

873
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,480
entering the swiss market realizing oh

874
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,880
boy switzerland is so complicated we

875
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,519
need a local company to join with us

876
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,840
that do does the operating for us so

877
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,919
that was a very good match 2016

878
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,840
and when this was coming about uh

879
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,519
federal government announced let's do a

880
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,519
mainstreaming attempt

881
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,440
and 2019

882
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,279
half of the cantons should support this

883
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,039
now

884
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,000
and

885
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,880
that's not what happened because 2018

886
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,200
geneva threw the towels so after almost

887
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,919
20 years of development geneva realized

888
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,399
they're no longer able to finance this

889
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:34,080
so geneva gave up

890
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,919
more or less a year before the federal

891
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,320
election 2019

892
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,360
and

893
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,760
and then this terminated the system two

894
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,919
months ahead of the federal election

895
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,360
they said we're going to support it for

896
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,960
the federal election and the two months

897
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,600
ahead again no we cannot do this this is

898
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,399
not secure enough we give up

899
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:53,919
as of today

900
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,519
huge shock again

901
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,240
and then comes

902
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,760
swiss post

903
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,039
swiss posts

904
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,440
had to publish their source code

905
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,519
and had to run a bug bounty program so

906
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,880
government

907
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,360
forced swiss post to run a bug bounty

908
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,919
program under internet voting prior to

909
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,720
using it in the national election

910
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,600
and this was happening 2019 did anybody

911
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,159
follow the news around the swiss post

912
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,679
buck bounty

913
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,919
yeah you know the headlines guys don't

914
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,799
you yeah that turned out really well

915
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,720
and the headlines uh were a bit rough

916
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,720
but let's get to the good side first

917
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,960
because the program had two sides source

918
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,480
code publication

919
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,279
and bug bounty the buck bounty they went

920
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,320
to uh

921
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,519
the voting village at defcon in the us

922
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:44,880
and they handed out flyers they

923
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,880
literally did and they had 3 000 hackers

924
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,279
uh subscribed to the newsletter so they

925
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,799
could join

926
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,600
the buck bounty with a bounty of fifty

927
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,519
thousand us dollars or fifty thousand

928
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,399
almost fifty thousand euros

929
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:03,440
so that was good incentive and finally

930
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,320
around one thousand hackers actually

931
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,560
attempted to exploit it and here on the

932
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,679
left is what they found 16 findings

933
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,359
under best practices so up here is steal

934
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:16,320
a vote

935
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,599
without being detected 50 000 bucks

936
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,040
down here is best practice finding 100

937
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,079
bucks

938
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,560
actually we raised this i was part of

939
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,918
the project

940
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,159
we raised this to 400 for the most

941
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,719
severe bug the most severe bug that

942
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,199
anybody identified was injecting an

943
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,639
arbitrary

944
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,719
ip address in a log

945
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,719
that is bad

946
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,239
and it's actually my fault my

947
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,879
misconfiguration but it's far from

948
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,520
intrusion into the system or taking over

949
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,719
a system

950
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,879
so this is the headline that never made

951
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,960
the headlines the bug bounty run really

952
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,280
well and we're going to see why it ran

953
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,399
really well

954
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,640
because the source code publication did

955
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,400
not nearly as good

956
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,000
these are some of the tweets and the

957
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
headlines globally for the source code

958
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,680
publication so the researchers find

959
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,000
critical backdoor into his online voting

960
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,640
system or uh swiss cheese whole

961
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,440
foundation source code audit swiss post

962
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,480
puts e-voting on hold after the

963
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,359
researchers uncover critical security

964
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:22,079
errors again two months ahead of the

965
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,119
election swiss switzerland lost its

966
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,040
online voting system

967
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,400
this was supposed to be running in

968
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,880
several cantons you chock for them two

969
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,960
months ahead of federal election no

970
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,680
internet voting system again some of the

971
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,480
cantons were the same as were affected

972
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,320
four years earlier

973
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,440
so

974
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,040
on the one side

975
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,280
you had the live system that could not

976
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,280
be exploited on the other side you had

977
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,240
the source code that looked horribly

978
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,119
everybody confirmed this is bad code so

979
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,760
what the spanish company cycle provided

980
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,240
was bad source code and switzerland

981
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,240
swiss posted like this and run it in

982
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,320
production and they never really saw the

983
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,720
source code up to the publication as

984
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,520
well

985
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,839
and then they went oh that's a lot worse

986
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,040
than we thought

987
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,760
but that was too late and

988
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,000
they had kind of had been warned

989
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,200
but then a lot of people telling them

990
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,680
that was good stuff so it was it was a

991
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,640
bad awakening for everybody i expected

992
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,200
it to be bad i did not expect it to be

993
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,760
that bad but then reality is usually

994
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,000
harder than you expect

995
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,359
good how did does the story continue

996
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,400
the whole

997
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,560
online voting process had to be rebooted

998
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,880
obviously that that's not cutting it and

999
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,560
we need to bring in the experts we need

1000
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,240
to bring in science we need to talk to

1001
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,839
universities and industry experts with

1002
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,720
this so switzerland swiss government

1003
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,040
together with provinces commissioned a

1004
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,440
report

1005
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,680
and i had the honor to run the

1006
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,720
scientific committee to do this report

1007
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,960
so they picked me as a security engineer

1008
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,400
because i've always been very interested

1009
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,079
in that stuff because i've published

1010
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,079
around that stuff so of all the people

1011
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,640
that pick me to run this committee and

1012
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,440
we published a report this is uri if you

1013
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,560
happen to know anybody working in online

1014
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,680
voting

1015
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,920
send them this url everybody should be

1016
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,880
reading this report and the report says

1017
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,440
if you want to do internet voting this

1018
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,280
is how you're supposed to do we cannot

1019
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,440
guarantee it's going to work but don't

1020
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,079
do internet voting without taking this

1021
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,400
advice into consideration this is 80

1022
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,320
pages report and it's relatively

1023
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,480
readable i think

1024
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,599
good

1025
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,240
uh so that was uh the online dialogue

1026
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,320
and so resort scientific report and now

1027
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,320
new regulation is coming in and supposed

1028
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,640
to be published at the end of this year

1029
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,280
and then they want to start a new next

1030
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,160
year

1031
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,359
summary of internet voting in

1032
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,119
switzerland we've been doing this for 20

1033
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,000
years

1034
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,200
uh switzerland is a useful testbed

1035
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,280
because we vote four times a year so you

1036
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,440
get a lot of production experience

1037
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,760
uh it's an iterative process with strict

1038
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,359
supervision on the federal level and

1039
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,200
they're not shy to block production

1040
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,280
system two months ahead

1041
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,520
of federal elections

1042
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,280
there was an expert dialogue and new

1043
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,160
regulation in 2021 and new online voting

1044
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,800
trials are scheduled next year

1045
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,440
probably aiming at half percent of the

1046
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,079
voting population so we're very on a low

1047
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,760
level here and

1048
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,280
perhaps we continue like this for

1049
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,800
another 10 years

1050
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,760
until we are convinced that this time

1051
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,240
this is really secure enough to use in

1052
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,960
for larger numbers okay

1053
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,440
now how do you pull this off how do you

1054
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,480
invite

1055
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,119
3 000 hackers at defcon to attack your

1056
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,400
system and all they find is 16

1057
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,599
low impact bugs

1058
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,280
let's

1059
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,880
see

1060
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,880
swiss post

1061
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,119
thankfully published a documentation how

1062
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,359
they pulled this off it was two weeks

1063
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,760
ago so uh following the scientific

1064
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,920
dialogue they were commissioned to be

1065
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,160
more transparent you need to tell swiss

1066
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,240
citizens what you're doing here we need

1067
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,720
full transparency here we need all the

1068
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,880
source code permanent we need your

1069
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,200
documentation we need your security

1070
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,320
audits to raise trust and confidence in

1071
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,040
the voting population so they published

1072
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,079
their concept how to tune the web

1073
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,599
application firewall and that's a very

1074
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,359
useful

1075
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,640
document because it explains how to run

1076
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,359
the always call rule set in production

1077
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,359
in a high security setting

1078
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,760
it's not magic it's just hard work and

1079
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,560
that document explains how to do this

1080
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,079
download it and i've linked it on

1081
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,920
twitter as well

1082
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,320
good and then you want to tune down to

1083
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,800
zero that's the core of this document

1084
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,640
you have false positive of course you

1085
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,040
have pulse positive you enabled crazy

1086
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,880
rules you have thousands of false

1087
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,520
positives and what you do you tune them

1088
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,119
away you train you rule set to do the

1089
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,200
way with this and i was working on the

1090
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,800
process as i said i was working for

1091
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,800
swiss pose as a contractor and they

1092
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,880
didn't believe me they didn't believe me

1093
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,560
that their referrals positive they were

1094
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,240
real and we need to tune this and we

1095
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,720
need to test this like before we go to

1096
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,880
production we really need to test in of

1097
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,319
course they learn it the hard way they

1098
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:19,920
did the demo in front of a very

1099
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,920
important politician and the politician

1100
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,440
a defaults positive and he was blocked

1101
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,480
from voting

1102
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,960
the next day they launched a testing

1103
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,920
campaign with millions of http requests

1104
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,240
they hired a professional test engineer

1105
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,200
to run millions of requests over several

1106
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,000
months and we tuned away every single

1107
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,079
false positive and in the end we ran for

1108
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,640
two years without a single false

1109
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,520
positive in production so for two years

1110
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,400
eight or ten voting periods people voted

1111
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,240
and not a single false positive in the

1112
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,599
log files

1113
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,680
so that works

1114
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,920
and in the absence of false positive you

1115
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,680
start to trust in the alerts because

1116
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,400
then whenever you have an alert in your

1117
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,200
log monitor you know this is an attacker

1118
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,800
because before that you're never quite

1119
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,720
sure is this an attacker is it a benign

1120
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,599
user

1121
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,200
are we doing something wrong and that

1122
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,520
period is over we're entering a whole

1123
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,160
new level where we don't think twice

1124
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,160
there is an alert it's an attack

1125
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,200
and that is a very very liberal moment

1126
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,160
liberating moment because

1127
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,599
when you do this

1128
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,920
then you can't start to divide and rule

1129
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,520
then you're no longer paying attention

1130
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,200
then you know this ip address is

1131
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,319
offensive

1132
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:33,040
this client here is an attacker

1133
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,480
and now we're going to attack that

1134
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,400
attacker we're going to ban the attack

1135
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,000
we're using fail to ban you're no longer

1136
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,480
connecting to us we no longer accept tcp

1137
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,960
connection for your ip address

1138
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,960
after the first finding

1139
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,200
you know what that does to attackers

1140
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,200
when you stop talking to them

1141
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,920
immediately the first sign of an attack

1142
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,160
when somebody wants to exploit you and

1143
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,200
we're over

1144
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,560
stop talking

1145
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,839
that's highly highly effective but it

1146
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:02,079
means you need to tune down your false

1147
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,319
positive and it's really a worthwhile

1148
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:05,680
investment

1149
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,640
and then you need to go beyond this so

1150
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,520
you manage paranoia level four

1151
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,000
with the crs and then you want even more

1152
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,119
security so what can you do you do

1153
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,359
positive security rule set

1154
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:22,960
crs is a deny rule set it's a generic

1155
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,119
denial rule set it knows about the bad

1156
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,160
stuff it smells esql and then it rejects

1157
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,839
requests

1158
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,200
positive security is more like a

1159
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,440
firewall is a network firewall is

1160
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,079
configured it does default in i and then

1161
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,760
it says the following three requests are

1162
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,640
okay with online voting we had eight api

1163
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,839
endpoints

1164
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:43,920
and these were the only uris that were

1165
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,079
allowed and from this same point you do

1166
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,000
post and here you do get and if you mix

1167
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,440
the two then you're out

1168
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,079
out as in fail to ban

1169
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,160
so no playing around with our importance

1170
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,440
here no invention of fuzzying of

1171
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,319
parameter names no these are the 28

1172
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,160
parameters that we know

1173
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,680
and you're not trying them out and that

1174
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,640
parameter name is an is a digit and if

1175
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,480
you're trying a ladder you're out you're

1176
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,920
banned for an hour

1177
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,960
so

1178
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,560
it's highly effective

1179
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,720
actually it was so effective that for

1180
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,640
the buck bounty we had to disable fail

1181
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,560
to ban because government said if you're

1182
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,040
doing that you're pissing off the

1183
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,839
testers and they will get bad press

1184
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,800
so we had to switch off the fail to ban

1185
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,200
with defaulting i you list uh the

1186
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,040
allowed resources you can go as deep as

1187
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,760
you want and with that reduce the attack

1188
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,880
surface of course because you're

1189
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,040
building a defaulting eye wall as in a

1190
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,599
castle and then you open tiny arrow

1191
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,280
slits where you

1192
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,920
accepting requests

1193
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,440
good

1194
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,440
and then as i said

1195
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,520
you have you have all the means to

1196
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,920
identify the attackers now and then you

1197
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,520
divide and rule

1198
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,240
and you apply fail to ban or some other

1199
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,319
harsh measure to keep them off your

1200
00:43:58,319 --> 00:43:59,920
services

1201
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,200
what else

1202
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,200
can you or could you do you could

1203
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,520
monitor the flow of your application

1204
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,599
mod security and crs is not doing that

1205
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:10,960
it's purely request based so new request

1206
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,480
starts from scratch

1207
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,560
unless we apply fail to ban

1208
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,560
starting from zero again start with our

1209
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,800
detection and of course we could combine

1210
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,400
requests we could follow sessions we

1211
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,640
could say hey why do you access this end

1212
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,079
point if you haven't accessed that

1213
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,440
endpoint first

1214
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,800
so you could

1215
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,520
follow the flow of the application

1216
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,079
there is no rules that uh as far as i

1217
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:33,440
can tell because i'm no longer working

1218
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,800
for them that does that you could time

1219
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,280
and see a monitor the rhythm

1220
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,200
of a client they're doing highly

1221
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,240
effective

1222
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,160
both things you will probably need to

1223
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,000
apply additional measures beyond mod

1224
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,800
security like branch out to lua code

1225
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,480
that is very well supported

1226
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,640
and do lots of additional stuff i'd be

1227
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,560
really interested for somebody to do

1228
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,880
this or provide a framework to do this

1229
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,839
in

1230
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:00,560
in mod security combining with lua but i

1231
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,760
haven't seen this happening and you can

1232
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,319
do a client fingerprinting which is also

1233
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:05,760
very interesting

1234
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,880
and and then you go beyond mod security

1235
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,440
uh you need an application of

1236
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,079
an application layer denial of service

1237
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:17,119
prevention avaf can help you there

1238
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,520
probably need to do this in front of the

1239
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,359
valve

1240
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,280
or very good tools unfortunately mod

1241
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,800
security is not very good when it comes

1242
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,119
to denial of service prevention

1243
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,280
quality of service stuff you can do this

1244
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,240
on apache it's better in front of apache

1245
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,800
you could look at ip reputations

1246
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,880
as blacklisting and if you happen to be

1247
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,640
in a small country like switzerland then

1248
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,200
geoip happens as well of course if you

1249
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,280
want to do this for foreign voters then

1250
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,160
guip is a bit of an intro contradiction

1251
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,119
that's why that hasn't happened

1252
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:50,240
good

1253
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,640
uh so let me sum this up before we come

1254
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,119
to the end and you're released for lunch

1255
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,319
and the alwa's mod security coral said

1256
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:01,280
at paranoia level four is a baseline if

1257
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,720
you want a good series about high

1258
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,720
security setups that you only want to

1259
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,520
apply in front of your application

1260
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,440
you can do a complementary positive

1261
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,560
security rule set to raise

1262
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,400
the security even higher

1263
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,400
in fact

1264
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,720
positive security works very well for

1265
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,920
apis

1266
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,800
and not so well for free text while the

1267
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,640
crs doesn't work so nicely for apis but

1268
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,400
it works fairly well for free text

1269
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,800
applications and you have to do combined

1270
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,599
then they're kind of complementary

1271
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,839
so it's a good combination to run you

1272
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:38,960
want application level ddos qs and as i

1273
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,520
said so that brings you the high

1274
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,400
security buff look up the resources i

1275
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,240
shared on twitter

1276
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,400
if you want to dive deeper into this and

1277
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,720
if you're interested this is how you

1278
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,280
find me i can guide you i can help you

1279
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,520
and i'm running regular courses

1280
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,920
on mod security and the call rule says

1281
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,660
thank you for your attention

1282
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:07,790
[Applause]

1283
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,000
thank you very much christian is there

1284
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,520
any question

1285
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,640
yes

1286
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,400
the usual suspect in the second round

1287
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,200
yeah uh out of curiosity the fact that

1288
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,920
you're using this fail-to-ban approach

1289
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:22,880
to block

1290
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,359
attackers after like the first request

1291
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:28,079
or even not the first but after like few

1292
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,640
malicious requests isn't like a problem

1293
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,760
i mean if i i don't know let's say i buy

1294
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,319
a malicious advertisement advertisement

1295
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:37,760
company or a

1296
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,359
newspaper let's say on an online

1297
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,839
newspaper and then i throw some requests

1298
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:43,680
through javascript from the browsers of

1299
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,920
the users to your uh online online

1300
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,520
voting system basically i denied the

1301
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,839
service to everyone yes that is a

1302
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:52,400
problem that's not a problem and uh and

1303
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,760
of course we would notice and then we

1304
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,559
disable filterman okay and then we go

1305
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,000
that's something you were disabled in

1306
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,920
that case yeah i mean we're monitoring

1307
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,079
the fail to ban okay and if they fail to

1308
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,400
ban would in production

1309
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,960
one attacker per day because who's

1310
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,880
attacking swiss online voting system

1311
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,960
relatively few people do that

1312
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,839
so we would see very few fail to ban

1313
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:16,000
activations in production and then with

1314
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,839
suddenly thousands of ip addresses then

1315
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:19,920
hey all the alarms go off what is

1316
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,359
happening there and then you see hey

1317
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,839
look we have a problem here and there is

1318
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:26,559
an important uh thing about the os i

1319
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:29,359
mean dossing an internet voting system

1320
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:31,599
means you stop the election

1321
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:34,640
and an important detail is

1322
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,280
the online the electronic voting stops

1323
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,359
one day ahead

1324
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,680
so when the system collapses you can

1325
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,920
still go to the voting office

1326
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,839
and that was a very important dial of

1327
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:46,839
service

1328
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:48,960
defense that doesn't work for foreign

1329
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,359
voters but it works very well for local

1330
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,280
voters where you say hey look this is

1331
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,640
always open

1332
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,400
for four weeks you can do electronic

1333
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,280
voting but on saturday is over and you

1334
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,440
didn't manage to vote if the system died

1335
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,440
if your browser died or whatever

1336
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,520
happened you go to the voting office on

1337
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,079
