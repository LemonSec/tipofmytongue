1
00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:09,269
hello everyone so you are you're here to

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,099
know how to you or you can impress your

3
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:13,769
management especially when you know

4
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,749
nothing about Active Directory so if you

5
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,630
know nothing about Active Directory it's

6
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:20,670
simpler in a company when you are using

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:25,979
your Windows to type your password it's

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:43,170
going in to achieve directory so let's

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:47,730
start sorry okay okay so let's introduce

10
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:50,580
myself so I'm Vincent Lee - in French I

11
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:54,150
suppose you have understood yes based on

12
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:56,910
my accent so this is not a red team talk

13
00:00:54,150 --> 00:01:00,930
to change from the auto you got before

14
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:03,989
and to change also I'm not a red teamer

15
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:06,840
I'm a part of the management so I had a

16
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:10,789
position as architects or blue team or

17
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:13,469
Shia so everything you want about that

18
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:15,509
I'm also a farmer I didn't you be

19
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:17,699
because you have to start from from

20
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,240
something so when I started this project

21
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:24,329
I knew nothing about Active Directory

22
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:27,570
but I'm sitting because I write some

23
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:31,499
cards especially in the smart card world

24
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:35,788
I made the GD ideas up let's I play with

25
00:01:31,499 --> 00:01:39,229
open TCP a smart card but you may know

26
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:42,090
me as the contributor to mimic ads so

27
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:43,908
below you will see my name so each time

28
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,979
you run mimikatz and you see two names

29
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:49,679
Benjamin and the second one so the

30
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:51,899
second one is me and and no because I

31
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:55,609
love traveling around the world and no

32
00:01:51,899 --> 00:02:02,130
speaker in mini mini conference

33
00:01:55,609 --> 00:02:04,259
so you want to impress Gianluca I love I

34
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,359
love John Luke because it's it's a

35
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,580
French I mean this is only campaign of

36
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:12,930
John top prize which is French and the

37
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:15,900
franchise so sonic is you

38
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,450
is no some web that ad is important

39
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,090
because you got some indie enterprise

40
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:23,339
but as a manager he has so much things

41
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:26,760
to cover yes he got a layout with the

42
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:30,270
King on everything you you want as a

43
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,880
captain and if you speak about security

44
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:35,670
because you are the security guy it's up

45
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:40,280
to you to fix it and without any son LP

46
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:42,600
Jets you have to fix it silently but

47
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,630
when you go to the management you have

48
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:48,950
something with which happened so I put

49
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:53,130
this Dilbert cartoon and I just rephrase

50
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:54,988
some some some topics so you go to the

51
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,700
management you say Oh many cards is

52
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:58,470
right so password in quick tags it's

53
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,329
don't rules you can compromise your

54
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,609
Active Directory and we need to fix it

55
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:06,300
because before a new node picture and

56
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:09,300
then you got fired because this is not

57
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:14,670
this is not the way you you speak to to

58
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:17,340
to the management so maybe it start it's

59
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:19,829
it's time to start with the basics

60
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:24,209
because jean-luc jean-pierre is asking

61
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:26,760
for basic question so when I started

62
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:29,670
this project I was asking where is the

63
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,890
one one Active Directory course meaning

64
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,899
that I'm just touching my activity

65
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:37,679
Security Project where do I start

66
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:40,110
so I've made this map you have many

67
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,860
frameworks for example you have the

68
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,470
French one

69
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,360
you got us one you got the German one I

70
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:48,959
don't know but Italy I didn't make any

71
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:52,080
research you got very specific control

72
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,860
for example you get the stick TI g

73
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,620
control of the US you got many things to

74
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:02,489
control for example for for GPO so this

75
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:05,190
is from general to basics and when you

76
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:08,700
are looking at tools you got very

77
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:11,549
advanced tool so I put the French one

78
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,820
for example you got bit here with which

79
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:17,160
was made by Airbus you don't you got

80
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:20,459
activity control pass you got also a

81
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:24,080
blonde that everybody should know many

82
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:27,409
tools to check for GPO

83
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,330
you go to sue scanner for the wanna cry

84
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:32,090
light but when you want to have a big

85
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:35,120
picture I didn't find any tool to do it

86
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:41,900
so my basic question was Oh match

87
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:46,250
domains do I have and I don't know so

88
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:48,650
let's start with let's continue with a

89
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:51,199
also basic question of the basic

90
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:54,378
question is how much do your users do I

91
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:57,319
have in my domain so you google it and

92
00:04:54,379 --> 00:05:02,210
basically you find two way to get the

93
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:05,389
answer the first one is a Porsche I'll

94
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:08,359
come and let you type get a user you do

95
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:10,789
a pipe you can't it's very fast it's

96
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,159
takes only two minutes but you need to

97
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:14,360
install something and you need to be

98
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:17,150
local I mean to do it

99
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,129
it's an onion kid you got also circa me

100
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:22,008
to the BG's that everybody can can run

101
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:26,719
you just run an LDAP search and you Kunz

102
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:32,199
the number of results but in real life

103
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:36,349
it's very slow and it's not very usable

104
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:38,180
let's continue I have my domain and I

105
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:40,849
want to know a match domains are

106
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:45,229
connected to my domain so I go to Google

107
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:48,139
and I see a list of answers and I'm just

108
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:51,979
trying every everyone's job proposed so

109
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:55,310
the first one is to run get slash get -

110
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:58,520
edit trust but because I'm not that mean

111
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:01,370
I was not able to install air SAT so I'm

112
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:05,029
not able to run it okay so you can use

113
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:08,419
net done but netdom is also part of air

114
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:11,360
SAT so you can't do it you have a nice

115
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:15,590
tool which is pop-up use that don't have

116
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:19,129
any prerequisite except not being

117
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:23,568
detected as a malware so it's difficult

118
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:25,789
and if you look in the image section you

119
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:29,180
will find the screenshot in the middle

120
00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:31,789
on which shows a choice that's exactly

121
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,889
what you want the program is because

122
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:35,180
this this pop-up is part of the onion

123
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:40,789
kit you need

124
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:43,910
mean to run it and you want to ask the

125
00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:51,009
mean here is data but he also seen he

126
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:54,800
has other things to do so good luck so I

127
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:56,690
wanted to have something generic the

128
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,039
goal was to have another view of my

129
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:03,650
domain be able to build a map it was a

130
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:07,130
inspired from the previous audits with

131
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:09,799
the earth and the best practice so the

132
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:12,710
idea behind this report is to have a

133
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:17,270
global overview of the ad and to be able

134
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:21,849
to assign a program to every person

135
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:25,130
which is a constable for it so I tried

136
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:29,630
what everybody should have tried before

137
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:34,820
me that means a right portion script so

138
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:38,360
it's easy to do so I've done it but what

139
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:41,270
we found out on the field is that it's

140
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,220
out to deburr partial script I mean it's

141
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:45,919
a because you get an ear or so you can

142
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:49,210
see the vero but you need to understand

143
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:52,219
the logics before getting to this error

144
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:54,620
so when you have someone on the phone

145
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:57,770
which I got an ear or can I fix it it's

146
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:00,770
very difficult something which was also

147
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:02,570
surprising for something like Mia is

148
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:06,469
that when you are running a partial

149
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:09,560
command lets you can get as it puts nil

150
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:11,479
nothing or a single object or an array

151
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,440
that means that if you are applying a

152
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:20,599
coat it is a current it doesn't work

153
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:24,110
surprisingly in our sec package i was

154
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:27,199
surprised that you have a common led

155
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:29,210
which allow you to tell you the number

156
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,390
of people to tell you the member of a

157
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:34,419
group directly but when you have a

158
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:36,740
people which is from another domain

159
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:39,620
which is called the foreign security but

160
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:43,310
simple it just doesn't work and to add

161
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:45,890
to that we add only a few expertise so

162
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:48,390
it was very hard to do it so you can see

163
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:51,390
at the left we are to split the street

164
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:55,920
many many minutes apart and as a

165
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:59,400
consequence is we met so many version so

166
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:03,089
to be able to added Active Directory we

167
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:06,900
have made up to 24 versions so you can

168
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:09,060
see at the upper right the list of of

169
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:12,000
change and you can see that it is

170
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:15,030
getting a lot and a lot feedback to get

171
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,220
improving and in addition to that when

172
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:18,930
you get some results you are just a

173
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,090
newbie and you get to the expert also

174
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:24,959
experts a you a newbie you don't know

175
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:30,480
this you leave me alone and it was very

176
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:32,520
difficult to move on so let's make a

177
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,500
demo of Pinkus are the results of four

178
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,500
years of hard work

179
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:48,150
so it's will demo it's not recorded demo

180
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:54,290
so you can see my lab as plenty of

181
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:56,490
domains yes this is a company now so

182
00:09:54,290 --> 00:10:00,060
what I suggest to do when you are

183
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:03,330
getting back to work Monday you go to

184
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:06,300
tinker start karma then you see it's

185
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:10,430
very easy you switch to download I have

186
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,430
to demo it to show you as simple it is

187
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:15,109
another thing

188
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,120
okay so

189
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:36,240
yasmin it again so you go to ping

190
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,080
Castile calm it's easy to remember being

191
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,360
like ping pong caster like a fortress

192
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:45,540
you don't read the blah blah you go

193
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:50,040
straight to download you get down you

194
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:54,449
have a big download button it's super

195
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:58,469
complicated you get the zip and inside

196
00:10:54,450 --> 00:11:00,810
the zip you got just an exec and because

197
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:08,850
I don't want to mess with my lab I have

198
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:12,030
already Pincus are here so when you

199
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:13,980
double-click on it you got a menu but

200
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:15,630
because it's too complex for management

201
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,810
and you know you have just that press

202
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:20,670
'enter because this is a default option

203
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:28,500
you goes right because you want to edit

204
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:30,240
your domains and up it's done so for

205
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:34,920
very complex domain it's the King

206
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:39,510
between 2 and 10 minutes you can see

207
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:42,360
that the program has created two files

208
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:45,600
the one is the first one is an until

209
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:48,750
HTML file and the second one is an XML

210
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:53,340
file so you can directly open the HTML

211
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:57,810
file so I will enable the JavaScript

212
00:11:53,340 --> 00:12:01,320
because there is some something cool so

213
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:03,449
is here is the report for my domains so

214
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,780
what the management lags is a big

215
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:11,340
indicator very simplified so here is the

216
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:14,970
one so you are at 85 up to hundred so

217
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:16,050
you are in the red zone you got also

218
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:18,560
many indicators

219
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:21,420
I won't don't want to spend much time

220
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:25,170
you get the words which has been added

221
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:27,180
so for example this rule is is by

222
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:29,219
default I wasn't aware when I started

223
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:32,699
this project but anyone can add a

224
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:35,450
computer to to the main so you got the

225
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,450
detail for the rules

226
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:44,579
you got many a generic informations for

227
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:50,009
the computers for the operating systems

228
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:52,469
for the domain controllers I will put

229
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:59,299
very fast if you want to know the list

230
00:12:52,470 --> 00:13:09,299
of n means here can have many many

231
00:12:59,299 --> 00:13:14,639
digital things etc etc but I will show

232
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:17,549
you now the cold stuff you can see that

233
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:21,209
you have an XML file here so basically

234
00:13:17,549 --> 00:13:24,299
it is the content of the XML report but

235
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:27,149
with that you can you can build more

236
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:33,569
things so I will run link a cell with

237
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:35,429
audio domains of my labs so enter an

238
00:13:33,569 --> 00:13:38,878
instant of just by signature will enter

239
00:13:35,429 --> 00:13:44,939
star so it will scan all the domain that

240
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:49,019
this program can access it's a little

241
00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:56,599
slow because my lab is huge sticking 20

242
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:56,600
seconds of the tab okay

243
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:06,000
okay here so what you have is that you

244
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:10,050
have basically runs the report on all

245
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,950
domains of your company on but you have

246
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:16,859
some bunnies things for example on you

247
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:21,750
are able to get the map all of your

248
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:31,340
domains so you can see in my lab that I

249
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:31,340
got seven domains okay

250
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,150
and on the field you will discover that

251
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:51,410
it's art to fixing suppose everybody

252
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:53,970
know it so this is one or two courses

253
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:56,130
about the vulnerability scanner so

254
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:59,790
everybody should have an ability scanner

255
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:02,640
and when you go to eat you go to rule

256
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:07,439
and what's cool is that you get a

257
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:09,720
solution mark so you run your system you

258
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,940
you on your vanity scan your every month

259
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:15,300
so I require you get a list of problem

260
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:19,980
you get a list of fixes to to apply and

261
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:22,589
you forward it to the admin right not

262
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:26,100
exactly because the next quarter or the

263
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:28,680
next month the problem is still there so

264
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:33,210
you want you need to check by yourself

265
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:35,370
is if the program is fixed or not so for

266
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:38,550
the new session you have many tools to

267
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:42,420
to check for it so for example you got

268
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:45,329
an nmap script button mat and map

269
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:48,479
requires and in right

270
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:50,520
you can play with our pc clients but you

271
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,980
need linux and if you are running it

272
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,030
from from a vm you need you need admin

273
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,400
right

274
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:59,339
you can run Wireshark but you need and

275
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:02,569
invites and you have this little command

276
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:08,529
at the right netshoes

277
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:10,940
/ IP address IP Cesaro with a mule but

278
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:12,260
the problem is that if you want to test

279
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,470
the domain controller because you have

280
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,709
already Ossetian it doesn't work so it's

281
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:19,040
not

282
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:23,199
intrapersonal either really reliable

283
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:26,420
sorry but when you are looking deeper

284
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:28,519
you will find out that there is two way

285
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:32,360
to to enable the new decision

286
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:34,399
the first one that every knows everybody

287
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,070
knows about I mean you just connect with

288
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,720
an empty users but you got also another

289
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:43,760
way to do it

290
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:45,980
you got some translation mechanism that

291
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:49,939
can be used without any authentication

292
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:53,660
and you just ask the system to translate

293
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:56,779
one ID to one users so for example you

294
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:59,870
do for the first one so s ID of the

295
00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:01,880
domain - 500 and then the system I'll

296
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:03,860
show to you and mean then you try the

297
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,839
next one the next one the next one until

298
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:09,679
you get no users so with these

299
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:14,020
techniques you are able to to enumerate

300
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:17,299
all the users of the domain and why

301
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:21,530
because you got some secret root cause

302
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:25,129
which is not documented so when you

303
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:29,059
install a Windows 2003 I mean 15 years

304
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:32,179
ago you had the small checkbox in the

305
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:34,428
restoration with are we which asking you

306
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:38,000
if you want to maintain the

307
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:39,830
compatibility with Windows to 2000 and

308
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,270
if you checked yes because you didn't

309
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:43,960
want to break anything

310
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:47,600
what you got is that you got any one

311
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:51,230
sorry anonymous I did as a member of the

312
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:54,620
pre Windows 2000 compatible access group

313
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:55,610
and because this user is here you got

314
00:17:54,620 --> 00:18:00,379
new session

315
00:17:55,610 --> 00:18:04,490
I got also a nice nice single of the

316
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:06,980
filter I got someone trying to insult

317
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:10,490
SharePoint and it wasn't working with

318
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:13,040
with users so the guy just google it

319
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:15,779
find out - and it just applied to it so

320
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,879
they ought to explain to him that yes

321
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:21,479
defy the special attribute named es

322
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:24,209
eristic and to change the value so

323
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:26,460
unless you know the special trick it's

324
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:33,419
very hard to protect your Active

325
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:36,119
Directory so before impressing jean-luc

326
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:39,690
I think you need to impress the active

327
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:41,580
directory guy because it will do an 80%

328
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:45,210
of the job and you did a bad job

329
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:49,699
previously with new session but let's go

330
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:53,729
and so I will show you a very specific

331
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:56,580
specific trick that most of the idea

332
00:18:53,729 --> 00:18:58,529
mean don't know and with this trick you

333
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:01,619
will be able to show you that you you

334
00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:05,849
know a little things bit better than

335
00:19:01,619 --> 00:19:09,869
email so in my research for example I

336
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:12,029
wanted to detect and patch computer but

337
00:19:09,869 --> 00:19:14,820
to detect on patch computer you need to

338
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:16,499
connect to Windows Update and you need

339
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:19,168
to have statistics you need to be a mean

340
00:19:16,499 --> 00:19:21,389
and it's very complex but you can

341
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:23,989
reverse the problem I mean if you go to

342
00:19:21,389 --> 00:19:26,758
a computer which didn't reboot for while

343
00:19:23,989 --> 00:19:29,279
six months one year you can guess that

344
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:33,529
this computer has not been patched so

345
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:37,019
the idea is to get the last startup time

346
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:39,179
so at the top right you have a commands

347
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:41,580
that you can run it's entitled by

348
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:45,239
default and you can get the startup time

349
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:48,839
of computer so I think this one's I mean

350
00:19:45,239 --> 00:19:52,469
those but the left one I think we didn't

351
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:54,178
know about it I mean when you have SMB

352
00:19:52,469 --> 00:19:56,609
v2

353
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:59,489
when you just connect without any

354
00:19:56,609 --> 00:20:02,449
authentication the answer is the server

355
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:06,989
answers for the first packet it answers

356
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:09,509
with response that contains the startup

357
00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:11,249
time so you can you have the link you

358
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:12,899
can choose to that means that you can

359
00:20:11,249 --> 00:20:15,269
get the startup time of a computer

360
00:20:12,899 --> 00:20:18,468
without any authentication so it's good

361
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:21,479
if you want to to scan your computers

362
00:20:18,469 --> 00:20:24,899
for the trust you can get the

363
00:20:21,479 --> 00:20:27,299
information by doing an LDAP query so

364
00:20:24,899 --> 00:20:28,110
there is no magic but because you can

365
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:31,889
get to the

366
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:34,979
of the trust you can get the trust

367
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:35,610
creation date that and I mean did forget

368
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,250
about it

369
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:41,850
and you can know if a trust is active or

370
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:44,370
not I mean every Saturdays the password

371
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:46,620
of the trust need to be changed and if

372
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:49,350
the password is change the truth object

373
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:56,340
is change but if there is no change in

374
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:57,529
the trust the trust is inactive two

375
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,939
slides

376
00:20:57,529 --> 00:21:05,370
most of the I mean don't know about

377
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:07,860
metadata because it's it's an either an

378
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:11,789
attribute or it in command so you can

379
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:14,309
reach with it with LDP that exceeds I

380
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:18,299
edit if you you have to switch some some

381
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:19,860
options but not Eddy Explorer based on

382
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:22,860
that you get some information from his

383
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:25,678
own peril about the last change time or

384
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:28,789
much time it has a big change Exeter etc

385
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,679
but now let's get to the cool stuff you

386
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:35,039
can know the number of times the Kami

387
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:38,190
TGT password has been changed and what

388
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:41,850
was the last time this password has been

389
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:44,760
changed because if the users is using

390
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:47,549
the wizard question it just clear clear

391
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:50,220
a field and you lose the information so

392
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:53,519
you get getting this information you can

393
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:56,700
also play with an attribute name schema

394
00:21:53,519 --> 00:22:00,720
info you will just google about it and

395
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:03,570
with with attributes you can know the

396
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,669
number of change that have been applied

397
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:09,090
to the Chimel since the creation of the

398
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:12,720
forest so in the red bubble you can see

399
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:16,740
seven see seven you do a change and it

400
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:21,029
becomes seven c8 so you you got an

401
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:23,940
increment and based on the metadata you

402
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:26,460
can get the data of the lights change so

403
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:31,049
you can get very advanced information

404
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:34,889
without any right last but not least you

405
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:37,710
get an attribute name DSS the D as a

406
00:22:34,889 --> 00:22:40,408
signature on each partition on

407
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:40,980
so then me know commands name rep and

408
00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:44,070
meaner

409
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:46,350
to get the same information but you

410
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:50,639
don't need to have this rigidity you can

411
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:52,740
just get the metadata no each time this

412
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,440
attribute has been changed and you can

413
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:59,990
know if the server has not been back

414
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:03,180
copied any time or weekly or daily and

415
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:06,950
and that means it thinks that this

416
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:10,770
information is confidential but it's not

417
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:23,670
and I think it's time for a demo to show

418
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:27,000
you more funny things so if you look at

419
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:29,910
this at this map so we are here we are

420
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,910
here on the domain and you can see that

421
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:35,940
you have many some kind of complex

422
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:39,720
actually actually - so you have a forest

423
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:43,370
here you have a forest here you have

424
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:46,050
another forest and you go to Bastion and

425
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:49,889
I will show you that the Bastion which

426
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:56,280
is a overprotected you can extract all

427
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:58,920
the users of the Bastion so I will run

428
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:03,000
in Castile and we'll switch to the

429
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:05,510
scanning section I will use foreign news

430
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,510
your scanner

431
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:22,080
so I want to enumerate the people of

432
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:24,270
this position so goes and I need to

433
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:27,750
input the servers that you can access

434
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:32,420
which is closest to this to this

435
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:32,420
computer so in this case it is this one

436
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:52,290
so you see everything has been

437
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:54,899
successful so you see you got the list

438
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:56,730
of all the users of the bastion so the

439
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:59,850
bastion is a flea protected with

440
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:02,430
firewalls with unidirectional trust and

441
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:10,770
even with that you can get to it it's

442
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:14,490
not an attack it's a feature I will show

443
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:18,629
also some nice strike

444
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:25,830
I think this techniques is not public I

445
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:27,870
treated it budget check so I will run it

446
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:33,389
on my computer so you will you will see

447
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:37,620
it and I will ask for a friend domain so

448
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:40,650
what I was doing here is that I was

449
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:42,689
connecting to the domain I'm connecting

450
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:46,860
to the translation service which

451
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:50,420
translate ace ID to user ID and I'm

452
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:55,649
using the fact that each service as

453
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:58,290
virtual users so I'm just connected to

454
00:25:55,650 --> 00:26:00,150
this domain using this this translation

455
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:04,860
and trying to see if the service is

456
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:13,700
installed or not and because I know it's

457
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:13,699
not the right which is

458
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,140
and because I was about to find the

459
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,150
service name wind event I am about to

460
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:25,090
know that Windows Defender is installed

461
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:30,940
but I have made it on my computer but I

462
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:49,480
can do it on friend computer I can do it

463
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:51,690
and oops that's the right the right one

464
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,690
magician

465
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:57,460
okay

466
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:05,630
so you see it has not fun any service so

467
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:09,350
the computer seems to be unpatched but

468
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:12,950
because maybe you don't trust me I will

469
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:24,610
scan it with another service so I will

470
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:27,440
use the time series will scan it ok and

471
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:29,870
you see that it was about to find that

472
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,240
there is a Windows service here so you

473
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:35,000
can eternally you can use this feature

474
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,770
as a vulnerability scanner to know if if

475
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,280
some product is installing not for

476
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:42,340
example Apache IAS or something like

477
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,340
that

478
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:52,370
and also if you want to use it in a

479
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:55,130
standalone feature especially for red

480
00:27:52,370 --> 00:28:00,649
tomorrow I've extracted this feature in

481
00:27:55,130 --> 00:28:05,120
Porsche script so you can use it so we

482
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:08,510
have impressed the admin and now it's

483
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:12,739
time to get closer to the management so

484
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:17,270
what our line with the management is

485
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:21,050
that you have to speak you have to make

486
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:23,210
very first things you can see on the an

487
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:26,629
image which is from a movie

488
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:30,560
Martin : as the CEO of a big company is

489
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:35,260
asking to be to be to be speaked

490
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:35,260
as a child you know you see or DoDEA

491
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:43,729
don't waste management energy I won't go

492
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:45,650
into details into the slides I made a

493
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:47,750
talk I'd blow out two budgets about

494
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:50,150
domain discovery but when you are

495
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:52,010
launching an address security project

496
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:54,500
you will find domains and domains and

497
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:57,730
dimension dimension domains and if you

498
00:28:54,500 --> 00:29:00,549
put the management and

499
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:03,490
too soon you will waste the management

500
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:07,059
energy and you will be left alone so

501
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:10,720
don't get into technical too soon it is

502
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:15,100
very a trap so you are ready to improve

503
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:19,090
the management's ready so you go to Jean

504
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:23,709
Luc okay hello jean-luc I want to make

505
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:26,889
all the owner and pink Estelle once this

506
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:30,549
quarter so you gots women's to run it

507
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:32,679
once and the good is not to surf the

508
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:36,370
problem don't surf the problem is just

509
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:40,450
to evaluate the budget for next year

510
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:44,439
and it's got no money so basically every

511
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:46,419
blocking point you remove it you will

512
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,850
move it you just say you want to run it

513
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:55,740
because it's not look but no pressure

514
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:55,740
and then time to pink ass turn magic

515
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:04,390
oops not the right and the right

516
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:10,980
computer that's a problem having too

517
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:15,070
much BM so I would use another program

518
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:19,440
then King Castile reporting and I will

519
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:19,439
ask him to generate nicely a template

520
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:25,470
oops it's low not supposed to be slow

521
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:33,960
such the demo effect ah yes I know why

522
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:36,760
because it's shaking for the computer

523
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,280
for the prime digital signature are just

524
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:47,850
two unconnected so it will get it will

525
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:47,850
be faster YT is why it is why it is okay

526
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:55,639
so what I just made it right now is to

527
00:30:52,850 --> 00:31:00,679
build an excel file you know it's super

528
00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:05,690
complex now I will fill this excel file

529
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:09,340
with the list of my domains protein the

530
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:09,340
protein the protein that is here

531
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:22,269
price so you see it's super complex

532
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:25,299
I just put my domains I found out in my

533
00:31:22,269 --> 00:31:30,490
previous study I just put a BU in that

534
00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:38,490
solo by some that I will run again the

535
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:42,750
program and I will build a poor points

536
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:42,750
yes management of powerpoints

537
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:52,380
so this is a four-point but because it

538
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:55,890
is inside the VM it's not it's not good

539
00:31:52,380 --> 00:32:04,559
to to be seen from outside so I have the

540
00:31:55,890 --> 00:32:07,340
same PowerPoint here just in case so

541
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:09,840
when when I started this project I just

542
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:12,090
until ten times

543
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,750
I just feel an excel file with the

544
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:19,110
result and that's Ola and and with that

545
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:21,390
you got a nice dashboard

546
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:25,260
okay it's not branded it's it's your job

547
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:27,840
you have to be paid for that but you

548
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:30,929
know on match domains has been covered

549
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:34,678
you know the average risk you know what

550
00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:39,179
is a featuring status you can get the

551
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:41,010
detail by bu it's okay not okay you can

552
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:44,309
know the detail like that and you can

553
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:47,700
switch Bobby you so you have if you want

554
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:50,280
to infinite to split the work across

555
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:57,090
many bu you get you got already the

556
00:32:50,280 --> 00:33:01,668
kpi's you can also do the same but I

557
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:01,668
don't have much time okay we stop here

558
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:16,429
okay no getting to your management work

559
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:19,190
you need to go expanding to the lower

560
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:23,060
management that's depending and the code

561
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:26,060
or jean-luc can be a pea green or a

562
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:27,470
nappy red you have to do it I mean it's

563
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:30,500
very important it's very technical

564
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:32,300
that's why you made so much you so much

565
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:34,520
to do so they have to tease you have to

566
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:37,610
work and they will walk because people

567
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:42,050
don't like red and then you go back to

568
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:45,530
John Luke thanks to his decision he has

569
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:48,889
made a new security and Couture but best

570
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:51,470
it can go to his management Sonic's

571
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:55,010
management's to explain that the

572
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:59,360
security subject is all that he has made

573
00:33:55,010 --> 00:34:02,660
things got measurable results and get to

574
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,830
a point that is likely a scheme is

575
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:06,260
management is there

576
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:08,960
I get budget to fix it so more money for

577
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:12,380
him more money for you or it was said

578
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:14,870
very to the management so if if you got

579
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:18,320
a problem is not your fault is not John

580
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:21,739
export is the management's sonics -

581
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:24,380
one's fault and because of Zach jean-luc

582
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:28,729
we get our bonus you will get a bonus

583
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:33,680
you will get two ponies I tried to make

584
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:35,179
it super simple but if you don't want to

585
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,489
have the simple part I have just two

586
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:41,149
slides I will explain in more

587
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:46,969
metallurgic way what we have done here

588
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:50,120
it's called maturity so this diagram is

589
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:52,339
inspired by CMMI if you don't know CMMI

590
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,929
it has been made by canopy Milan which

591
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:56,180
is also designs of surfed

592
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:59,690
brand so if you all about say it's going

593
00:34:56,179 --> 00:35:02,120
to be me alone it's CMMI same six so

594
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:04,460
it's fronting from step one in a short -

595
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:07,279
repeatable defined manager optimising

596
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:08,930
in sharks five its mini cuts we want to

597
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,230
detect mimikatz you have to be at the

598
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:14,930
five five steps and in pics and style

599
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:17,000
focus on those two first steps the first

600
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:18,230
one is defined as copying you know what

601
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,060
is your active directory

602
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:21,630
you know if it's

603
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:27,640
good or it's bad and you have already

604
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:30,460
built something and this maturity its

605
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:33,839
I've brought a paper which is on the

606
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:36,580
website when we zoom into this process

607
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:38,710
into these main processes you got ship

608
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:41,710
processes and for each processes you get

609
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:42,400
the KPI so if you want to impress more

610
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:44,620
jean-luc

611
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:48,820
because maybe jean-luc is the technical

612
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:51,040
guy you can go here and and and make

613
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:52,930
things right and the best thing with

614
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:56,410
this methodology is that you can get a

615
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:58,270
single score for wall company and manage

616
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:02,129
more like having a score for a company

617
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:07,480
before they are paying this company so

618
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:12,430
it's good so a writer time time to get

619
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:15,730
the conclusion on spoiler pink Esther do

620
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:18,009
not stop mimic ads I write many cats I

621
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:20,110
write pinkest are not completely mimic

622
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:22,990
add some to be honest it's more Benjamin

623
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:26,710
job but I do not climb to stop mini cats

624
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:29,529
but at least if you get hot after being

625
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:31,570
run pink Estella you can say okay I've

626
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:33,430
done something but if you didn't run

627
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:37,030
think I said before getting hacked you

628
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:40,330
have no excuses so what I found the

629
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:44,020
field is that you get to two vendors so

630
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:46,990
I don't think there is any ad security

631
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:50,050
from those air but basically they sell

632
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:52,209
to you a big houses big deal cause ease

633
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:55,090
with the pool with the tennis court

634
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:58,300
everything you want but just forgot to

635
00:36:55,090 --> 00:37:03,730
put the foundation and then it collapses

636
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:07,690
so what what I promised to you with pink

637
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:09,220
castle is to build strong foundation so

638
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:11,560
you will be able to build the O's you

639
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:13,689
want if you have no budget we have just

640
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,759
a basic foundation but if you have

641
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:20,830
budget we have a big house with a nice

642
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:21,870
pool and to conclude on you have no more

643
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:25,390
excuses

644
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:28,420
just run Tinka style as jean-luc

645
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:37,540
alright thank you

646
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:39,800
[Applause]

647
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:43,250
because it's too complicated you gotta

648
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:46,870
sue the link before it disappear take

649
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:49,760
the pictures show it to the management

650
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:52,790
you know management you have to speak

651
00:37:49,760 --> 00:38:00,470
slowly like a child or dog this is a

652
00:37:52,790 --> 00:38:04,190
link okay so anyway any question for

653
