1
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:13,250
right so the first thing that we're

2
00:00:10,309 --> 00:00:17,390
going to talk about is just to get into

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:18,230
a bit of the history of why I think this

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,170
is interesting

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,400
so Federation is a word that's tossed

6
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:26,929
around a lot

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:30,729
we have federated identities we have the

8
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:33,980
concept of email of various systems

9
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:35,990
talking to each other and people kind of

10
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:41,330
get confused about what Federation

11
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:43,730
really is and so it started a long time

12
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:48,440
ago we had Bob and Alice they wanted to

13
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:48,949
send each other mail and so how did that

14
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,800
work

15
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:54,560
Bob just knew Alice's email address

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:58,160
allison yahoo.com sent it nobody really

17
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:01,550
thinks about how this works right in

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,250
essence it's just DNS it's just lines in

19
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:06,679
a config file somewhere that says okay

20
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,200
Gmail lookup where's yahoo.com

21
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:15,649
we do this now with serve records Auto

22
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:17,719
come a big idea in this right I am has

23
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:20,560
never really done this people have

24
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:24,109
talked about it since the late 90s and

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,549
this has been the Holy Grail big tenant

26
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:28,039
in systems where people could talk

27
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:31,490
together or hosted systems where

28
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:34,369
everything just kind of worked and the

29
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:36,199
view is still somewhat like this you're

30
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:40,009
running three different clients you have

31
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:43,219
really weird names and you can only talk

32
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:45,799
to people within your silos so if I get

33
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:50,589
a friend who is on AOL and I don't run

34
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:55,819
in I needed to go get it so the goal of

35
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:57,409
Federation is you're one person the

36
00:01:55,819 --> 00:02:00,829
reason that the pictures changed is

37
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:03,590
because the new players are all talking

38
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:05,630
XMPP so a few people are still lagging

39
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:09,810
behind but most of this is working over

40
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:13,349
XMPP and so the big

41
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:15,599
of Federation is you only have a single

42
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:16,769
identity now or we're working towards a

43
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,349
point where you have a single identity

44
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,090
and you can talk to everybody you want

45
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:27,839
to talk to you

46
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:31,260
so as anybody heard of XMPP before cool

47
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,940
at least a few people so XMPP is also

48
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,399
one of those things which is talked

49
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:40,079
about in reverent tones and gets a

50
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:42,569
little confusing but the basis of XMPP

51
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,670
think about it as a transport for

52
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:46,170
building other protocols and when they

53
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,518
put this together they really couldn't

54
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,780
make a decision on exactly what

55
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,850
protocols they want it to be able to

56
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:54,750
support so they'll pretty much support

57
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:57,989
anything so it is a layer 7 transport

58
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:00,150
and you can bind it to anything it's if

59
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:01,830
the original documentation said you

60
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:05,790
could run it over UDP or you could run

61
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:08,180
it over TCP it runs over HTTP now it

62
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:13,500
runs over other various binary protocols

63
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:16,620
but it can run over any transport that

64
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,590
can support sending messages back and

65
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:22,140
forth between endpoints and XMPP is a

66
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,880
structured XML document which seems a

67
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,410
little weird because it's a document

68
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,900
that starts out but you don't have the

69
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:30,900
whole thing when you begin and at some

70
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,310
point in the document building process

71
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,329
you'll actually start all the way back

72
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,819
at the beginning and throw out the

73
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:38,310
document that you have except you keep

74
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:40,738
the state that you build up as you were

75
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:43,049
parsing it and there are three main

76
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:46,850
building blocks they call them stanzas

77
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:49,620
and their message IQ and presence which

78
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:51,519
were named for the first primary

79
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:55,980
workloads

80
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:58,420
so building block number one is message

81
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,100
it's pretty easy to think about you want

82
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:04,179
to send somebody and I'm Mayim message

83
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:06,579
and you have a body but it can also have

84
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:09,040
a few other ideas you can have subjects

85
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,420
for it you can put thread IDs in it if

86
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,140
you want to try and tie different

87
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:17,680
messages together and you can get really

88
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:21,700
really complicated with it which leaves

89
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,040
us room for screwing around because you

90
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:28,000
can have alternate representations in

91
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:30,550
your message so the first subject is in

92
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,250
English because the primary language of

93
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,810
the stanza is tagged as English if they

94
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,780
left this off you're supposed to assume

95
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:41,860
it's English but there's also a French

96
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:44,140
tag and a French body a thread ID that

97
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:47,200
says who my parent was and what my

98
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:49,750
current thread ID is and also you can

99
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:55,120
put XHTML into the body as well if you

100
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:56,710
want to have formatting so one of the

101
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,130
interesting problems with this besides

102
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:03,810
the fact that there you run into

103
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:06,730
interest with Unicode parsing and

104
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:08,500
homophones is if you're running

105
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:12,010
compliance on this thing what do you

106
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:15,730
actually log and who actually saw which

107
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:18,760
body you're not quite sure but in terms

108
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:22,060
of building protocols message is also

109
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,950
kind of like UDP and it's also a bit

110
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,170
like TCP if you add in message

111
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:28,930
acknowledgments but to start out with

112
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:31,210
it's UDP or push so the idea is we

113
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,110
needed a way to send a message to

114
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:36,219
somebody else

115
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:40,150
who hadn't really requested it the

116
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:43,450
payload of a message in XML schema

117
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:46,299
contains an access any every one of the

118
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:49,990
stanzas contains an excess ne so after

119
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:52,440
the supplied elements you can put pretty

120
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:56,680
much whatever you want in there so an

121
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,930
example of a new protocol is when you're

122
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,479
typing in an ion client and the other

123
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,979
side sees you know Jason is typing to

124
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:04,280
you right now you need some way to

125
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:06,139
signal that and

126
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,260
a protocol that they put in there is

127
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:12,230
called chat States so I send a message

128
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:15,830
it doesn't have a body it just says Bob

129
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:18,950
is composing and additionally you can

130
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:20,750
request receipts to say that Alice

131
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:24,020
actually got this message or Alice's

132
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:25,820
client did so those are a couple of

133
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:29,630
different ways to build protocols and

134
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,590
then additionally you can get an error

135
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,469
response back

136
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,570
but like UDP it's not required so you

137
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:38,000
don't necessarily know whether something

138
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:40,120
made it or not it depends on whether the

139
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,880
endpoint wants to respond with an error

140
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:51,140
so presence is a multi-purpose block

141
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:53,180
which allows you to subscribe to

142
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:56,659
something and allows you to get

143
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:59,740
notifications so it's both asynchronous

144
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:03,470
and it's a published subscribed system

145
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:05,919
so an example of publish subscribe is

146
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:08,900
you fire up a client you know add

147
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:11,630
contact and you're going to send a

148
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:14,120
message with the type subscribe and that

149
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,919
endpoint needs to respond to you it can

150
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,950
tell you unsubscribe it can tell you

151
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:23,419
subscribed but it needs to respond to

152
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:26,780
you in some way but then I changed my

153
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:29,270
presence and I set myself to a way so I

154
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:33,739
just send a message and I don't expect

155
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:35,330
the response back and more in a more

156
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,919
complex manner if we start talking

157
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,229
multi-user chat

158
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:44,150
we've just extended the presence model

159
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:47,419
because this bottom one is saying Bob

160
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:50,359
wants to join a channel named XMPP chat

161
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:56,599
and he wants everyone to know him as the

162
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:58,550
name Bob Ryan so the other problem that

163
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:01,130
you can play with is that presence

164
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:04,160
relationships are long-lived

165
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:05,450
and they're unidirectional which is

166
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,220
interesting one of the problems with

167
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:09,440
actually talking to another client is

168
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,150
that for most of the questions you want

169
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,130
to ask you need to have an established

170
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,510
presence relationship but then you show

171
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:16,250
up in somebody's contact list and they

172
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,599
know about you

173
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:22,380
that that doesn't have to be the case

174
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:26,970
because you can be accepted on their

175
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:28,620
side and they can not send you a request

176
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:32,399
for presents as well so you don't show

177
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:35,520
up in their contact list so just to sort

178
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,440
of show the the slightly confusing state

179
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,478
you start out in a state of none neither

180
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,719
side is actually subscribing to each

181
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,940
other and maybe Bob sends a subscribe so

182
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,850
Alice's server now marks this down and

183
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,950
it says there's a pending respond or a

184
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:52,709
pending subscribe from Bob

185
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:55,110
so pending in Alice needs to do

186
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:56,489
something so the server is going to send

187
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,680
her a message do you want to accept this

188
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:01,140
or do you want to reject it and if you

189
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,149
accept you only end up in a state of

190
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,279
thumb so both servers record that Bob

191
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:07,320
has subscribed to Alice so Bob can now

192
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,029
talk to Alice's client as much as he

193
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,190
wants the server will let that through

194
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:16,850
without ever actually letting Alice

195
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:21,420
subscribe back to him so the last one is

196
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:23,040
IQ and IQ is kind of the main building

197
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,800
block it's request/response it's like

198
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,020
HTTP it's like Internet message you

199
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,510
always have to get either an error or a

200
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:35,189
real response back to any request you

201
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:38,040
send and so you build this up as a get

202
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:41,279
or a set on an XML namespace and you get

203
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:43,410
back either a results or an error you

204
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,800
always have to have an element that

205
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:50,130
defines what you're asking and you can

206
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,529
address anything so I can address a user

207
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:55,470
but a user may also have a bunch of end

208
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:58,100
points and I can address each end point

209
00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:01,500
individually I can address the server

210
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:03,360
some workflows like multi user chat are

211
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,550
built up as a component something that

212
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,890
attaches to the messaging backbone and I

213
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,870
can address components and I can address

214
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:12,689
channels and pretty much anything that

215
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:16,050
has a name which has to be everything in

216
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:19,140
XMPP I can ask questions of and I might

217
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:23,609
get responses back so

218
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:26,100
the the basic syntax is that I have an

219
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:27,600
IQ it's of a type get and I have to put

220
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,750
something in there so maybe I'm querying

221
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,300
a roster a roster is the list of people

222
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:36,180
who are on my contact list that I care

223
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:38,849
about or maybe I'm asking for some

224
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:48,109
information about an entity which would

225
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:50,610
be a disco info so xmpp is a big

226
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:57,450
transport for building more protocols

227
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:59,130
and it started in 99 with just a project

228
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:02,490
that some guy was working on and they

229
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:04,140
quickly founded jabber Inc and started

230
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:09,240
competing in the instant messaging space

231
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:11,670
and so over time we've kind of gotten a

232
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,890
big set of baggage in the protocol so if

233
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:16,530
you start looking at this there was the

234
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:18,780
pre RFC time where for a while there

235
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:20,280
just was no real documentation for it

236
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,780
they started documenting it somebody

237
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,800
said you should bring this to the IETF

238
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:29,790
and then we got 39 20 and 39 21 out and

239
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:33,150
so you have this history of pre version

240
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:36,510
1 and then the version 1 protocol which

241
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:39,329
is 39 20 and 39 21 and so if you read

242
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:40,830
through the RFC's they're very ambiguous

243
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:43,440
about how you have to handle stuff

244
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:46,440
because you need to be able to handle

245
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,320
all of the mistakes that they made

246
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,000
before they started doing the RFC and at

247
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,530
some point they came up and they said ok

248
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,670
we need to standardize a bit more and

249
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:59,280
they came out with 60 120 and 60 121 but

250
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:00,930
they left the version at 1 and they've

251
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,199
put some stricture around some of the

252
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:06,089
processing of your xml elements except

253
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,730
that you still have to be backward

254
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:11,220
compatible with 39 20 and 39 21 at the

255
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:13,590
same time there are also a bunch of

256
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,090
support RFC's that change like how to

257
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:19,360
deal with internationalized characters

258
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:21,549
and how to deal with naming

259
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,470
and then additionally there's this thing

260
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:26,369
called the zet system which is the

261
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:29,889
jabber extension protocols and there's

262
00:12:26,369 --> 00:12:32,889
314 of them published today and they're

263
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:36,069
RFC like and they're maintained by the

264
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:38,769
jabber foundation XMPP org and those are

265
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:43,988
the places that specify things like how

266
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:47,019
do I ask a name for information so the

267
00:12:43,989 --> 00:12:49,329
last piece is the government is also

268
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:51,730
stepping in they've decided XMPP is

269
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:56,019
really interesting and so they have a

270
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:59,410
big document called UCR 2008 which has a

271
00:12:56,019 --> 00:13:01,779
section which unified communications

272
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:03,999
requirements it has a section on X and B

273
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:06,369
P so they have competing requirements

274
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:08,499
with the RFC s and competing

275
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:09,999
requirements with the old RFC's and then

276
00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:13,769
on top of that you have a bunch of

277
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:18,759
implementations so over all XMPP is a

278
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:23,649
bit of a mess which is kind of fun so

279
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:26,110
why are we talking about XMPP I asked

280
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:30,149
you guys whether you use I am in the

281
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:32,529
workplace and what I generally see is

282
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:35,079
people still think I am as kind of a

283
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:37,419
social pulley you use it for setting up

284
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:38,979
an after work beer or maybe just

285
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:41,410
catching up on the weekend or something

286
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:47,319
but you don't use it much for business

287
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:49,299
and back in the early 2000s when I was

288
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:54,040
doing security architecture for an IM

289
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:55,779
system I wanted authentication and what

290
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,790
we were told was this is the most

291
00:13:55,779 --> 00:14:01,360
important thing an IM system can have

292
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:06,579
and so all of our features got cut for

293
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:10,079
the smiley so in general what's the

294
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:10,079
attack surface of instant messaging

295
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,690
anyone have other ideas beyond these

296
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:24,069
like is there stuff that you deal with

297
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:27,589
on a regular basis I'm just curious

298
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:29,270
so it seems like people are still

299
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:31,040
talking about the same thing it's like

300
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:34,699
password policy people are still talking

301
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,449
about password policy for I am it's

302
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,940
fishing

303
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:39,589
spin spam it's the same thing it's

304
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,899
trying to get people to do things that

305
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:45,230
you want them to installing malware

306
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:47,209
there's still regulatory compliance most

307
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:49,959
people when I talk about I am roll their

308
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:54,020
eyes they're like compliance and

309
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:57,079
compliance was a problem in 2002-2003

310
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:59,720
and most of these were that the vendors

311
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:04,370
caught up and everybody thinks we're

312
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:08,180
okay now because we have tools except I

313
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:12,920
am has grown up and so instant messaging

314
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:16,310
is a neat afterthought in linked-in same

315
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:19,880
time but the you see market is much

316
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:21,589
bigger than that and right now we're at

317
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,770
about a four a four billion dollar

318
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:26,570
market cap and the PBX replacement cycle

319
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:29,240
which is what people are going for is

320
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:31,490
about three to seven years so everyone

321
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,610
is now competing in replacing corporate

322
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:39,170
phone systems and your phone looks like

323
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:42,050
this it is an IM client it's also a

324
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:44,089
video chat client it does audio it does

325
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:47,209
video it does application sharing it

326
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:49,100
shares your desktops and it's incredibly

327
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:51,010
powerful but it's also always running

328
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:55,990
now and it's running on your phones

329
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:57,069
which is pretty exciting so

330
00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:00,820
[Music]

331
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:04,690
I got involved in this back in 99 we

332
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:08,220
started a project to do a group chat

333
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:11,860
system for financial services and the

334
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:15,100
idea was a federated banking Network

335
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:16,930
where every person could come together

336
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,520
in the investment banking world and they

337
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:22,420
could do their trades phones were

338
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:25,210
annoying and phones were recorded the

339
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:27,099
squawk boxes that you had down on desks

340
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:30,490
on the trading floor that broadcast news

341
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:32,230
were antiquated and you had to sit there

342
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,060
and listen to them so you can start

343
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:35,860
putting out all of your trade ideas and

344
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:38,709
actually conduct your business over

345
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:42,460
instant messaging but the problem was

346
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:45,610
that bankers were doing business over

347
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:47,020
AOL and Yahoo I am because the people

348
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:49,780
that they actually wanted to do business

349
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:51,160
work with were there so this is a

350
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:53,740
screenshot of something called i''m

351
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,230
trader which was built to do trade

352
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:59,500
business over a AOL instant messaging

353
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:03,329
the other screen is mid-2000s

354
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:05,410
and that was Reuters play to create this

355
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:06,760
federated system that was going to bring

356
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:08,020
all of the bankers onto the Reuters

357
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,260
platform and get them away from

358
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:16,540
Bloomberg and still traders were doing

359
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:18,939
business over AOL so the private sector

360
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:20,589
has failed and we never managed to drive

361
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:22,689
instant messaging to a single protocol

362
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:25,780
we got really close we got to the point

363
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:29,170
of sip and XMPP and the big vendors

364
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:31,780
Cisco IBM Microsoft we're all running on

365
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:33,880
sip except that this little guy jabber

366
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,710
came along and they were selling into

367
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,410
the government the United States

368
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:40,960
government and so you could never

369
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:42,790
actually get rid of XMPP because the US

370
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:48,640
Department of Defense is a big market

371
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:52,030
and finally the DoD has spoken and so

372
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:54,400
from this point actually last year XMPP

373
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:57,129
is the new pool and everybody's moving

374
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,230
to it so cisco bought jabber and you can

375
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:02,050
now talk XMPP into their phone systems

376
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:05,050
you can talk XMPP into Microsoft's phone

377
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:07,770
systems pretty soon and same time has

378
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:10,110
worked over XMPP for a long time

379
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:12,990
with bridging technology into sip and

380
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:15,959
the other fun thing is the DoD has said

381
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:17,580
you must fetter eight so you have to

382
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,410
have a way for your system to sit out on

383
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:22,230
the internet so that when I pick up my

384
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:24,150
phone and call somebody at a contractor

385
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:28,590
it actually rings through and I can talk

386
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:31,890
to them and this is the specification if

387
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:35,129
you ever really have a need to read it

388
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:39,950
but this is the big document you see our

389
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:39,950
2008 change to section five seven

390
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:45,190
[Music]

391
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:53,780
No federated identity so the DoD or

392
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:56,928
large companies at this point are saying

393
00:18:53,780 --> 00:19:00,830
that your identity on the chat network

394
00:18:56,929 --> 00:19:04,760
is business valuable and so they don't

395
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:07,639
want some traitor doing business as by

396
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:10,910
clubber 73 they definitely don't want

397
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,980
someone in the military talking over ale

398
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:14,870
and instant messaging and doing business

399
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:17,540
deals they want you at your dot mil

400
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:19,668
account and so when you're doing I am

401
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:21,559
you are your dot mil account when you're

402
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:23,890
talking on your phone your your dot mil

403
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:23,889
account

404
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,769
[Music]

405
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:37,309
in theory you could set it up that way

406
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:41,629
yeah so the the main vendors that I'm

407
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:43,428
aware of the idea is you're logged into

408
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:45,470
your machine through your corporate

409
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:48,529
identity whatever is in your corporate

410
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:53,659
LDAP and so that is the identity you

411
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:55,730
want to be I don't know of any in a few

412
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:57,110
products that I've or any features in a

413
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:59,149
few products that I've looked at that

414
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:00,709
really make it easy to have multiple

415
00:19:59,149 --> 00:20:04,658
identities

416
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:04,659
I'm sure you could pull that off though

417
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:12,289
but in general they don't want there the

418
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:14,450
goal is your infrastructure is here you

419
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:17,179
have a box on your edge and your box on

420
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:19,179
your edge talks to the wide Internet to

421
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:22,070
another box for some other corporation

422
00:20:19,179 --> 00:20:25,850
or military branch or whatever we're

423
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:28,490
talking about and so those two boxes do

424
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:31,759
all of the negotiation of whatever

425
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:33,440
protocol streams are flowing and it's

426
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:40,159
just like you're calling your friends

427
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:41,910
sitting at the next desk so the question

428
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:45,840
is

429
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:49,080
we now have a company that has purchased

430
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,240
a large unified communication system and

431
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:54,629
they've set up an edge box that listens

432
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:56,940
on the public internet and they have a

433
00:20:54,630 --> 00:21:00,030
bunch of users on there I am clients

434
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:03,150
that are always running and so I can

435
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:04,950
start sending messages through the front

436
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:06,660
door and I could try and get to one of

437
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:08,790
your IM clients but you're gonna see

438
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,260
pop-ups and people are gonna watch

439
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:13,430
network traffic flowing and they're

440
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:18,540
probably going to know that I'm there so

441
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:20,010
the question is can we do things where

442
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:24,750
you don't know

443
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:28,200
and with XMPP with that opening port the

444
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:32,010
first thing that you do is you open your

445
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:36,240
document so the stream is the XMPP

446
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:39,570
transport and it's the top level element

447
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:42,540
of an XML document it provides flow

448
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:45,240
control so you can send stanzas if I

449
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:47,760
initiate to you then I can send you

450
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:50,310
stanzas and you can send me errors but

451
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:53,879
you can't send me stanzas back you have

452
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:57,210
to open up your own stream to me there

453
00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:01,110
is changes for that but right now it's

454
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:04,380
still unidirectional and so students are

455
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:08,399
also in securely introduced and so I

456
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:12,230
open up an open TCP connection and then

457
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,230
I negotiate TLS if you support it

458
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:17,470
so there's two different sets of rules

459
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,030
there's client to server and server to

460
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,950
server so when I say things are

461
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:22,899
unidirectional that server because

462
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:29,050
client only opens up a single connection

463
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:32,110
and traffic flows both ways so over the

464
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:34,570
decade of rule changes you can get no

465
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:36,760
version or you can get version 9 or 0.9

466
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:38,590
and you may have to deal with that

467
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:41,140
depending on who you are which means

468
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:44,110
that any of the structure and structure

469
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:46,360
around what naming you actually use in a

470
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:47,679
stream is thrown out because they didn't

471
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,889
think you actually had to name the thing

472
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:54,670
at first so if you're going to support

473
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:56,170
it then you're kind of lost in the woods

474
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:58,480
and there are commercial products that

475
00:22:56,170 --> 00:23:01,570
still do so the opening document kind of

476
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:04,810
looks like that so it's from Google it's

477
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:07,659
to Yahoo it's version 1 we know what it

478
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:09,490
is because it's got an XML namespace and

479
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:11,560
we know that it's jabber server because

480
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:13,720
it has an XML namespace that tells us

481
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:16,389
whether it's server or client so if

482
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:19,690
we're point nine or before none of that

483
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:21,670
stuff is actually there you have the two

484
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:24,160
but you don't have any of the other

485
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:28,660
stuff that is absolutely required and

486
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:32,320
then the server responds so the server

487
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:33,910
response is kind of like TLS if you're

488
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,909
familiar with the way that works the

489
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:39,100
client says hi I'm here the server says

490
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:41,380
here's all the list of stuff that I want

491
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:44,379
or that I think you can do and you need

492
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:47,320
to pick what you're interested in which

493
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:49,750
has some of the same problems of TLS

494
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:52,360
where a client can downgrade if there's

495
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:54,910
something there that's really weak so if

496
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:58,510
you look at this in theory the client

497
00:23:54,910 --> 00:24:01,420
can pick any one of these to do next if

498
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:03,730
it's offered so we have the idea that we

499
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:05,860
could start TLS we could start

500
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:10,120
compression if we wanted to we could

501
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:13,449
negotiate bi-directional flow of data we

502
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:16,449
could authenticate each other or we

503
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:19,180
could use a very weak form of non

504
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:21,490
authentication to use DNS to call back

505
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:22,520
and see if you're who you we think you

506
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:23,930
are

507
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,879
if I offered all of these at the same

508
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:27,530
time exactly like this

509
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,600
I could actually choose none of them and

510
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:32,110
keep going because none of them are

511
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:37,189
required and they are all mutually

512
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:42,199
possible or not necessary so what should

513
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:43,340
happen is the client should restart the

514
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,580
stream every time a feature is

515
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:48,620
negotiated and the first thing you do is

516
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:51,590
you start TLS because you have to have

517
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:54,169
that for authentication and TLS should

518
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:57,320
actually be required so the client

519
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:58,820
negotiates TLS and then after TLS is

520
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,710
established they send a new stream

521
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:02,960
element and we start all over again

522
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:04,670
and the next set of features doesn't

523
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,460
include TLS it's already been negotiated

524
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:12,980
but it includes mechanisms because you

525
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:14,720
have to authenticate so if you offer it

526
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:16,070
all the client can choose whatever they

527
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,750
want but if you do it in a methodical

528
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:20,270
manner the client is supposed to choose

529
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:23,150
exactly what you need and so this is

530
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:25,100
kind of what it looks like and I put

531
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:28,160
that up there not so that you can read

532
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:31,429
it all but to show you that it gets a

533
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:33,770
little crazy and this is interesting

534
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:35,690
because sure there's this chunk for TLS

535
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:37,460
there's this chunk for sazzle there's

536
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:40,430
this chunk for doing dial back if you

537
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:41,990
want to do it but the girls to get to

538
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:43,420
open stands exchange and the server

539
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:46,610
should never let you go through that

540
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:49,960
without doing what it expects and then

541
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:52,760
we get to Google because there's a neat

542
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:54,320
little proof-of-concept out there that

543
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,000
you can play with the guy's got a video

544
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,040
that you can watch and so this is kind

545
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,510
of a cut from the video so you look at

546
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:02,000
the stream negotiation between your

547
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:04,010
jabber gtalk client or your Google gtalk

548
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,660
client the proxy that's in the middle

549
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:12,500
and Google Google so the client opens up

550
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:16,940
the server says hey welcome from Gmail

551
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:20,390
and it's jabber client and hey stream

552
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:25,130
features I require you to start TLS

553
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:27,230
start TLS is required and you shouldn't

554
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:28,820
actually have the mechanisms in there

555
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:31,130
right now but if you look at the sazzle

556
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:33,210
you can do Google token or you can do

557
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:35,339
Google OAuth

558
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:38,339
those are your only choices and so the

559
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:43,320
client starts TLS and the server says

560
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:46,080
proceed except so if you look at that

561
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:48,029
you should not be able to establish an

562
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:53,279
insecure Channel and an unauthenticated

563
00:26:48,029 --> 00:26:55,789
channel with Google and the little

564
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:59,969
exploit that this guy wrote this proxy

565
00:26:55,789 --> 00:27:02,190
opens up a clear text connection with a

566
00:26:59,969 --> 00:27:05,039
plaintext password off which are not

567
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:08,580
offered but the server accepts it so in

568
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:10,080
the end he can man in the middle gtalk

569
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:16,139
even though Google says you're not

570
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:19,739
allowed to do this so why cheat if

571
00:27:16,139 --> 00:27:23,428
they're just gonna let you in so for any

572
00:27:19,739 --> 00:27:25,559
server that advertises XMPP Federation

573
00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:27,469
they have a serve record out there that

574
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:30,029
points you at the right place to go

575
00:27:27,469 --> 00:27:33,059
hopefully you have to get through TLS

576
00:27:30,029 --> 00:27:34,830
but how hard is it to get a certificate

577
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:36,269
for whatever domain you want if it's

578
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:38,339
open Federation it really doesn't matter

579
00:27:36,269 --> 00:27:39,839
who you are it just matters that your

580
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:43,639
certificate matches the domain that

581
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:47,219
you're claiming to be and most companies

582
00:27:43,639 --> 00:27:49,559
have a policy since you guys aren't our

583
00:27:47,219 --> 00:27:52,379
users of big federated systems at this

584
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:54,479
point it's hard to ask but I've been

585
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:55,889
through a bunch of companies where the

586
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:59,190
security policy is we will absolutely

587
00:27:55,889 --> 00:28:01,498
not federate with anybody but we will

588
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:03,179
iterate with Google will better a twith

589
00:28:01,499 --> 00:28:05,190
Google will federate with live will

590
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:06,570
Fedder a twith Yahoo because people

591
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:08,009
really want to be able to talk to their

592
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:12,599
spouses and their kids and their friends

593
00:28:08,009 --> 00:28:16,440
and so big bank no no you can't fetter

594
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:18,479
it with them but Gmail is fine and so

595
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:23,120
with a certificate that matches my

596
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:25,559
domain I can get into XMPP

597
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:29,159
so I'm going to turn it over to Rachel

598
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:31,430
to talk a bit about the questions that

599
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:35,960
you can ask

600
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:35,960
[Music]

601
00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:52,380
Oh oh good okay at least I think yep

602
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:57,480
okay that works

603
00:28:52,380 --> 00:29:01,380
there you okay I've kind of a big list

604
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:03,540
of features on here but uh okay so Jason

605
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:06,420
earlier mentioned that there were 314

606
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:08,010
different standards if you look on the

607
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:11,160
Jabbar website on their standards

608
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:12,840
website that's a lot there's an each of

609
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:15,120
those represents a different feature and

610
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,580
so when you have this user the Jason is

611
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:20,879
talking about who is connecting from

612
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:22,919
Gmail to your corporate network as an

613
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,840
attacker if I'm connecting from Gmail

614
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:26,820
what I'm interested in is what

615
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,260
functionality is exposed on your server

616
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:31,950
that's what's really interesting to me

617
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:34,110
and 314 different Zepps that's 314

618
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:35,820
different like unique things that are

619
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:37,260
piggybacked on top of jabber so when we

620
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:39,659
say it's extensible we mean it's really

621
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:41,370
extensible it's a transport on top of

622
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:43,770
which people can build applications so

623
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:45,449
there's like video voice they can search

624
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:47,070
your directory like there's all kinds of

625
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,780
different extensions that you can add

626
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:49,919
each of which has like it and

627
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,990
Philosopher's have very rich

628
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,670
functionality and so when we were

629
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:56,040
starting to look at jabber from a

630
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:57,630
security perspective that stuff is all

631
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,800
very interesting to us and it's

632
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,000
definitely very interesting to an

633
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,830
attacker they can look at your server

634
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,030
and they can go through and sort of

635
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:07,830
cherry-pick which steps they're

636
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:10,620
interested in but to actually but it's

637
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:12,929
hard to get to get your hands on the

638
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:14,189
actual and the actual servers to test

639
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:15,870
them and see which ones are supportive

640
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:17,310
age because the the large deployment

641
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:19,560
ones that are used in the DoD are very

642
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:21,659
expensive and we do not have a hundred

643
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:24,480
thousand dollars to test each individual

644
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:27,660
server so what we did was we went and we

645
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,040
looked at the different pieces of jabber

646
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:31,050
that are actually required to be

647
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,520
compliant that's what these are so if

648
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:34,230
you're going to be a compliant jabber

649
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:36,300
server or you're going to be a compliant

650
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:39,720
jabber client you are going to speak

651
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:40,830
this list of this list of features and

652
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,940
so we're just going to go through those

653
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:43,439
bit by bit and so we were kind of

654
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:46,260
looking at these and seeing what kind of

655
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:50,460
attack service they explore

656
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:52,500
so if you're a jabber component that

657
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:54,240
means you are another your privileged

658
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:58,110
component on the network that would have

659
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,370
been really nice in practice you have to

660
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:01,439
have a password and you have to know the

661
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:03,389
namespace for it so that would be kind

662
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,910
of hard to get that would have a nice

663
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:10,140
but doesn't but we can't get it so we

664
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:11,790
rejected it entity and capabilities so

665
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:15,240
this is like when you mentioned earlier

666
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:16,950
when you're opening up you want to know

667
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,270
when somebody's coming online so one of

668
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:20,250
your friends just came on mind you want

669
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:21,690
to know that that's called presence and

670
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:23,520
so you're subscribed to their presence

671
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:26,250
so when I'm so I let's say I subscribe

672
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,139
to your presence I subscribe to your

673
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,549
presence and you say do you want and

674
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:31,200
it'll say do you want Rachel to be able

675
00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:33,480
to subscribe and you'll say yes sure

676
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,580
rachel is a great person and so that's

677
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,200
kind of how that works every time after

678
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,799
that silently you'll be able to see my

679
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,880
presence

680
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:43,650
I guess I'll set it over to the network

681
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:46,140
to you and if I want to know what

682
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:47,580
features your client exposes the clients

683
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:49,559
all support different features to let's

684
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:50,850
say your client like lets you do voice

685
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:52,620
streaming or video streaming or

686
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:54,780
something like that so that's what that

687
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:56,879
is I can see okay their client does do a

688
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,020
voice chat and so I can click on the

689
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,530
button that does voice chat every jabber

690
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:03,090
and you can actually explore that when

691
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:04,260
you get there present certification

692
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:06,809
their presence notification will tell

693
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:09,809
you what features their client exposes

694
00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:11,280
but unfortunately it'll pop up and

695
00:32:09,809 --> 00:32:13,379
accept denied dialog and most of the

696
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,580
clients that you can use so you would

697
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:17,130
know that I was trying to figure out

698
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:21,149
what what you do which is unfortunate

699
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:25,410
for us personal venting protocol this is

700
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:28,260
also most of standards so the personal

701
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:30,840
venting protocol it also comes broadcast

702
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:32,640
in presence tandas this is like if you

703
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:35,879
have an IM client and it says so-and-so

704
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,860
is in a good mood and they and they are

705
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:40,620
doing such and such and and they're

706
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:41,820
listening to this music so you know the

707
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,049
worst he could find out there is they

708
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,320
listen to Coldplay or something like

709
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:45,570
that

710
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,340
it also will broadcast their GPS

711
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:49,280
location so maybe if they're on a phone

712
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:51,230
and they're talking on their phone

713
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,399
it'll broadcast their GPS location which

714
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:54,230
would be great that would be fantastic

715
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,990
then you could like spy on people and do

716
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:58,730
all kinds of creepy stuff but it also

717
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:03,320
required and I said tonight dialogue so

718
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:05,480
this not as useful for an attacker chat

719
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,700
state notifications I could find out

720
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,600
should there split your typing while

721
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:13,159
you're at a computer you're probably

722
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:14,600
typing so what is interesting that was

723
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:17,390
on that list there a couple of things

724
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:19,549
that service discovery multi-user chat

725
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:22,370
convey cards and so we'll go into those

726
00:33:19,549 --> 00:33:25,970
a little bit more depth service

727
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:27,770
discovery so as I said like this is very

728
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:29,780
extensible so if I'm talking to another

729
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:31,280
jabber component like a client or a

730
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:32,928
server or another component on the

731
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:35,059
network I need to know what it supports

732
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:37,400
and you can do discovery to see what it

733
00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:40,639
supports each of the features is named

734
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:43,880
and so when I connect to in this case I

735
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:46,340
believe it's the server I can see what

736
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:49,039
features it supports supports paying

737
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:51,980
private messaging off search a couple of

738
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:54,289
their things I can see what the server

739
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:56,780
supports that's useful that's how I can

740
00:33:54,289 --> 00:34:00,350
find out if it doesn't have any rich

741
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:03,200
features that I'm looking for here I can

742
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:06,049
see down here this is kind of cool it

743
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,780
says it supports amok which is

744
00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:11,570
multi-user chat and that's chat channels

745
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:15,889
and so in any systems that's where a lot

746
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:17,510
of the real juicy information is if yeah

747
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:20,179
I'll get to admin I'll go into more

748
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:23,690
depth there here in our example we have

749
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:25,399
the watercooler channel which has the

750
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:27,260
name of the which has the title of the

751
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:29,239
channel maybe the topic conversation or

752
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:30,800
something like that there's a closed

753
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:31,819
Channel for paranoid people who don't

754
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,500
want people to know what they're talking

755
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:35,690
about and an open channel where you can

756
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:38,330
talk about anything so I can actually

757
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:38,600
get that just by looking at the chat

758
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:40,299
server

759
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,290
[Music]

760
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,880
over here I can see that the clothes

761
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:46,940
channel is very paranoid it requires a

762
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:49,820
password and as members-only and I'll

763
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:51,830
end it I doesn't look terribly friendly

764
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:53,630
and so I really that's kind of

765
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:57,560
interesting to me that they have very

766
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:58,790
productive channels and if I can

767
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:02,180
actually join it you know man if I can

768
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:03,590
actually join the channel if I ask the

769
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,850
channel for a list of items I can get

770
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:06,920
the list of users on the channel that's

771
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:08,330
interesting so if your company has a

772
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,940
channel that's talking about a product

773
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:12,890
then I'm somebody that's federating with

774
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:14,420
you like either from from Gmail do you

775
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:16,400
want somebody from Gmail to be able to

776
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:18,020
know that like you have this new product

777
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,760
they're talking about it on the channel

778
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,200
and all the users who are who are on

779
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,150
that channel it's gonna have their names

780
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,200
on the channel now I know that all now

781
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,550
at the know the names of all the people

782
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,710
that are working on that product that's

783
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:29,810
pretty awesome for me I can like if I'm

784
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:31,700
if I'm a competitor I can be like hey

785
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:33,020
that person works in that product we

786
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,160
don't have anybody that has expertise on

787
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:36,040
that why don't I call him up and hire

788
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,270
them and give them lots of money

789
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:40,310
the names are nicknames on the channel

790
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:41,690
but and you can actually change them but

791
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:44,870
a lot of them by default will give you

792
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:46,530
the the person's the person's actual

793
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:48,930
username

794
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:52,320
[Music]

795
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:55,980
let's see yeah the gun it has a list of

796
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,840
user names group chat is about community

797
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,740
yeah so this is kind of the this is kind

798
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,540
of the thing that were most interested

799
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:03,180
in like a lot of security talks end up

800
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:05,310
being here is some fancy here's some

801
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:09,000
fancy crypto attack or here's some fancy

802
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:10,410
memory corruption attack but with the

803
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,670
really interesting stuff on any of these

804
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:13,560
systems that you're trying to get at is

805
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,850
the information that's on them if you

806
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,080
can get it if I can get access at your

807
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:17,400
seat I've met your information that's

808
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,410
the most interesting part or if I can

809
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,210
change it or something like that and you

810
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,500
can get an absolute ton of information

811
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:24,840
about the channels these people have

812
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,940
like through the federated connection so

813
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:29,160
if I'm that gmail user talking to I'm

814
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:30,690
talking to your company do I mean you

815
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,460
want the person to be able to talk to

816
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:35,310
their like wife whatever but you don't

817
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:37,800
want but it's not necessarily quite a

818
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:39,150
trusted connection and but all of a

819
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:42,330
sudden they can see all kinds of neat

820
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:44,160
things about your company like um people

821
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:45,870
like meaning as it says here people like

822
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,700
meaningful names so let's say that it

823
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,020
was like Apple I'm sure there would be a

824
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,970
ton of journalists would like to see

825
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:54,570
what their next phone is gonna be call

826
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:56,040
them here they're using oh yes using

827
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:57,270
bermuda swaptions a little bit big

828
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,830
bankers but yeah if you're a bank

829
00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:00,780
there's probably all kinds of things

830
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:03,170
going on within your company that you're

831
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:06,080
going to be products working on and

832
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:08,070
banks will Fedder it with each other

833
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,390
they'll have some parts they need to

834
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:10,680
talk to each other and you really don't

835
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:13,620
want your competitors knowing your from

836
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,690
your doing is the room private is it

837
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:17,009
like who's a who's on the channel it's

838
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:18,750
everybody on the channel a director

839
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:22,020
that's pretty neat i want to see what's

840
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:23,640
on that channel and and some level you

841
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:25,200
can say well you should just lock all

842
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,150
those channels down but that's kind of

843
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,490
not what it's about which you if you

844
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:31,380
work in a most people work in like sort

845
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:32,819
of limited individual groups and you

846
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,380
talk to the same kind of people every

847
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,580
day use the fact to maybe sit in like

848
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,900
five to ten different people in your

849
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:38,430
group and you don't know everything

850
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,170
that's going on is your company and the

851
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:41,310
point of the group chat is to get people

852
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:43,350
talking to show they're discovering

853
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:44,049
information like if I'm in Group A and

854
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:45,219
somebody

855
00:37:44,049 --> 00:37:46,449
Group B is doing something really

856
00:37:45,219 --> 00:37:48,069
interesting that I'd like to know about

857
00:37:46,449 --> 00:37:49,809
and like to my product be able to work

858
00:37:48,069 --> 00:37:51,819
with you want those people talking to

859
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:53,339
each other discovering the channels that

860
00:37:51,819 --> 00:37:55,719
they're talking about their products on

861
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:56,890
engaging with those people so it kind of

862
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:58,509
has to be about free flow of information

863
00:37:56,890 --> 00:38:00,160
you kind of can't if you locked it down

864
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:02,229
it would kind of destroy the purpose of

865
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,089
having the of having a social systems

866
00:38:02,229 --> 00:38:05,979
with your company begin with so you

867
00:38:04,089 --> 00:38:11,009
could lock it down but it's probably not

868
00:38:05,979 --> 00:38:14,259
something you're going to do okay and

869
00:38:11,009 --> 00:38:16,179
we'll get the other mic up here so this

870
00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:18,369
is a picture of the chat system that we

871
00:38:16,179 --> 00:38:19,959
both used to work on and when I say like

872
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:21,429
people are talking about products and

873
00:38:19,959 --> 00:38:23,078
people are talking about equities and

874
00:38:21,429 --> 00:38:24,759
people are talking about like marketing

875
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:26,529
um like marketing strategies and things

876
00:38:24,759 --> 00:38:27,579
like that that's that that's absolutely

877
00:38:26,529 --> 00:38:30,189
what they do and they named them after

878
00:38:27,579 --> 00:38:32,380
them so if you have like super-secret

879
00:38:30,189 --> 00:38:33,578
new product those are definitely the

880
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:35,979
kinds of things people will absolutely

881
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:38,890
name a channel I'm a product after or a

882
00:38:35,979 --> 00:38:42,089
channel after other so has anybody

883
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:42,089
that's this week

884
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:56,440
so there's anyone familiar with the IRC

885
00:38:50,070 --> 00:39:00,400
y'all used it so this was based around

886
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:02,650
IRC and this is actually a product

887
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,910
screenshot it's not live data because

888
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:07,270
let me tell you the live data was

889
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:09,129
actually a lot more interesting right so

890
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:13,180
when we talk about this it's really

891
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:15,340
esoteric but I just saw a movie the

892
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:17,799
other night about or that was trying to

893
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:19,420
talk about Lehman back in 2008 when they

894
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:22,030
were trying to dump all of their CD

895
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:24,130
asses without anyone knowing all in one

896
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:27,130
day to try and get out from under the

897
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:28,570
the cloud of what was going to come and

898
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:31,600
so you look at that and you're like man

899
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:33,730
if I had only known about that right at

900
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:37,750
the start of the day where would I be

901
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:41,800
right now and so then on his tradition

902
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:45,070
country maybe but so this was kind of

903
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:46,540
modeled on what is now UBS because the

904
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:48,220
product actually came out of Swiss bank

905
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,120
right about the time that the murder

906
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:52,839
happened with UBS

907
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:54,370
so the EBS is a company that had you

908
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,600
been able to get it their chat channels

909
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:58,089
have you been able to get it the

910
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:00,040
descriptions and topics you would have

911
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:02,740
actually seen a channel probably that

912
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:05,410
was trade idea get the heck out from

913
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:06,850
under the falling rock and I mean with

914
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:08,859
actual data about what they were going

915
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:11,830
to do because UBS was terrible about

916
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:13,180
this and anybody could join because you

917
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:16,240
could plug into the network and it was

918
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:18,250
IRC and so we didn't have an app Knack

919
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,020
back then we didn't have Wi-Fi we didn't

920
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:21,400
care about who got on what network you

921
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:23,350
can just plug it in you could join IRC

922
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:26,080
and you can find out every single trade

923
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:28,810
that was happening in the bank at that

924
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:32,890
point which included all of the illegal

925
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:35,740
stuff so it was a treasure trove another

926
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:37,629
great anecdote is that I have some

927
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:40,169
cousins that fly helicopters or used to

928
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:43,660
fly helicopters for the military and

929
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:46,420
when they were deployed one of them flew

930
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:48,190
search-and-rescue for the Navy off of

931
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:51,700
carriers and the air waves were so

932
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:54,910
precious that they used a o L Instant

933
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:57,189
Messenger to do flight control unless

934
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:58,420
you are on approach because that was the

935
00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:00,460
only time that you could

936
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,900
get radio slotted in to talk to a

937
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:03,220
controller so the controller sat there

938
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:06,040
and chatted all day but then they

939
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:09,250
brought group chat along and so the

940
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:11,619
group chat channels were locked down but

941
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:14,020
all of the names and things carried

942
00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:16,569
tasking orders and movement and all

943
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:19,030
sorts of really interesting data because

944
00:41:16,569 --> 00:41:20,770
it helped people find the right channel

945
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:23,130
when they were on approach to a specific

946
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:27,970
base to figure out who to talk to

947
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:30,099
so it's a little esoteric but it's

948
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:32,379
really quite fun to think about our

949
00:41:30,099 --> 00:41:36,309
company is going to have an open group

950
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:38,319
chat system right now few people have it

951
00:41:36,309 --> 00:41:40,540
deployed on XMPP but it is gaining

952
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:42,040
ground and I do this product was

953
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,700
actually bought by Microsoft in this

954
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,890
part of Lync

955
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,569
so as Microsoft starts to expose more

956
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:48,730
and more things to comply with DoD

957
00:41:46,569 --> 00:41:50,589
requirements which used to require MOC

958
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:51,910
until we complained and said that they

959
00:41:50,589 --> 00:41:55,839
shouldn't be in there

960
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:57,578
they will eventually be back and all of

961
00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:01,750
a sudden this MUC data is going to start

962
00:41:57,579 --> 00:42:04,510
being exposed over XMPP so one

963
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:07,059
correction is the user lists wouldn't

964
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:09,180
really be interesting if I couldn't get

965
00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:11,290
at them without joining the channel

966
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:12,669
there's a lot of interesting stuff you

967
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:14,920
can get once you're a member of a

968
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:17,140
channel because the channels won't allow

969
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:18,670
you to ask a NIC about user details so

970
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:20,890
you can't message a NIC which is a

971
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:22,299
different name than a user name and say

972
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:23,379
tell me about the client that's

973
00:42:22,299 --> 00:42:24,509
connected and all of the information

974
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:27,420
about the user

975
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:30,220
unless you're connected to a channel and

976
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:34,059
connecting to a channel is a bit of an

977
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:35,980
aggressive move may cross some lines and

978
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:39,099
so we haven't really looked at that yet

979
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:41,200
but the user lists are almost always

980
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:43,329
available just with the Disko items to

981
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,799
the channel without actually joining it

982
00:42:43,329 --> 00:42:48,869
so you can just get that list without

983
00:42:44,799 --> 00:42:51,400
doing anything that's questionable so

984
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:54,160
really an interesting thing one of the

985
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,079
one of the items on the very first Disko

986
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,029
info slide was something called search -

987
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:01,720
and luckily this product that we were

988
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:03,190
testing with does not an able directory

989
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,598
integration and user searching by

990
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:06,190
default but it is possible

991
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:08,140
lots of places do so you can actually

992
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:09,309
start asking search hey just tell me

993
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:11,240
everything about the corporate LDAP

994
00:43:09,309 --> 00:43:13,280
because you're connected to it and so

995
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:14,359
I'd like your information but let's say

996
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,640
you can't do that

997
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:19,160
Jabbar is pretty good they said you know

998
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:21,080
what doing user enumeration is bad so

999
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,910
they wrote this thing called zet 191

1000
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:25,610
simple communications blocking which

1001
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:27,500
says anytime somebody asks you something

1002
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:28,640
that could be leaking information you

1003
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,650
should just respond with service

1004
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,390
unavailable don't give differentiated

1005
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:36,700
responses because differentiated

1006
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:40,700
responses leads to user enumeration so

1007
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:43,970
they're trying to block it but let's

1008
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:47,299
start looking at this a bit so this is a

1009
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:49,970
domain jid this is jabber jid as a

1010
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:52,910
jabber identifier it's a name so this

1011
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:55,220
specifies a domain and then when we ask

1012
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:57,950
the domain tell me about the items it

1013
00:43:55,220 --> 00:44:00,379
popped up this chat example.com which is

1014
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:02,299
a component and when we asked about the

1015
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:03,410
component it told us it was muck but it

1016
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:07,010
could tell us that it's just about

1017
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:10,670
anything a bare jid is just the username

1018
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:12,320
at the realm so this is a user the user

1019
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:14,119
is always there whether the user is

1020
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:16,670
connected to the system right now or not

1021
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:18,650
and when the user connects they get a

1022
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:23,180
full jid which includes this resource

1023
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:26,420
identifier and so this is an actual

1024
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:29,750
connected user and we can ask questions

1025
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:32,270
about it we also have a channel name so

1026
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:33,950
this is foreign exchange trading at the

1027
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:36,710
channel server let's say and then we

1028
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:38,600
have a nickname on a channel which is

1029
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:40,640
foreign exchange at chat so this is the

1030
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:42,799
channel there's some guy named Bob and

1031
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,299
the thing that was that Rachel was

1032
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,940
talking about is Bob and Bob are

1033
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:48,500
actually not equivalent because if

1034
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:49,730
they're the same name maybe we can make

1035
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:53,960
use of that but they don't actually

1036
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:56,900
represent the same thing so this could

1037
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:58,670
be Jo and it would go to Bob if Bob

1038
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:01,720
actually joined the channel and said hey

1039
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:01,720
my nickname is Jo

1040
00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:07,410
so if we ask for disco info on a user

1041
00:45:05,219 --> 00:45:09,150
and it bear did we get service

1042
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:12,899
unavailable you shouldn't be telling us

1043
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:15,630
about that if we ask for a full jid with

1044
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:18,180
a bad resource number we still get

1045
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:21,029
service unavailable if we have the

1046
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:24,089
resource ID and we ask for disco info

1047
00:45:21,029 --> 00:45:27,599
then we get a bunch of information back

1048
00:45:24,089 --> 00:45:30,239
about the client so we can actually use

1049
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:32,489
the muck nicknames and just substitute

1050
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:34,319
out the domain to try and get to a bare

1051
00:45:32,489 --> 00:45:35,849
jid we're making a guess but it's an

1052
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:37,319
educated guess and it actually works

1053
00:45:35,849 --> 00:45:40,529
quite often because of the way the

1054
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:42,509
clients work but we also have to get to

1055
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:45,469
this resource ID and if we look at the

1056
00:45:42,509 --> 00:45:48,599
way people do this we have some hope

1057
00:45:45,469 --> 00:45:51,539
spark a popular client uses a fixed

1058
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:54,479
string side plus we don't even need a

1059
00:45:51,539 --> 00:45:57,059
version number pigeon the user has to

1060
00:45:54,479 --> 00:45:58,618
type one in but people are bad at

1061
00:45:57,059 --> 00:46:01,469
choosing names so maybe we could use

1062
00:45:58,619 --> 00:46:05,190
that exoddus another really popular one

1063
00:46:01,469 --> 00:46:07,140
offers you three choices so we might be

1064
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:10,170
able to do that we get down to like

1065
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:12,538
Citroen and they add the host name which

1066
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:14,759
you probably can't guess for that client

1067
00:46:12,539 --> 00:46:16,709
swift does the right thing and they

1068
00:46:14,759 --> 00:46:20,039
generate an actual very nice random

1069
00:46:16,709 --> 00:46:22,799
number Google Talk does the same thing

1070
00:46:20,039 --> 00:46:24,809
they use a fixed version number or fixed

1071
00:46:22,799 --> 00:46:30,329
string with a random value and I wasn't

1072
00:46:24,809 --> 00:46:32,940
able to check i chat but we can't really

1073
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:34,769
guess that and the thing is we get into

1074
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:36,749
this mode where if we don't actually

1075
00:46:34,769 --> 00:46:39,299
know that the name exists then guessing

1076
00:46:36,749 --> 00:46:43,709
a resource ID is kind of pointless we're

1077
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:45,359
never gonna find anything but the cards

1078
00:46:43,709 --> 00:46:49,190
are the last thing that was on that list

1079
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:51,680
and so

1080
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:53,569
they're interesting in themselves we can

1081
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,129
get information that maybe recruiters

1082
00:46:53,569 --> 00:46:57,950
could use we could use it for various

1083
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:59,390
reconnaissance stuff but the interesting

1084
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:01,240
thing about V cards is they contain

1085
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:03,740
interesting stuff about a person and

1086
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:05,779
you're supposed to have that before you

1087
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:08,240
establish a relationship maybe you don't

1088
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:09,799
know that Joe at gtalk is the person you

1089
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,359
want to talk to so you pull their v card

1090
00:47:09,799 --> 00:47:14,349
to find out oh is this the Joe that I'm

1091
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:17,450
thinking of and so the V card

1092
00:47:14,349 --> 00:47:19,520
Zep specifically calls out that hey we

1093
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:21,169
need to worry about this whole user

1094
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:23,630
enumeration thing so be very very

1095
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:25,490
careful with it and what's awesome is

1096
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:28,039
that if you ask for the v card of a user

1097
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:30,828
without a resource ID you find out

1098
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:32,510
whether they're there if you don't or if

1099
00:47:30,829 --> 00:47:34,760
the user doesn't exist you'll get back a

1100
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:39,260
service unavailable but if the user does

1101
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:43,280
exist hey you get the v card so in the

1102
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:45,380
end you can enumerate users pretty

1103
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,730
easily with some educated guessing and

1104
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:49,280
then from there you could start using

1105
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:50,930
the resource ID problem to start

1106
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:56,029
actually getting at clients if you

1107
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:59,058
really wanted to so okay what did we get

1108
00:47:56,029 --> 00:48:00,829
so at first we ruled out poor server

1109
00:47:59,059 --> 00:48:02,119
implementations because that gets a

1110
00:48:00,829 --> 00:48:05,470
little too crazy there isn't a good

1111
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:08,089
standardization and we also limited

1112
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:13,339
ourselves to doing things that are on

1113
00:48:08,089 --> 00:48:18,200
the the white side of legal and so with

1114
00:48:13,339 --> 00:48:21,619
that we were able even with the most

1115
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:24,770
secure test platform what we ended up

1116
00:48:21,619 --> 00:48:27,230
getting is some pretty reasonable

1117
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:29,450
information and then what can we do with

1118
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:31,369
that so now we know about users and now

1119
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:34,368
we can start exploiting bad protocol

1120
00:48:31,369 --> 00:48:37,730
implementation in the jumble of in the

1121
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:40,339
mess that is XMPP right now you think

1122
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:42,020
about HTTP I exploit your server and

1123
00:48:40,339 --> 00:48:45,680
your server is probably sitting in a DMZ

1124
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:48,230
you've architected it really well you

1125
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:50,569
only have one opening back to a sequel

1126
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:53,750
database and you're being very careful

1127
00:48:50,569 --> 00:48:56,050
about sequel injection so I can get into

1128
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:58,900
the DMZ but

1129
00:48:56,050 --> 00:49:01,530
in the DMZ for unified communication

1130
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:04,510
systems is a proxy that sends every

1131
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:07,000
well-formed protocol message into a

1132
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:08,800
specific host on the internal network so

1133
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,080
you can get to servers you can get the

1134
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:13,570
client hosts it'll reflect out to their

1135
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:15,700
their phones because I have XMPP clients

1136
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:18,630
running on my phone and if you don't you

1137
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:22,029
should because it's really useful and

1138
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:24,520
what's even better is that XMPP

1139
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:25,990
initiates conversations it's just like

1140
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,880
sip so sip is the session initiation

1141
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:31,479
protocol that was designed for the mbone

1142
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:33,040
to establish media flows XMPP is now the

1143
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:35,710
same thing with jingle and google voice

1144
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:38,590
google voice is pushing to basically do

1145
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:41,830
session initiation so I can ask your

1146
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:45,340
client your phone whatever to open up a

1147
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:47,770
path for RTP between my endpoint and

1148
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:51,790
your phone get it through the firewall

1149
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:55,210
and to whatever device you have so we

1150
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:56,710
now have a path that goes all the way to

1151
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:59,680
the hosts that you're trying to defend

1152
00:49:56,710 --> 00:50:01,090
and through all of the network

1153
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:04,600
infrastructure that was built up to

1154
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:07,600
defend it and the best thing is it's

1155
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:09,819
complicated and even when you sit there

1156
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:11,589
and say require TLS and you can't

1157
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:14,770
connect without being authenticated

1158
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:16,810
strongly authenticated people still

1159
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:19,090
implemented incorrectly Google

1160
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:20,410
implemented it incorrectly and you can

1161
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:24,010
stick a proxy in the middle and

1162
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:27,069
downgrade so thanks

1163
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:28,810
that's our talk I guess one of the

1164
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:33,850
things that I would be interested in is

1165
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:35,759
if anybody has thoughts on their

1166
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:38,440
companies looking to implement this

1167
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:40,920
looking to do Federation have you guys

1168
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:44,580
even run into this concept before

1169
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:47,170
because I'm trying to get a sense of of

1170
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:50,060
how much this has permeated the world

1171
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:51,620
outside of those of us who work on it

1172
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:54,580
communicate with each other use email

1173
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:54,580
mostly or to use

1174
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:59,529
[Music]

1175
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:04,529
thank you

1176
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:09,920
I think

1177
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:12,769
better is not the right tactic right so

1178
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,690
I don't think that's the question what

1179
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:19,399
people when you start to get to the

1180
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:20,299
point where you're doing when you're

1181
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,759
doing corporate to corporate

1182
00:51:20,299 --> 00:51:23,900
conversation the reason back in like 99

1183
00:51:22,759 --> 00:51:26,150
that we were trying to create this

1184
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:28,069
Clearing House is because everybody was

1185
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:29,839
worried that AOL was unauthenticated and

1186
00:51:28,069 --> 00:51:31,970
so they thought if we can join two

1187
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:33,619
companies together then company a has

1188
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:35,419
authenticated their people and Company B

1189
00:51:33,619 --> 00:51:37,809
has authenticated their people so we at

1190
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:39,920
least know that they're talking as

1191
00:51:37,809 --> 00:51:43,759
authenticated entities which is a lie

1192
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:45,470
even in XMPP now but that was kind of

1193
00:51:43,759 --> 00:51:47,359
the start of it but now you start

1194
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:50,238
getting into this is my phone and I'm

1195
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:53,299
gonna join meetings because a great

1196
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:55,430
feature of these products is all of this

1197
00:51:53,299 --> 00:51:58,279
PowerPoint sharing and stuff that has

1198
00:51:55,430 --> 00:52:00,769
been really cumbersome is incredibly

1199
00:51:58,279 --> 00:52:02,599
simple to set up and so you can do

1200
00:52:00,769 --> 00:52:05,269
online meetings and you can telework

1201
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:09,499
pretty easily and you join with your

1202
00:52:05,269 --> 00:52:11,868
corporate credentials so when you set up

1203
00:52:09,499 --> 00:52:14,180
a company to company meeting you still

1204
00:52:11,869 --> 00:52:17,329
have the same thing I show up as Jason

1205
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:20,890
on their bridge and they see me as that

1206
00:52:17,329 --> 00:52:23,749
and so it's not so much that doing this

1207
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:26,509
or doing the big aggregation clients

1208
00:52:23,749 --> 00:52:29,839
like Trillium and things is bad it's

1209
00:52:26,509 --> 00:52:31,609
just that you have to run that one

1210
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:34,279
client have an account on all of these

1211
00:52:31,609 --> 00:52:36,440
different networks and worry about the

1212
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:37,969
messaging policies and the blocking

1213
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:40,309
policies of every single one of those

1214
00:52:37,969 --> 00:52:42,559
networks and companies don't want to do

1215
00:52:40,309 --> 00:52:43,999
that it takes a lot of management so if

1216
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:46,940
they can go off and they can buy from a

1217
00:52:43,999 --> 00:52:49,819
single vendor this all in one really

1218
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:53,229
great unified communication system then

1219
00:52:49,819 --> 00:52:53,229
they're doing that now

1220
00:52:55,540 --> 00:53:04,490
the DoD is yeah I mean and the DoD is

1221
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:08,200
setting it up so that the DoD is in a

1222
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:10,459
bunch of silos and so they actually have

1223
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:13,549
implementations that just to talk to

1224
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:16,960
each other they need to do Federation

1225
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:20,950
and so they need to cross out of a DMZ

1226
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:24,140
into a public internet which is a DoD

1227
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:26,540
network and then cross into another DMZ

1228
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:27,799
into another silo to be able to talk to

1229
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:30,470
each other so even for their own

1230
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:32,150
functionality they need that and they

1231
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:35,660
want to own their own servers they don't

1232
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:38,859
want people chatting over em yeah so

1233
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:38,859
company actually

1234
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:49,240
I can basically Overmind like client

1235
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:50,859
type of a Cisco address itself the

1236
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:54,720
message they accepted

1237
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:54,720
basically jab

1238
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:58,790
oh that's actually using quite a bit of

1239
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,970
use

1240
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:02,640
[Music]

1241
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:04,649
so do you know if you do like open

1242
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,299
Federation with link where it will talk

1243
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:16,200
to anybody with a cert or is it just

1244
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:18,960
Sisko I believe okay I mean I I don't

1245
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:21,319
know of any problems with that I'm just

1246
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:24,320
curious

1247
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:24,320
so

1248
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:31,799
so my answer general

1249
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:35,070
I like that okay I have really small

1250
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:36,880
company though so they don't have to buy

1251
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:38,650
anything to each other

1252
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,920
before the hell Cassidy never used a

1253
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,920
noose

1254
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:47,380
well Skype is actually going to start

1255
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:50,410
federating with XMPP so they are joining

1256
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:51,790
the open world as well and we weren't

1257
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:53,350
sure whether they were going to join or

1258
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:54,910
not because they have such a different

1259
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:56,980
network in such a different protocol but

1260
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:58,868
yeah they've announced that officially

1261
00:54:56,980 --> 00:55:07,440
they are moving to an XMPP Federation

1262
00:54:58,869 --> 00:55:07,440
model so any other questions

1263
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:23,380
I think the working group so I mean with

1264
00:55:18,819 --> 00:55:26,259
the ietf it's sort of the the jabber

1265
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:29,650
working group the next MPP org is still

1266
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:32,589
the owner and the the people who deal

1267
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:35,109
with XMPP and then they publish to the

1268
00:55:32,589 --> 00:55:37,839
IETF so the working group is pretty much

1269
00:55:35,109 --> 00:55:41,828
the same this same group of people and I

1270
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:44,230
think they are interested in fixing

1271
00:55:41,829 --> 00:55:46,329
these problems one of the difficulties

1272
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:48,640
that I don't I I don't see them

1273
00:55:46,329 --> 00:55:51,970
addressing well is the fact that they

1274
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:54,400
have such a protocol mishmash so the new

1275
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:57,939
protocols the 6000 series protocols are

1276
00:55:54,400 --> 00:56:00,940
very clear about what naming elements

1277
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:02,920
that you have to have and how you would

1278
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:06,430
do bi-directional communication but they

1279
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:08,260
get really really wishy-washy on exactly

1280
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:11,290
how you deal with names and certificates

1281
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:14,230
there's a an extension protocol document

1282
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:16,390
that starts to talk about it but when

1283
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:17,980
people are working on this

1284
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:24,220
bi-directional communication thing

1285
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:26,109
because if you have a set of say 10 edge

1286
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:27,549
servers that are actually load balanced

1287
00:56:26,109 --> 00:56:30,250
in order to handle your traffic and

1288
00:56:27,549 --> 00:56:31,920
you're a big ISP or you're a cloud

1289
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:36,190
vendor or somebody who has an XMPP

1290
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:38,470
implementation then you are going to

1291
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:41,740
need to open up for one company you

1292
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:43,930
could potentially have two TCP sockets

1293
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:45,430
between every one of your edge boxes to

1294
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:46,960
handle the load because you don't know

1295
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:50,379
exactly which one it's going to land on

1296
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:53,589
when they establish it and you you run

1297
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:55,480
into the problem that like if you have a

1298
00:56:53,589 --> 00:56:58,089
client here in a client here in their

1299
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:59,530
edges in the middle client a could send

1300
00:56:58,089 --> 00:57:01,990
a message this way and it'll traverse

1301
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:03,400
one Network path and establish one

1302
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:05,140
stream but then the reverse stream

1303
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,730
because of DNS load balancing or

1304
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:08,799
whatever comes back through a totally

1305
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:10,299
different path you can't associate them

1306
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:11,559
so they're they're looking at because

1307
00:57:10,299 --> 00:57:13,509
they have a lot of names and because

1308
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:15,339
they have this whole connection

1309
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:17,140
management problem during this

1310
00:57:15,339 --> 00:57:18,099
bi-directional communication stuff so I

1311
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:21,578
can negotiate

1312
00:57:18,099 --> 00:57:23,559
yes actually let's talk the same or

1313
00:57:21,579 --> 00:57:25,530
let's talk bidirectionally on this one

1314
00:57:23,559 --> 00:57:27,530
stream and oh by the way let's do

1315
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:31,550
negotiation of new name

1316
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:33,050
so sure we have example two to fabrikam

1317
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:34,700
but now all of a sudden we're adding

1318
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:37,250
Google on this side too so let's just

1319
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:39,410
use the same open pipe and so they have

1320
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:42,440
very very wishy-washy rules around all

1321
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:45,799
of that and the competing

1322
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:48,140
implementations are wrong all of them so

1323
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:51,350
and even like doing vendor testing

1324
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:52,190
between people major vendors the

1325
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:58,040
interoperation

1326
00:57:52,190 --> 00:58:00,110
is very weak so they have a long way to

1327
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:03,080
go I think people are thinking about it

1328
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:05,330
but they're not focusing on sort of

1329
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:06,590
ejecting some of the the chaff that's

1330
00:58:05,330 --> 00:58:07,880
existed they're still trying to work

1331
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:10,280
within the framework and keep

1332
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:12,820
interoperation with old versions of

1333
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,820
their protocol

1334
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:22,349
well I mean that is that is the zet so

1335
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:26,190
there's that process is intended to be

1336
00:58:22,349 --> 00:58:28,650
IETF light and publish into the IETF so

1337
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:31,200
they follow the same process where

1338
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:32,820
things go through experimental and draft

1339
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:35,279
standard and then become standardized

1340
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:38,280
and then you run into the problem that

1341
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:40,109
they version that but they don't put in

1342
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:41,670
a way to tell which version of the

1343
00:58:40,109 --> 00:58:43,410
protocol you're talking on some of them

1344
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:45,720
some of those apps are really well

1345
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:49,440
written and some of them are less well

1346
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:53,970
written and so that's I think they are

1347
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:57,630
working through this but it's it's a

1348
00:58:53,970 --> 00:59:01,250
very large a singer' distributed

1349
00:58:57,630 --> 00:59:01,250
organization so

1350
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:06,659
[Music]

1351
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:19,410
and it's gotten broken by its own it has

1352
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:21,810
but the happy thing there's a there is a

1353
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:26,609
happy thing with the push from the DoD

1354
00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:30,600
it has forced big vendors to start

1355
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:32,550
working together and I suspect that we

1356
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:36,029
will see in the next couple of years

1357
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:40,350
much more push from from Cisco from

1358
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:43,590
Microsoft from Skype from IBM to try and

1359
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:46,440
force this issue and make sure that

1360
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:47,730
people both talk the same protocol so

1361
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:49,980
that they work together and start

1362
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:51,440
throwing out some of the the bad

1363
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:54,600
behaviors that they've had to maintain

1364
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:56,160
so and we shouldn't forget I showed who

1365
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:57,720
didn't know that I was actually testing

1366
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:03,379
with their system but they actually are

1367
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:03,379
a really good commercial XMPP vendor so

1368
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:28,589
Myst is out of it actually

1369
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:32,610
NIST and the DoD are within some

1370
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:36,330
protocol space NIST has domain but DISA

1371
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:39,960
the is the the communications group and

1372
01:00:36,330 --> 01:00:42,299
so this big DoD document and testing

1373
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,710
effort is all being driven by DISA who

1374
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:45,930
was put together to make sure that phone

1375
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:47,430
systems interoperate it which seems kind

1376
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:49,350
of crazy if you think about it but

1377
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:51,390
apparently for decades phone systems

1378
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:53,730
didn't work together when they bought

1379
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:55,650
them and so this is what DISA did for a

1380
01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:59,400
long time and so now they're working on

1381
01:00:55,650 --> 01:01:02,280
XMPP and trying to force vendors to go

1382
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:04,110
through a standardization process and so

1383
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:06,690
I mean some of the stuff that you will

1384
01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:07,950
see come back from so DISA is partly

1385
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:11,520
working off what are called the

1386
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:13,859
compliance suites Zep that screen of X's

1387
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:18,090
and checkmarks and stuff is the 2010

1388
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:21,000
compliance suite which XMPP requires and

1389
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:22,319
then DISA has come in and said on top of

1390
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,119
that we require you to

1391
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:26,788
these other things because we need them

1392
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:29,579
one of those is multi-user chat and so

1393
01:01:26,789 --> 01:01:33,619
that will be coming back in the diese

1394
01:01:29,579 --> 01:01:33,619
process it's just that it was so

1395
01:01:34,099 --> 01:01:39,390
unformed that what they found is that

1396
01:01:36,989 --> 01:01:41,219
most of the vendors showing up our sip

1397
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:43,799
systems that are creating bridges to

1398
01:01:41,219 --> 01:01:47,489
XMPP which is really really fun because

1399
01:01:43,799 --> 01:01:49,619
within presents models you can there's

1400
01:01:47,489 --> 01:01:51,359
some difficulty in mapping sip in XMPP

1401
01:01:49,619 --> 01:01:55,140
presence models which have caused some

1402
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:57,089
really bad implementations and so when

1403
01:01:55,140 --> 01:02:00,808
we talk about getting pop-ups there's a

1404
01:01:57,089 --> 01:02:02,578
future hope that maybe I can piggyback

1405
01:02:00,809 --> 01:02:05,940
on the fact that there's this changeover

1406
01:02:02,579 --> 01:02:11,430
and get in to presence accepting without

1407
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:13,199
actually getting popups but the because

1408
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:15,749
of those bridge systems they jettisoned

1409
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:17,910
muck because it was too confusing to map

1410
01:02:15,749 --> 01:02:20,419
but it will come back probably in the

1411
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:20,420
next year or two

1412
01:02:25,339 --> 01:02:28,058
Thanks
