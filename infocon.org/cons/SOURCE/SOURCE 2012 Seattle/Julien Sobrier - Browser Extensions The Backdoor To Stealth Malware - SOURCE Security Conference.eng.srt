1
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:12,280
okay I'm re going to step right now for

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:15,070
the 15 so I'm going talk about managers

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,869
browser extensions and especially what

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:21,300
kind of collection are in there in both

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:24,789
web browser and now we can bypass them

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:28,029
so just a few words about me my name is

7
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:30,759
Aubrey I work at this killer we mostly

8
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:33,610
focus on the web research web security

9
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:37,060
research you can go to our blog at

10
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:39,879
research desk at calm and we also have a

11
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:44,260
few free tools that shred lab that come

12
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:46,870
including browser extensions so why is

13
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:50,489
this talk I've been walking on both

14
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:53,349
extension for about two years making

15
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:55,199
security extension to protect user but

16
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:58,120
while I was doing this I realized that

17
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:01,300
bother extensions are a lot more

18
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,910
powerful than I expected and what I was

19
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:08,110
making user more secure you can actually

20
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:13,570
do a lot of very bad things with browser

21
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:15,340
extensions so this is what I'm going to

22
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,979
talk about today so first I'll I'll talk

23
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,170
about both extension in general and then

24
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:23,920
I'll go deeper in each of the three

25
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:27,070
major web browser to see especially how

26
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,430
the plug-in architecture works

27
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:32,529
what kind of protection they have and

28
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:37,570
what kind of marriages extension you can

29
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:40,000
do on this three buzzer I probably will

30
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:43,289
not have enough time to talk about home

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,420
that we'll see if time permits

32
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:49,210
so both extension they don't feel like

33
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:51,610
regular software most people I talk

34
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:53,500
about it's like extension for any

35
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:58,719
software if they feel like it's just add

36
00:01:53,500 --> 00:02:00,159
a few features they are not as scary as

37
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,880
install as an installer you don't have

38
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:07,869
any warning it's it just feel like a

39
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:09,788
very simple piece of software that has a

40
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:12,850
very limited role on your computer and

41
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:16,630
it's easy to remove which shouldn't be

42
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:17,459
very harmful and that's like that's

43
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:21,120
actually very

44
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:25,640
and I'm going to explain why so first

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:29,099
what our bottle extensions so in Firefox

46
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:34,529
in Firefox mobile Firefox is a extension

47
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:37,399
are mostly JavaScript files they have an

48
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:40,680
interface called xpcom that allows

49
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:43,170
firefox plugins to to use more advanced

50
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,540
features like zipping and zipping and

51
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,879
accessing the file system in java

52
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:51,450
scripts which through these X become

53
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:52,980
services and in Firefox and extension

54
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:56,569
has access to the entire browser

55
00:02:52,980 --> 00:03:00,030
including the content which each tab

56
00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:01,589
Chrome and also suffer in apply is a

57
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,919
little bit different so we still using

58
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:08,849
javascript for all the for for the

59
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:11,459
extension but the extension is split

60
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:12,988
into two parts one is the background

61
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:15,510
page which I could which has access to

62
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:17,549
the browser but not to the content of

63
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:20,280
the tab and the other part is the

64
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:22,590
injected script that's injected into the

65
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,209
tab and which has access to a tab and

66
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,590
not to the bother

67
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:30,060
and the two can talk to each other

68
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:32,459
extension don't have I don't have full

69
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,739
access to the web browser and are they

70
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,419
are isolated from from each other and

71
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:38,639
again I'll go into more details when I

72
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:41,489
when I talk about each of the different

73
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,709
web browser Internet Explorer is a

74
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:47,909
completely different beast it's actually

75
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:49,409
compiled code Ethernet or C++ and the

76
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:53,939
browser extension is readied for each

77
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:55,858
tab so what can you do with these

78
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:59,159
browser extensions so for all browsers

79
00:03:55,859 --> 00:04:01,109
you can access all the cookies that are

80
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:03,720
being transmitted or that have already

81
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:06,209
been stored by the user from previous

82
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,400
sessions you can see all the password

83
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:10,109
and login that are sent and because you

84
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,859
are inside the web browser it doesn't

85
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:15,419
matter if you're now using HTTP HTTPS

86
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:16,889
but for Firefox and also interacts

87
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:18,840
project actually have access to the

88
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:22,259
entire file system you can read anywhere

89
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:24,060
on the file system and you can run

90
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:26,880
executive or just some limitations for

91
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:30,750
index Pro that that

92
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:33,960
when Nader and Firefox which is the blog

93
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:36,000
that was the most powerful plug-in

94
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,609
architecture you can also write anywhere

95
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,780
on the web browser extensions can also

96
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:45,540
replace part of the web browser and they

97
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,940
have access to all your login and as

98
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,680
well that you may have saved in the web

99
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,750
browser you know when you enter login

100
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:57,450
password usually ask you if you want to

101
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:59,880
save it so double you need

102
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:03,080
if you if you if you want to write a web

103
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:07,050
malware so you want to extract all the

104
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:09,330
useful information from the from the

105
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:12,090
user so you want these credentials so

106
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,560
you can get access to his account you

107
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,169
want to be able to send these

108
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:20,610
credentials out to your to your own

109
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:21,960
server you want maybe to steal some of

110
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:25,830
the important document if it is a

111
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,479
corporate computer any kind of

112
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:30,570
information but the user like Social

113
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:32,940
Security number credit card when you

114
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:35,010
want want to try to use the information

115
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,600
about the user to spam other users or to

116
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:39,930
contact the users so you might want to

117
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:43,500
have access to his email contact is

118
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:46,950
Facebook friends Linkedin etc you might

119
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:49,170
also want to change web pages for super

120
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:51,210
pages so if somebody's going to make a

121
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:52,650
payment through PayPal for the poor you

122
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:54,930
may want to change who is actually

123
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,400
getting the money you may want to change

124
00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:02,490
the browser link so that instead of

125
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:05,179
donating a software from another web

126
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:07,860
site you can actually download a

127
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:10,290
malicious electable from from any words

128
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,630
you might want to send spam and you want

129
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:14,010
to do that being invisible right you

130
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,630
don't want the user to notice that

131
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:18,539
you're actually doing all of this on his

132
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:21,630
computer and you don't want antivirus to

133
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:24,270
to catch you and broke you and if you

134
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:29,790
look at what both extension can do

135
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:31,380
that's actually all of this and I

136
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:33,450
explained I explained why but you can

137
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:36,270
access all the user credentials because

138
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:37,830
everything that we enter is 99 points

139
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:41,099
for web border when you login

140
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:42,150
to your bank accounts etc because you're

141
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,160
on the web browser you can of course

142
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,630
make HTTP requests so once you have

143
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,920
access to this credential you can send

144
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:51,570
them out I mentioned that on Firefox and

145
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,300
Internet Explorer you have flex s to the

146
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:57,810
file system so we can read a new

147
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:59,850
document and upload them any important

148
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:02,070
information like social security number

149
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:05,310
that are entered on a webform you can

150
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:07,500
also access them and again because you

151
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:09,750
are inside the browser you have no

152
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:15,990
problem modifying the page or accessing

153
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:18,000
any of the data like gmail contacts so

154
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:20,430
what what protection do the user have on

155
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,130
that computer well if you look if you if

156
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:25,170
you're outside of a company that pretty

157
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:28,409
much the only security tools that people

158
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:31,290
are running is their antivirus which

159
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:33,090
does two type of detection mostly right

160
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:36,780
one is behavior analysis trying to

161
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:39,830
figure out that some piece of software

162
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:44,359
is not behaving normally and as a

163
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:46,650
suspicious behavior and static analysis

164
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:52,290
it doesn't work very well for both

165
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:53,880
extension every time I upload a bot

166
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:58,590
extension to virustotal I usually get

167
00:07:53,880 --> 00:08:00,390
this kind of result the no AV vendor is

168
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:03,960
able to tell that both extensions

169
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:06,030
actually malicious and why why is it so

170
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:09,630
if you look if you if you look at

171
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:13,320
behavior analysis that an AV would look

172
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:15,150
at is a process that's hooking into

173
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,969
other processes so for our key logger

174
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:20,390
might hook into some application or your

175
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:25,110
Windows system to intercept all the

176
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:26,700
keyboard information a process might try

177
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,590
to connect to internet you may have seen

178
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:31,349
from Paul you know even when you install

179
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:33,959
Skype windows my might ask you if you

180
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:37,320
want this software to connect to the

181
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:39,270
internet it will probably add itself as

182
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,560
a service or to the starter to make sure

183
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:43,559
it's running every time you restart your

184
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:47,579
computer and then it might be trying to

185
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:49,130
hide it hide itself and he might try to

186
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,850
access part of the

187
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:54,889
of the file system that's not expected

188
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:56,690
but if you are inside of the browser the

189
00:08:54,889 --> 00:09:00,769
browser can do all of this action right

190
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:02,990
the the the the extension is not visible

191
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:04,639
to the operating system because it's now

192
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:08,120
the support thread is actually inside

193
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:09,920
the web browser web browser does need to

194
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:13,519
have internet access so there's nothing

195
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:16,819
wrong with that buzzer is always running

196
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:24,290
where we all serve the waiver all the

197
00:09:16,819 --> 00:09:25,550
time and sorry and the person needs to

198
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,139
have access to the file system right

199
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:36,258
when you're opening file or sending file

200
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:37,910
sorry okay so because there is no

201
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:39,769
distinction between the browser

202
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,870
extension and the web browser you cannot

203
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:43,639
tell that who is sending the HTTP

204
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,829
request this is the web browser or is it

205
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:49,069
the extension who is accessing a file on

206
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:51,349
on the system is it a particular about

207
00:09:49,069 --> 00:09:56,060
extension or is it the web browser so

208
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:58,399
behavior analysis is useless then you

209
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:02,508
have static analysis basically signature

210
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:10,180
and it works pretty well with Internet

211
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:13,870
Explorer usually when I upload malicious

212
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:15,699
DLL for night explore they are fun to be

213
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:20,200
measured by I know at least a few of

214
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:27,210
your vendors but for Chrome and Firefox

215
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:29,680
pretty much never and and there's a

216
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:31,450
couple of reason that I'll show our show

217
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:35,979
a little bit later but one of them is

218
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:42,220
the way extensions are handled by the

219
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:44,860
browser web browser so let's see in

220
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:47,110
Firefox and not hesitate to ask question

221
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:52,330
if something is not clear or if you need

222
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:53,830
any any more details so little bit more

223
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:57,820
details about the extension in in

224
00:10:53,830 --> 00:11:00,100
Firefox so far 5 Firefox extension are

225
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,510
distributed as dot xpi file which is

226
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:05,860
just a zip file with the different

227
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:09,189
extensions and among all the the file

228
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:12,760
that make up and extensions there are

229
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:17,220
three very important file one is called

230
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:21,339
install that rdf which describe the the

231
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:24,390
extension to firefox and one of the

232
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:26,320
important information is the ID each

233
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:29,199
browser extension has to have a unique

234
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,680
ID that's provided by the extension

235
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:36,880
creator so usually it's a gooey ID or an

236
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:38,199
email update you on where the firefox go

237
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,810
to check if there is a new version

238
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:44,070
available for this atom and the

239
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:47,199
contraction of the atom so this is what

240
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:50,830
the install that IDF looks like you can

241
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:54,730
see in the description yes yeah ID here

242
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:58,920
the GUI ID the version number here and

243
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:58,920
you have the update your here

244
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:08,060
so install at IDF you have the one

245
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:10,279
javascript file at least that actually

246
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,619
contains your your code for the

247
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:15,350
extension and the cert file that you

248
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:17,450
need is : overlay and that basically tie

249
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:22,640
the javascript file with your web

250
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:25,250
browser so this is an example here of an

251
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,949
overlay that ties your JavaScript files

252
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:29,690
so this is the JavaScript file that

253
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:32,720
contents the the the code of the

254
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:34,339
extension and it ties it to the to the

255
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,930
web browser and you can also add other

256
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:41,990
stuff so life report there is a status

257
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:44,989
bar that's added to the web browser you

258
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:46,520
can actually add native code to use your

259
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:50,450
own native code inside the file

260
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:52,550
extension you can embed C++ library and

261
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:54,950
you can also the extension you can also

262
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:58,579
replace a part of the brother so you can

263
00:12:54,950 --> 00:13:01,670
you can each most of the browser parts

264
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:04,850
have a GUI ID so for pop-up blocker as

265
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:06,709
its own GUI ID and you can declare your

266
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:11,589
own pop-up blocker for example to

267
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:16,189
replace part of the observer web browser

268
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:16,820
so as far as updates the I mentioned the

269
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:19,899
update you all

270
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:22,550
that's what Firefox uses to figure out

271
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:24,770
where to get where to go to check if a

272
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:28,790
new update is available there could be

273
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:30,949
another key if you if you do update over

274
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:33,649
HTTP you are required to having a big

275
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:35,300
key to sign the update manifest but

276
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:37,670
that's really a big pain so usually

277
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:41,270
people just use HTTPS and then you don't

278
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:44,649
need to sign anything and when when

279
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:49,160
Mattila firefox dropped the bet manifest

280
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:50,899
if we look for the ID and see the

281
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,910
version number is higher and then you

282
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:54,260
will it will download everything it's a

283
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:57,800
little bit different if you do not get

284
00:13:54,260 --> 00:14:00,829
extension from the mozilla add-on

285
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,899
website there's no update your instead

286
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:05,540
they use system settings and they just

287
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:08,470
use the same you are with a different ID

288
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,469
to figure out

289
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:15,610
where to look for the update so what

290
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:19,080
I've got mentioned and that's not found

291
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:22,570
in Ohio for extension is there's no

292
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,920
permissions so extension has access to

293
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,110
everything there's no limitation on what

294
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,790
they can do it doesn't declare if they

295
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:32,230
have access to the file system of the of

296
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:34,240
access to http web site and the

297
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:37,000
extension itself is not signed it's just

298
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,320
no in some cases the abet manifest might

299
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,860
be signed but the extension is not

300
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,510
signed

301
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:46,860
so Firefox cannot tell if if if an

302
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:49,209
extension is modified that at any time

303
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,770
okay so now that I've described how it

304
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:52,660
works let's see what we can actually do

305
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:54,760
in Firefox with an additional extension

306
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:57,189
so I mentioned that you have access to

307
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,680
the full bother you also have access to

308
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:00,910
the setting of the web browser so what

309
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,829
you could do if I want partly stop

310
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:06,219
disabling the security feature of

311
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:08,860
Firefox Firefox uses Google Safe

312
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:10,839
Browsing as a as a blacklist so what you

313
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:18,910
can do is just straight a setting to

314
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:24,760
disable the this this feed but it's not

315
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:26,319
really starts like my title mentioned in

316
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,540
the talk because if you go to the option

317
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,029
if the user actually bothered to go you

318
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:33,819
know to do a few clicks and to go into

319
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:37,990
the option under security will see that

320
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:41,620
the blacklist are now unchecked because

321
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:45,579
you just disable it through through

322
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:48,100
settings so what you can do to be to be

323
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:49,689
silence Ted is and that's something that

324
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:53,860
that can be done for many feature is

325
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:55,930
instead of disabling the feature disable

326
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:59,320
the data that the feature is using so if

327
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:01,540
you were supposing as to be a video

328
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:04,510
every 30 minutes so what you can do is

329
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:06,819
simply change the URL it's using to be

330
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:09,430
nothing so now we're supposing cannot

331
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:11,459
update itself and if you want to remove

332
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:14,339
what was there as it just as a database

333
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:17,680
SQLite database that you can just empty

334
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:20,230
it's a regular sqlite3 database we can

335
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,079
just issue one segment and remove what's

336
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,790
what's over there so now

337
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:26,970
if you go through the UI you won't

338
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:28,949
notice anything wrong I mean the the two

339
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:31,110
checkboxes for the word supposing and a

340
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:32,580
ball but we were supporting is not able

341
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:36,780
to get any data and you won't get any

342
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:40,920
morning and because all the browser

343
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:42,689
extensions are settings are still at the

344
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,449
same place we can also start disabling

345
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:50,910
other security features so fell apart

346
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:53,130
btq scan is a V extension what you can

347
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:55,650
tell is no every second you just tell

348
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:57,270
the extension that it just it just ran a

349
00:16:55,650 --> 00:17:02,189
scan so there's no need to do another

350
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:05,069
one or this is a extension I I wrote

351
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:08,780
called descaler safe shopping that gets

352
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:11,669
downloads regularly a list of malicious

353
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:13,889
fake online stores again you can just

354
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:16,920
change the world and now the plugin is

355
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:18,180
not able to get any new information so

356
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,459
you can pretty much disabled this

357
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:22,709
disable all the features all security

358
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:25,050
features of the web browser and the

359
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:29,520
extensions and you want your user 1

360
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:33,720
notice anything and once you start

361
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:37,470
infected your your the the users bother

362
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,880
what you can do also is stop updates for

363
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:40,950
the web browser so you might feel that

364
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,050
now some new update of Firefox may have

365
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:45,480
improve security and might detect what

366
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:48,450
you're doing again just change the URL

367
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,880
that Firefox uses to look for updates

368
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:55,920
and it won't be able to find updates

369
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:57,780
automatically so I said that you you

370
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,950
have access to a whole file system for

371
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:04,440
reading and writing so you can also

372
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:07,140
infect existing extensions so if you're

373
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,300
afraid that users might remove your

374
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:12,600
malicious extension at some point then

375
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:14,250
you can start adding your own code into

376
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,199
the existing extensions because

377
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,150
extension are not signed so Firefox

378
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,800
won't be able to tell that the version

379
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:22,950
is running is a modified version from

380
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,730
the one that was installed and then you

381
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,690
have two options

382
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:28,850
once you have infected

383
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:31,490
existing what extension you can either

384
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:34,550
so you can either infect the extension

385
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:36,260
that on on the file system and disable

386
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,800
all the updates or you can do the

387
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:39,140
opposite

388
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:41,810
you can force Firefox to update the

389
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:44,900
current extension to malicious versions

390
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:47,000
and to do that you simply have to change

391
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:53,960
the update you are in the install that

392
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:57,110
rdf and change it to your own to your

393
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:59,510
own URL and force an update of the

394
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:03,979
extensions philippa by setting a small

395
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:05,480
update interval and now Firefox will

396
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:08,690
actually do the infection for yourself

397
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,980
it will now try to find an update find

398
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:13,340
one because you have one already and

399
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:18,340
replace the real extension with a

400
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:22,030
malicious one or you can from your

401
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:26,389
extension modify the code on the on the

402
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:28,420
object other extensions and and then you

403
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:31,730
want to make sure that Firefox does not

404
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:33,410
update the infection that you dress

405
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:36,470
infected and you can do the same kind of

406
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:39,380
trick so you can disable completely

407
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:41,750
extension update you can modify the

408
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:44,150
update interval to be very long you can

409
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:47,480
override the update that URL information

410
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:49,340
in the file so it points to wrong URL or

411
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,650
you can and you can change the date you

412
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:55,459
are for the exemption that I don't know

413
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:57,290
did for the for the from the official

414
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:00,020
store or we can just have a huge version

415
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:01,340
number the version numbers 100 and no

416
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:07,550
update will be varied because it will

417
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:10,610
always be lower so beside extension then

418
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:12,440
you can go even even deeper and actually

419
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:16,340
start replacing part of your web browser

420
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:18,140
so a lot of the fire for scope is

421
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,179
actually JavaScript there's a file

422
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:22,280
called open it the jar you can look on

423
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:24,920
your on your Windows or Linux Mac

424
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,450
computer and it's just a zip file and if

425
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,740
you decompress you will see that there

426
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,240
are a lot of JavaScript file that

427
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:31,820
defines for example the pop-up blocker

428
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,380
or how the tab looks like or what kind

429
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:36,350
of information that might be added to a

430
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:38,350
tab and you can start replacing that so

431
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:40,269
you can you know at you

432
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:42,789
one that issue managers cut to every tab

433
00:20:40,269 --> 00:20:45,009
just by modifying the the bother itself

434
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:46,899
and then again these a board browser

435
00:20:45,009 --> 00:20:54,639
update so you so the user never get a

436
00:20:46,899 --> 00:20:58,719
good version anymore you can also add

437
00:20:54,639 --> 00:21:02,918
and remove file so you can use the ball

438
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:05,970
accession just as a file drop dropper to

439
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:08,950
again get access internet access we

440
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:11,230
without being a visible because the

441
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:13,090
bother has internet access and just drop

442
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:21,009
measures website file on your computer

443
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:22,299
and execute Sam so extension can do a

444
00:21:21,009 --> 00:21:25,000
lot of bad stuff but how do we actually

445
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:27,940
get the users to do to install this

446
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,149
extension on on their computer so you

447
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:35,320
have to wait to sort of an extension in

448
00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:38,199
Firefox the one that you that is usually

449
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:41,950
used is you click on a link that points

450
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:45,700
to an extension Firefox presents a first

451
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:47,590
warning as telling you that your the

452
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,899
website wants to insert an extension so

453
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:51,970
you can lower denied then you get five

454
00:21:49,899 --> 00:21:54,820
seconds to actually think about it

455
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:57,690
carefully and and then you can click

456
00:21:54,820 --> 00:22:02,649
install so there's no possibility of

457
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:06,960
silent distillation from the web so if

458
00:22:02,649 --> 00:22:09,008
you want to the user to to to install a

459
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,860
malicious attention from your website

460
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:14,679
you have to use some social engineering

461
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:17,199
so what you usually use is like a flag

462
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:19,090
flash update you go to a website tells

463
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,179
you you want you to see this video but

464
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:23,709
you have an old Flash version so please

465
00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:26,919
don't know this new saturation and then

466
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:30,279
you get prompted for an extension that

467
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:33,879
looks like a flash update same thing

468
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:37,200
with fake video player one of the nice

469
00:22:33,879 --> 00:22:40,029
thing of using both extension and not

470
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,279
fight button not just a regular I don't

471
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:44,320
know that that the user no should

472
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:48,100
download and store its first is only one

473
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,539
click so the you don't have to

474
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:53,830
the user doesn't have to download and

475
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:55,210
then install and also both extension

476
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:58,928
that are done already don't go through

477
00:22:55,210 --> 00:23:00,039
the download manager and you probably

478
00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:02,260
notice that every time you download the

479
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:03,940
files for Firefox before you can

480
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:08,760
actually click on it the entire virus

481
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:12,700
run if you have one installed and so if

482
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:13,840
if it's a known malicious file the AP

483
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,390
will block it before you can actually

484
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,280
click to execut but with both extension

485
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:20,650
the handle automatically by the web

486
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:25,658
browser and there's no / - natee for the

487
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:27,730
AV - kicks in to quicken and rather than

488
00:23:25,659 --> 00:23:30,010
good thing and with these I have seen

489
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:31,059
that a couple of times is you don't

490
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:33,510
actually have to put the malicious

491
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:36,970
content inside or inside the extension

492
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:41,110
the extension can can pull its contents

493
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:43,840
after it executes so there's nothing

494
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:45,879
really militias in in the exception that

495
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,500
you're doing that you're downloading is

496
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,460
just when I try and if we don't know

497
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:55,080
diminishes code and then run it so div

498
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,080
won't detect that it's a work extension

499
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:03,850
maybe anyway every engineer is very bad

500
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:06,700
at detecting threats in index file

501
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:08,889
so I tried further on Paul one known

502
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:11,200
piece of malware from the black hole

503
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:12,370
expert kid I took something that was not

504
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,890
too not too old

505
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:16,600
not too new so got Olevia time to

506
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:20,320
actually sit come and see see it and

507
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:24,668
only half of the other vendors can

508
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:27,220
actually find some some malicious in in

509
00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:29,260
this travel script file when I run the

510
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:31,299
same time when I run the same thing for

511
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:33,330
the executive all that other that are

512
00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:36,190
downloaded by the black hole expected

513
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:38,139
the success thread by a vendor is much

514
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:41,140
higher

515
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:45,429
another thing that is in favor of both

516
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:49,000
extension is a lot of antivirus don't

517
00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:52,960
scan dot txt file by default the thing

518
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,700
is yes the the extension doesn't mean

519
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:59,020
anything for Firefox I mean the

520
00:24:54,700 --> 00:25:00,970
JavaScript file can be can be can have a

521
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:04,090
dot txt extension can have any

522
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:06,190
any kind of extension so just rename all

523
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:09,459
your JavaScript file as bad 60 and most

524
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:15,990
of the AV won't won't bother looking at

525
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:15,990
them now as a second way of doing

526
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,900
extension installation on Firefox is

527
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:26,590
called third-party installation so if

528
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:29,410
you came across one of these repackage

529
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:33,310
VLC or a package free software that's

530
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:35,670
trying to install like a toolbar for

531
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:38,350
example on your own your web browser

532
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:41,650
this one Oliva this Mona I see all the

533
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:44,199
time these days the way the way that

534
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:46,300
walk to install the application is

535
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,490
actually drop the extension into your

536
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:51,940
Firefox profile so next time you run

537
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:59,200
Firefox Firefox will see the extension

538
00:25:51,940 --> 00:26:01,830
and in recent and before used to be

539
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,780
signing like in the Firefox free backs

540
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:07,270
third party could add add-ons to your

541
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:09,610
profile and it will just be used right

542
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:13,290
away when Firefox started so they've

543
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:17,080
made some improvements to to combat this

544
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:19,060
sub part yoga extension but the the

545
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:21,040
protection they have are very easily

546
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:22,659
bypassed so one of the protections they

547
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:27,250
have is a list of blacklisted

548
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:30,160
blacklisted extension they have an excel

549
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:33,820
file on on the user profile that contain

550
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:36,280
the list of the extension IDs that are

551
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:38,710
known to be malicious and this list is

552
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:42,639
updated automatically but again because

553
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:44,920
you have full access to to your to the

554
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,530
file to the balla settings now when you

555
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:52,570
install an extension you can always

556
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:54,190
disable this block list and if you do a

557
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:56,590
third-party installation you can also

558
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:59,470
this you can also remove the file that's

559
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:01,770
inside the user profile before you

560
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:04,390
install your your own application and

561
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:07,300
the file is the file is just a list of

562
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:09,520
ID I mean every time you don't know the

563
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,428
same add-on you can you could generate a

564
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,529
new

565
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:14,090
gree idea for them power so all your

566
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:16,909
manage that then we will always have a

567
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:22,220
different GUI ID and Firefox wouldn't be

568
00:27:16,909 --> 00:27:23,960
able to keep up anyway so the other

569
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:26,779
protection they added is now when you

570
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:30,320
restart your web browser after third

571
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:31,789
party installation Firefox will actually

572
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,950
prompt you and tell you hey there's a

573
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:36,289
new add-on here do you actually want to

574
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:39,890
enable it and by default it won't be

575
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:43,610
enabled so user users are aware of new

576
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:46,429
extension beings or that way but again

577
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:49,840
it's actually very easy to bypass the

578
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:52,010
Firefox stores all the information about

579
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,199
extension that I already installed into

580
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:56,809
a database again sqlite3 database so

581
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,669
very easy to access so what you can do

582
00:27:56,809 --> 00:28:01,120
is simply add your own record into the

583
00:27:58,669 --> 00:28:04,279
table it's wait it's very simple

584
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,590
actually the demo ready for that where I

585
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:07,820
probably won't have time so when you do

586
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:10,418
when you do you subtract the

587
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:14,299
acceleration just add your at the your

588
00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:16,399
add-on introduced into this database say

589
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:18,139
hey this is an extension that was

590
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:20,149
already stored two weeks ago don't worry

591
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,559
about it and when the user stop the

592
00:28:20,149 --> 00:28:24,279
browser it doesn't notice that there is

593
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:26,809
a new extension because Firefox won't

594
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:32,360
want from the user the extension will be

595
00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:33,470
running so very very easy to bypass yeah

596
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:39,229
I probably won't have time for that

597
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:44,870
maybe you see at the end of talk any

598
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:49,120
question about Firefox or no ok so let's

599
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:49,120
say chrome Chrome is a mask you were

600
00:28:49,539 --> 00:28:56,179
buzzer and for long time actually quite

601
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,918
a week browser architecture like up

602
00:28:56,179 --> 00:29:01,520
until maybe two years ago you couldn't

603
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:04,669
do very interesting with it but your

604
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:08,389
family does much more robust robust

605
00:29:04,669 --> 00:29:09,980
security system so Chrome extension also

606
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:12,080
made up of three main files one is a

607
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:14,450
manifested manifest file which is

608
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,590
similar to the installer idea for

609
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:19,470
Firefox

610
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:22,199
it describes the extension so that name

611
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:24,510
and you do have permissions inside the

612
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:27,059
file as ashram to the users so you sure

613
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:29,750
one example here so you have to say for

614
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:33,030
up or if you want to inject the script

615
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:35,880
here in which type of pages you want to

616
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:43,559
tell access so here means any HTTP HTTP

617
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:45,929
website if if you want to use some

618
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:49,230
special API that can modify request for

619
00:29:45,929 --> 00:29:52,020
example or look at that are double risky

620
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:55,230
yours you also need to to request

621
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:57,539
permission for that then you have a

622
00:29:55,230 --> 00:30:00,120
background page that exact access to the

623
00:29:57,539 --> 00:30:03,390
web browser but not the tab and the

624
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:05,459
injected file that's injected into the

625
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:08,039
tab and that has access to the top

626
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:12,000
content but not the bother and the two

627
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:17,549
can can communicate to each other so

628
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,720
much more iteration each extension is

629
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,908
completely independent from the other

630
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,610
they cannot share settings they cannot

631
00:30:20,909 --> 00:30:25,850
talk to each other extension cannot

632
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:31,469
change any setting for the whole powder

633
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:34,219
on its own store own settings it doesn't

634
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:37,740
have access to the file system

635
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:39,929
it cannot run or included in that native

636
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:42,630
code they've added it to Chrome OS but

637
00:30:39,929 --> 00:30:46,140
not to not to home and like I said if

638
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:49,620
there is any risky access that you need

639
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:53,130
you need to request it in your manifest

640
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:59,449
file so the user know what what the

641
00:30:53,130 --> 00:31:02,190
add-on has access to so you have the

642
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:05,610
attack surface is much more for for

643
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:08,600
Chrome and in the latest version as

644
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:13,590
using chrome 20 if I remember correctly

645
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:18,379
you can only install extension extension

646
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:20,879
from there from their own own store

647
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:23,250
third-party so this is when you don't

648
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,770
know nothin from their home store that's

649
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:27,990
kind of forgot that you get you see the

650
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:29,879
permissions here and you have a chance

651
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:32,110
to cancel if you change your mind and

652
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,700
now if you try to download

653
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:36,729
none from a different website you will

654
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:38,350
get this warning that tells you that you

655
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:40,000
can only download it from the Chrome Web

656
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:43,300
Store only if you already want to

657
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,710
install a third party an extension from

658
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:47,530
a third party website you actually have

659
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:49,510
to download it as a regular file go to

660
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:52,300
your preference the extension page do a

661
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:54,550
drag and drop or you have to go to on

662
00:31:52,300 --> 00:32:00,159
Chrome with special parameter to a low

663
00:31:54,550 --> 00:32:03,280
set party website so that means a lot

664
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:04,780
less options to get user to install

665
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,639
malicious app now you actually have to

666
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:09,129
trick we're going into accepting your

667
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:14,080
malicious website extension on their

668
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:19,410
website so the only only way to

669
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:22,560
compromise extension is really to modify

670
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:27,520
the javascript file that's on the file a

671
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:30,340
third party executive all again the the

672
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:32,410
extension are not signed so Google

673
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:34,419
Chrome is not aware of any change and

674
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:39,190
next time you restart chrome it will

675
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:41,440
pick up the code changes and and you end

676
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:44,830
and then you'll be able to lick that I

677
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,350
like your session cookies you're a user

678
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:50,010
name/password

679
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:51,459
but so it's it's no more limited

680
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:53,379
architecture

681
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:57,730
less option no access to the file system

682
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:59,700
no way to executables more secure in

683
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:02,080
general

684
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:08,380
okay now probably the most interesting

685
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:11,949
internet explorer so browser extension

686
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:15,130
in trance product are called the browser

687
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:16,930
helper object BHO if you google for pho

688
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:20,860
the probably the first 30 results will

689
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:22,060
be about malware and that were installed

690
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:24,310
as Robledo

691
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:26,050
so both extension on the intact provides

692
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:28,780
a very bad reputation so there are

693
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:32,080
compiled codes are dll I can be done

694
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:33,810
either in c++ c plus plus or dotnet and

695
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,070
it's a complete black black box when you

696
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:38,440
don't know the dll you have no way of

697
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:41,800
knowing what it's going to do and it

698
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:43,270
doesn't even export any any function so

699
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,050
you really can tell what is doing

700
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:47,679
there's no

701
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:50,919
permission nothing like that and what

702
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:52,600
extension are handled completely outside

703
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:55,510
of the web browser so you cannot

704
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:58,030
download on a link and interpreter will

705
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:59,530
not handle installation for yourself and

706
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:04,570
one thing that's also a little bit weird

707
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:06,010
about in thanks for is that if you want

708
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:10,110
to create the toolbar if you want to

709
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:13,869
create like many options and your own

710
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:16,119
extension we have to be seperated BHO so

711
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:17,970
in Firefox and call you typically you

712
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:21,879
have at least two screen when one is a

713
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:24,399
the option screen may be a pop up next

714
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:25,480
with your old bar and your your main

715
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,980
code and that will be in the same

716
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,740
extension before in tight spot you have

717
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:34,899
to do three different browser extensions

718
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:36,580
for that so let's see how you so main

719
00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:38,020
protection of in tax power is called

720
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:41,190
protected mode you probably aware of it

721
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:45,159
that means index poor and all its

722
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:46,629
extension are running as a low and low

723
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:48,970
integrity process that means they have

724
00:34:46,629 --> 00:34:50,618
limited access to the registry we have

725
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:53,469
limited write access to the file system

726
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:56,409
and they can only run executive all

727
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:59,919
which are the same privileges mini

728
00:34:56,409 --> 00:35:03,390
meaning lower privilege so if they try

729
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:08,619
to earn a higher privilege application

730
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:14,230
the prompt is is shown to the user to

731
00:35:08,619 --> 00:35:16,660
allow this executable to run but there

732
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:19,930
are a few shortcomings to into the

733
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:24,029
product mod so first you can actually

734
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:27,430
actually can add what's called

735
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:28,990
elimination elevation policy to your

736
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:31,930
registry so you can actually allow

737
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:37,410
Internet port to run some executables

738
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:39,819
and in any executive board with higher

739
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:42,640
integrity without without having any

740
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:44,880
prompt just need to write the ads a

741
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:47,200
couple of entering your registry and

742
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,510
while you have limited access to the

743
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,549
file system were limited read access to

744
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:53,440
sorry limited write access to the file

745
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:54,490
system we actually actually have

746
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,670
unlimited

747
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:59,439
read access to the whole file system

748
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:03,640
that means again the extension can read

749
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:08,980
any file and upload it anywhere the

750
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:11,019
Windows 8 they actually introduced

751
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:15,250
something called n ends protected mode

752
00:36:11,019 --> 00:36:17,319
that have more granular read access but

753
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:21,309
unfortunately it's disabled by default

754
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:23,259
in Internet Explorer 10 because most of

755
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:27,730
the plugging like flash are wouldn't

756
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:30,250
work with this limitation so also there

757
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:32,980
are a few changes in Internet Explorer

758
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:36,309
10 as fast security extensions still

759
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:40,839
have a completely access to the entire

760
00:36:36,309 --> 00:36:48,730
file system ok so now how you install

761
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:49,740
yeah I tested on Windows 9 sorry

762
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:53,890
Internet Explorer 9

763
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:55,959
yeah so protecting most started with in

764
00:36:53,890 --> 00:37:02,618
times four seven on Windows Windows

765
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:05,769
Vista so I mentioned that both extension

766
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:08,589
are not handled directly by intense

767
00:37:05,769 --> 00:37:11,919
power you actually once you want to the

768
00:37:08,589 --> 00:37:14,619
another dll on your local hard drive you

769
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:17,259
don't have to register it so well so

770
00:37:14,619 --> 00:37:19,930
that Internet Explorer can pick it up

771
00:37:17,259 --> 00:37:21,940
when it restarts when you register

772
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:24,308
meaning you add entries in the registry

773
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:33,549
you need to have administrator right so

774
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:34,930
you get a pop-up so go to package above

775
00:37:33,549 --> 00:37:37,329
the extension you have to clear any

776
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:39,669
store that will do the registration for

777
00:37:37,329 --> 00:37:41,769
yourself for for the user so you just

778
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:43,680
have to download and I ran under their

779
00:37:41,769 --> 00:37:46,328
executive board with the illustration

780
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,710
but that's that means for the user quite

781
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:50,500
a few straight that's we don't know the

782
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:54,250
equitable executive or it has to run it

783
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:57,240
it has to accept the USC prompt to get

784
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:59,890
administrator privileges for the

785
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:02,288
registration and it doesn't look like

786
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:04,000
you know small pieces of foreigner you

787
00:38:02,289 --> 00:38:07,930
actually burning and running an

788
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,480
executable but unfortunately they are

789
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:11,290
weather on that so I don't know if any

790
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,200
of you

791
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:17,589
try to install the Google Google Chrome

792
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:19,000
Frame form tanks for you should try that

793
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:20,799
even if you remove after a while that's

794
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,380
actually very impressing and very scary

795
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:26,200
so you go to that website within that

796
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:28,510
Explorer you click on a link you get no

797
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:30,279
prompt for in transport nothing you just

798
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:32,470
get redirected to a new web page where

799
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:35,140
Google's tells you we've installed the

800
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:37,118
Google confirm on your computer you just

801
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:38,650
have to restart Internet Explorer it's

802
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,530
not like the extension is not doing much

803
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:43,690
I mean is changing the switching the

804
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:46,359
rendering engine from Internet Explorer

805
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:49,930
and Google Chrome so there is a way to

806
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:52,060
install both extension without prompting

807
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:54,819
the user and for that they use two

808
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:57,880
things one is called click click once

809
00:38:54,820 --> 00:39:00,280
deployment to deploy application moseley

810
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:03,510
and I'll go into details and the other

811
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,510
one is a bother

812
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:08,920
Pietro injection so instead of

813
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:10,390
registering the [ __ ] who is in the

814
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:15,070
restroom is Internet Explorer which

815
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:17,078
require you which requires administrator

816
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:19,750
right actually injected directly into

817
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:22,000
index bar and I'm going to explain what

818
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:25,240
it is so click once what is it

819
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,240
so like his name says it's click once

820
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:33,069
for the user maybe even click never

821
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:35,169
click some cases so the way it works is

822
00:39:33,069 --> 00:39:36,910
you once you have your executive or your

823
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:43,300
installer you sign it

824
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:45,520
and with and it's probably something

825
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:50,020
that was designed for intranet because

826
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:53,380
if you if you if you have the code

827
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:56,170
certificate in your local store that was

828
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:58,329
used to sign the Executive Board there's

829
00:39:56,170 --> 00:40:02,440
actually not prompt so the ID was a

830
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:04,930
cooperate might distribute their code

831
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,920
signing certificate for to all to all

832
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:07,899
the computers

833
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,760
user Buju you will just have to click

834
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,500
now on their intranet to download the

835
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,609
software and everything will be done

836
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:18,069
automatically they wouldn't have to

837
00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:20,330
worry about anything so once you have

838
00:40:18,069 --> 00:40:23,450
your click once

839
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:26,480
yeah once you have your click once

840
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:29,899
packaged so what would you beep sorry in

841
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:34,720
your like click ones deployment so the

842
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:37,940
click ones if you you want you want to

843
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:41,899
extract the browser browser extension

844
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:43,340
into a low integrity folder so that you

845
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:47,600
don't have to prompt the user again for

846
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:49,190
any any additional privileges register

847
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,440
as a Windows service I didn't realize

848
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:54,230
that anybody could do that without

849
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,940
special privileges and then detect when

850
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:59,030
internet explorer is open so when you

851
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:01,930
detect the iexplorer process when you

852
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:06,680
inject the DLL into into the process and

853
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:10,390
you and then you can just add the gate

854
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:13,370
show directly into into the process and

855
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:14,930
if you look at the source code from from

856
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:17,420
home it's actually very trivial to do

857
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:19,790
that it's just a few lines of C++ to do

858
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:22,700
that then you have to send your click

859
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:25,759
table for click once and create the

860
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:27,290
click one deployment package with you

861
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:32,540
can do it with Visual Studio it's pretty

862
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:34,600
easy and here you are then you get pH to

863
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:40,670
install without admin access so here's

864
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:44,750
what you get when you're the co sign in

865
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:48,520
certificate is not in your in your local

866
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:53,870
store so you still get one click to do

867
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:55,880
but I think as it's much better than the

868
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:57,170
regular pop up that you may see from

869
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,120
your web browser that asked you to

870
00:41:57,170 --> 00:42:01,100
install something so first of all the

871
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,450
pop-up is nothing like you ever seen in

872
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,819
Internet Explorer is they look

873
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:06,290
completely different if you minimize a

874
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:08,570
web browser the pop-up won't be

875
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:14,360
minimized at all so it looks like an

876
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:15,950
official no pop-up from from the US

877
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:18,620
rather than just from there from the web

878
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:21,410
browser and again and then if you click

879
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:23,240
install you don't have a way to cancel

880
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:25,160
at any time you click install and the

881
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,540
beatriz install is there already is it

882
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,670
sort of magically on the web browser you

883
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:33,050
don't have a way to to cancel at any

884
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:34,140
time if you look carefully at the image

885
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:38,369
you might find

886
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:43,140
a couple of things that look strange and

887
00:42:38,369 --> 00:42:45,930
the image was not photoshopped so how

888
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:48,808
can you abuse click once

889
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:49,890
so you see three information one is the

890
00:42:48,809 --> 00:42:51,690
name of the software that they're

891
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:56,569
supposed to be downloaded downloading

892
00:42:51,690 --> 00:43:02,220
white comes from the the host domain and

893
00:42:56,569 --> 00:43:05,308
the publisher of the cut signing

894
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:06,930
certificate so the name you can do

895
00:43:05,309 --> 00:43:09,029
anything right so I just say okay you're

896
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:10,890
actually donating a Windows Update that

897
00:43:09,029 --> 00:43:12,329
looks legitimate and again because the

898
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:15,839
pop-up does not look like anything

899
00:43:12,329 --> 00:43:18,029
you've seen in in Internet Explorer make

900
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:20,250
sign that you will be donating a windows

901
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:23,849
a bit like that and if you look at the

902
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:25,829
at the host name it looks like it's just

903
00:43:23,849 --> 00:43:29,220
coming from a weird subdomain of

904
00:43:25,829 --> 00:43:30,690
Microsoft calm and that's because even

905
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:33,089
though the most important part of the

906
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:35,010
domain is on the right right it's a tab

907
00:43:33,089 --> 00:43:39,180
domain of the chill D we actually

908
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:41,609
truncate the right side of the domain so

909
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:45,029
I just use no some very long domain name

910
00:43:41,609 --> 00:43:47,009
that Microsoft come dot my website calm

911
00:43:45,029 --> 00:43:48,779
and because it's strong it's just

912
00:43:47,009 --> 00:43:50,549
doesn't show up here so if you see here

913
00:43:48,779 --> 00:43:53,750
over over the string yeah if you do

914
00:43:50,549 --> 00:43:53,750
however you will see the full name but

915
00:43:54,289 --> 00:44:01,349
yeah that still amazes me that in 2012

916
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:03,240
we see that this kind of error where

917
00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:06,960
we're actually hiding the most important

918
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:09,240
part of the information so it's pretty

919
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:12,779
easy to pull the user into thinking that

920
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:14,069
they are downloading an official Windows

921
00:44:12,779 --> 00:44:15,740
Update for example but could be in

922
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:17,808
either update form and official

923
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:20,069
microstrip obviously you might find

924
00:44:17,809 --> 00:44:25,619
metric spend more time finding a better

925
00:44:20,069 --> 00:44:28,710
long subdomain and there are also a

926
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:32,700
couple of advantages of using this

927
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:36,000
method so first when you inject the bot

928
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:38,069
extension is enabled by default and the

929
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:43,650
user can always go into its options

930
00:44:38,069 --> 00:44:45,779
later on and then disable it but for

931
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:50,970
Internet Explorer a new

932
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:52,650
a new extension means a new gyd so what

933
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:56,040
you can do is every time you detect a

934
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:58,050
new ix4 ik process you just enjoy the

935
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:00,480
same GLA with a different GID that you

936
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:02,850
know random gyd and then again it will

937
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,770
be enabled by default so yeah if you

938
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:07,470
keep disabling then you might go to your

939
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:09,180
eye down and see you know 52 of them but

940
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:10,649
by default in tax problems not show you

941
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:13,140
yet and of our disabled you actually

942
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:15,150
have to a couple of extra steps to see

943
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:19,020
all the add-ons that were installed at

944
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:24,660
some point and disabled so there are

945
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:27,410
actually ways around around the long

946
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:30,839
process of installing build extension in

947
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:33,930
Internet Explorer okay quick quick

948
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:35,610
conclusion so what extension actually

949
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:38,910
much more powerful and then you may

950
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:41,820
think you know again flexor cycles for

951
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:46,250
in your file system and this should be

952
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:50,400
treated as complete executables and

953
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:53,280
scanners scan as well that's so I think

954
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,650
that's a much better way for for malware

955
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:58,050
so first of all it's easy to code you

956
00:45:55,650 --> 00:46:00,350
just have to turn JavaScript even for

957
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:02,760
Internet Explorer which is in C++ or

958
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:04,860
dotnet you can actually use one of the

959
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:08,100
free framework that allows you to write

960
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:10,740
JavaScript code that we work on Firefox

961
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:13,680
Chrome and next power the work should at

962
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:15,479
least to my words is this your tool

963
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,089
rockball extension that were using one

964
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,290
of these framework and and then that

965
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:22,500
means there was on on older browsers

966
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:24,060
they work on all the platform and very

967
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:28,620
live access to everything that you may

968
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:32,610
want to steal on somebody's computer so

969
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:36,240
what do we do to to protect your user so

970
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:40,290
do what chrome is doing make a lower

971
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:43,410
only extension from the official

972
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:45,870
extension store so Firefox for Nepal

973
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:48,930
they do a manual review of all the Adam

974
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:52,170
that are sent to the user to a stop

975
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:53,430
before it's reviewed it I mean takes

976
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:54,930
quite a while especially the first time

977
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:57,899
you said nearly done but they are not

978
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:59,220
sorely reviewed Chrome as they are doing

979
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:01,050
some automatic check

980
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:04,830
but another human shape for sure because

981
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:06,570
the dose approach seems too fast and if

982
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:08,549
you want to do such if you want to infer

983
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:12,599
this automatically the good thing is

984
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:15,390
good news is that all these add-ons rely

985
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:20,790
completely on the mime type to figure

986
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:24,359
out if something is an extension so if

987
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:25,830
you--if Firefox at home down if if you

988
00:47:24,359 --> 00:47:27,210
don't know the data x-play file that's

989
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:29,640
not sent with the right mind type

990
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:31,080
Firefox with downloading as well give

991
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:33,000
your file you won't try to install it

992
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:36,180
same thing for home if he doesn't have

993
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:39,330
the right 9 pipe it won't it will just

994
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:41,640
denote it as a regular file and for in

995
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:43,380
transport again you need a special name

996
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:46,560
type for click one that your it

997
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:50,119
shouldn't be using on internet expected

998
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:54,140
search for google chrome chrome store

999
00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:57,410
Internet Explorer does not have a real

1000
00:47:54,140 --> 00:48:00,868
extension store like Firefox and Chrome

1001
00:47:57,410 --> 00:48:05,790
so if you want to get user use extension

1002
00:48:00,869 --> 00:48:07,200
for FYE you probably want to vet the

1003
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:09,660
extension before the other nerdy and

1004
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:12,720
wholesome on your intranet and only

1005
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:16,399
allow extension from there or you could

1006
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:18,810
just completely disable extension

1007
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,700
installation by looking down Windows or

1008
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:24,900
the web browser have settings that when

1009
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:28,859
they switch I can set two to disable the

1010
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:36,710
installation of any extension yeah and

1011
00:48:28,859 --> 00:48:36,710
that's it any question yes

1012
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:41,799
[Music]

1013
00:48:38,619 --> 00:48:43,809
these positive exposed api's to her in a

1014
00:48:41,799 --> 00:48:46,040
narcissist

1015
00:48:43,809 --> 00:48:47,960
we'll be done

1016
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:50,029
[Music]

1017
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:53,930
okay so they asked me to repeat so the

1018
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:58,220
question is should web browser exposed

1019
00:48:53,930 --> 00:49:00,799
the extension to the AV before before

1020
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:02,029
it's actually executed that would be

1021
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,590
nice if every man that we are aware

1022
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:09,200
actually catching them I mean every time

1023
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:13,160
I I tried to donated 100 Protima less

1024
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:15,680
than the success rate was very low for a

1025
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:17,450
javascript extension so yeah I think

1026
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,100
that would be better so we don't

1027
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:21,890
recommend the every scam that happen

1028
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:23,980
with the donor major but until they do a

1029
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:36,970
better job as polygons not going to help

1030
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:36,970
too much I don't know I didn't

1031
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:44,259
[Music]

1032
00:49:45,229 --> 00:49:51,149
yeah I think it something was designed

1033
00:49:48,269 --> 00:49:52,348
for intranet but yeah that's it

1034
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:54,119
they really looked something that was

1035
00:49:52,349 --> 00:49:56,999
designed for Internet where now there's

1036
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:58,950
a lot more trust especially again if you

1037
00:49:56,999 --> 00:50:02,450
put your cosine interested and there's

1038
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:06,919
no click and shouldn't be expose on the

1039
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:06,919
network yes yeah

1040
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,970
sure

1041
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:20,770
[Music]

1042
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:20,770
also in ie10 you had something to happen

1043
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:26,310
yeah so that's well yeah but so that's

1044
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:27,930
what expected yeah that's why I

1045
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:31,400
explained with the enhanced protective

1046
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:35,399
mod right that's that the same idea of a

1047
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:37,260
granular read access and you don't have

1048
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:40,470
access to hold hold five Cs I'm a part

1049
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:42,210
of it but I've understood Windows a

1050
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:47,669
before my so from the official blog is

1051
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:49,410
that because plugins like like flash we

1052
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:50,850
didn't work with that because expect to

1053
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:53,670
have full access to a file system

1054
00:50:50,850 --> 00:51:00,049
it's actually disabled by default in IE

1055
00:50:53,670 --> 00:51:00,050
10 okay sure

1056
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,710
[Music]

1057
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:08,869
so otherwise this year I have actually

1058
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:10,670
seen a lot more nyesha's work extension

1059
00:51:08,869 --> 00:51:14,810
I've seen it in the news and I've seen

1060
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:16,340
it in my research also there's a lot of

1061
00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:18,230
web pages for example that that claim

1062
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:20,630
that you don't have a right fake flash

1063
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:23,090
so it's a all right flash version and

1064
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:24,859
you need to do no one and then empty

1065
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:26,630
area until this year it was always an

1066
00:51:24,859 --> 00:51:29,180
exact able that you have to download and

1067
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:33,380
this year I think twice it was actually

1068
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:36,350
a broad extension that they wanted you

1069
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:38,990
to install and not an injectable and the

1070
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:41,960
detection rate for Westar that's free

1071
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:44,660
version one for home one for Firefox one

1072
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:48,619
for IE I the directional was actually

1073
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:52,250
pretty good and for Firefox and Chrome

1074
00:51:48,619 --> 00:51:54,440
II was very was very bad it was one or

1075
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:57,050
so one cross-platform and close browser

1076
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:58,550
version that was for sale 'singing but

1077
00:51:57,050 --> 00:52:02,810
the beginning of the year or end of last

1078
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:06,859
year and not have the name it was wrong

1079
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:11,270
extension for sale so it's it's it's not

1080
00:52:06,859 --> 00:52:13,940
yet I don't think another thing is that

1081
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:18,470
widely used but there is there is an

1082
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:22,340
increase and assuming make sense rather

1083
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:23,990
than having this fake ID update that no

1084
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:28,359
look very fake is in something like

1085
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:28,359
click once is much more effective

1086
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:37,370
do we have time on that because there's

1087
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:39,590
nobody I will interested in let me just

1088
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:43,790
add a couple of demos ready

1089
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:46,910
I can maybe just show you how easy it is

1090
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:48,380
to add a third-party extension without

1091
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:49,670
getting any warning if you're interested

1092
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:57,980
if you want to leave I know you might be

1093
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:58,700
angry I don't mind if you want to look

1094
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:03,050
at this

1095
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:04,790
so I created just a profile Firefox

1096
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:06,230
profile for just for sauce because I

1097
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:12,730
don't want to mess up with mine when I

1098
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:23,110
was testing okay sweets in the Uptown

1099
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:23,110
warming Mozilla Firefox and Miren

1100
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:35,819
[Music]

1101
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:38,100
okay and that's good so I actually tried

1102
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:40,470
this le vide player and that that was

1103
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:42,450
showing screenshots and I did a custom

1104
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:46,100
installation what I said don't want the

1105
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:48,930
ask toolbar and where it is actually

1106
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:52,259
actually actually installed it on all my

1107
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:55,259
profiles and but because they didn't go

1108
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:56,640
the extra mile and change the database

1109
00:53:55,260 --> 00:54:01,470
I'm actually prompted so I'm going to

1110
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:04,290
say no I don't want to use it so you see

1111
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:10,319
add-ons I okay and it's remove this one

1112
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:19,470
this was before okay so this is what I

1113
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:21,570
have so here quick demo so you will add

1114
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:23,189
this type of stuff to your to executive

1115
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:25,320
order if you see without the window that

1116
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:27,390
shows what you're doing so you can look

1117
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:29,730
for the profile at an on location under

1118
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:32,069
your user directory then you can

1119
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:35,460
enumerate all a different profile so I

1120
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:38,010
was only interested in this one I'm

1121
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:41,580
going to add some running from here and

1122
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:46,070
I'm just going to copy this folder which

1123
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:50,910
contain the browser extension into my

1124
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:53,760
source extension so that's what the

1125
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:57,120
application was doing okay then look at

1126
00:54:53,760 --> 00:55:02,010
the extension that it is that's again

1127
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:08,930
known on location doesn't change okay so

1128
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:12,200
now I'm done I can just show you quickly

1129
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:12,200
the code

1130
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:20,130
where is it

1131
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:28,550
look at maybe I show you later now if

1132
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:32,839
you look under my profile and source

1133
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:37,280
profile you will see an extension is 7/5

1134
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:39,109
stuff that I show you is here and so

1135
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,579
remember for I feel it to last bar that

1136
00:55:39,109 --> 00:55:45,710
did the same thing but didn't change the

1137
00:55:40,579 --> 00:55:47,240
database so now if I run and if it

1138
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:55,130
doesn't work and we look like a fool but

1139
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:57,618
let's try right nothing no new plugin we

1140
00:55:55,130 --> 00:56:00,170
actually look and they're add-ons you

1141
00:55:57,619 --> 00:56:03,920
see here again just find the name so

1142
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:06,770
people don't actually remove it that

1143
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:08,690
Jelena I installed and if you and I did

1144
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:10,579
something very simple I so if you look

1145
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:13,280
at everything now again you can you can

1146
00:56:10,579 --> 00:56:15,559
you can see it but the homepage it's not

1147
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:18,500
dealer who credited its Madeira so it

1148
00:56:15,559 --> 00:56:20,569
looks like an official plugin if we do

1149
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:23,839
not remove it people where is it and

1150
00:56:20,569 --> 00:56:25,089
this tree is doing is just what they do

1151
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:28,910
for this one

1152
00:56:25,089 --> 00:56:30,980
whenever I browse I can notice whenever

1153
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:32,180
I was just sending you all to to my

1154
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:33,859
server so I know what the user is doing

1155
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:36,379
this work for looking for the first

1156
00:56:33,859 --> 00:56:40,759
three login and password that the user

1157
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:44,569
said and send it to to a server so it's

1158
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:46,690
very easy completely silent and Firefox

1159
00:56:44,569 --> 00:56:49,759
doesn't have any protection for that and

1160
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:51,859
that know the strength and the force of

1161
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,599
Firefox is that they're very open so

1162
00:56:51,859 --> 00:56:55,250
anybody can hack look into the database

1163
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:57,530
but now you can do it for good to learn

1164
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:59,930
how Firefox works and you can do it for

1165
00:56:57,530 --> 00:57:01,970
dad I was trying to do the same thing

1166
00:56:59,930 --> 00:57:05,419
with a coffee route where they store the

1167
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:07,189
information for the database but for the

1168
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:08,930
extension to see if I could Nielsen mine

1169
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:10,790
there was much much harder and it have

1170
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:18,098
time to even find out where it is we

1171
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:18,099
should spend more time okay thanks

1172
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:25,179
