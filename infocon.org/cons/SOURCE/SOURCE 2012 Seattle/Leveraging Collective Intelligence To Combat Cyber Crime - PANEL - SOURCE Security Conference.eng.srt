1
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:12,830
to do is as we talked about these things

2
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,629
if you have questions don't hold them

3
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,520
till the end you just stopped us because

4
00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:18,560
I think this ought to be more

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,180
interactive than anything else everybody

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,740
has got an opinion on this these kinds

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,680
of things if they know we're here to

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,839
talk about everybody's looking at their

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,420
program real quick all right this is

10
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,710
information sharing and so the federal

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,570
government talks about public-private

12
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,430
partnerships and information sharing all

13
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,170
the time seems to have cracked the code

14
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:38,030
on neither so that's what we're gonna

15
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,670
discuss information sharing across

16
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:43,640
public/private lines within a sector

17
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:45,949
across levels of government is applied

18
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,299
to a certain number of use cases so my

19
00:00:45,949 --> 00:00:48,530
name is Mike Hamilton and I'm the

20
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:52,070
information security officer for the

21
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:54,470
city so we protect your electricity

22
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:56,360
clean water sewage disposal Public

23
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:58,699
Safety law enforcement transportation

24
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,350
management and then we worry about

25
00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:04,729
credit cards and other detritus like

26
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:06,710
that my esteemed panel who I'm going to

27
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:08,360
let do their own BIOS I'm gonna

28
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,649
introduce them very briefly this is Ken

29
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,929
Ken lock who is the chief information

30
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:14,000
security officer of Boeing credit union

31
00:01:11,929 --> 00:01:15,890
Boeing employees credit union even

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,789
though non Boeing employees can be part

33
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,219
of your credit unit is that correct

34
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:21,439
that's correct okay this is Carol

35
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:23,119
Thompson Carol is the IT director of

36
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,089
seattle City Light the 10th largest

37
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:31,009
energy utility in the United States and

38
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:37,219
I think one of two that is one of we

39
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:38,810
bring you light one of two that is under

40
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:41,329
the purview of municipal government of

41
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:45,439
local government it's it's it's us it's

42
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:52,939
Austin and were there any others so this

43
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:55,779
is rare and rot you're the CEO CTO of

44
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:59,559
internet identity down in Tacoma and

45
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:02,420
these guys have some very interesting

46
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,709
managed services that play right into

47
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,719
the information sharing space and

48
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:07,219
getting up to collective intelligence so

49
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:08,810
Ken talk about your bio a little bit I'm

50
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:10,910
gonna ask you to do one thing I'm gonna

51
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:14,319
ask you tell everybody something about

52
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,319
yourself has nothing to do with security

53
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:20,840
okay there is nothing like that so Ken

54
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:21,350
Ken lock information security at BCU I'm

55
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,150
also

56
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:25,370
possible for corporate insurance

57
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:29,570
everything except for employee benefits

58
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:31,580
and business continuity been in the

59
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:34,609
industry you know many years maybe as

60
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:36,650
many as 20 and come from a very

61
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:39,410
technical background

62
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:44,510
mostly building networks and that kind

63
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:47,260
of thing you really got me with that

64
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:50,600
something that's not about security you

65
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:54,140
ski naked anything ya know something

66
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,930
interesting I show Scottish terrier dogs

67
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:59,059

Best in Show and that's why you got into

70
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,760
isn't it okay Carol and I'm Carol

71
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:10,400
Thompson I'm the director for city

72
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,200
lights IT department and we have about a

73
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,470
hundred and eleven people on staff that

74
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,570
cover everything from poor application

75
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:20,150
development supporting the public until

76
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:23,269
public utility as well as network

77
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:26,210
infrastructure security the whole gamut

78
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:28,190
I am highly untechnical so that's why I

79
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:30,350
braced myself between two technical and

80
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:32,120
smart people but we do have a lot of use

81
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,920
cases and such that have happened with

82
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,830
the utility that may be of interest

83
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,450
today and so the one non security

84
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,430
related thing there are so many to

85
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:42,290
choose from but I'm meeting this

86
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:51,170
afternoon with my daughter who's on the

87
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:53,780
New Zealand roller derby circuit throw

88
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:56,239
an elbow every once in a while

89
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,460
hi I'm rod Rasmussen president and CTO

90
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,430
of internet identity we're an Internet

91
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:03,560
security company do lots of things

92
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:05,300
mainly around finding identifying and

93
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,950
shutting down evil things on the

94
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,350
internet for your definition of evil

95
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:12,019
which is what I think most civilized

96
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:13,460
society considers evil to and we're

97
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:17,690
doing a lot of things in the information

98
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:20,120
sharing space as far as enabling various

99
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,890
companies and government etcetera to

100
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,780
share some things back and forth with

101
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:25,550
each other around what's happening and

102
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:28,460
creating some situational awareness and

103
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:30,770
trying to do that in real time so and

104
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,638
I'm you know I did this to Michael on a

105
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,710
panel I had him

106
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:37,520
a while ago said and that what I talked

107
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:39,438
about wine I so something probably

108
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,210
almost nobody in this industry knows

109
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:44,270
about me is I'm actually an avid model

110
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:45,770
railroad guy yeah except I have no

111
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:48,289
railroad setup or anything I just have

112
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,448
boxes and boxes of trains that I've

113
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:51,770
collected over the years

114
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:52,789
stuffed away in storage in the Attic

115
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,430
because you know after you move a couple

116
00:04:52,789 --> 00:04:56,330
of times it's really hard to and running

117
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,430
a business and things like that

118
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:01,128
doing setting up Ola out it's pretty

119
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:03,349
tough to get done so maybe one day when

120
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:05,449
I retire from this stuff we'll have some

121
00:05:03,349 --> 00:05:06,319
massive thing going there you go yeah I

122
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:08,689
think we're all looking forward to

123
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:11,629
blowing off these techno so that means

124
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:18,349
that we have to ask rod is this a

125
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:23,289
railroad symbol in the yeah yeah they're

126
00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:23,289
like a hypnosis wheel or something okay

127
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:39,349
is that sure to the pack does that swag

128
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:41,150
from the conference okay so let's talk

129
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:44,180
briefly about the evolution of

130
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:45,438
information-sharing at least in the

131
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,509
definition I'm gonna make up for you

132
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,149
right now so in the beginning there were

133
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:55,009
skips everybody know what a skip is

134
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:56,839
right great guess great guess it is a

135
00:05:55,009 --> 00:06:00,020
secure compartmented information

136
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:05,389
facility right that's where you'd

137
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:09,378
receive classified information and then

138
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:12,080
when we started to actually employ a lot

139
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:13,129
of computing and needed to tell one

140
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,359
another about some things that we're

141
00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:16,430
going on we would use our trusted

142
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,899
networks and so think of that as three

143
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:20,830
guys in a room discussing what happened

144
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:23,960
last week right just people you trust

145
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:27,169
and that kind of evolved into portals

146
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:29,239
and we have stuff like the homeland

147
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:32,000
security information network which

148
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:35,000
distributes a lot of information and we

149
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,069
ended up with ice axe right I sac

150
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,069
information-sharing an analysis Center

151
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:46,920
and there's this new meme that has

152
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:49,170
kind of taking on a life of its own and

153
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,270
started to show some value and called

154
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,580
collective intelligence anybody familiar

155
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,780
with that term collective intelligence

156
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:57,270
okay

157
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:59,309
ideally that's something that would the

158
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:01,620
abstraction of it is you're always

159
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:03,690
telling everybody what happens to you

160
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,660
because then everybody else can leverage

161
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:08,940
that event to better protect themselves

162
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:13,200
or to better understand the severity of

163
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:14,969
an event and so there are some methods

164
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,469
and services evolving to take advantage

165
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,580
of that for example there's one called

166
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:20,280
sip the collective intelligence

167
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:22,590
framework that was developed by the the

168
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:26,849
Ren I sack of research and education

169
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:27,810
network I sac so does anybody want to

170
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:30,150
add anything to that

171
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:32,580
Mike I think you should explain what the

172
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:34,799
Renault psychos so the rent I sack is

173
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,200
one of this collection of ice acts and

174
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,420
there is not one for every sector in the

175
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,520
in the parlance of homeland security

176
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:43,740
there are 18 critical sectors dams

177
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,539
energy water blah blah blah blah about

178
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,930
finance sorry

179
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:51,150
and many of those have an information

180
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:53,970
sharing an analysis center so there's

181
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:55,380
the FSI sack there's the r ni sack for

182
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:57,900
research and education network

183
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:59,640
there's the multi-state I sac for state

184
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:04,020
local tribal and territorial governments

185
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:05,969
primarily and some of those work better

186
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,370
than others I think actually the FSI

187
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,870
sack is the one that works the best the

188
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,010
rent I sack by virtue of the fact that

189
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,450
they're doing all this development and

190
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:17,039
making this free to the communities I

191
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:20,190
think is is wonderful work so let's do

192
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,360
this I would point out too that there

193
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,290
are a lot of other organizations that

194
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,570
are out there trying to share

195
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:27,660
information you may be familiar with

196
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:29,790
team comer e shadows server right

197
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,710
characters like that or trying to

198
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:34,680
aggregate everything that they can in an

199
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:36,059
open source capacity and share that back

200
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,890
out to the network so that everybody has

201
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:41,520
better informed that's kind of

202
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:44,640
collective intelligence so what I like

203
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,140
to do is I would like to go down a

204
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,449
number of threats that we're all

205
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,710
familiar with and I would like to talk

206
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:52,380
about two things that would like to have

207
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:55,350
the panel talk about two things number

208
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:57,689
one where would you find out about

209
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,580
current activity with respect to this

210
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:01,500
threat where would you go for that

211
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:04,650
information to better inform yourself

212
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,480
and number two who would you tell if

213
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:08,069
something happened to you where would

214
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,990
you put that piece of information so

215
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:13,350
that others could benefit from the

216
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:15,930
experience you just had alright let's

217
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:19,760
start with one that I think is near and

218
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:22,739
dear to your heart phishing smishing

219
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,110
largely that stuff is oriented towards

220
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:29,940
acquiring credentials for financial

221
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:32,520
logins as you find out so we we find out

222
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,380
through our members we don't call them

223
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,680
customers but the members of the credit

224
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:40,170
union largely that is how we we we find

225
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,800
out they report to us that they're

226
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:46,140
receiving a text message an email but

227
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,229
today it's really it's really either a

228
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:52,800
phone call or a text message is the the

229
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:54,900
bane of that existence today that's

230
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,670
largely how we always find out there are

231
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,980
a couple other channels but that's the

232
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,959
the majority of it and what do we do

233
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,450
with it we need partners we need

234
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,850
information sharing because these things

235
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:08,010
often the traditional fishing is really

236
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:10,620
easy easily understood right there's a

237
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,970
there's a server somewhere that this is

238
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:16,200
going to the link and the email is going

239
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:17,700
to end up at and so we need information

240
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,290
and then we need partners to help take

241
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:24,870
that down particularly when there's an

242
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:29,400
international play beyond that there's

243
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:30,990
the anti-phishing working group so you

244
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,060
know in phishing we kind of got there

245
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:37,380
with email but we have a new battle to

246
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:43,109
fight in the in the text and and text

247
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:45,960
and smartphone who would you tell you

248
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:49,320
just you just got targeted in a BECU

249
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,910
specific credit union phishing attack or

250
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,140
you or your members were targeted yeah

251
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,050
so one that make any sense to tell

252
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,189
anybody well it well regular

253
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:57,569
regulatorily we have to talk to the

254
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,790
state of Washington the Department of

255
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:02,040
Finance and we also have to put our

256
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,780
insurer on notice beyond that it's

257
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,140
whoever we would think would make sense

258
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:07,920
so the anti-phishing working group and

259
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,689
potentially partners that are going to

260
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,959
help us take down those the

261
00:11:09,689 --> 00:11:14,969
those things phishing is mainly a

262
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,899
financial thing but Carol we have seen

263
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:20,579
this as well largely when when this

264
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:23,040
happens to us they're trying to get our

265
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:26,339
domain logins and we have seen this

266
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,589
targeted against energy utility assets

267
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:30,540
right which get your attention let me

268
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:33,449
tell you right so one of the experiences

269
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,610
that we had just recently was that our

270
00:11:33,449 --> 00:11:39,329
power marketers who are trading and

271
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:42,149
buying selling and trading energy were

272
00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:44,219
targeted with phishing attacks and they

273
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:46,769
were able to get the hackers were able

274
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,749
to get their names and understand what

275
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:50,689
their job was within the utility just

276
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:54,290
because our folks were listed in the

277
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:56,610
publicly available directories and so

278
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:58,439
you know that's just kind of we were

279
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:00,360
thinking more customer service oriented

280
00:11:58,439 --> 00:12:02,429
letting people know who we are where we

281
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,869
are how to get ahold of us but we got a

282
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:07,319
little sharp slap at the face on that

283
00:12:03,869 --> 00:12:09,269
one to realize that there are much

284
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:11,248
targeted much more targeted attacks than

285
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:12,959
what we were expecting so what we ended

286
00:12:11,249 --> 00:12:16,110
up doing is we took all of the available

287
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:18,748
information public facing off any kind

288
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:22,049
of website or directory for our power

289
00:12:18,749 --> 00:12:24,089
marketers and it's really important for

290
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:26,490
us to make sure that the power marketers

291
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:28,499
understood the vulnerabilities so that

292
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:31,100
they were not clicking on links I mean

293
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:33,299
they're very good at what they do but

294
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,850
Internet Security is not one of their

295
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:38,879
strong points nor as logical email

296
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:41,970
management one of their strong points so

297
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:44,189
what we did was we educated them we gave

298
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:46,709
them talking points to talk through with

299
00:12:44,189 --> 00:12:48,389
other power marketing agencies because

300
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:51,359
all of the utilities most of the

301
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:53,970
utilities have some form of power

302
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,249
management area there that they would be

303
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:58,860
working with and so they became the

304
00:12:56,249 --> 00:13:01,199
community that was actually sharing with

305
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,089
others about where the the emails were

306
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:06,059
coming from what kinds of words were in

307
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:09,809
the header and the subject and so forth

308
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:13,290
so we used feet on the street and mouths

309
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:15,629
on the telephones to get our message out

310
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:17,099
are you required to tell Newark about

311
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:19,169
things like that if you feel that you

312
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:22,110
have been very power marketers so that

313
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:22,949
you know right we have extra power

314
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,450
there's a lot of

315
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:26,400
no we're making powers Southern

316
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:28,080
California's out we have to negotiate a

317
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,790
whole bunch of things for Bonneville to

318
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,040
open up transmission lines to get it

319
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:35,550
down there that's power marketing has

320
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,270
nothing to it billboards sorry really

321
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:39,990
okay

322
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:42,300
so so we have we're heavily regulated

323
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:45,720
with national energy reliance

324
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,939
corporation and we do not have to tell

325
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,970
them if we are targeted necessarily but

326
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:52,920
we do have to tell them if we have been

327
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:54,600
exposed in any if we get viruses on our

328
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,420
machines and so forth if they actually

329
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:00,450
click on the links and and compromise

330
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:04,680
any aspect of a trade because they do do

331
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:07,040
the trades via email in some cases and

332
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,599
through text messaging instant messaging

333
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,130
but the trade itself does not do that

334
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,810
but there's enough information in the

335
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:19,590
tree about the trade that could be

336
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:22,199
compromised so you've brought a topic

337
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:24,300
that is you know our company basically

338
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,970
started in the security side of things

339
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,920
on fishing and dealing with that and it

340
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,700
has evolved tremendously and I think

341
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,650
there's a couple of different issues

342
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,960
that that actually have already surfaced

343
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:35,579
here it's it's vectors or changing

344
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,830
techniques are changing targeting is

345
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:40,350
changing it's constantly changing

346
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:43,440
I also think that that the fishing in

347
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:47,970
itself and within the leadership of the

348
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,710
AP aPWG myself we have that has been a

349
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:52,500
big success story as far as information

350
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:54,720
sharing goes in the basic form of

351
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,690
classic fishing where you have some of

352
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,820
you send something that a lure it looks

353
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:01,080
like a bank or an online service or

354
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:05,250
something like that and they're trying

355
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:07,200
to gather your credentials right and so

356
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,270
we find out about things and actually

357
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,950
ironically largely our customers who we

358
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:12,930
work for and do shut down and things for

359
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,940
tell us about most of the stuff because

360
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:16,500
their customers are clued into this but

361
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,940
a lot of stuff we still get from sharing

362
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,160
between other partners and things like

363
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:23,130
that a lot of the email providers the

364
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,800
anti-spam vendors feed into this system

365
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:27,689
right so they've detect phishing URLs

366
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,120
with an email streams are going out that

367
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:31,560
gets pushed in we'll we'll pick up on

368
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,360
that and then go with it from there and

369
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,800
then of course we feed back from things

370
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,510
we get to our customers in that system

371
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,849
nice thing about that too

372
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:40,650
that that it's a feedback loop where and

373
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:44,430
I spam companies and all the major

374
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:46,079
browser manufacturers have systems to

375
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:48,060
instantly block that stuff so we're

376
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:50,190
getting near real-time I mean call it

377
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:52,739
real-time called near real-time as far

378
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:53,970
as detection of some sort of traditional

379
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,610
fishing at least and getting that

380
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:59,220
blocked and it be easier with an email

381
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:01,470
or within the browser so the customers

382
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,970
are protected and that's a really

383
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:04,410
important reason and an incentive for

384
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,360
people are you know especially our

385
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:08,160
customers to make sure that they're

386
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,480
reporting that and because it can

387
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,250
actually protect customers through that

388
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,990
collective intelligence

389
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,850
things are changing though I were you

390
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:15,990
seeing techniques are being used which

391
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,670
aren't traditional fishing they're

392
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:19,820
actually just trying to exploit your

393
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:22,589
computer and get malware on them well

394
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:24,150
various browser people won't don't

395
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:26,520
classify that as phishing so they don't

396
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,990
block those there's there so there's a

397
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,810
there's a hole in the system in that

398
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:33,750
regard there's a policy hole they will

399
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:34,859
use one-time use URLs so it defeats the

400
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,710
technical measures that we've

401
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,390
implemented you're also seeing this

402
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:42,180
targeted stuff going on our spearfishing

403
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:44,220
is the Perl any of the opponents of the

404
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:46,319
industry and that's also interesting

405
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,240
because oftentimes people don't want

406
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,350
that report it necessarily and we see

407
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,590
that it's been particularly when it's

408
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:53,760
targeting government officials or

409
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:55,950
high-ranking executives at major

410
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,260
financial institutions don't want to

411
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:59,610
share this kind of specialized stuff out

412
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,470
to the rest of the community that's a

413
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:03,020
challenge for us because obviously if

414
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:05,490
we're sharing techniques across the

415
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:07,709
spectrum we can it's the same groups

416
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:10,050
doing this right there's only a few bad

417
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:12,089
few groups of bad guys out there using

418
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:15,419
these specialized techniques but because

419
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:16,829
of its deemed sensitive we're seeing

420
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,480
some with some reluctance to sharing

421
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:20,339
that kind of stuff so it's we've seen

422
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,740
this evolution and it's it's actually I

423
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:24,510
think accelerating in new methodologies

424
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,250
and things like that that are going on

425
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:28,410
measures and countermeasures are

426
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:32,060
becoming much more rapidly developed and

427
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:34,320
deployed you know one thing that I

428
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:36,060
didn't put on the agenda to talk about

429
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,040
but I'm gonna say a little bit about is

430
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:41,850
this reluctance of the private sector to

431
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:43,690
share information because puts companies

432
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:46,389
at a competitive disadvantage

433
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:49,960
and just real briefly I will tell you

434
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:52,690
that I got Carol to stand in at the last

435
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,210
moment because we had someone else from

436
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:57,100
the private sector whose company is so

437
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:58,510
anti information sharing they wouldn't

438
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,100
even let him sit on a panel to talk

439
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,590
about information sharing and I'm not

440
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:06,550
making that up

441
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:08,590
no no I wouldn't tell you what it was

442
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:13,240
okay so fishing that's kind of to the

443
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:15,909
iceberg I'm gonna skip email getting

444
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,650
email you know we get that the email

445
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:20,140
security has become so commoditized I

446
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:21,610
think that's internally there's enough

447
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,980
stuff being shared where everybody's

448
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:27,010
informed about you know bad email fairly

449
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:28,510
quickly we all agree yeah and and if you

450
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:31,600
look at the numbers of spam it's it's

451
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:33,660
the the bra volume has gone way down

452
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,560
[Music]

453
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:39,580
yeah don't get me started on some of

454
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:42,000
those actions though although on email

455
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:45,790
and it's done information sharing but

456
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,230
DKIM and and SPF right I mean we got to

457
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,909
have it we got to do these we got to

458
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:57,070
continue to do those kind of things to

459
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:59,860
keep that at bay so let's talk about

460
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:04,120
something that's one of my favorites is

461
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:08,830
the fifty thousand a day compromised

462
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:11,260
websites that build in redirects inject

463
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:13,149
redirects so you go to golf swing comm

464
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:15,820
and you don't know that you're being you

465
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:18,190
know attack sideways from Kazakhstan we

466
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:21,070
pick up a hundred and fifty of these a

467
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:23,400
week that our URL filtering and content

468
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:26,110
management technology doesn't know about

469
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,820
we find them in there and we got a guy

470
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:29,740
whose track and organized crime Network

471
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:31,810
so we have blocked so much logical real

472
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:33,130
estate in some countries that if

473
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:37,000
anybody's out there planning a trip to

474
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:39,100
Seattle they're out of luck but so this

475
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,990
this thing about compromises so we find

476
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:46,209
bad URLs right clearly our technology

477
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,950
vendors are our main source of that

478
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:49,270
information and you know you don't have

479
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:51,580
to identify who your vendors are here

480
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:54,340
but you know tell me something about

481
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:57,129
where you get that info and who you tell

482
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:59,020
and how how easy is it or not

483
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,400
to report that information up to

484
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:04,240
somebody who can make use of it to

485
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:07,540
protect the rest of the community well

486
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:10,270
for city light we report it to him so

487
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:12,040
we're in very very good shape but I

488
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:15,610
think one of the things that limits us

489
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:17,889
is the ability to just not get

490
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:19,449
information fast enough you don't have

491
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:21,220
people that are aware throughout the

492
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:23,560
organization of what has just happened

493
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,750
to them and if they see it they're not

494
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:30,040
well enough educated in many cases in

495
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:32,260
this topic to be able to recognize it

496
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:36,310
for what it is and report it back up so

497
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:38,379
we're delayed until we can get some of

498
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:40,030
the logs read and verified and it just

499
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:42,300
it just doesn't happen quickly enough

500
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:46,720
you know if we could in some way adopt a

501
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:48,580
Facebook type mentality for how to share

502
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:53,410
this information without compromising

503
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:55,600
ourselves it would be ideal I could I

504
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:57,400
could speak to this for probably a two

505
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,310
hour pair our view is individual session

506
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,960
on my own okay because we got people

507
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:03,490
sitting in front of screens identifying

508
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,010
this kind of stuff as part of what we

509
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:07,630
got services we offer but it's hard

510
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:10,030
especially lately you've got a lot of

511
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:12,420
automation going on where the bad guys

512
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:15,310
have tools now that they can basically

513
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:17,470
go across the internet we using what we

514
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:20,440
call Google dorks or over here which is

515
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:22,390
basically looking at various patterns

516
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:25,000
that will appear on vulnerable websites

517
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:28,570
and being able to to zero it on those

518
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,950
and automatically exploit them and you

519
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:32,889
see I mentioned earlier we had that

520
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:35,440
policy issue where where for certain

521
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:37,150
kinds of abuse things will get blocked

522
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,560
automatically for other kinds of abuse

523
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:41,650
that haven't been defined from a policy

524
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,240
perspective they won't you know but

525
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:45,010
we're actually the few if you take a

526
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,420
step back the the industry is largely

527
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:52,930
reliant upon a few big vendors that be

528
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:56,200
you know Microsoft and Google and some

529
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:58,150
of the big ISPs but those Facebook and

530
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,670
some of the more the social networks

531
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:03,730
those folks are all investing a lot into

532
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:05,920
actually trying to do automate a lot of

533
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:08,800
this kind of stuff one of the challenges

534
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:13,150
is when you get reports in from the pub

535
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:15,790
like a lot of is unusable or inaccurate

536
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:17,800
or disinformation on top of that that's

537
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:19,389
always a big concern but even more than

538
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,620
this information is just people clicking

539
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:21,880
on something they don't like they got a

540
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,050
message from somebody was probably

541
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,360
legitimate they probably signed up for

542
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:27,639
it they click on it as being evil

543
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,830
phishing spam and it's really just the

544
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,890
latest marketing offering and as a

545
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:35,620
corporate entity with very deep pockets

546
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:38,140
like Google or Microsoft they're very

547
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,820
risk-averse into fully automating and

548
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:43,060
doing things because of the risk of

549
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:45,399
somebody saying you blocked my my web my

550
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:47,889
web shop and I lost 10 million dollars

551
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,450
in transactions you know that kind of

552
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:51,100
stuff so there's there's this balancing

553
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:54,850
act that you run into so it makes it

554
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:56,980
very hard and then you know I think that

555
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:58,389
other industries have have that feedback

556
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,310
mechanism I mean I think you may have

557
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,660
that on the list or for example av and

558
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,919
some of the other places like that where

559
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,690
you actually have reporting

560
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:14,410
infrastructures it's very hard on the

561
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:16,420
website to actually do that typical in

562
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:18,490
this the space where we're reliant on

563
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:20,800
the vendors but you know we're an

564
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:23,590
approximate environment to being an NFI

565
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:28,389
and so we're largely relying on them for

566
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:31,510
for the list of bad URLs but it clearly

567
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:35,790
is is slightly behind this list right

568
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:39,490
and we see this manifests itself in

569
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:42,340
watching the logs for our online banking

570
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:45,060
environment or our brochure site even if

571
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:47,560
you will and we can see URL injection

572
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:49,750
and they're getting very sophisticated

573
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:51,700
in the URL injection that they're doing

574
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:54,520
so this means that that phishing emails

575
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:56,710
still continue to have them with with

576
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:59,500
links in them not necessarily for just

577
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:01,300
pure fishing anymore but they're doing

578
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,490
some URL injection and when you try to

579
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:05,889
follow those links well you might end up

580
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:08,700
on you know maybe the the Google toolbar

581
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:11,470
installer or some other you know

582
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:13,510
innocuous thing so where do I report

583
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:15,400
that and that's one of the reasons why I

584
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:17,320
was interested in this panel is because

585
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,240
what do I do with that do I just give it

586
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,189
to my firewall vendor is that enough

587
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,509
right how do we how are we going to

588
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:25,479
solve some of these problems because

589
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:26,949
as as we see them you know the

590
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:29,709
information that we get may not be

591
00:24:26,949 --> 00:24:32,169
actionable for us right I can't get this

592
00:24:29,709 --> 00:24:33,999
into to the browsers I can't get it into

593
00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:37,119
that list I don't have any direct input

594
00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:39,789
to that but I'm getting information that

595
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:42,968
is actionable right talked about fishing

596
00:24:39,789 --> 00:24:45,339
we get reports that well I got a text

597
00:24:42,969 --> 00:24:47,589
message it came from this number well

598
00:24:45,339 --> 00:24:49,059
okay the numbers spoofed so I can't even

599
00:24:47,589 --> 00:24:51,219
figure out which carrier I would want to

600
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:52,809
give it to and even if I could and I

601
00:24:51,219 --> 00:24:57,399
called them up are they gonna respond to

602
00:24:52,809 --> 00:24:59,469
me and the number was spoofed so you

603
00:24:57,399 --> 00:25:00,758
know it's not actionable for me but

604
00:24:59,469 --> 00:25:02,319
there must be somebody who can take

605
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:04,869
action and we've got to get better at

606
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:06,190
this and the the public private things

607
00:25:04,869 --> 00:25:10,359
that we've talked about some of the the

608
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:12,729
ice acts they move very slowly and so I

609
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:14,739
wanted to make sure that we all you know

610
00:25:12,729 --> 00:25:17,679
are mindful that that the the folks

611
00:25:14,739 --> 00:25:19,059
behind this have no rules and we have to

612
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,099
look by the rules but we have to

613
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:23,408
continue to get creative and get faster

614
00:25:21,099 --> 00:25:26,198
at this so and they also move very

615
00:25:23,409 --> 00:25:27,489
quickly they do right I mean because I

616
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:30,759
mean to the some points that were made

617
00:25:27,489 --> 00:25:33,219
earlier today at another meeting the

618
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:35,049
attack takes that long after all the

619
00:25:33,219 --> 00:25:38,769
reconnaissance and everything the attack

620
00:25:35,049 --> 00:25:42,309
boom it's very fast and you know we need

621
00:25:38,769 --> 00:25:43,739
to be in a reactive mode in a sharing

622
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:49,739
mode to try and protect our neighbors

623
00:25:43,739 --> 00:25:49,739
far as I'm concerned okay yes

624
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:37,360
you know unfortunately a lot of stuff

625
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:41,080
gets thrown into that on categories

626
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:43,809
category and later on its found to be

627
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:46,480
fairly virulent and it's because I mean

628
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:48,158
two rods point human beings got to check

629
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:52,049
this stuff out I don't think there's

630
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,049
peer automation that can be used in that

631
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,919
there's a couple of points there yeah

632
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,270
you can use some automation to a certain

633
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:00,309
point but you have to you have to train

634
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:01,750
the the machines how to do it and they

635
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:03,760
keep morphing things right so there's

636
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:06,490
that I think there are some statistics

637
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,870
around the question you're talking about

638
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:10,690
there is where the word is this stuff

639
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:12,189
show up back when fishing started and a

640
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:13,809
lot of the original malware stuff it was

641
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:15,400
they were registering domain names and

642
00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:16,740
they were you know was and it was

643
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,510
unblocked

644
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:21,460
bulletproof hosting out of Russia so you

645
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:22,840
say okay those bad IP space is evil

646
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:24,760
anything showing up there I know it's

647
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,049
bad and those domain names being

648
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,570
registered by these good know those

649
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:29,889
techniques continue to this day but most

650
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:32,950
of the stuff that we see is on

651
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:36,130
compromised sites and worse you're

652
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:38,169
seeing a shift towards compromising ad

653
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:42,370
networks which then gets you under the

654
00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:44,350
categorize good sites right and there's

655
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:45,939
bad network guys are in denial around

656
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:48,570
this and it's a real hole we have right

657
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:52,030
now as though the whole ad network space

658
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:55,870
and and this may sound a little bit like

659
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:57,730
you know the finger in the dike but one

660
00:27:55,870 --> 00:28:00,939
of the techniques that I like to look at

661
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:07,360
is they bound traffic for anything that

662
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:08,440
I know is an ISP DHCP I just think

663
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,550
that's very interesting from my

664
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:14,270
corporation if I see

665
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:18,290
bound traffic destined to what I'm you

666
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:20,360
know 99% sure is a Comcast address at

667
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:24,649
somebody's house in Seattle that's

668
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:29,139
interesting traffic alright let's get

669
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:29,140
some good stuff here yeah question

670
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:50,900
no actually I'm surveying these guys

671
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:56,179
where do you find out Nvidia tell do you

672
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:57,320
think that scales well so you want to

673
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:00,460
take us back to three guys in the room

674
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,460
talking about what happened last week

675
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,229
well I mean it is happening right

676
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:07,460
everybody's got their trusted network

677
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:09,200
there's a ton of them but then and we

678
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:11,630
very that's a great place to share

679
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,240
techniques in information about where

680
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:17,270
stuff is going but the actual doing real

681
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:19,640
time scalable your blocking or

682
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:22,670
transmission of information you can't do

683
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:25,510
that you know that then over a trust

684
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:27,920
group it just doesn't scale no and

685
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:29,750
automation is needed here and kind of

686
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,460
where this discussion is going but but

687
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:33,740
but the intelligence thing how can it be

688
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:36,590
brought to bear on these problems number

689
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:38,270
one is we've all got to get over it did

690
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:40,879
you share information nobody's gonna

691
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:45,680
fire you especially in the public sector

692
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:49,100
right yeah Adam good to see ya any other

693
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:50,660
thoughts on that it's I'm so I want to

694
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:54,860
get this something good stuff you got it

695
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:56,720
yeah I mean we want we want and we need

696
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,969
to get there we need to do more than

697
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:04,010
technical solutions we have to find ways

698
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:06,230
to to share this information as I said

699
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:08,090
this is what I was alluding to many of

700
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:09,590
us are sitting on information that is

701
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:12,020
not actionable for us but it is

702
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:14,270
actionable for one of the other

703
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:16,310
organizations that we know and we got to

704
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:18,170
find a way to get it there right exactly

705
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:21,110
right you're dealt with it but you know

706
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:24,080
helps to help your neighbor out here so

707
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:27,709
so let's talk about

708
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:31,970
the with a buzz frayed of runs phrase of

709
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:34,610
the decade here the the apt all right so

710
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:38,180
let's I know yeah we got to do this we

711
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:40,639
got to do this so let's say let's say

712
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:43,010
you found something that was so targeted

713
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,960
and it was directed against your

714
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:46,910
intellectual property or your

715
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,940
infrastructure or something like that

716
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:53,860
and this is not the kind of thing that

717
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:56,270
is going to really help your neighbors

718
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:59,060
because this is really targeted against

719
00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:03,080
you right so now you're in a position of

720
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:06,980
having to decide who to tell for help

721
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:08,540
and it may have a regulatory impact how

722
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:10,220
do you escalate this up to the correct

723
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:14,500
level of government and/or to law

724
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:14,500
enforcement what's what is germane here

725
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,710
the definition of apt and I just went

726
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,930
through when I said you found something

727
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:28,910
that's on your network that's targeted

728
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:32,180
yeah that was it that's the definition

729
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:35,480
we're going with so targeted attack and

730
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:45,890
it's inside yeah well first of all I'm

731
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:50,630
gonna call Mike yeah you know the the

732
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:52,690
honest answer for for my organization I

733
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:55,580
can't speak for the whole fi space but

734
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:59,240
is fairly prescribed with what I'm going

735
00:31:55,580 --> 00:32:01,610
to do one we have some insurance to

736
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:04,040
cover such events that is very

737
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:07,699
prescriptive in how we should deal with

738
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:09,379
that including the forensics right so

739
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:11,740
we're going to make sure that that we we

740
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:14,720
do that and we have some particular

741
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:15,980
folks we're going to work with service

742
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,040
providers that are going to help with

743
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:20,540
that but again being in that five space

744
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,250
there's a credit union we're gonna

745
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:24,770
report to the state because we're state

746
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:28,670
chartered we're also gonna report to our

747
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:31,120
insurer if we were federally insured it

748
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:33,680
it changes a little bit and if you're a

749
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:36,409
not a credit union but a retail bank if

750
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:39,590
you will the the reporting structure is

751
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:41,240
going to be you know OTC or SEC it

752
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:45,439
depends on really what section of that

753
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:47,870
Bank is involved so you know other than

754
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,590
that there's there's no requirements for

755
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:51,290
where we're going to show that

756
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:52,760
information so you got something that's

757
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:54,470
bad you don't know if you smacked it

758
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,420
down you know that it's doing something

759
00:32:54,470 --> 00:33:01,790
really bad are you gonna go ask for help

760
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:06,070
you're gonna tell law enforcement we may

761
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:08,149
engage law enforcement but you know it

762
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:09,889
depends on whether or not we think that

763
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:11,600
that we're gonna get anywhere which

764
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:13,520
which direction are we which direction

765
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,199
are we in but it was I mean we wouldn't

766
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:17,600
exclude a cover II than information

767
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,210
sharing but you know when you find

768
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,100
something it may be a good idea to put

769
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:25,730
that into some kind of national context

770
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:27,530
so that others like you can be informed

771
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:30,410
especially with indicators of compromise

772
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:33,530
if you come up with them exactly yeah so

773
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:35,930
I mean to take a step back what would be

774
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:37,730
ideal is that that we have some place

775
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:43,160
specifically to report these things we

776
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:47,120
talked about SEF right and but I'm not

777
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:57,680
sure that the FBI is that that's my

778
00:33:47,120 --> 00:34:01,280
point but yeah so for the utility we

779
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:04,550
have we have so many opportunities I'll

780
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:07,220
say to be targeted just in terms of the

781
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:10,820
type of a utility that we run and so if

782
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:13,340
we had a targeted attack I would go to

783
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:17,450
Mike and then you I'm sure we have and

784
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:20,330
we have and we would probably go up the

785
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:22,850
federal chain because we are federally

786
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:24,830
regulated I'm not sure how effective it

787
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:26,120
all could be but one of the things that

788
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:28,100
we've been doing at City Light is

789
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:30,859
working with the fusion center as well

790
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:33,290
as the FBI in helping to educate them

791
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:35,390
ahead of time as to the vulnerabilities

792
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:38,659
associated with our utility whether it's

793
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:40,609
the physical security or the digital

794
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:42,590
security it's it's been important for us

795
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:44,830
to help get them more educated so that

796
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:46,790
they can help here

797
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:50,600
what's going on in the rest of the

798
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:51,020
nation in the world and correlate some

799
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,299
of the thing

800
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:55,850
that they here and get it back into some

801
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:58,970
kind of a oh I thought about you first

802
00:34:55,850 --> 00:35:01,480
when I heard blah blah blah so you know

803
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:04,730
I think for us that's a really positive

804
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:06,560
collaboration because we can't be on top

805
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:08,960
of everything that's happening nor can

806
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:12,049
they but it's one more set of ears that

807
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,570
that can listen to what their expert at

808
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:16,130
and then translate into something that

809
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,140
we're expert at which is not the

810
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:22,520
security portion of it but more the

811
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:23,900
running of the utility so we're kind of

812
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,120
on the other side of it where we are

813
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:28,670
taking reports from people so if you get

814
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:31,250
get one of these let us know because

815
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:34,310
we're we have the ability to then share

816
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:36,770
that with other people to help you know

817
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:37,759
block those kinds of attacks I mean one

818
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:40,790
thing I think that's important to

819
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,770
remember is targeted attacks are not as

820
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:44,390
targeted as you think typically you're

821
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:46,580
not just the only one that's going to be

822
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:50,720
be hit by these guys whoever these guys

823
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:52,430
are and and you also have this issue of

824
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,439
what with what was the attack

825
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:56,029
methodology what were they going after

826
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:59,240
trying to figure out those kinds of

827
00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:02,540
things and then responding in kind a lot

828
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:04,430
of this you know a lot of the apt has

829
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:05,540
become to mean many different things to

830
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:07,100
many different people depending on who

831
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,870
you're talking to

832
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:10,310
one of the definitions well the common

833
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:14,960
definitions is it's state-sponsored

834
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:17,740
stuff right that stuff is really a lot

835
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,450
bigger than you think it is I mean the

836
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:21,859
hyperbole and the in the press I don't

837
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:23,899
know if that's if it's good if it's

838
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:25,580
actually covering it off though the ties

839
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:27,200
between what we're seeing attacking

840
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:29,360
energy sector versus the financial

841
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,460
sector versus the government sector that

842
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:33,350
a lot of it leads back to there's a very

843
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:36,200
same places and it's coming out of the

844
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:37,910
same places but in the in in there as

845
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,319
well as a bunch of more and more comedy

846
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:40,850
crime stuff where they're just trying to

847
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:43,070
get stuff on their systems or to be able

848
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:44,210
to to extract information out so you

849
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:46,520
don't and then you have the whole

850
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:49,250
anarchist groups right which is great

851
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:51,140
cover for everybody else out there so

852
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:53,570
you don't necessarily know what and why

853
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:55,819
if you're if you if you user database

854
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:56,480
ends up on a spin that was probably an

855
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,670
anarchist

856
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:02,079
right probably not necessarily but

857
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:04,820
probably anarchist yeah hacktivists type

858
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,500
but a lot of this stuff and the

859
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:08,750
techniques are being used in the same

860
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,970
places the same we just had a there was

861
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:14,720
a great report from Symantec out last

862
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:17,589
week remember the new what do big boom

863
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:21,740
call see that would cuddle what's that

864
00:37:17,589 --> 00:37:23,630
no it was it was actually the a little

865
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:25,640
brewery or something that it basically

866
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:28,310
tied everything they went on with Aurora

867
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:31,400
Aurora and Google it's really hot all

868
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:33,130
right well right but it was it tied all

869
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:39,670
these things together with that

870
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:45,950
elderberry Elderwood over 100 yes

871
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:47,750
networks knows the berries so yeah and

872
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:49,310
and we've seen this a lot and kind of

873
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:50,750
the infrastructure stuff we look at is

874
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:52,099
that these things are all tied together

875
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:55,160
and they've been going on for years

876
00:37:52,099 --> 00:37:56,540
literally so kind of keeping it close to

877
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:59,598
the vest isn't really helpful because

878
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:01,550
you your neighbors and are all getting

879
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:03,200
hit by the same thing I'm going to be

880
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:04,579
beneficial for everybody to actually

881
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,710
know about these things and be able to

882
00:38:04,579 --> 00:38:08,329
do something about them so but there

883
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:11,390
isn't there are mechanisms for it

884
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:13,640
there's some work being done in the FBI

885
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:15,230
like NC FTA folks are looking at this

886
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:21,560
stuff but they're a bit of a black hole

887
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:22,940
as well you have to yeah there's a two

888
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,440
way and it's kind of end up being one of

889
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:26,410
the vendors you know various vendors

890
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:30,890
I know semantics or McAfee and all the

891
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:32,750
folks they have stuff they deploy so if

892
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:34,609
you report it to all of them then

893
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:36,380
they'll all have something that can

894
00:38:34,609 --> 00:38:38,299
maybe help you with but they're not

895
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,740
they're only so good at sharing that

896
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,380
information back and forth amongst each

897
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:43,729
other i okay so let's get on this topic

898
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:46,760
here because I think this is a big deal

899
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:50,990
this how to inform the vendors of things

900
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:54,200
that you have found right so we're by no

901
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:56,359
virustotal right virustotal you put some

902
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:59,750
stuff in there three of the vendors

903
00:38:56,359 --> 00:39:03,020
figure it out and the other you know 39

904
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:04,880
don't they get informed right here's a

905
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:06,259
piece of malware you didn't get so

906
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,060
figure it out and get a signature out

907
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,950
for this that actually works pretty well

908
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:11,750
if it's working as advertised

909
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:14,089
and I don't know that I can confirm that

910
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:15,680
I do okay

911
00:39:14,089 --> 00:39:19,369
some are slower than others but it does

912
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:23,060
work really so if if technology vendors

913
00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:25,960
supplied a good feedback loop and could

914
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:30,099
somehow incentivize their customers to

915
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:32,480
to do this you know what would we do it

916
00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:35,030
right and and and what would you tell

917
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:38,180
vendors in this regard right

918
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:42,020
but because ideally right so something

919
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:44,000
Symantec knows about would be real handy

920
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:45,740
to get into web sense if web sense

921
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,040
didn't know about it because these like

922
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:50,000
blended email threats with bad links

923
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:53,329
kind of split the difference between

924
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,099
those two vendors right and and many of

925
00:39:53,329 --> 00:39:56,839
those vendors have like one-to-one

926
00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:58,550
relationships or one to a few

927
00:39:56,839 --> 00:40:00,170
relationships back and forth where they

928
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,980
will share some that information at

929
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:03,260
least when they don't think they're

930
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:05,030
competing with each other but if you'll

931
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:06,950
notice the kinds of reports that come

932
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:08,750
out about I discovered this botnet and

933
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:10,009
it's doing all this stuff and they'll

934
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:11,480
tell you all about the AV they'll give

935
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:12,619
you the md5 hash of that because they

936
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,540
share that information all right

937
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:16,550
but when it comes to things like you

938
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:20,240
could identify on your network like

939
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:23,119
particular URL patterns or IP addresses

940
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,799
they're always grayed out so that you

941
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,940
can't so the other everybody else

942
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,140
reading this now they say they don't

943
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,160
want the bad guys well the bad guys

944
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:30,890
already know that they've been made

945
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:34,220
right there's this this is so we have to

946
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:38,060
get past this communis this the nature

947
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:40,069
of the data itself is is very transient

948
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:41,210
right what's what's here in attacking

949
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:41,839
you today is going to be moving

950
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:43,369
somewhere else

951
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,930
it's techniques and things like that

952
00:40:43,369 --> 00:40:47,510
that are really important and how you

953
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:49,490
apply that data and to protecting things

954
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:51,470
is really your wink a competitive

955
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:53,479
advantages so the data we have to get

956
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:56,529
past this idea that data is so how gold

957
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:59,569
and should be reported

958
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:59,569
[Music]

959
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:06,440
yeah and just to follow on there you

960
00:41:03,859 --> 00:41:08,509
know as a as somebody just trying to

961
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:13,849
protect an organization you know and the

962
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:20,240
big C of this stuff you know that it's

963
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:22,660
not nicely or easy to hear because you

964
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,488
kind of lose my thought here but

965
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:27,759
you know this information is out there

966
00:41:24,489 --> 00:41:30,789
and it shouldn't be monetized just

967
00:41:27,759 --> 00:41:35,140
because we can right I mean this is the

968
00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:38,049
it's kind of an odd thing right we want

969
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:41,078
to be capitalists exactly but at the

970
00:41:38,049 --> 00:41:44,589
same time we're kind of getting you know

971
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:47,200
it handed to us on a plate so if if I

972
00:41:44,589 --> 00:41:50,200
don't have providers that have this

973
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,129
information then then as an organization

974
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,259
I mean because i'm in the business

975
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:55,960
making loans i'm not going to go out and

976
00:41:53,259 --> 00:41:57,009
become an expert in in all of these

977
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,859
things and gathering this information

978
00:41:57,009 --> 00:42:02,710
i'm not in a position to do that but as

979
00:41:59,859 --> 00:42:04,900
an organization i really would like to

980
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:07,779
be able to take action at what's left of

981
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:11,249
the perimeter when it money over you

982
00:42:07,779 --> 00:42:11,249
know capable right

983
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:32,899
[Music]

984
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:38,330
that's a great question I would ask that

985
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:41,270
in fact I got a follow up question on

986
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:44,750
here about the difficulty in sharing

987
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:46,640
information in your sector and so if

988
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:49,370
information was going to be applicable

989
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:51,170
to me I would think it would be

990
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:53,420
applicable to other state local tribal

991
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:56,990
territorial governments that's who I

992
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:59,480
would share that with so I think from

993
00:42:56,990 --> 00:43:01,399
that example I would say intra sector

994
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:11,740
that's not necessarily the whole answer

995
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:14,240
you got an idea here what's that right

996
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:16,129
well that's the world we live in now

997
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,470
isn't it I mean I really do think that

998
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:20,600
we need technology in fact I think it

999
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:22,910
would be a very interesting startup for

1000
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:25,970
somebody to build a company that

1001
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:28,670
brokered information between vendors

1002
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:31,129
like that for a license and that's why I

1003
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:34,400
was really excited to be a part of this

1004
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:37,190
is because I think this is is really you

1005
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:40,070
know we have other models where we're

1006
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:41,690
doing quite well but there were there's

1007
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:45,280
some centralization so I'll give you an

1008
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:47,390
example it's in the credit card space I

1009
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,880
don't care who you got your credit card

1010
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:53,740
from it is being run through Bayesian

1011
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:56,540
logic for anomalies in your behavior and

1012
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:58,370
that information gets back to whoever if

1013
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:00,259
you do that credit card and it gets back

1014
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:02,390
there in like a real time one

1015
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:06,740
transaction and we're done

1016
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:09,290
so models exist but in our space in the

1017
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:11,479
you know the pure technology space you

1018
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:13,070
know forget my vertical of FI when we're

1019
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:15,200
talking about where can interconnecting

1020
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:19,340
all these computers we're doing a really

1021
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:21,649
poor job and and letting folks use it

1022
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:25,220
the fact that we have to live by rules

1023
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:27,710
and provide privacy for our constituents

1024
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:30,290
and so we have to find a better better

1025
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:33,440
model and the public private information

1026
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:37,250
well it's a great effort it really is

1027
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:40,070
this section between three men in a room

1028
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:41,630
and us getting together in this room and

1029
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:43,400
understanding who's got what

1030
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:45,880
capabilities and how we can share those

1031
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,880
capabilities

1032
00:44:48,549 --> 00:44:53,900
and we didn't even touch about on the

1033
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,879
whole host of issues around yeah I get

1034
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:58,609
all kinds yeah we got we got regulatory

1035
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:59,869
issues we got policy issues we we a part

1036
00:44:58,609 --> 00:45:01,549
of a part of problem is people don't

1037
00:44:59,869 --> 00:45:03,559
feel they can't because they're

1038
00:45:01,549 --> 00:45:05,569
constrained so we need safe harbor issue

1039
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:07,220
you know types of thing these are being

1040
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:08,569
talked about at the policy level they're

1041
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,890
the only thing kind of failed

1042
00:45:08,569 --> 00:45:13,040
cybersecurity legislation there were

1043
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:14,569
some safe harbor things but then then

1044
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,890
there's the okay this is we're talking

1045
00:45:14,569 --> 00:45:18,170
about the United States of America this

1046
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:20,299
is worldwide right all of this stuff is

1047
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:21,920
and I think you talk about the credit

1048
00:45:20,299 --> 00:45:24,109
card industry there's an incentive there

1049
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,180
right right so we don't have the our

1050
00:45:24,109 --> 00:45:28,819
incentives aren't online this is the

1051
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:31,040
biggest problem we have right so how do

1052
00:45:28,819 --> 00:45:34,640
we do that without forcing people to do

1053
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:36,440
it and because you know it it's in our

1054
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,029
collective interest to do it but it's a

1055
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:42,200
given that's that the prisoner's dilemma

1056
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:44,210
issue we've got a lot of this that's a

1057
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:50,899
great way to end it all right thanks for

1058
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:53,780
listening you know policy issues what I

1059
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:56,450
prefer to do is as we talk about these

1060
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:57,799
things if you have questions don't hold

1061
00:45:56,450 --> 00:46:00,290
them till the end you just stop us

1062
00:45:57,799 --> 00:46:02,299
because I think this ought to be more

1063
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:03,920
interactive than anything else everybody

1064
00:46:02,299 --> 00:46:05,569
has got an opinion on this these kinds

1065
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,420
of things if they know we're here to

1066
00:46:05,569 --> 00:46:10,579
talk about everybody's looking at your

1067
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:13,160
program real quick all right this is

1068
00:46:10,579 --> 00:46:14,750
information sharing and so the federal

1069
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:16,279
government talks about public-private

1070
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:18,170
partnerships and information sharing all

1071
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,940
the time seems to have cracked the code

1072
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:21,770
on neither so that's what we're gonna

1073
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:24,410
discuss information sharing across

1074
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:27,380
public/private lines within a sector

1075
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:29,720
across levels of government is applied

1076
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:31,040
to a certain number of use cases so my

1077
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,270
name is Mike Hamilton and I'm the

1078
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,808
information security officer for the

1079
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:38,210
city so we protect your electricity

1080
00:46:35,809 --> 00:46:40,099
clean water sewage disposal Public

1081
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:42,440
Safety law enforcement transportation

1082
00:46:40,099 --> 00:46:44,089
management and then we worry about

1083
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:48,470
credit cards and other detritus like

1084
00:46:44,089 --> 00:46:50,450
that my esteemed panel who I'm going to

1085
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:52,098
let do their own BIOS I'm gonna

1086
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:53,390
introduce them very briefly this is Ken

1087
00:46:52,099 --> 00:46:55,670
Ken Locke who is the chief information

1088
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:57,740
security officer of Boeing Credit Union

1089
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:59,630
Boeing employees credit union even

1090
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:00,439
though non Boeing employees can be part

1091
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:02,960
of your credit you is that correct

1092
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:05,180
that's correct okay this is Carol

1093
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,859
Thompson Carol is the IT director of

1094
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:09,828
seattle City Light the 10th largest

1095
00:47:06,859 --> 00:47:14,089
energy utility in the United States and

1096
00:47:09,829 --> 00:47:19,960
I think one of two that is one of them

1097
00:47:14,089 --> 00:47:22,130
we bring you light one of two that is

1098
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:24,290
under the purview of municipal

1099
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:26,270
government of local government it's it's

1100
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:33,950
it's us it's Austin and were there any

1101
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:38,180
others so this is rare and rot you're

1102
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:41,598
the CEO CTO of internet identity down in

1103
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:45,859
Tacoma and these guys have some very

1104
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:47,089
interesting managed services that play

1105
00:47:45,859 --> 00:47:48,319
right into the information sharing space

1106
00:47:47,089 --> 00:47:50,450
and getting up to collective

1107
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:51,650
intelligence so Ken talk about your bio

1108
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:53,000
a little bit I'm gonna ask you to do one

1109
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:55,160
thing I'm gonna ask you to tell

1110
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:59,750
everybody something about yourself has

1111
00:47:55,160 --> 00:48:01,940
nothing to do with security okay

1112
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:04,579
there is nothing like that so Ken Ken

1113
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:06,880
Locke information security at BCU I'm

1114
00:48:04,579 --> 00:48:09,109
also responsible for corporate insurance

1115
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:13,309
everything except for employee benefits

1116
00:48:09,109 --> 00:48:15,319
and business continuity been in the

1117
00:48:13,309 --> 00:48:18,290
industry you know many years maybe as

1118
00:48:15,319 --> 00:48:20,390
many as 20 and come from a very

1119
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:23,150
technical background

1120
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:28,250
mostly building networks and that kind

1121
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:31,670
of thing you really got me with that

1122
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:34,069
something that's not about security you

1123
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:37,160
ski naked anything yeah no it's

1124
00:48:34,069 --> 00:48:38,960
something interesting I show Scottish

1125
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:41,509
terrier dogs on last year my dog

1126
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,970
finished number seven in the country I

1127
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:49,190
love that film Best in Show and that's

1128
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:51,290
why you got into isn't it okay Carol and

1129
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:53,750
I'm Carol Thompson I'm the director for

1130
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:56,299
city lights IT department and we have

1131
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:58,130
about 111 people on staff that cover

1132
00:48:56,299 --> 00:49:00,230
everything from

1133
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:03,170
poor application development supporting

1134
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:06,650
the public until public utility as well

1135
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:09,500
as network infrastructure security the

1136
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:11,299
whole gamut I am highly untechnical so

1137
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:13,430
that's why I braced myself between two

1138
00:49:11,299 --> 00:49:15,140
technical and smart people but we do

1139
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:17,270
have a lot of use cases and such that

1140
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:19,730
have happened with the utility that may

1141
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:21,920
be of interest today and so the one non

1142
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:22,970
security related thing there are so many

1143
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,040
to choose from

1144
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:26,930
but I'm meeting this afternoon with my

1145
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:35,690
daughter who's on the New Zealand roller

1146
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:37,490
derby circuit throw an elbow every once

1147
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:39,980
in a while

1148
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:42,200
hi I'm rod Rasmussen president and CTO

1149
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:44,290
internet identity we're an internet

1150
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:47,299
security company do lots of things

1151
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:49,040
mainly around finding identifying and

1152
00:49:47,299 --> 00:49:50,690
shutting down evil things on the

1153
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:53,089
internet for your definition of evil

1154
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:55,760
which is what I think most civilized

1155
00:49:53,089 --> 00:49:57,200
society considers equal to and we're

1156
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:01,430
doing a lot of things in the information

1157
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:03,859
sharing space as far as enabling various

1158
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:05,629
companies and government etcetera to

1159
00:50:03,859 --> 00:50:07,520
share some things back and forth with

1160
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:09,349
each other around what's happening and

1161
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:12,200
creating some situational awareness and

1162
00:50:09,349 --> 00:50:14,540
trying to do that in real time so and

1163
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:16,939
I'm you know I did this to Michael on a

1164
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:19,910
panel I had him on a while ago said and

1165
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:22,579
that what I talked about wine I so

1166
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:24,020
something probably almost nobody in this

1167
00:50:22,579 --> 00:50:27,770
industry knows about me is I'm actually

1168
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:29,270
an avid model railroad guy yeah except I

1169
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:31,910
have no railroad setup or anything I

1170
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:33,319
just have boxes and boxes of trains that

1171
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:35,509
I've collected over the years

1172
00:50:33,319 --> 00:50:36,650
stuffed away in storage in the Attic

1173
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:39,170
because you know after you move a couple

1174
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:40,400
of times it's really hard to and running

1175
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:42,890
a business and things like that doing

1176
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,799
setting up Ola out it's pretty tough to

1177
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:47,359
get done so maybe one day when I retire

1178
00:50:45,799 --> 00:50:49,309
from this stuff we'll have some massive

1179
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:51,040
thing going oh there you go yeah I think

1180
00:50:49,309 --> 00:50:54,920
we're all looking forward to blowing off

1181
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:58,570
so that means that we have to ask rod is

1182
00:50:54,920 --> 00:51:03,320
this a railroad symbol in the

1183
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:07,030
yeah yeah and like a hypnosis Wheeler's

1184
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:07,030
in there okay

1185
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:23,089
is that sure to the pack does that swag

1186
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:24,890
from the conference okay so let's talk

1187
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:27,920
briefly about the evolution of

1188
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:29,180
information sharing at least in the

1189
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,250
definition I'm gonna make up for you

1190
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:32,890
right now so in the beginning there were

1191
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:38,630
skiffs everybody know what a skip is

1192
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:40,580
right great guess great guess it is a

1193
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:44,090
secure compartmented information

1194
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:50,600
facility right that's where you receive

1195
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:53,210
classified information and then when we

1196
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:55,850
started to actually employ a lot of

1197
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:57,380
computing and needed to tell one another

1198
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:58,880
about some things that we're going on we

1199
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:00,680
would use our trusted networks and so

1200
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,930
think of that as three guys in a room

1201
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:06,020
discussing what happened last week right

1202
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:09,500
just people you trust and that kind of

1203
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:11,420
evolved into portals and we have stuff

1204
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:14,090
like the homeland security information

1205
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:17,170
network which distributes a lot of

1206
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:19,910
information and we ended up with ice axe

1207
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:25,760
right I sack information sharing an

1208
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:30,109
analysis Center and there's this new

1209
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:31,880
meme that has kind of taken on a life of

1210
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:33,940
its own and started to show some value

1211
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:35,660
and called collective intelligence

1212
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:38,540
anybody familiar with that term

1213
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:41,029
collective intelligence okay ideally

1214
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:43,040
that's something that would the

1215
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:45,380
abstraction of it is you're always

1216
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,420
telling everybody what happens to you

1217
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:50,390
because then everybody else can leverage

1218
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:52,700
that events to better protect themselves

1219
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:56,750
or to better understand the severity of

1220
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:58,759
an event and so there are some methods

1221
00:52:56,750 --> 00:53:00,200
and services evolving to take advantage

1222
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,340
of that for example there's one called

1223
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:04,009
sip the collective intelligence

1224
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:06,710
framework that was developed by the the

1225
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:10,610
Wren I stack research and education

1226
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:12,079
network eyes act so does anybody want to

1227
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:13,880
add anything to that

1228
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:16,579
Mike I think you should explain what the

1229
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:19,369
rent I psychos so the rent I sack is one

1230
00:53:16,579 --> 00:53:21,349
of this collection of ice axe and there

1231
00:53:19,369 --> 00:53:23,299
is not one for every sector in the in

1232
00:53:21,349 --> 00:53:25,939
the parlance of Homeland Security there

1233
00:53:23,299 --> 00:53:28,449
are 18 critical sectors dams energy

1234
00:53:25,939 --> 00:53:32,660
water blah blah blah blah finance sorry

1235
00:53:28,449 --> 00:53:34,880
and many of those have an information

1236
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:36,199
sharing and analysis center so there's

1237
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,209
the FSI sack

1238
00:53:36,199 --> 00:53:39,949
there's the r ni sack for research and

1239
00:53:38,209 --> 00:53:42,198
education network there's the

1240
00:53:39,949 --> 00:53:44,439
multi-state i sac for state local tribal

1241
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:47,989
and territorial governments primarily

1242
00:53:44,439 --> 00:53:50,149
and some of those work better than

1243
00:53:47,989 --> 00:53:52,400
others i think actually the FSI sack is

1244
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:53,539
the one that works the best the rent i

1245
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,679
sacked by virtue of the fact that

1246
00:53:53,539 --> 00:53:56,179
they're doing all this development and

1247
00:53:54,679 --> 00:54:00,799
making this free to the communities i

1248
00:53:56,179 --> 00:54:03,920
think is is wonderful work so let's do

1249
00:54:00,799 --> 00:54:05,119
this I would point out too that there

1250
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,019
are a lot of other organizations that

1251
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:08,329
are out there trying to share

1252
00:54:06,019 --> 00:54:11,419
information you may be familiar with

1253
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:13,549
team comer e shadows server right

1254
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:15,439
characters like that or trying to

1255
00:54:13,549 --> 00:54:18,410
aggregate everything that they can in an

1256
00:54:15,439 --> 00:54:19,848
open source capacity and share that back

1257
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:21,649
out to the network so that everybody is

1258
00:54:19,849 --> 00:54:25,279
better informed that's kind of

1259
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:28,400
collective intelligence so what I like

1260
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:29,869
to do is I would like to go down a

1261
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,179
number of threats that we're all

1262
00:54:29,869 --> 00:54:33,469
familiar with and I would like to talk

1263
00:54:32,179 --> 00:54:36,140
about two things that would like to have

1264
00:54:33,469 --> 00:54:39,160
the panel talk about two things number

1265
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:41,359
one where would you find out about

1266
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:43,279
current activity with respect to this

1267
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:45,229
threat where would you go for that

1268
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:48,380
information to better inform yourself

1269
00:54:45,229 --> 00:54:50,209
and number two who would you tell if

1270
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:51,829
something happened to you where would

1271
00:54:50,209 --> 00:54:53,719
you put that piece of information so

1272
00:54:51,829 --> 00:54:57,079
that others could benefit from the

1273
00:54:53,719 --> 00:54:59,689
experience you just had alright let's

1274
00:54:57,079 --> 00:55:03,489
start with one that I think is near and

1275
00:54:59,689 --> 00:55:06,469
dear to your heart phishing smishing

1276
00:55:03,489 --> 00:55:08,869
largely that stuff is oriented towards

1277
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:13,670
acquiring credentials for financial

1278
00:55:08,869 --> 00:55:16,249
logins as you find out so we we find out

1279
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:18,109
through our members we don't call them

1280
00:55:16,249 --> 00:55:21,788
customers but the members of the credit

1281
00:55:18,109 --> 00:55:24,259
union largely that is how we we find out

1282
00:55:21,789 --> 00:55:25,070
they report to us that they're receiving

1283
00:55:24,259 --> 00:55:28,370
a tax

1284
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:30,680
message an email but today it's really

1285
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:33,500
it's really either a phone call or a

1286
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:37,220
text message is the the bane of that

1287
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:39,020
existence today that's largely how we

1288
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:41,089
always find out there are a couple other

1289
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:41,750
channels but that's the the majority of

1290
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:43,460
it

1291
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:45,830
and what do we do with it we need

1292
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:48,320
partners we need information sharing

1293
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:50,090
because these things often the

1294
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:51,740
traditional fishing is really easy

1295
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:54,380
easily understood right there's a

1296
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:55,729
there's a server somewhere that this is

1297
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:59,930
going to the link and the email is going

1298
00:55:55,730 --> 00:56:01,460
to end up at and so we need information

1299
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:03,049
and then we need partners to help take

1300
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:08,630
that down particularly when there's an

1301
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:13,040
international play beyond that there's

1302
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:14,720
the anti-phishing working group so you

1303
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,820
know in phishing we kind of got there

1304
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:21,140
with email but we have a new battle to

1305
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:26,870
fight in the in the text and and text

1306
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:29,720
and smartphone who would you tell you

1307
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:33,049
just you just got targeted in a BECU

1308
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:34,640
specific credit union phishing attack or

1309
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:36,110
you or your members were targeted yeah

1310
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:39,319
so one make any sense to tell anybody

1311
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:40,700
well it well regular regulatory we have

1312
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:42,500
to talk to the state of Washington the

1313
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:45,560
Department of Finance and we also have

1314
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:47,180
to put our insurer on notice beyond that

1315
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:49,549
it's whoever we would think would make

1316
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:51,589
sense so the anti-phishing working group

1317
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:53,690
and potentially partners that are going

1318
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:57,260
to help us take down those those those

1319
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:59,120
things phishing is mainly a financial

1320
00:56:57,260 --> 00:57:03,080
thing but Carol we have seen this as

1321
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:04,940
well largely when when this happens to

1322
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:07,340
us they're trying to get our domain

1323
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:10,550
logins and we have seen this targeted

1324
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:12,620
against energy utility assets right

1325
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:14,600
which get your attention let me tell you

1326
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:17,540
right so one of the experiences that we

1327
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:20,000
had just recently was that our power

1328
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:23,630
marketers who are trading and buying

1329
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:26,180
selling and trading energy were targeted

1330
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:28,610
with phishing attacks and they were able

1331
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:30,649
to get the hackers were able to get

1332
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:32,840
their names and understand what their

1333
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:35,450
job was within the utility just because

1334
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:37,319
our folks were listed in the publicly

1335
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:40,229
available directories

1336
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:41,699
and so you know that's just kind of we

1337
00:57:40,229 --> 00:57:43,618
were thinking more customer service

1338
00:57:41,699 --> 00:57:45,690
oriented letting people know who we are

1339
00:57:43,619 --> 00:57:47,369
where we are how to get a hold of us but

1340
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:50,789
we got a little sharp slap at the face

1341
00:57:47,369 --> 00:57:52,799
on that one to realize that there are

1342
00:57:50,789 --> 00:57:54,749
much targeted much more targeted attacks

1343
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:56,459
than what we were expecting so what we

1344
00:57:54,749 --> 00:57:58,680
ended up doing is we took all of the

1345
00:57:56,459 --> 00:58:02,249
available information public facing off

1346
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:05,219
any kind of website or directory for our

1347
00:58:02,249 --> 00:58:07,019
power marketers and it's really

1348
00:58:05,219 --> 00:58:09,029
important for us to make sure that the

1349
00:58:07,019 --> 00:58:10,680
power marketers understood the

1350
00:58:09,029 --> 00:58:12,569
vulnerabilities so that they were not

1351
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:15,839
clicking on links I mean they're very

1352
00:58:12,569 --> 00:58:17,430
good at what they do but Internet

1353
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:19,828
Security is not one of their strong

1354
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:23,698
points nor as logical email management

1355
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:25,859
one of their strong points so what we

1356
00:58:23,699 --> 00:58:27,930
did was we educated them we gave them

1357
00:58:25,859 --> 00:58:30,449
talking points to talk through with

1358
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:32,129
other power marketing agencies because

1359
00:58:30,449 --> 00:58:35,130
all of the utilities most of the

1360
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:37,739
utilities have some form of power

1361
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:39,989
management area there that they would be

1362
00:58:37,739 --> 00:58:42,599
working with and so they became the

1363
00:58:39,989 --> 00:58:44,940
community that was actually sharing with

1364
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:46,829
others about where the the emails were

1365
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:49,799
coming from what kinds of words were in

1366
00:58:46,829 --> 00:58:53,640
the header and the subject and so forth

1367
00:58:49,799 --> 00:58:56,880
so we used peat on the street and malice

1368
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:58,920
on the on telephones to get our message

1369
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,630
out are you required to tell Newark

1370
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:02,759
about things like that if you feel that

1371
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:05,819
you have been Terry power marketers so

1372
00:59:02,759 --> 00:59:07,589
that you know right we have extra power

1373
00:59:05,819 --> 00:59:09,630
there's a lot of snow we're making power

1374
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:11,130
Southern California's out we have to

1375
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:12,959
negotiate a whole bunch of things for

1376
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:14,279
Bonneville to open up transmission lines

1377
00:59:12,959 --> 00:59:17,839
to get it down there that's power

1378
00:59:14,279 --> 00:59:18,989
marketing has nothing to with billboards

1379
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:23,038
sorry

1380
00:59:18,989 --> 00:59:26,039
really okay so so we have we're heavily

1381
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:29,459
regulated with national energy reliance

1382
00:59:26,039 --> 00:59:31,650
corporation and we do not have to tell

1383
00:59:29,459 --> 00:59:33,649
them if we are targeted necessarily but

1384
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:36,660
we do have to tell them if we have been

1385
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:38,519
exposed in any if we get viruses on our

1386
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:41,160
machines and so forth if they actually

1387
00:59:38,519 --> 00:59:44,189
click on the links and and compromise

1388
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:48,390
any aspect of a trade because they do do

1389
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:50,280
the trades via email in some cases in

1390
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:52,859
through text messaging instant

1391
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:54,300
messaging but the trade itself does not

1392
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:56,400
do that but there's enough information

1393
00:59:54,300 --> 01:00:03,330
in the tree about the trade that could

1394
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:05,940
be compromised so you've brought a topic

1395
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:08,040
that is you know our company basically

1396
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:10,710
started in the security side of things

1397
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:12,660
on phishing and dealing with that and it

1398
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:13,440
has evolved tremendously and I think

1399
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:15,600
there's a couple of different issues

1400
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,700
that actually have already surfaced here

1401
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:19,319
and it's it's vectors or changing

1402
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:22,169
techniques are changing targeting is

1403
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:24,690
changing it's constantly changing I also

1404
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:28,080
think that that the phishing in itself

1405
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:31,890
and within the leadership of the AP aPWG

1406
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:33,180
myself we have that has been a big

1407
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:36,240
success story as far as information

1408
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:38,490
sharing goes in the basic form of

1409
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:41,430
classic phishing where you have some of

1410
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:43,560
you send something that a lure it looks

1411
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:45,029
like a bank or an online service or

1412
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:48,990
something like that and they're trying

1413
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:50,940
to gather your credentials right and so

1414
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:53,009
we find out about things and actually

1415
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:54,690
ironically largely our customers who we

1416
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:56,670
work for and do shutdown and things for

1417
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:58,680
tell us about most of the stuff because

1418
01:00:56,670 --> 01:01:00,240
their customers are clued into this but

1419
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:01,680
a lot of stuff we still get from sharing

1420
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,870
between other partners and things like

1421
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:06,870
that a lot of the email providers the

1422
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:09,540
anti-spam vendors feed into this system

1423
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:11,460
right so they've detect phishing URLs

1424
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:13,860
within email streams are going out that

1425
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:15,360
gets pushed in we'll we'll pick up on

1426
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:17,160
that and then go with it from there and

1427
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:18,540
then of course we feedback from things

1428
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:20,790
we get to our customers in that system

1429
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:22,890
nice thing about that too is that that

1430
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:25,610
it's a feedback loop where anti-spam

1431
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:28,620
companies and all the major browser

1432
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:30,360
manufacturers have systems to instantly

1433
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:30,960
block that stuff so we're getting near

1434
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:32,700
real-time

1435
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,950
I'm gonna call it real-time called near

1436
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:37,350
real-time as far as detection of some

1437
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:39,899
sort of traditional fishing at least and

1438
01:01:37,350 --> 01:01:42,150
getting that blocked and it will either

1439
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:44,670
with an email or within the browser so

1440
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:46,530
the customers are protected and that's a

1441
01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:48,150
really important reason and an incentive

1442
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:50,100
for people are you know especially our

1443
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:51,900
customers to make sure that they're

1444
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:53,220
reporting that and because it can

1445
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:54,990
actually protect customers through that

1446
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:56,669
collective intelligence

1447
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:58,589
things are changing though were you

1448
01:01:56,670 --> 01:01:59,730
seeing techniques are being used which

1449
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:01,300
aren't traditional fishing they're

1450
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:03,570
actually just trying to explain

1451
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:06,340
your computer get malware on them well

1452
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:07,870
various browser people won't don't

1453
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:10,270
classify that as phishing so they don't

1454
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:11,589
block those there's there so there's a

1455
01:02:10,270 --> 01:02:14,350
trick there's a hole in the system in

1456
01:02:11,590 --> 01:02:17,410
that regard there's a policy hole they

1457
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:18,610
will use one-time use URLs so it defeats

1458
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:21,490
the technical measures that we've

1459
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:23,140
implemented you're also seeing this

1460
01:02:21,490 --> 01:02:25,930
targeted stuff going on our spearfishing

1461
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:27,790
is the parlaying of the opponents of the

1462
01:02:25,930 --> 01:02:30,040
industry and that's also interesting

1463
01:02:27,790 --> 01:02:31,960
because often times people don't want

1464
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:33,100
that report it necessarily and we see

1465
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:35,340
that it's been particularly when it's

1466
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:37,509
targeting government officials or

1467
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:39,700
high-ranking executives at major

1468
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:41,980
financial institutions don't want to

1469
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:43,240
share this kind of specialized stuff out

1470
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:45,190
to the rest of the community and that's

1471
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:46,770
a challenge for us because obviously if

1472
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:49,240
we're sharing techniques across the

1473
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:51,460
spectrum we can it's the same groups

1474
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:53,680
doing this right there's only a few bad

1475
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:55,840
few groups of bad guys out there using

1476
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:59,379
these specialized techniques but because

1477
01:02:55,840 --> 01:03:00,880
of its Dean sensitive we're seeing some

1478
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:02,380
of some reluctance to sharing that kind

1479
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:04,240
of stuff so it's we've seen this

1480
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:06,670
evolution and it's it's actually I think

1481
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:08,229
accelerating in new methodologies and

1482
01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:10,000
things like that that are going on

1483
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:12,160
measures and countermeasures are

1484
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,810
becoming much more rapidly developed and

1485
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:18,069
deployed you know one thing that I

1486
01:03:15,810 --> 01:03:19,810
didn't put on the agenda to talk about

1487
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:21,850
but I'm gonna say a little bit about is

1488
01:03:19,810 --> 01:03:25,570
this reluctance of the private sector to

1489
01:03:21,850 --> 01:03:28,900
share information because puts companies

1490
01:03:25,570 --> 01:03:32,350
at a competitive disadvantage and just

1491
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:33,970
real briefly I will tell you that I got

1492
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:36,580
Carol to stand in at the last moment

1493
01:03:33,970 --> 01:03:39,399
because we had someone else from the

1494
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:40,930
private sector whose company is so anti

1495
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:42,490
information sharing they wouldn't even

1496
01:03:40,930 --> 01:03:44,080
let him sit on a panel to talk about

1497
01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:49,890
information sharing and I'm not making

1498
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:52,390
that up no no I wouldn't tell you it was

1499
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:53,529
okay so phishing that's kind of tip of

1500
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:58,150
the iceberg

1501
01:03:53,530 --> 01:04:00,130
I'm gonna skip email getting email you

1502
01:03:58,150 --> 01:04:02,460
know we get that the email security has

1503
01:04:00,130 --> 01:04:04,360
become so commoditized I think that's

1504
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:06,599
internally there's enough stuff being

1505
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:09,509
shared where everybody's informed about

1506
01:04:06,599 --> 01:04:11,369
bad email fairly quickly we do all agree

1507
01:04:09,509 --> 01:04:14,279
yeah and if you look at the numbers of

1508
01:04:11,369 --> 01:04:18,749
spam it's it's the the bra volume has

1509
01:04:14,279 --> 01:04:21,229
gone way down yeah I don't get me

1510
01:04:18,749 --> 01:04:23,759
started on some of those actions though

1511
01:04:21,229 --> 01:04:27,960
although on email and it's done

1512
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:30,269
information sharing but dkim and SPF

1513
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:31,890
right I mean we got to have it we got to

1514
01:04:30,269 --> 01:04:39,598
do these we got to continue to do those

1515
01:04:31,890 --> 01:04:42,328
kind of things to keep that at bay so

1516
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:47,309
let's talk about something that's one of

1517
01:04:42,329 --> 01:04:51,049
my favorites is the 50,000 a day

1518
01:04:47,309 --> 01:04:53,880
compromised websites that build in

1519
01:04:51,049 --> 01:04:56,160
redirects inject redirects so you go to

1520
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:57,869
golf swing comm and you don't know that

1521
01:04:56,160 --> 01:05:01,319
you're being you know attack sideways

1522
01:04:57,869 --> 01:05:03,720
from Kazakhstan we pick up a hundred and

1523
01:05:01,319 --> 01:05:05,400
fifty of these a week that our URL

1524
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:08,430
filtering and content management

1525
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:10,019
technology doesn't know about we find

1526
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:11,879
them in there and we got a guy who's

1527
01:05:10,019 --> 01:05:13,859
track and organized crime network so we

1528
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:15,989
have blocked so much logical real estate

1529
01:05:13,859 --> 01:05:17,400
in some countries that if anybody's out

1530
01:05:15,989 --> 01:05:21,359
there planning a trip to Seattle they're

1531
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:25,999
out of luck but so this this thing about

1532
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:28,650
calm right so we find bad URLs right

1533
01:05:25,999 --> 01:05:31,200
clearly our technology vendors are our

1534
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:32,489
main source of that information and you

1535
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,799
know you don't have to identify who your

1536
01:05:32,489 --> 01:05:36,539
vendors are here but you know tell me

1537
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:39,989
something about where you get that info

1538
01:05:36,539 --> 01:05:42,779
and who you tell and how how easy is it

1539
01:05:39,989 --> 01:05:44,130
or not to report that information up to

1540
01:05:42,779 --> 01:05:47,999
somebody who can make use of it to

1541
01:05:44,130 --> 01:05:51,299
protect the rest of the community well

1542
01:05:47,999 --> 01:05:53,999
for city light we report it to him so

1543
01:05:51,299 --> 01:05:55,829
we're in very very good shape but I

1544
01:05:53,999 --> 01:05:59,368
think one of the things that limits us

1545
01:05:55,829 --> 01:06:01,619
is the ability to just not get

1546
01:05:59,369 --> 01:06:03,180
information fast enough you don't have

1547
01:06:01,619 --> 01:06:04,950
people that are aware throughout the

1548
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:07,288
organization of what has just happened

1549
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:09,509
to them and if they see it they're not

1550
01:06:07,289 --> 01:06:13,799
well enough educated in many cases in

1551
01:06:09,509 --> 01:06:15,989
this topic to be able to recognize it

1552
01:06:13,799 --> 01:06:19,979
for what it is and report it back up so

1553
01:06:15,989 --> 01:06:20,250
we're delayed until we can get some of

1554
01:06:19,979 --> 01:06:22,379
the

1555
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:24,270
read and verified and it just it just

1556
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:27,030
doesn't happen quickly enough you know

1557
01:06:24,270 --> 01:06:30,630
if we could in some way adopt a Facebook

1558
01:06:27,030 --> 01:06:32,310
type mentality for how to share this

1559
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:37,140
information without compromising

1560
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:39,450
ourselves it would be ideal I could I

1561
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:41,339
could speak to this for prior to our

1562
01:06:39,450 --> 01:06:43,919
pair or this individual session on my

1563
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:45,720
own okay because we I've got people

1564
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:47,220
sitting in front of screens identifying

1565
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:49,740
this kind of stuff as part of what we

1566
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:51,359
dub services we offer but it's hard

1567
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:53,790
especially lately you've got a lot of

1568
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:56,150
automation going on where the bad guys

1569
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:59,040
have tools now that they can basically

1570
01:06:56,150 --> 01:07:01,230
go across the internet using what we

1571
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:04,350
call Google dorks or over here which is

1572
01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:06,120
basically looking at various patterns

1573
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:08,759
that will appear on vulnerable websites

1574
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:12,299
and being able to to zero it on those

1575
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:13,710
and automatically exploit them and you

1576
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:16,650
see I mentioned earlier we had that

1577
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:19,200
policy issue where where for certain

1578
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:20,880
kinds of abuse things will get blocked

1579
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,290
automatically for other kinds of abuse

1580
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:25,410
that haven't been defined from a policy

1581
01:07:22,290 --> 01:07:26,910
perspective they won't you know but

1582
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:28,770
we're actually though if you if you take

1583
01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:32,060
a step back the the industry is largely

1584
01:07:28,770 --> 01:07:36,690
reliant upon a few big vendors that be

1585
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:39,720
you know Microsoft and Google and some

1586
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:41,910
of the big ISPs but though your Facebook

1587
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:44,490
and some of the more the social networks

1588
01:07:41,910 --> 01:07:47,490
those folks are all investing a lot into

1589
01:07:44,490 --> 01:07:49,680
actually trying to do automate a lot of

1590
01:07:47,490 --> 01:07:52,229
this kind of stuff one of the challenges

1591
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:55,879
is when you get reports in from the

1592
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:59,280
public a lot of it is unusable or

1593
01:07:55,880 --> 01:08:01,080
inaccurate or disinformation on top of

1594
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:02,400
that that's always a big concern but

1595
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,720
even more than this information is just

1596
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,190
people clicking on something they don't

1597
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:06,359
like they got a message from somebody

1598
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:08,250
who's probably legitimate they probably

1599
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:10,950
signed up for it they click on it as

1600
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:12,690
being evil phishing spam and it's really

1601
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:16,380
just the latest marketing offering and

1602
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:19,049
as a corporate entity with very deep

1603
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:19,980
pockets like Google or Microsoft they're

1604
01:08:19,049 --> 01:08:22,380
very risk-averse

1605
01:08:19,979 --> 01:08:24,209
into fully automating and doing things

1606
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:27,600
because of the risk of somebody saying

1607
01:08:24,210 --> 01:08:30,390
you blocked my my web my web shop and I

1608
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:32,160
lost ten million dollars in transactions

1609
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:33,809
you know that kind of stuff so there's

1610
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:36,929
there's this balancing act that you

1611
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:39,839
so it makes it very hard and then you

1612
01:08:36,929 --> 01:08:41,940
know I think that other industries have

1613
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:43,170
have that feedback mechanism and I think

1614
01:08:41,939 --> 01:08:44,848
you may have that on the list or for

1615
01:08:43,170 --> 01:08:46,170
example av and some of the other places

1616
01:08:44,849 --> 01:08:48,210
like that where you actually have

1617
01:08:46,170 --> 01:08:57,078
reporting infrastructures it's very hard

1618
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:59,609
on the website to actually do that word

1619
01:08:57,078 --> 01:09:01,710
typical on this the space where we're

1620
01:08:59,609 --> 01:09:03,539
reliant on the vendors but you know

1621
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:06,059
we're an approximate environment to

1622
01:09:03,538 --> 01:09:09,000
being an NFI and so we're largely

1623
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:13,889
relying on them for for the list of bad

1624
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:16,618
urls but it clearly is is slightly

1625
01:09:13,889 --> 01:09:20,819
behind this list right and we see this

1626
01:09:16,618 --> 01:09:23,729
that manifests itself in watching the

1627
01:09:20,819 --> 01:09:26,400
logs for our online banking environment

1628
01:09:23,729 --> 01:09:30,509
or our brochure site even if you will

1629
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:32,339
and we can see URL injection and they're

1630
01:09:30,509 --> 01:09:33,868
getting very sophisticated in the URL

1631
01:09:32,339 --> 01:09:35,759
injection that they're doing so this

1632
01:09:33,868 --> 01:09:38,759
means that that phishing emails still

1633
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:40,889
continue to have them with with links in

1634
01:09:38,759 --> 01:09:43,439
them not necessarily for just pier

1635
01:09:40,889 --> 01:09:45,299
fishing anymore but they're doing some

1636
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:47,788
URL injection and when you try to follow

1637
01:09:45,299 --> 01:09:49,618
those links well you might end up on you

1638
01:09:47,788 --> 01:09:52,429
know maybe the the Google toolbar

1639
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:55,170
installer or some other you know

1640
01:09:52,429 --> 01:09:57,239
innocuous thing so where do I report

1641
01:09:55,170 --> 01:09:59,130
that and that's one of the reasons why I

1642
01:09:57,239 --> 01:10:01,079
was interested in this panel is because

1643
01:09:59,130 --> 01:10:02,969
what do I do with that do I just give it

1644
01:10:01,079 --> 01:10:04,920
to my firewall vendor is that enough

1645
01:10:02,969 --> 01:10:06,770
right how do we how are we going to

1646
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:09,570
solve some of these problems because as

1647
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:11,630
as we see them you know the information

1648
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:14,549
that we get may not be actionable for us

1649
01:10:11,630 --> 01:10:16,590
right I can't get this into to the

1650
01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:19,469
browsers I can't get it into that list I

1651
01:10:16,590 --> 01:10:21,000
don't have any direct input to that but

1652
01:10:19,469 --> 01:10:23,699
I'm getting information that is

1653
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:26,699
actionable right talked about phishing

1654
01:10:23,699 --> 01:10:29,070
we get reports that well I got a text

1655
01:10:26,699 --> 01:10:31,409
message it came from this number well

1656
01:10:29,070 --> 01:10:32,820
okay the number spoofed so I can't even

1657
01:10:31,409 --> 01:10:34,949
figure out which carrier I would want to

1658
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:36,509
give it to and even if I could and I

1659
01:10:34,949 --> 01:10:41,129
called them up are they gonna respond to

1660
01:10:36,510 --> 01:10:43,230
me and the number was spoofed so you

1661
01:10:41,130 --> 01:10:44,519
know it's not actionable for me but

1662
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:46,299
there must be someone who can take

1663
01:10:44,519 --> 01:10:48,789
action and we've got to get better at

1664
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:50,320
and the the public/private things that

1665
01:10:48,789 --> 01:10:54,099
we've talked about some of the the ice

1666
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:56,469
axe they move very slowly and so I

1667
01:10:54,099 --> 01:10:58,480
wanted to make sure that we all you know

1668
01:10:56,469 --> 01:11:01,449
are mindful that that the the folks

1669
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:02,799
behind this have no rules and we have to

1670
01:11:01,449 --> 01:11:04,839
look by the rules but we have to

1671
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:07,150
continue to get creative and get faster

1672
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:09,519
at this so and they also move very

1673
01:11:07,150 --> 01:11:11,320
quickly they do all right I mean because

1674
01:11:09,519 --> 01:11:14,499
I mean to the some points that were made

1675
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:16,960
earlier today at another meeting the

1676
01:11:14,499 --> 01:11:18,789
attack takes that long after all the

1677
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:22,480
reconnaissance and everything the attack

1678
01:11:18,789 --> 01:11:26,050
boom it's very fast and you know we need

1679
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:27,480
to be in a reactive mode and a sharing

1680
01:11:26,050 --> 01:11:33,480
mode to try and protect our neighbors

1681
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:33,480
far as I'm concerned okay yes

1682
01:11:44,170 --> 01:12:20,270
that's do we you know unfortunately a

1683
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:24,320
lot of stuff gets thrown into that

1684
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:26,660
Uncategorized category and later on it's

1685
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:29,509
found to be fairly virulent and it's

1686
01:12:26,660 --> 01:12:31,130
because I mean two rods point human

1687
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:33,110
beings got to check this stuff out I

1688
01:12:31,130 --> 01:12:37,550
don't think there's peer automation that

1689
01:12:33,110 --> 01:12:39,019
can be used in that there's a couple of

1690
01:12:37,550 --> 01:12:41,150
points there yeah you can use some

1691
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:42,500
automation to a certain point but you

1692
01:12:41,150 --> 01:12:44,179
have to you have to train the the

1693
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:45,830
machines how to do it and they keep

1694
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:47,710
morphing things right so there's that I

1695
01:12:45,830 --> 01:12:50,480
think there are some statistics around

1696
01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:52,000
the question you're talking about there

1697
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:54,679
is where the word is this stuff show up

1698
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,150
back when fishing started and a lot of

1699
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:57,920
the original malware stuff it was they

1700
01:12:56,150 --> 01:13:00,200
were registering domain names and they

1701
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:02,690
were you know and it was on black or on

1702
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:05,210
a bulletproof hosting out of Russia so

1703
01:13:02,690 --> 01:13:06,589
you say okay those bad IP space is evil

1704
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:08,480
anything showing up there I know it's

1705
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:09,800
bad and those domain names being

1706
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:11,059
registered by these good know those

1707
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:13,640
techniques continue to this day

1708
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:16,700
but most of the stuff that we see is on

1709
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:19,880
compromised sites and worse you're

1710
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:21,920
seeing a shift towards compromising ad

1711
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:26,720
networks which then gets you on to the

1712
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:28,400
categorized good sites and bad network

1713
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:29,990
guys are in denial around this and

1714
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:33,620
that's a real hole we have right now as

1715
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:36,019
though the whole ad network space and

1716
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:39,650
this may sound a little bit like you

1717
01:13:36,020 --> 01:13:41,690
know the finger and the dike but one of

1718
01:13:39,650 --> 01:13:44,690
the techniques that I like to look at is

1719
01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:51,320
now bound traffic for anything that I

1720
01:13:44,690 --> 01:13:53,059
know is an ISP DHCP I just think that's

1721
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:54,049
very interesting from my corporation if

1722
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:57,380
I see

1723
01:13:54,050 --> 01:14:01,760
outbound traffic destined to what I'm

1724
01:13:57,380 --> 01:14:04,190
you know 99% sure is a Comcast address

1725
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:08,390
at somebody's house in Seattle that's

1726
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:12,879
interesting traffic all right let's get

1727
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:12,880
some good stuff here you got a question

1728
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:34,610
no actually I'm surveying these guys

1729
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:39,920
where do you find out NVIDIA tell do you

1730
01:14:34,610 --> 01:14:41,030
think that scales well so you want to

1731
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:44,200
take us back to three guys in the room

1732
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:44,200
talking about what happened last week

1733
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:48,969
well I mean it is happening right

1734
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:51,200
everybody's got their trusted network

1735
01:14:48,970 --> 01:14:52,940
there's a ton of them but then and we

1736
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:55,370
very that's a great place to share

1737
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:57,980
techniques in information about where

1738
01:14:55,370 --> 01:15:01,010
stuff is going but the actual doing real

1739
01:14:57,980 --> 01:15:03,379
time scalable your blocking or

1740
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:06,410
transmission of information you can't do

1741
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:09,250
that you know that and over a trust

1742
01:15:06,410 --> 01:15:11,630
group it just doesn't scale no and

1743
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:13,490
automation is needed here and know kind

1744
01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:15,200
of where the discussion is going but but

1745
01:15:13,490 --> 01:15:17,480
but the elegance thing how can it be

1746
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:19,760
brought to bear on these problems number

1747
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:22,009
one is we've all got to get over it

1748
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:24,620
you share information nobody's gonna

1749
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:29,420
fire you especially in the public sector

1750
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:30,820
right yeah Adam can see yeah any other

1751
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:33,380
thoughts on that

1752
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:36,679
it's I'm so I want to get this something

1753
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:39,770
good stuff you got it yeah I mean we

1754
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:41,660
want we want and we need to get there we

1755
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:44,240
need to do more than technical solutions

1756
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:48,349
we have to find ways to to share this

1757
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:50,719
information as I said this is what I was

1758
01:15:48,350 --> 01:15:52,820
alluding to many of us are sitting on

1759
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:55,490
information that is not actionable for

1760
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:57,650
us but it is actionable for one of the

1761
01:15:55,490 --> 01:15:59,120
other organizations that we know and we

1762
01:15:57,650 --> 01:16:01,250
got to find a way to get it there right

1763
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:03,050
exactly right you've dealt with it but

1764
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:09,050
you know helps to help your neighbor out

1765
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:11,690
here so so let's talk about the with a

1766
01:16:09,050 --> 01:16:15,740
buzz phrase of gross phrase of the

1767
01:16:11,690 --> 01:16:18,349
decade here the the apt all right so

1768
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:21,800
let's I know yeah we got to do this we

1769
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:24,380
got to do this so let's say let's say

1770
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:26,750
you found something that was so targeted

1771
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:28,700
and it was directed against your

1772
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:30,890
intellectual property or your

1773
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:33,679
infrastructure or something like that

1774
01:16:30,890 --> 01:16:37,600
and this is not the kind of thing that

1775
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:40,010
is going to really help your neighbors

1776
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:42,800
because this is really targeted against

1777
01:16:40,010 --> 01:16:47,330
you right so now you're in a position of

1778
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:50,720
having to decide who to tell for help

1779
01:16:47,330 --> 01:16:52,280
and it may have a regulatory impact how

1780
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:53,960
do you escalate this up to the correct

1781
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:58,240
level of government and/or to law

1782
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:58,240
enforcement what's what is germane here

1783
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:08,599
the definition of apt and I just went

1784
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:10,670
through when I said you found something

1785
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:12,650
that's on your network that's targeted

1786
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:15,920
yeah that was it that's the definition

1787
01:17:12,650 --> 01:17:19,219
we're going with so targeted attack and

1788
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:29,630
it's inside yeah well first of all I'm

1789
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:34,400
gonna call Mike yeah you know the the

1790
01:17:29,630 --> 01:17:36,430
honest answer for for my organization I

1791
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:39,530
can't speak for the whole fi space but

1792
01:17:36,430 --> 01:17:43,010
is fairly prescribed with what I'm going

1793
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:45,349
to do one we have some insurance to

1794
01:17:43,010 --> 01:17:47,780
cover such events that is very

1795
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:51,440
prescriptive in how we should deal with

1796
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:53,300
it including the forensics right so

1797
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:56,480
we're gonna make sure that that we we do

1798
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:58,460
that and we have some particular folks

1799
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:59,599
we're going to work with service

1800
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:02,780
providers that are going to help with

1801
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:04,280
that but again being in that five space

1802
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:05,990
there's a credit union we're gonna

1803
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:08,389
report to the state because we're state

1804
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:11,510
chartered we're also going to report to

1805
01:18:08,390 --> 01:18:14,330
our insurer if we were federally insured

1806
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:17,240
it it changes a little bit and if you're

1807
01:18:14,330 --> 01:18:20,090
a not a credit union but a retail bank

1808
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:23,330
if you will the the reporting structure

1809
01:18:20,090 --> 01:18:24,980
is going to be you know OTC or SEC it

1810
01:18:23,330 --> 01:18:29,180
depends on really what section of that

1811
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:31,610
bank is involved so you know other than

1812
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:32,330
that there's there's no requirements for

1813
01:18:31,610 --> 01:18:35,059
where we're going to show that

1814
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:36,500
information so you got something that's

1815
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:38,090
bad you don't know if you smacked it

1816
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:40,130
down you know that it's doing something

1817
01:18:38,090 --> 01:18:45,530
really bad are you gonna go ask for help

1818
01:18:40,130 --> 01:18:49,810
you're gonna tell law enforcement we may

1819
01:18:45,530 --> 01:18:51,920
engage law enforcement but you know it

1820
01:18:49,810 --> 01:18:53,630
depends on whether or not we think that

1821
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:55,340
that we're gonna get anywhere which

1822
01:18:53,630 --> 01:18:57,290
which direction are we which direction

1823
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:58,940
are we in but it was I mean we wouldn't

1824
01:18:57,290 --> 01:18:59,370
exclude a cover II than information

1825
01:18:58,940 --> 01:19:02,580
sharing

1826
01:18:59,370 --> 01:19:04,380
but you know when you find something it

1827
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:07,380
may be a good idea to put that into some

1828
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:09,360
kind of national context so that others

1829
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:11,250
like you can be informed

1830
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:14,219
especially with indicators of compromise

1831
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:17,250
if you come up with them exactly so I

1832
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:19,680
mean to take a step back what would be

1833
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:21,480
ideal is that that we have some place

1834
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:26,910
specifically to report these things we

1835
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:30,870
talked about SEF right and but I'm not

1836
01:19:26,910 --> 01:19:41,430
sure that the FBI is that that's my

1837
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:45,000
point but yeah so for the utility we

1838
01:19:41,430 --> 01:19:48,300
have we have so many opportunities I'll

1839
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:51,000
say to be targeted just in terms of the

1840
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:54,540
type of a utility that we run and so if

1841
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:57,060
we had a targeted attack I would go to

1842
01:19:54,540 --> 01:20:01,200
Mike and then you I'm sure we have and

1843
01:19:57,060 --> 01:20:04,050
we have and we would probably go up the

1844
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:06,599
federal chain because we are federally

1845
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:08,550
regulated I'm not sure how effective it

1846
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:09,660
all could be but one of the things that

1847
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:11,820
we've been doing at City Light is

1848
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:14,610
working with the fusion center as well

1849
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:17,040
as the FBI in helping to educate them

1850
01:20:14,610 --> 01:20:19,139
ahead of time as to the vulnerabilities

1851
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:22,410
associated with our utility whether it's

1852
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:24,330
the physical security or the digital

1853
01:20:22,410 --> 01:20:26,490
security it's it's been important for us

1854
01:20:24,330 --> 01:20:29,940
to help get them more educated so that

1855
01:20:26,490 --> 01:20:33,080
they can help hear what's going on in

1856
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:35,099
the rest of the nation in the world and

1857
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:37,800
correlate some of the things that they

1858
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:40,320
hear and get it back into some kind of a

1859
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:42,900
oh I thought about you first when I

1860
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:44,990
heard bla bla bla so you know I think

1861
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:48,480
for us that's a really positive

1862
01:20:44,990 --> 01:20:50,309
collaboration because we can't be on top

1863
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:52,530
of everything that's happening nor can

1864
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:55,080
they but it's one more set of ears that

1865
01:20:52,530 --> 01:20:57,599
look that can listen to what they're

1866
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:59,550
expert at and then translate into

1867
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:01,740
something that we're expert at which is

1868
01:20:59,550 --> 01:21:06,060
not the security portion of it but more

1869
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:07,230
of the running of the utility so we're

1870
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:09,690
kind of on the other side of it where we

1871
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:12,450
are taking reports from people so if you

1872
01:21:09,690 --> 01:21:15,219
get get one of these let us know

1873
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:18,519
we have the ability to then share that

1874
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:20,620
with other people to help you know block

1875
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:21,840
those kinds of attacks I mean one thing

1876
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:25,120
I think that's important to remember is

1877
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:27,250
targeted attacks are not as targeted as

1878
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:28,720
you think typically you're not just the

1879
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:32,440
only one that's going to be be hit by

1880
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:34,840
these guys whoever these guys are and

1881
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:37,389
and you also have this issue of what

1882
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:38,980
what was the attack methodology what

1883
01:21:37,390 --> 01:21:40,380
were they going after trying to figure

1884
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:43,629
out those kinds of things and then

1885
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:47,080
responding in kind a lot of this you

1886
01:21:43,630 --> 01:21:48,370
know a lot of the apt has become to mean

1887
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:49,450
many different things to many different

1888
01:21:48,370 --> 01:21:52,269
people depending on who you're talking

1889
01:21:49,450 --> 01:21:53,500
to one of the definitions when the

1890
01:21:52,270 --> 01:21:56,920
common definitions is it's

1891
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:59,770
state-sponsored stuff right that stuff

1892
01:21:56,920 --> 01:22:02,950
is really a lot bigger than you think it

1893
01:21:59,770 --> 01:22:04,990
is I mean the the hyperbole and the in

1894
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:06,550
the press I don't know if that's if it's

1895
01:22:04,990 --> 01:22:08,800
good if it's actually covering it off

1896
01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:10,540
the ties between what we're seeing

1897
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:12,460
attacking energy sector versus the

1898
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:14,380
financial sector versus the government

1899
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:16,510
sector that a lot of it leads back to

1900
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:19,000
there's a very same places and it's

1901
01:22:16,510 --> 01:22:21,250
coming out of the same places but in the

1902
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,750
in in there as well as a bunch of more

1903
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:24,340
comedy crime stuff where they're just

1904
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:26,740
trying to get stuff on the systems or to

1905
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:27,970
be able to extract information out so

1906
01:22:26,740 --> 01:22:30,429
you don't and then you have the whole

1907
01:22:27,970 --> 01:22:32,980
anarchist groups right which is great

1908
01:22:30,430 --> 01:22:34,870
cover for everybody else out there so

1909
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:37,299
you don't necessarily know what in why

1910
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:39,550
if you're if you're if you user database

1911
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:42,250
ends up on a spin that was probably an

1912
01:22:39,550 --> 01:22:43,720
anarchist right probably not necessarily

1913
01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:48,130
the problem with a narc is yeah

1914
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:50,050
hacktivists type but a lot of this stuff

1915
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:52,030
and the techniques are being used in the

1916
01:22:50,050 --> 01:22:53,800
same places the same we just had a

1917
01:22:52,030 --> 01:22:58,420
there's a great report from Symantec out

1918
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:59,770
last week remember than what dude from

1919
01:22:58,420 --> 01:23:03,250
call see they would cuddle

1920
01:22:59,770 --> 01:23:06,550
what's that no it was it was actually

1921
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:08,650
the it'll it'll burry or something that

1922
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:11,560
it basically tied everything they went

1923
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:14,379
on with Aurora Aurora and Google it's

1924
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:16,600
really Hall right well right but it was

1925
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:16,990
it tied all these things together with

1926
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:19,570
that

1927
01:23:16,990 --> 01:23:20,329
elderberry Elderwood don't know what

1928
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:27,759
there

1929
01:23:20,329 --> 01:23:30,860
oh yes networks knows of elderberries

1930
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:32,480
so yeah and and we've seen this a lot

1931
01:23:30,860 --> 01:23:34,040
and kind of the infrastructure stuff we

1932
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:35,299
look at is that these things are all

1933
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:38,449
tied together and they've been going on

1934
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:39,770
for years literally so kind of keeping

1935
01:23:38,449 --> 01:23:41,808
it close to the vest isn't really

1936
01:23:39,770 --> 01:23:44,210
helpful because you your neighbors and

1937
01:23:41,809 --> 01:23:46,550
are all getting hit by the same thing

1938
01:23:44,210 --> 01:23:48,170
and it'd be beneficial for everybody to

1939
01:23:46,550 --> 01:23:50,300
actually know about these things and be

1940
01:23:48,170 --> 01:23:51,920
able to do something about them so but

1941
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:54,860
there isn't there aren't mechanisms for

1942
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:57,290
it there's some work being done in the

1943
01:23:54,860 --> 01:23:58,699
FBI like NC FTA folks are looking at

1944
01:23:57,290 --> 01:24:05,090
this stuff but they're a bit of a black

1945
01:23:58,699 --> 01:24:06,530
hole as well you have to yeah there's a

1946
01:24:05,090 --> 01:24:07,790
two way and it's kind of ended up being

1947
01:24:06,530 --> 01:24:09,860
one of the vendors you know various

1948
01:24:07,790 --> 01:24:11,989
vendors you know Symantec the McAfee and

1949
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:15,409
all the the folks they have stuff they

1950
01:24:11,989 --> 01:24:18,138
deploy so if you report it to all of

1951
01:24:15,409 --> 01:24:20,000
them then they'll all have something

1952
01:24:18,139 --> 01:24:22,040
that can maybe help you with but they're

1953
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,480
not there only so good at sharing that

1954
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:25,969
information back and forth amongst each

1955
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:27,500
other i okay so let's get on this topic

1956
01:24:25,969 --> 01:24:30,500
here because I think this is a big deal

1957
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:34,730
this how to inform the vendors of things

1958
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:37,940
that you have found right so we're by no

1959
01:24:34,730 --> 01:24:38,750
virustotal right virustotal you put some

1960
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:41,629
stuff in there

1961
01:24:38,750 --> 01:24:44,989
three of the vendors figure it out and

1962
01:24:41,630 --> 01:24:47,150
the other you know 39 don't they get

1963
01:24:44,989 --> 01:24:49,489
informed right here's a piece of malware

1964
01:24:47,150 --> 01:24:51,079
you didn't get so figure it out and get

1965
01:24:49,489 --> 01:24:53,030
a signature out for this that actually

1966
01:24:51,079 --> 01:24:54,980
works pretty well if it's working as

1967
01:24:53,030 --> 01:25:02,179
advertised and I don't know that I can

1968
01:24:54,980 --> 01:25:04,308
confirm that I did okay so if if

1969
01:25:02,179 --> 01:25:06,980
technology vendors supplied a good

1970
01:25:04,309 --> 01:25:10,880
feedback loop and could somehow

1971
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:14,808
incentivize their customers to to do

1972
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:16,730
this you know what would we do it right

1973
01:25:14,809 --> 01:25:17,599
and and and what would you tell vendors

1974
01:25:16,730 --> 01:25:21,919
in this regard

1975
01:25:17,599 --> 01:25:25,760
right because ideally right so something

1976
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:27,739
Symantec knows about would be real handy

1977
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:29,480
to get into web sense if web sense

1978
01:25:27,739 --> 01:25:31,780
didn't know about it because these like

1979
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:33,980
blended email threats with bad links

1980
01:25:31,780 --> 01:25:37,130
kind of split the difference between

1981
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:38,839
to vendors right and and many of those

1982
01:25:37,130 --> 01:25:40,580
vendors have like one-to-one

1983
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:42,290
relationships or one to a few

1984
01:25:40,580 --> 01:25:43,910
relationships back and forth where they

1985
01:25:42,290 --> 01:25:44,720
will share some that information at

1986
01:25:43,910 --> 01:25:47,000
least when they don't think they're

1987
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:48,770
competing with each other but if you'll

1988
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,570
notice the kinds of reports that come

1989
01:25:48,770 --> 01:25:52,489
out about I discovered this botnet and

1990
01:25:50,570 --> 01:25:53,750
it's doing all this stuff and they'll

1991
01:25:52,489 --> 01:25:55,219
tell you all about the AV they'll give

1992
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:56,750
you the md5 hash of that because they

1993
01:25:55,220 --> 01:25:58,430
share that information all right but

1994
01:25:56,750 --> 01:26:00,860
when it comes to things like you could

1995
01:25:58,430 --> 01:26:04,370
identify on your network like particular

1996
01:26:00,860 --> 01:26:07,639
URL patterns or IP addresses they're

1997
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:08,989
always grayed out so that you can't so

1998
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:10,130
the other everybody else reading this

1999
01:26:08,989 --> 01:26:11,269
now they say they don't want the bad

2000
01:26:10,130 --> 01:26:13,220
guys well the bad guys already know that

2001
01:26:11,270 --> 01:26:15,800
they've been made right this is this is

2002
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:19,190
so we have to get past this communis

2003
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:23,060
this the the nature of the data itself

2004
01:26:19,190 --> 01:26:24,620
is is very transient right what's what's

2005
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:25,580
here in attacking you today is going to

2006
01:26:24,620 --> 01:26:26,930
be moving somewhere else

2007
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:28,670
it's techniques and things like that

2008
01:26:26,930 --> 01:26:31,250
that are really important and how you

2009
01:26:28,670 --> 01:26:33,230
apply that data and to protecting things

2010
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:35,210
is really your weight competitive

2011
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:37,219
advantages so the data we have to get

2012
01:26:35,210 --> 01:26:45,710
past this idea that data is so how gold

2013
01:26:37,220 --> 01:26:49,220
and should be reported yeah and just to

2014
01:26:45,710 --> 01:26:50,630
follow on there you know as a as

2015
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:53,570
somebody just trying to protect an

2016
01:26:50,630 --> 01:26:58,370
organization you know and the Big C of

2017
01:26:53,570 --> 01:27:04,370
this stuff you know that it's not nicely

2018
01:26:58,370 --> 01:27:07,309
or easy to hear because you kind of lose

2019
01:27:04,370 --> 01:27:09,260
my thought here but you know this

2020
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:12,860
information is out there and it

2021
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:15,230
shouldn't be monetized just because we

2022
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:19,040
can right I mean this is the it's kind

2023
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:22,599
of an odd thing right we want to be

2024
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:26,030
capitalists exactly but at the same time

2025
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:28,910
we're kind of getting you know it handed

2026
01:27:26,030 --> 01:27:31,639
to us on a plate so if if I don't have

2027
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:34,160
providers that have this information

2028
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:35,660
then then as an organization I mean

2029
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:37,910
because i'm in the business making loans

2030
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:40,190
i'm not going to go out and become an

2031
01:27:37,910 --> 01:27:41,780
expert in in all of these things and

2032
01:27:40,190 --> 01:27:44,239
gathering this information I'm not in a

2033
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:46,519
position to do that but as an

2034
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:47,809
organization I really would like to be

2035
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:50,390
able to take action at

2036
01:27:47,810 --> 01:27:51,410
what's left of the perimeter when it

2037
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:54,970
went over

2038
01:27:51,410 --> 01:27:54,970
you know capable right

2039
01:27:58,750 --> 01:28:01,819
[Music]

2040
01:28:07,430 --> 01:28:10,569
[Music]

2041
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:16,639
[Music]

2042
01:28:17,850 --> 01:28:22,050
that's a great question I would ask that

2043
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:25,019
in fact I got a follow up question on

2044
01:28:22,050 --> 01:28:28,470
here about the difficulty and sharing

2045
01:28:25,020 --> 01:28:30,390
information in your sector and so if

2046
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:33,120
information was going to be applicable

2047
01:28:30,390 --> 01:28:34,920
to me I would think it would be

2048
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:37,170
applicable to other state local tribal

2049
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:40,680
territorial governments and that's who I

2050
01:28:37,170 --> 01:28:43,230
would share that with so I think from

2051
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:44,940
that example I would say interest sector

2052
01:28:43,230 --> 01:28:49,309
but that's not necessarily the whole

2053
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:49,309
answer you got an idea here what's that

2054
01:28:53,570 --> 01:28:59,759
right well that's the world we live in

2055
01:28:57,870 --> 01:29:02,130
now isn't it I mean I really do think

2056
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:03,630
that we need technology in fact I think

2057
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:06,660
it would be a very interesting startup

2058
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:09,720
for somebody to build a company that

2059
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:12,420
brokered information between vendors

2060
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:14,850
like that for licensing and that's why I

2061
01:29:12,420 --> 01:29:18,150
was really excited to be a part of this

2062
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:20,910
is because I think this is is really you

2063
01:29:18,150 --> 01:29:23,820
know we have other models where we're

2064
01:29:20,910 --> 01:29:25,410
doing quite well but there were there's

2065
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:29,030
some centralization so I'll give you an

2066
01:29:25,410 --> 01:29:31,139
example it's in the credit-card space I

2067
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:33,599
don't care who you got your credit card

2068
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:37,490
from it is being run through Bayesian

2069
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:40,290
logic for anomalies in your behavior and

2070
01:29:37,490 --> 01:29:42,120
that information gets back to whoever if

2071
01:29:40,290 --> 01:29:43,980
you do that credit card and it gets back

2072
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:46,140
there in like a real time one

2073
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:50,490
transaction and we're done

2074
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:53,040
so models exist but in our space in the

2075
01:29:50,490 --> 01:29:55,050
you know the pure technology space you

2076
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:56,430
know if we get my vertical of Fi when

2077
01:29:55,050 --> 01:29:58,350
we're talking about working the inter

2078
01:29:56,430 --> 01:30:00,900
connecting all these computers we're

2079
01:29:58,350 --> 01:30:04,980
doing a really poor job and and letting

2080
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:07,740
folks use it the fact that we have to

2081
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:10,530
live by rules and provide privacy for

2082
01:30:07,740 --> 01:30:12,420
our constituents and so we have to find

2083
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:15,300
a better better model and a public

2084
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:19,950
private information well it's a great

2085
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:22,470
effort it really is this section between

2086
01:30:19,950 --> 01:30:24,660
three men in a room and us getting

2087
01:30:22,470 --> 01:30:26,490
together in this room and understanding

2088
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:29,630
who's got what capabilities and how we

2089
01:30:26,490 --> 01:30:29,630
can share those capabilities

2090
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:37,650
and we did him in touch about on the a

2091
01:30:35,789 --> 01:30:39,630
whole host of issues around yeah I get

2092
01:30:37,650 --> 01:30:42,268
all kinds yeah we got we got regulatory

2093
01:30:39,630 --> 01:30:43,619
issues we got policy issues we we a part

2094
01:30:42,269 --> 01:30:45,269
of a part of problem is people don't

2095
01:30:43,619 --> 01:30:47,308
feel they can't because they're

2096
01:30:45,269 --> 01:30:49,320
constrained so we need safe harbor issue

2097
01:30:47,309 --> 01:30:50,940
you know types of thing these are being

2098
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:52,320
talked about at the policy level they're

2099
01:30:50,940 --> 01:30:53,909
the only oh and kind of the failed

2100
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:57,150
cybersecurity legislation or some safe

2101
01:30:53,909 --> 01:30:58,650
harbor things but then then there's the

2102
01:30:57,150 --> 01:30:59,820
okay this is we're talking about the

2103
01:30:58,650 --> 01:31:02,909
United States of America this is

2104
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:04,289
worldwide right all of this stuff is and

2105
01:31:02,909 --> 01:31:05,670
I think you talk about the credit card

2106
01:31:04,289 --> 01:31:07,860
industry there's an incentive there

2107
01:31:05,670 --> 01:31:09,809
right right so we don't have the our

2108
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:12,539
incentives aren't online this is the

2109
01:31:09,809 --> 01:31:14,789
biggest problem we have right so how do

2110
01:31:12,539 --> 01:31:18,389
we do that without forcing people to do
