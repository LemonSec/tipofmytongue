1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:13,950
it might be interesting to you to know a

2
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:15,900
little bit about my practice I I work in

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,369
a 900 person law firm it's an

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,970
international law firm called McGuire

5
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:26,308
wood and I am the head of what's called

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:27,598
the data privacy and security group they

7
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:35,370
didn't really have any of that when I

8
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:39,750
went to college to your point we have 41

9
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:43,110
lawyers in my group I have 41 people

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,750
that want to work with me and want to

11
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:48,090
work in this area of the law

12
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:50,610
and that should suggest to you several

13
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,760
things that if that many lawyers want to

14
00:00:50,610 --> 00:01:02,170
become involved with your business that

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:03,709
may not be a good thing and the reason

16
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:08,430
[Music]

17
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:10,619
is because of data breaches my practice

18
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:14,639
area is regarded by my contemporaries as

19
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:16,740
being very sexy and for me for a lawyer

20
00:01:14,639 --> 00:01:19,679
working with people like you is regarded

21
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,568
as being very sexy practice of law it's

22
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:23,159
not drafting wills it's out there

23
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:26,039
cutting doing cutting-edge stuff and

24
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,139
trying to respond to really high tech

25
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:30,479
threats some of which are AI tech and

26
00:01:28,139 --> 00:01:34,649
some of the some of them as we know are

27
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,869
no tech and but it's it's a great area

28
00:01:34,649 --> 00:01:39,749
of the law so this is what this is kind

29
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:41,279
of the overview the theft of personal

30
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:41,880
information by the Russians the

31
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:45,889
vulgarians

32
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:48,719
unaffiliated gangs in US and Europe

33
00:01:45,889 --> 00:01:51,749
depth of trade secrets the advanced

34
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:54,568
persistent threat by China the advanced

35
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:56,908
persistent threat should be a major

36
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:58,709
sales point you were talking a few

37
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:04,439
minutes about go about the Tulsa

38
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:08,429
organization hear that all the time the

39
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:11,880
FBI has a specific operation

40
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:14,730
I think it's called sting ray that is

41
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,260
designed to counter the advanced

42
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,959
persistent threat coming in from China

43
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,239
on a routine basis it's on the next

44
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,400
slide

45
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:26,040
Clark says that every company in the US

46
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,709
over a over a billion dollars certainly

47
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,929
has already been hacked by the Chinese

48
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:33,120
and the Chinese what I was told by the

49
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,550
National Security Agency seven years ago

50
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,200
was that the Chinese steal the

51
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:40,230
equivalent of the Library of Congress

52
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:44,160
every week from US and European

53
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:47,929
corporations it's an astronomical figure

54
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:53,790
it's proven to be absolutely correct

55
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:56,010
so in Chicago we have been close and

56
00:02:53,790 --> 00:03:01,500
personal with the hacktivism threats

57
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:06,209
that are going on the no no well

58
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,489
hacktivism problem I belong to and you

59
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:10,950
should belong to

60
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:16,739
InfraGard which is the FBI

61
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:19,560
reach out program nationwide you should

62
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:23,130
also belong to the Secret Service

63
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,500
computer crime task force it's done by

64
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,930
the US Secret Service obviously it's it

65
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,910
joins a bunch of local law enforcement

66
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:33,959
organizations and both organizations are

67
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:36,660
open to and soliciting of people just

68
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:39,090
like you to come to their presentations

69
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,620
here's what the presentations are maybe

70
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,359
make the presentation but more

71
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,730
importantly the benefit that it provides

72
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:47,069
you you know down the road kind of way

73
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:50,069
is that it gives you a name to put in

74
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:52,589
your contact list it gives you the name

75
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:54,540
of an agent a couple of agents so that

76
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,459
if something goes south you can

77
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,650
immediately and you and the decision is

78
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,600
made to contact law enforcement you have

79
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,910
somebody in law enforcement that you can

80
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:06,090
contact that's an enormous benefit and

81
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:10,319
when it hits the fan it's it's just

82
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,709
priceless so so this is on a very high

83
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:19,399
level

84
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:21,389
lots of piti PII and thi now one

85
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:24,330
important distinction that you have to

86
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:27,120
know that's just really important from

87
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:29,580
the liability point of view is that from

88
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,390
the point of view of the laws and the

89
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,599
regulations and they said come down now

90
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:38,229
they

91
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:43,289
equals unauthorized access unauthorized

92
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:47,430
access equals somebody in your

93
00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:49,599
accounting section has access to

94
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,940
personal information that they shouldn't

95
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:55,330
have access to within within their own

96
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:57,940
company that's an unauthorized access of

97
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:00,609
information that unauthorized access

98
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:03,639
depending on what the information is can

99
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:05,500
trigger HIPAA concerns or a HIPAA

100
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:08,259
violation under the Health and Human

101
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:11,319
Services spectrum it can almost

102
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:14,770
certainly trigger a violation of state

103
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:16,690
data privacy laws because the state data

104
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,880
privacy laws are fashioned in a way

105
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:21,550
so unauthorized access by even people

106
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,440
inside it the own organization is the

107
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:32,610
equivalent of a data breach and needs to

108
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:37,659
be handled as such I have it in here

109
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:39,969
okay this these are the these are the

110
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:42,039
take-home lessons that a lot of a lot of

111
00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:44,560
us use to try and bring home the point

112
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:47,050
that data security happens they're

113
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,120
vulnerable ities happens everybody and

114
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:54,430
that there's a price tag that's

115
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:56,199
connected with those again here is the

116
00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:01,270
richardclark support that every

117
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:02,800
company's already been hacked these are

118
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:05,159
figures that we throw out on a routine

119
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,949
basis to try to get the attention of

120
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:10,599
CEOs and boards of directors that this

121
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:12,759
is an issue that they have to throw some

122
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:14,469
money behind they can't walk away from

123
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:17,530
it anymore and that their entire

124
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:19,270
reputation is at stake

125
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:21,520
sometimes they buy it sometimes they

126
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:24,789
don't it's just like you were saying

127
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,549
before it's security breaches never

128
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:31,180
happen to me they never happened to us I

129
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:33,750
have a program that I I should trademark

130
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:36,699
this it's called take a deep to lunch

131
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:40,240
and I every time I give a presentation

132
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:42,449
or a legal community or CEOs or boards

133
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,449
of directors

134
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,920
I tell them okay youyou don't think

135
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:51,550
you've got anything going wrong down in

136
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:53,910
the IT section take take the IT staff to

137
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:56,110
lunch and ask them what they're seeing

138
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:58,030
and if they're gonna be candid with you

139
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:00,430
they're going to be saying we see this

140
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:02,799
number of attempted pings on our system

141
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:05,650
every day we have this many attempted

142
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,870
intrusions every day and on a recurring

143
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:09,909
basis we have our firewalls breach or at

144
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,680
least you know people sticking up have

145
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:15,160
taken folks on our firewall on a

146
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,990
continuing basis every single day it's a

147
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,090
way for the people in the front office

148
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:21,040
to get a sense of just what the hostile

149
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:24,609
environment is out there in terms of

150
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:27,460
automated intrusion they're always

151
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:29,590
stunned and it immediately this is dis

152
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,570
abuses them of the idea that it can't

153
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:34,119
happen to them the only thing that's

154
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:36,280
standing between them and utter chaos is

155
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,900
you so that's that a little

156
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,789
self-promotion never hurt anybody that's

157
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:44,620
what so these are the kinds of

158
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:48,430
specialized intrusion attacks that the

159
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:53,850
FBI and you noted over the past up to

160
00:07:48,430 --> 00:08:00,040
including this March of September 2011

161
00:07:53,850 --> 00:08:04,000
these are still ongoing the malvert

162
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,500
izing issue is a very tricky one and

163
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,510
it's it's it's hard to conceptually

164
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,010
discuss this with people in the

165
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:13,390
marketing community because the

166
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:21,010
marketing community computer security

167
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:24,789
has two natural enemies lawyers and the

168
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:26,590
marketing people and each of those are

169
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:30,130
in a position that they have what they

170
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:31,780
don't know is going to hurt you in this

171
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:34,059
situation of malvert izing as you

172
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:37,360
probably know there's a device where

173
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:39,789
hackers put you know bugs of information

174
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,580
on people's web page making it appear

175
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:43,929
that they are a legitimate place for the

176
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,520
third piece of people that are going

177
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:47,290
through the webpage they will hit on

178
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,050
that bug and all the information about

179
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:52,240
the origin of the person who tried to do

180
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:54,040
legitimate work on the bit web page that

181
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,250
consumer is then downloaded to the

182
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,250
hacker

183
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:02,610
there is very professional you know

184
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,609
extensive in the Chicago area yeah

185
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,540
yeah

186
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:26,630
yep there's really no question about it

187
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:28,219
is that is that fair well sure it is

188
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:30,770
because I get paid a lot of money for

189
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,470
telling for telling the seat y'all what

190
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,610
you just told him yourself

191
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:38,570
so from my point of view it couldn't be

192
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:42,020
it couldn't be fair and the reason they

193
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:45,680
listen to me is because I talked to them

194
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:51,590
in terms of liability in terms of the

195
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:53,839
impact of poor security and these days

196
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:57,350
the Wall Street Journal that does a lot

197
00:09:53,840 --> 00:10:01,430
of my work for me because companies I

198
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:05,240
have a major I have a big client in

199
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:07,760
Rhode Island that hired me to do a

200
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,510
complete personal identifiable

201
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,069
information assessment and I said well

202
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:14,660
what why why do you see the need and

203
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,610
they said because we live in Rhode

204
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,949
Island and right next to us is the state

205
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:21,980
of Massachusetts and the Massachusetts

206
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:23,690
AG has made it very clear that he's out

207
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,120
to get companies that don't secure the

208
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:29,720
information and that's especially

209
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,640
prevalent right now because we're now on

210
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,520
the verge of election and election times

211
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:38,900
are coming up various AG offices up for

212
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:40,390
up for bids and in that environment the

213
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,920
AG's office

214
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:45,380
Illinois's a good example they want to

215
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:48,079
be able to tell the consumers of that

216
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:50,510
state I'm the I'm the one that stood up

217
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,700
for your rights as a consumer to protect

218
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:54,730
your information on all these companies

219
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:57,920
that wanted to take your information in

220
00:10:54,730 --> 00:11:00,110
not secure it and make it available to

221
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,240
hackers and other people that they come

222
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:04,910
in and would steal it all so I'm the

223
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,320
person just standing between you

224
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:08,540
distributing your information to a

225
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:12,440
company in that company selling your

226
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:15,490
information downstream that that winds

227
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:19,100
folks consumers like to hear that and

228
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:22,610
the AG's offices now are armed with the

229
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:24,200
vehicle they need to do that to make

230
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:26,840
those prosecutions and those are called

231
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,030
the the various breach notification laws

232
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,130
but we'll discuss that a little bit more

233
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,689
detail a few minutes but that's that's

234
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:35,089
the way the game is

235
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:37,970
and so the AG's are making this very

236
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:41,000
personal and bringing it up close and

237
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:43,010
while we're kind of going on that the

238
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,940
other the other thing that nobody really

239
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:49,240
ever saw coming is that the we have

240
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,240
HIPPA

241
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:58,040
never talk to a doctor about HIPAA or

242
00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:01,130
healthcare anybody but they'll just go

243
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:05,689
nuts on you when they ask me what I do I

244
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:13,820
tell them I sell cars I don't do a HIPAA

245
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:15,829
law of course I do but HIPAA Health and

246
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:19,130
Human Services authorized I think it was

247
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:22,969
500 audits there's this physical year

248
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:24,589
the audits are being done by KPMG of

249
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:28,160
course have been one of the big big five

250
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:30,850
accounting firms and so a lot of people

251
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,260
said okay the audits are done

252
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:36,740
not to worry we've got a little we got a

253
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:38,810
breathing room of about a year to work

254
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:43,250
on our systems right so ourselves up to

255
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:46,040
HIPAA compliant but Health and Human

256
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:48,170
Services threw us all a curve what they

257
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:51,709
have been doing is spending an enormous

258
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:53,540
amount of money training various

259
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:56,899
Attorney General's offices throughout

260
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:59,060
the country so the AG's can do for them

261
00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:02,269
what their federal budget won't let them

262
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:04,640
do for themselves and the beautiful

263
00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:08,060
thing from from the Health and Human

264
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:10,430
Services point of view is that the state

265
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:13,518
legislatures have already given the

266
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:16,040
tools to the AG's office to enforce

267
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,589
these health care laws because health

268
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,420
care information is classified

269
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:23,690
personally identifiable information for

270
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:26,029
purposes of state prosecution so now

271
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:28,100
what we have is instead of one central

272
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:30,230
place that's doing audits and doing

273
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:34,279
hippo searches and hip investigations

274
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:36,410
we've got 46 different locations and

275
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:38,390
it's 46 instead of 50 because their

276
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:40,880
courts are for states that don't have

277
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:43,209
data breach notification laws so we got

278
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,230
46 different jurisdictions out there

279
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:46,069
pressing the flesh trying to get

280
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:54,560
prosecutions

281
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:57,380
for loss of health care information it's

282
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,640
on here Kentucky and New Mexico

283
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:02,730
I'll think of the next one the other two

284
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,730
[Music]

285
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:16,008
really

286
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:16,009
you know

287
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:26,830
yeah well I think it was in Michigan and

288
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:27,850
in that particular situation well

289
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,980
they're been actually two of them the

290
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:33,130
kid that won was in Georgia

291
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:40,030
one was in Michigan and the one in

292
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:42,340
Michigan was a situation where Health

293
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:44,319
and Human Services and the Office of

294
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:47,170
Civil Rights and healthy human services

295
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,580
the enforcement arm for HIPAA they told

296
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:52,540
this particular company you've got HIPAA

297
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:55,360
compliance problems you're not in

298
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:57,849
compliance in under a number of

299
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,780
different levels and the company's

300
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:03,970
response was to disregard the warning so

301
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:06,579
the response of the the state government

302
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:09,130
was to find them this astronomical

303
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:11,620
amount of money was it a surprise

304
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:13,710
not exactly but this is a situation

305
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:18,760
where the company kind of had it coming

306
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:21,190
and it's sometimes people are just hard

307
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:23,319
it's hard to figure out why they don't

308
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:26,790
want to take the next logical step to

309
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,790
get this the fixes in place

310
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:45,030
I deal with data breaches all the time

311
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:49,270
and I got to tell you it's a lot of fun

312
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:52,480
and because I get to hear lots of

313
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:56,170
different war stories and when there's a

314
00:15:52,480 --> 00:16:00,010
breach these are all these are the

315
00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:03,520
people that are pointed to the IT staff

316
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:05,410
is always the first first place in first

317
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,900
people to get name they're called in to

318
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:10,540
the attorney's offices to find out what

319
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:12,130
happened how did we have a breach you've

320
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:15,699
got this enormous budget down there what

321
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:18,189
have you been doing the other people

322
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:21,310
that aren't under the gun on the people

323
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:22,570
in HR HR becomes especially involved if

324
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:24,969
there's a loss of personally

325
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:27,250
identifiable information because they

326
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,020
are being viewed as the gurus to protect

327
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,040
to help the information of the people

328
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:33,579
inside the company

329
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:36,490
so when PII is lost they come in and say

330
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:38,770
what why why weren't you putting

331
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:40,810
encryption on all this you know we have

332
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:42,760
encryption in the IT section why weren't

333
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:44,290
you using encryption in the HR session

334
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,780
to protect these healthcare records and

335
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:48,790
the records of employment and the fact

336
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:52,000
that so-and-so is gay and some so-and-so

337
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:56,530
is lesbian why is that information not

338
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:03,910
being protected by you yeah the other

339
00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:06,899
people vendors vendors are kind of a

340
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:10,750
blind spot for a lot of corporations

341
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:15,820
they get their own ship in order they go

342
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:18,119
through assessments two hours ago I was

343
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:19,839
on the phone with a really big

344
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:22,300
telecommunications company that I'm

345
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:24,669
doing a hip assessment for them and

346
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:30,159
we're at the concluding part of the

347
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:32,020
assessment and the question came up by

348
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,700
me I said what where do you stand with

349
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:39,120
respect to your vendor relationship and

350
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:42,430
the security on your vendor site and

351
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,750
they had the wrong answer the answer

352
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:45,700
we don't know we never thought about

353
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:48,430
that we thought it was good enough for

354
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:50,380
us to secure ourselves the rule of

355
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:53,110
course is that when you enter into a

356
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:55,350
contractual relationship with any

357
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:58,240
company to handle secure information

358
00:17:55,350 --> 00:18:03,040
their security level has to be as good

359
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:05,800
as or exceed your own and if it's not

360
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,990
you have created a vulnerability you've

361
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,669
created a technical vulnerability in the

362
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:12,250
real world in terms of an intrusion will

363
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:14,970
take place and be tagged to you but

364
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:22,360
you've also created an enormous legal

365
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:24,580
liability the baseline historic case on

366
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,340
this involves the American Civil

367
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:29,260
Liberties Union in that situation the

368
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:32,439
American Civil Liberties Union had

369
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:34,600
promised their vendors or their donors

370
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,510
that they would not disclose the donors

371
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:39,610
information under anything other than a

372
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:42,250
court order and that they would fight it

373
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:44,379
all the way to the Supreme Court and on

374
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,970
the strength of that donors who didn't

375
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,770
necessarily want to be connected with

376
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:49,600
the ACLU

377
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:51,430
they made the donations with the

378
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,790
understanding their information was

379
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:57,460
going to be protected there came a day

380
00:18:54,790 --> 00:19:00,940
when their donor list appeared on the

381
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:02,560
front page of the New York Times now in

382
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,420
the law enforcement community which I

383
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:07,510
was part of for 16 years as a federal

384
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:09,040
prosecutor when the donor list appears

385
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:16,180
on the front page the New York Times

386
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:18,550
that is regarded as a clue and you can

387
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:21,250
you can entertain the idea that there

388
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:24,010
has been a break break-in and the

389
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:27,010
information has been stolen the donors

390
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:29,260
were not happy and the somewhat

391
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:32,470
notorious illustrious Attorney General

392
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:33,270
Eliot Spitzer in New York was not happy

393
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:38,670
either

394
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:42,780
the ACLU reaction was totally illogical

395
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:45,130
they said it's not us it's our vendor

396
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:47,649
the vendor had poor security

397
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:49,120
inadequate security we did what we

398
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:50,830
thought was due diligence on the vendor

399
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,919
but lo and behold they had a

400
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:55,090
vulnerability that got exploited so we

401
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,340
will be your

402
00:19:55,090 --> 00:20:00,370
witness mr. Spitzer against our vendor

403
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:04,030
board for the dastardly deed they've

404
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:07,239
done to us Eliot Spitzer's response was

405
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:10,750
good I will accept you as my witness but

406
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:12,820
I'm still gonna prosecute you and his

407
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:17,080
rationale which is the rationale of the

408
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:19,300
law in this area is that vendor

409
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:23,530
liability flows through to the person

410
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:25,840
that hired them so the vendor was liable

411
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:28,510
in that situation and the ACLU was still

412
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,550
viable that is the rule throughout this

413
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:32,560
this environment so if you talk to the

414
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:35,139
AG's office about a vendor that did you

415
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,790
wrong he's going to say well okay I'm

416
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:39,540
gonna go after the vendor but I'm also

417
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:39,540
going to go after you

418
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,940
there haven't been a lot of cases

419
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:57,060
because doing that kind of that level of

420
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:58,380
due diligence kills the case and from a

421
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:00,720
prosecution point of view

422
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:02,700
it kills the case as well because the

423
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,610
sexy the sexy person you want to

424
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:07,020
prosecute is the big corporation there's

425
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:09,800
not much bang for your buck to go after

426
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,800
a vendor

427
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:21,649
there's not a lot of case law but

428
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:24,429
there's an awful lot of legal legal

429
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:24,430
action in this area

430
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,650
the

431
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:56,480
that works that works as of now that

432
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:58,429
works now I see I don't want to make you

433
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,880
I don't want to let you have a warm cozy

434
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:06,290
feeling about this this session here I

435
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:09,140
say as of now because in HIPAA the

436
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:11,480
Security Rule is just about on the verge

437
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:14,660
of becoming final it was supposed to be

438
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,070
a final rule back in May and then it was

439
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,990
going to be a final rule in June and

440
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:19,490
then it was a final rule in July and now

441
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:21,620
it's become part of a political football

442
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:24,710
situation so we won't probably have a

443
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:26,870
final rule until after the election the

444
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:29,420
significance of the final rule for the

445
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:31,689
conversation we're having right here is

446
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:42,320
that the final rule kind of sets aside

447
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:49,610
all of that and okay a few words about

448
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:52,159
from my sponsor hip HIPAA is designed

449
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:58,820
for healthcare organizations think

450
00:22:52,160 --> 00:23:01,760
hospitals pharmacies doctors often there

451
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:04,310
is a subsection of HIPAA that deals with

452
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:07,100
a special category of cat referred to as

453
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:09,710
a business associate a business

454
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:13,370
associate is somebody that helps you

455
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:16,190
helps the healthcare environment it

456
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:18,820
could be a telecommunications company it

457
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:22,100
can be any number of support companies

458
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:24,439
these business associates are defined by

459
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:26,959
the fact that they as part of their work

460
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,720
part of their network environment they

461
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,660
have personal eat what's called Eph I

462
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,950
electric health information passing

463
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:38,900
through their environment that belongs

464
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:42,500
to the healthcare provider now the rule

465
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:44,450
with respect to business associate was

466
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:47,120
that you could you could satisfy your

467
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:48,410
obligations by doing that kind of due

468
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,189
diligence discussion that you were

469
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:53,570
talking about

470
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:55,130
and the thought was and the indications

471
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:57,710
the early indications from the

472
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:59,990
enforcement arm OSI our office of civil

473
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:01,059
rights of Health and Human Services or

474
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:03,159
that you know

475
00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:05,980
you didn't need to go to the nth degree

476
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:08,940
in order just to satisfy due diligence

477
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:11,409
that seemed to be a good logical result

478
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:14,379
the problem is that the new security

479
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:16,749
rule is going to have a provision that

480
00:24:14,379 --> 00:24:20,080
says that the business associates have

481
00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:23,860
to have the same HIPAA hi-tech Security

482
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:26,320
Rule assessment done on them that the

483
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:31,508
healthcare provider does and it gets

484
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:35,519
better if you are a vendor to a business

485
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:38,200
associate who is working for a hospital

486
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:40,600
the vendor to the business associate

487
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,220
will also have to meet the assessment

488
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,908
requirements and meet the security

489
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:48,879
requirements of the health of HIPAA and

490
00:24:45,909 --> 00:24:51,009
so in fact the business associates will

491
00:24:48,879 --> 00:24:54,998
have business associates agreements

492
00:24:51,009 --> 00:24:56,379
going down the line now you tell me if

493
00:24:54,999 --> 00:24:59,789
you don't think I'm in a great area of

494
00:24:56,379 --> 00:24:59,789
the law I mean for crying out loud

495
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:19,809
no no you you you still have to we're

496
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:22,779
gonna get in that whole thing of hosting

497
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:27,549
Colo all that that discussions coming up

498
00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:30,970
like I can feel it the critical thing is

499
00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:35,760
whether or not you have access to EPA

500
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:37,539
John if you handle you pH I obviously

501
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,090
you're going to be you're going to have

502
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:45,908
to be qualified under the HIPAA Security

503
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:50,080
Rule the tricky part is if you have

504
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:52,270
access to EPA Chive only on a periodic

505
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,340
basis visualize the managed hosting

506
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:56,559
environment where you're going in to

507
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:58,240
make sure the environment is secure that

508
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,918
the fixes are in that the patches are in

509
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,570
and just you know periodically you know

510
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:05,710
you you're answering a stress call you

511
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:07,779
go in on a on a routine basis it has to

512
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:09,190
be a routine basis as opposed to an

513
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:11,320
emergency basis but if you go in on a

514
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:14,559
routine basis and just monitor the way

515
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:17,439
the system is going and you have access

516
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:20,139
even temporary access that eph I then

517
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,549
you become a business associate and have

518
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:24,490
to have a business associate agreement

519
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:28,570
and meet the security climate the

520
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:29,770
tougher problem is working through the

521
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:31,510
distinction or it's a difficult

522
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:33,970
difficult one for me I'm sure it's not

523
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:36,419
difficult for you but to always make the

524
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:41,140
where's the bright line between a Colo

525
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:43,090
and a managed hosting environment and

526
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:47,470
that's that changes from contract and

527
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:49,629
agreement to right down the line and so

528
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:51,730
what what we have to do what I have to

529
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:54,250
do and what with my clients is to kind

530
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:58,620
of set aside what I would grow as

531
00:26:54,250 --> 00:27:02,260
traditional technology jargon Colo

532
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:05,678
management Oh sting hosting just kind of

533
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:09,669
set that aside and say do you see Eph I

534
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:11,770
on routine basis yes or no if you do as

535
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:14,590
a matter of routine you're gonna have to

536
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:16,929
meet the security requirement or get the

537
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:19,870
kinds of reps and warranties that you'll

538
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:21,299
be talking about over there so this is

539
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:24,840
an area that you just have to kind of

540
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:24,840
pay attention to

541
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,040
yeah

542
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:48,230
it's a good point obviously but you need

543
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:50,870
to understand that there's a flexibility

544
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:54,410
requirement built into the definition of

545
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:57,260
the HIPAA and the flexibility

546
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:59,660
requirement recognizes that small

547
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:02,390
vendors can't afford to do the complete

548
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:04,850
risk assessment that's called for by a

549
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:08,120
major healthcare organization and so

550
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:10,010
it's a balancing test candidly the

551
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:13,070
balancing test weighs heavily in favor

552
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:16,580
of securing your environment and but the

553
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:18,439
other way that vendors are impacted

554
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:20,300
then you somebody help me with you or

555
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:23,200
one of people down services making the

556
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:26,149
idea and security as a marketing tool

557
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,820
vendors are starting to use the fact

558
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:31,690
that they have our HIPAA compliance as a

559
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:34,310
sales tool to make themselves attractive

560
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:37,130
to telecommunications companies that

561
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:39,770
need a vendor for handling HIPAA kinds

562
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:41,090
of issues because that makes it easier

563
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:43,400
for the telecommunications company

564
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:45,169
because if the vendor says that they're

565
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,730
HIPAA compliant and makes that assertion

566
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:48,650
and makes the representations and

567
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:50,570
warranties that they've done the

568
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:51,830
assessment and they've checked out you

569
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:54,350
know they have encryption or they don't

570
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:56,540
have encryption what they've done in

571
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:58,520
terms of logging automatic log off all

572
00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:00,170
the requirements if the vendor will make

573
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,510
those representations where that makes

574
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:04,820
it a no-brainer deal you know this

575
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:06,740
vendor may have a better price but this

576
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:09,290
vendor is higher but they're hired

577
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:11,120
because they're HIPAA compliant and we

578
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:15,909
can pass liability on to them and

579
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,909
they'll be able to stand up to the test

580
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,960
there is

581
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:39,360
you guys are acting pretty good

582
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:41,219
questions there is a if you go to no one

583
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,929
for you she got into light too

584
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:48,120
and you have to tell the lighting too so

585
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:54,890
I'm on a hip assessment Dunham they'll

586
00:29:48,120 --> 00:30:02,010
say okay you might regard a significant

587
00:29:54,890 --> 00:30:05,820
lack certain regarded sniffing and so

588
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:07,500
they start going through and I'm sorry

589
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,760
what was your question yeah I was

590
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,140
thinking about the bill that we got from

591
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:19,770
the white teacher were like highs are

592
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:22,880
just yes yes okay I'm sorry you're a

593
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:26,330
okay so delighting to so do the baseline

594
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:30,600
assessment under the Security Rule 168

595
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:33,570
corn 164 and they will give you a gap

596
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:36,600
analysis and unfortunate but they won't

597
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:41,370
offer an opinion as to whether or not

598
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:44,219
you are HIPAA compliant and the company

599
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:48,300
that hires them virtually although why

600
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:49,980
do we pay all this money for the white

601
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:52,980
comes back and say we can give you a

602
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:55,380
certification that says that your HIPAA

603
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:59,010
compliant and the certification will be

604
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,850
good as of this day is a four o'clock

605
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:06,390
this afternoon

606
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:08,879
your HIPAA compliant yeah you know yeah

607
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:11,160
10 minutes later the hell we don't know

608
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,320
about that but as of this day on this

609
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:15,330
time your HIPAA compliant in that

610
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:18,500
certification winner guess what it's

611
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:18,500
going to cost you a lot more money

612
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:45,909
yeah all right

613
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,780
yep

614
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:29,490
um

615
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:45,889
[Music]

616
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:45,890
[Laughter]

617
00:32:53,310 --> 00:33:07,929
yeah down the road there will be a

618
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:10,270
federal there will be a federal

619
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:13,150
intervention now it's not going to help

620
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:16,900
with HIPAA HIPAA has kind of created a

621
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:18,040
life of its own and the only thing

622
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,890
that's going to reverse the trend on

623
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:23,920
HIPAA is if studies start to show that

624
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:26,590
in fact serious serious ramifications

625
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:28,090
are flowing from not being able to

626
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:34,919
distribute the information to people

627
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:40,720
that need to have it and trust me every

628
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:43,080
yep well death happens to all of us and

629
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,080
so they'd you know

630
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:53,740
all right that's I think that's the

631
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:56,710
perfect response what what four years

632
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:59,260
the federal government has had various

633
00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:03,700
federal security standards for

634
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:05,800
corporations that have been bouncing

635
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:07,390
back and then reviewed by various

636
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:11,889
committees and all but there currently

637
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:14,230
is no Federal Security Standards no in

638
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:16,299
the absence of that vacuum we have the

639
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:18,310
state of Massachusetts we have the state

640
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:21,010
of California we have the state of

641
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:24,130
Illinois we have various states weighing

642
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:26,320
in and eager to weigh in on what the

643
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:31,929
protection of the information that their

644
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:36,159
citizens should be so the difficulty

645
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:39,010
that comes to my clients is not so much

646
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:41,830
from it's not from the federal

647
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:44,620
government it's from tries is to try and

648
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:47,139
account for each of the individual 46

649
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:49,299
states that have the security law that

650
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:50,710
has a different level of requirement now

651
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:53,440
if the federal government would step in

652
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:55,630
and pass a security law and then

653
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,090
federalize the entire structure you

654
00:34:55,630 --> 00:35:00,640
would only have one set of standards one

655
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:02,140
rule you could check off the box and we

656
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,029
check off the box you know that you've

657
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:07,330
satisfied the federal standard you know

658
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:09,070
similar to the situation with PCI you

659
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:11,799
know you get yourself PCI certified

660
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:14,670
you're good for about a year and then

661
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:17,709
you then you've gone

662
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:17,709
[Music]

663
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:45,960
yes

664
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:50,820
no Massachusetts is Massachusetts is a

665
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:52,619
great state and people are so worried

666
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:57,030
about that why was a lot of thing I like

667
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:58,470
he got a slide under that you know my

668
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:01,920
client in Rhode Island is reacting to

669
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:03,240
the Massachusetts law but I have clients

670
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,290
in Maryland that are reacting to the

671
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,290
Massachusetts law as well

672
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:26,980
you got to know every yeah everybody

673
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:28,990
everybody whose records you need to

674
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:33,040
notify the people that are residents of

675
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:36,399
Texas you don't need if your database in

676
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:38,350
a place where you do business contains

677
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,890
information about people in Kansas you

678
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:44,680
need to notify the people in Kansas

679
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:48,040
you will also depending on where you are

680
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:49,540
need to notify credit bureaus you will

681
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,759
need to contact the credit bureau and

682
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:55,870
tell the tell national credit bureaus

683
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:57,730
what happened what the length of the

684
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:59,500
breach was how long it took for you to

685
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:01,990
notify the various people whose

686
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:08,320
information was lost and what you're

687
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:11,049
doing to remediate the situation yeah in

688
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:13,080
in at least 14 different states right

689
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:13,080
now

690
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:24,819
nineteen

691
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:27,309
have a requirement that you notify the

692
00:37:24,819 --> 00:37:30,970
Attorney General of the state where the

693
00:37:27,309 --> 00:37:35,619
person resides so in the Texas situation

694
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:39,490
a Texas company would have an obligation

695
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:41,680
to notify a Kansas consumer whose

696
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:43,899
records were lost and they might also

697
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:49,118
have an obligation to send a letter to

698
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:51,670
the AG of Kansas okay that that's where

699
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:59,970
this whole thing gets to be wild was

700
00:37:51,670 --> 00:38:02,410
there the other situation is that the

701
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:03,730
definition of state from personal

702
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:06,339
identifying information varies

703
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:08,680
dramatically from state to sync some

704
00:38:06,339 --> 00:38:12,759
case states in a bank account it's a

705
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:16,328
credit card some states it's some states

706
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:17,859
it's biometric device in some states in

707
00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:20,559
California I think they've got one that

708
00:38:17,859 --> 00:38:26,400
says DNA is classified it's personally

709
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:29,380
identifiable information right all right

710
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,900
what we're also seeing is is a move

711
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:34,869
toward especially in Europe making your

712
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:39,309
email personally identifiable

713
00:38:34,869 --> 00:38:41,589
information and your email or your email

714
00:38:39,309 --> 00:38:43,480
account so your Facebook account at some

715
00:38:41,589 --> 00:38:51,509
point may be classified as personally

716
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:51,510
identifiable information um yeah

717
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:09,520
i-i've been doing CCI cases for nine

718
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:13,240
years and one of the things that I have

719
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:16,240
seen is how the PCI standard was used by

720
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:19,330
Minnesota as the basis for putting

721
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:21,370
together one of the first privacy really

722
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:25,180
a big time

723
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:29,020
data security law and I thought to

724
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:31,120
myself well you know this this is never

725
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:33,460
gonna fly because this is way too rigid

726
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:37,600
a standard for the states to be holding

727
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:39,760
individuals to I was wrong

728
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:41,680
I also predicted that nobody would be

729
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,010
dumb enough to trust their credit card

730
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,990
on the internet because it was you know

731
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:49,870
the UNIX operating system based on

732
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:52,359
insecurity who's gonna be stupid enough

733
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:54,279
to do that I was wrong about that as

734
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:57,670
well so that's what

735
00:39:54,280 --> 00:40:00,430
so the PCI standard is being is the

736
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:02,440
driving force in one of them toward the

737
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:06,129
states enacting all these security

738
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:09,130
provisions and of course the PCI

739
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:12,400
standard you know everybody see this is

740
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:16,090
this is the largest private security

741
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:19,090
standard in the world and it I've you it

742
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:21,700
as being highly technical and I the

743
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:24,670
other thing about PCI is it's always

744
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:26,069
changing they say it changes with the

745
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:28,240
nature of the beast

746
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:30,190
so that it's a very difficult standard

747
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,950
to meet but yet that's that's the

748
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:34,720
standard to be pushed down on all these

749
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:37,299
states in the various state levels and

750
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:40,390
that just makes that that's an inert

751
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:41,830
insurmountable burden so back to the

752
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:44,350
question that you asked me in a good

753
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:46,240
form about five minutes ago not until

754
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:48,040
the federal government steps in and

755
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,589
supersedes all of these local state

756
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:52,600
privacy laws are we going to really have

757
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:56,190
something that's effective and it takes

758
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,190
a lot of the costs out of assistance

759
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:10,640
well here's the Massachusetts right log

760
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:13,450
here one of the interesting provisions

761
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:16,750
of the Massachusetts law your point

762
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:19,879
brought up the issue of cloud computing

763
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:21,980
so you had to have cotton you had to in

764
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:24,860
fact contracts with cloud for Phoenix

765
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:26,090
and other providers had to include your

766
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:28,870
assertion that you're going to protect

767
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:28,870
all of this information

768
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:43,750
the Securities and Exchange Commission

769
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:52,270
um there is no federal breach

770
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:55,270
notification law right yeah I'm sorry

771
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:56,890
no federal breach notification law so

772
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:59,259
that the federal government views itself

773
00:41:56,890 --> 00:42:02,379
as falling behind everybody else so the

774
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:04,930
SEC in order to try and bring itself up

775
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:08,530
to the same level as the states as

776
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:12,580
effectively they're testing the water by

777
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:14,590
having a reach notification requirement

778
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:16,690
it isn't really requirement that they're

779
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:18,670
just telling people companies that are

780
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:22,270
members of the SEC environment that they

781
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:23,500
really need to disclose the risk factors

782
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:26,259
that are involved as part of their

783
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:29,920
disclosures to the SEC and that will be

784
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:32,130
based upon you know what your security

785
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:36,780
risk is and if you've had a major breach

786
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:39,970
like one of my clients did last Saturday

787
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:41,740
that then rises to the level of an S

788
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:46,180
something has to be disclosed to the SEC

789
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:48,609
to the SEC if it's material quote

790
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:50,680
whether it's a material defense

791
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:52,600
that's securities lawyers have to answer

792
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:55,049
that question when it involves a lot of

793
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:58,270
people whether it's a big dollar volume

794
00:42:55,050 --> 00:43:00,580
situation whether it's likely to result

795
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:02,290
in litigation those are all factors that

796
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:04,029
go into the decision as to whether or

797
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:06,820
not it's a material breach at which

798
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:10,360
point it needs to be disclosed to the

799
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:14,290
SEC what the SEC is that they're they're

800
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:16,990
trying to set get a record of companies

801
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:19,810
not notifying them so that they can then

802
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:22,479
go back to Congress and tell Congress we

803
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:25,350
need a mandated breach notification law

804
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,350
for the SEC

805
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:35,010
so companies are now fighting Island

806
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:37,680
cybersecurity statements they're

807
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:40,290
establishing policies and all the

808
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,118
systems in place developing contingency

809
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:44,310
plans all the things that should have

810
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:46,980
been doing all the way over here with

811
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:48,450
the NIST standard all of these things

812
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:51,080
are going on now are supposed to be

813
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:51,080
going on now

814
00:43:53,780 --> 00:44:04,490
Barbie yes he's missing non-techie legal

815
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,490
jargon

816
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:38,140
right well that's that's not quite just

817
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:38,140
pull out your logs write a check

818
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:45,339
no materiality traditionally has been

819
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:48,200
defined in terms of will ders have a

820
00:44:45,339 --> 00:44:50,930
financial impact on the institution and

821
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:54,109
the definition financial impact depends

822
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:57,740
upon how big the institution is so a

823
00:44:54,109 --> 00:45:01,790
material omission for Texaco will not be

824
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:09,939
the same as a material omission for some

825
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:09,940
smaller company yeah

826
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:34,030
you have really I thought it was at

827
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:35,970
least 15% well and see and you make that

828
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:38,890
decision at your own risk

829
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:40,660
you make him say because yes you seek

830
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:43,000
and then come back then doing that's the

831
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:46,330
SEC and investigation and determine that

832
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:49,119
you miss stated your and you omitted

833
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:55,150
material facts on your your your 10k and

834
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:56,710
10-q it no no it's it's a guessing game

835
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:58,450
for you it's not a guessing game for the

836
00:45:56,710 --> 00:46:09,690
SEC because they they're the ones that

837
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:09,689
have all the cards right

838
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:20,250
right there's a little guessing game you

839
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:21,990
don't have to worry about the SEC but

840
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:26,580
you have to worry about your stockholder

841
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:29,040
and shareholder value and I hear the

842
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:31,890
expression shareholder value a lot to my

843
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,810
line of work talking to companies about

844
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:36,890
the data breach and the in fact that the

845
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:36,890
data breaches can handle on

846
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:59,920
well yeah I'd like to see that but the

847
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:06,980
other thing is that then is a reflection

848
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:08,680
the my experience with respect to when

849
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:12,110
you come to breach notification

850
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:16,450
companies abhor the idea of notifying

851
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:19,310
people they all we lost your information

852
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:20,960
and they're scared to death about that

853
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:22,910
you know what's gonna happen before

854
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,380
investors are gonna leave like you know

855
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:26,930
people aren't going to go to our stores

856
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:29,960
anymore and it the same phenomena

857
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:32,390
roughly roughly occurred the statistics

858
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:34,580
I've seen are then only between five to

859
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:36,020
and five percent of the people that

860
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:37,880
receive a notification of breach

861
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:39,500
notification it has any difference on

862
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:41,900
the way they do business or they shop

863
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:44,150
for anything today it's there are so

864
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:46,430
many breaches and there are so many

865
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:47,870
breach notifications on its going on you

866
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:50,410
have to take my word for it it becomes

867
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:50,410
white noise

868
00:47:56,710 --> 00:48:00,299
I'll do it you gotta get life

869
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:24,890
yeah

870
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:32,140
yeah

871
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:35,859
I talk I talk to clients it's a 72 hour

872
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:38,109
news cycle the first day it's the first

873
00:48:35,859 --> 00:48:40,420
day it's news and you've gotten your

874
00:48:38,109 --> 00:48:41,859
your you know your PR people are gonna

875
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:45,940
be lit up by the Wall Street Journal in

876
00:48:41,859 --> 00:48:48,369
New York Times the second day it's what

877
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:50,619
what have you found out recently what do

878
00:48:48,369 --> 00:48:52,960
you have - they're looking for the lead

879
00:48:50,619 --> 00:48:55,470
for the next the next news cycle so by

880
00:48:52,960 --> 00:49:02,730
the third day they don't really care

881
00:48:55,470 --> 00:49:04,629
unless you set a record yeah

882
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:07,869
and see that's that's a problem that

883
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:09,970
Sony had in that situation the hacker

884
00:49:07,869 --> 00:49:11,880
group kept coming back and back and back

885
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:18,069
keeping Sony on the front page for

886
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:21,279
months no I know right I'm an Army

887
00:49:18,069 --> 00:49:24,190
veteran and so I received breach

888
00:49:21,279 --> 00:49:28,779
notification letters from the DoD on a

889
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:31,539
non-stop basis I mean yeah yeah I just

890
00:49:28,779 --> 00:49:39,450
thought they lost my records again what

891
00:49:31,539 --> 00:49:39,450
a surprise yeah

892
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,810
yeah

893
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:48,160
and and the biggest pain in that and I'm

894
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:52,009
I'm doing this right now myself is

895
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:56,330
notifying your automatic people you pay

896
00:49:52,010 --> 00:50:00,260
automatically it right I don't even know

897
00:49:56,330 --> 00:50:04,330
how many people I think automatically

898
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:06,470
right now I'm you you probably have my I

899
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:12,549
here's my credit card I've got to notify

900
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:12,549
you to it I just got hit yeah

901
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:27,259
oh they go nuts

902
00:50:33,009 --> 00:50:40,009
no I know it's a it's a tremendous

903
00:50:35,719 --> 00:50:41,269
phenomena but I've been in the boardroom

904
00:50:40,009 --> 00:50:44,419
when that when they're having that

905
00:50:41,269 --> 00:50:46,488
phenomena take place and it is heads are

906
00:50:44,419 --> 00:50:50,479
gonna roll and they are then

907
00:50:46,489 --> 00:50:54,769
oh that decadent that could last for

908
00:50:50,479 --> 00:50:56,779
months yeah and I mean they don't forget

909
00:50:54,769 --> 00:51:00,678
and they don't forget when it comes to

910
00:50:56,779 --> 00:51:03,529
budget time either so and but it's a

911
00:51:00,679 --> 00:51:05,599
bizarre phenomena and the heat goat when

912
00:51:03,529 --> 00:51:08,390
the heat comes off the out of the papers

913
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:10,849
the heat comes out of the board room but

914
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:12,259
the board members remember the other

915
00:51:10,849 --> 00:51:14,529
thing the other people that remember are

916
00:51:12,259 --> 00:51:17,959
the members on the board of directors

917
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:19,759
because they've had a life scare because

918
00:51:17,959 --> 00:51:21,799
that life scare involves their potential

919
00:51:19,759 --> 00:51:23,989
personal liability for failing to

920
00:51:21,799 --> 00:51:26,959
adequately secure and protect

921
00:51:23,989 --> 00:51:29,809
stockholder value that makes us pay

922
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:31,969
attention one follow-up story with

923
00:51:29,809 --> 00:51:35,509
respect of the SEC and I can't leave yes

924
00:51:31,969 --> 00:51:37,880
to see you around talk about it the day

925
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:43,789
after they released their SEC guidelines

926
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:46,279
they got briefed and the SE C's answer

927
00:51:43,789 --> 00:51:51,169
was it was the vendors fault it wasn't

928
00:51:46,279 --> 00:51:58,009
their fault this comes under the heading

929
00:51:51,169 --> 00:51:59,629
of priceless I don't know I don't know

930
00:51:58,009 --> 00:52:02,169
whatever it was it was great timing as

931
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:02,169
far as I was concerned

932
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:22,319
what do i do I'll do anything you tell

933
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:26,520
me there's one there's one thing I do

934
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:30,500
want to push and and then that's the

935
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:34,619
need for the attorney-client privilege

936
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:39,750
now one obvious thing is this makes me

937
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:43,440
money putting that aside if you have an

938
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:45,450
investigation that's going on you need

939
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,770
to happen you need to have a filter

940
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:49,200
between what becomes part of the

941
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:51,680
permanent record of the company and will

942
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,910
have it and what becomes business

943
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:56,069
business policy discussions inside the

944
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:57,720
company business policy discussions

945
00:52:56,069 --> 00:52:59,369
designer companies are not protected by

946
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:01,859
the attorney-client privilege and they

947
00:52:59,369 --> 00:53:04,079
can be discovered readily in the event

948
00:53:01,859 --> 00:53:05,520
of litigation if it's something is

949
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:08,099
covered by the attorney-client privilege

950
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:09,930
then it's it's protected and the other

951
00:53:08,099 --> 00:53:11,940
side has to fight like hell in order to

952
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:14,190
get even part of it out of the company

953
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:15,810
the idea is that the attorney-client

954
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:18,210
privilege enables the company to do the

955
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:20,430
investigation in an open and candid way

956
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:22,740
and exchange information candidly and

957
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:24,750
not be held to task for something in

958
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:27,140
some comments that people make these are

959
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:31,200
some of the comments that I have been

960
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:32,670
frequently blown back to me I had a guy

961
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:36,180
that worked for a union that got broken

962
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:36,720
into and I I pre tried this guy seven

963
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:39,328
times

964
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:41,549
and every time I did he kept coming back

965
00:53:39,329 --> 00:53:44,460
to this expression which was just a nail

966
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:48,540
in our coffin because he had just taken

967
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:50,880
over the job that every time there was a

968
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:54,029
night break-in the IT person just

969
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:57,990
started and it's the fault of the people

970
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:59,430
they had there before and this guy kept

971
00:53:57,990 --> 00:53:59,910
using this this screen door on a

972
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:05,160
submarine

973
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:06,629
you know I just I finally had done say

974
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:08,220
that say that again one more time now

975
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:10,380
because it's the last time you'll ever

976
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:12,209
say that in your life don't use that

977
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:16,560
expect so these are the kinds of things

978
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:18,450
that come up if you're not if you're not

979
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:20,549
watching what the auditors and Assessors

980
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:23,569
say sometimes the Assessors can make

981
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:23,569
remarkable things

982
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:33,680
and this is directly the point that

983
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:37,069
you're making for work we're not gonna

984
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:39,290
get broken into in this situation the

985
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:41,420
company got hit too they had a IT

986
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:44,120
professional company come in and they

987
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:45,620
they had disengaged the VPN because I

988
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:47,630
just really couldn't figure out the way

989
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:48,859
it operated on the network they thought

990
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:56,140
it was impeding the network and they

991
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:56,140
didn't know what they're doing yeah

992
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:01,120
really

993
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:23,940
no I tell them write everything down

994
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:26,100
because we need like we're talking about

995
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:28,170
downstairs before they say you need to

996
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:29,610
make a track working the only way you

997
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:31,920
can establish a track record by

998
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:33,600
establishing due diligence due diligence

999
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:36,270
is only established by having a paper

1000
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:39,480
trail of what what decision worked what

1001
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:46,860
decision didn't work so that's what

1002
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:48,360
you've got to do yes and you can explain

1003
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:51,840
it later but the idea is you have to

1004
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:53,160
show you work by them because if there's

1005
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:55,680
a work product there I can take that

1006
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:57,810
into any court and say this is what they

1007
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:00,029
were doing this was this was a false

1008
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:02,400
lead this was legitimate this so we

1009
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:05,700
follow different you need judges

1010
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,840
understand that I mean they don't they

1011
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:11,450
don't understand very much about

1012
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:14,550
technology one first case I tried

1013
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:18,629
involved UNIX operating system and we'd

1014
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:22,760
had a bunch of C language code got

1015
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:26,520
stolen I thought there's an AI program

1016
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:28,410
and the judge I said the program is

1017
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:38,400
written in C did and he says well how do

1018
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:42,379
you spell that you know C it takes them

1019
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:44,960
a while they don't get the jargon okay

1020
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:49,170
[Music]

1021
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:56,070
see I got to this and I didn't get to be

1022
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:59,850
yelled at I finally take a position that

1023
00:56:56,070 --> 00:57:03,630
they're three bring-your-own-device

1024
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:05,040
the phenomena in the hiring phase how

1025
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:08,310
much information are you able to require

1026
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:09,600
people to give you in terms of access to

1027
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:11,549
your background information your

1028
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:14,490
Facebook page all that the trend of the

1029
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:17,040
law is against it asking people about

1030
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:21,299
their Facebook or their multimedia

1031
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:23,460
environments getting consent to audit

1032
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:27,619
things like this these are things that

1033
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:31,160
go in employment agreements and

1034
00:57:27,619 --> 00:57:34,579
and BYOD is a very hot issue with lots

1035
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:36,769
of major corporation the moment a lot of

1036
00:57:34,579 --> 00:57:40,009
corporations I take the position they

1037
00:57:36,769 --> 00:57:41,209
would rather give you a phone that have

1038
00:57:40,009 --> 00:57:42,650
you bring your own phone into their

1039
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:45,349
environments

1040
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:45,829
and they control your access from the

1041
00:57:45,349 --> 00:57:48,799
phone

1042
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:50,569
that's what's one way to handle it but

1043
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:55,359
that creates a lot of problems and

1044
00:57:50,569 --> 00:57:57,349
there's some fair fairly large

1045
00:57:55,359 --> 00:58:00,170
indications that even if you do have

1046
00:57:57,349 --> 00:58:02,059
your own have their phone they're going

1047
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:03,259
to find a way to get their phone into

1048
00:58:02,059 --> 00:58:18,160
the company to try and get the

1049
00:58:03,259 --> 00:58:18,160
information it's sort been with again

1050
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:28,039
but really what BYOD really hits the

1051
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:30,499
road is when you somebody leaves I tell

1052
00:58:28,039 --> 00:58:32,119
tell companies you're gonna have to make

1053
00:58:30,499 --> 00:58:35,299
it a session because this isn't this is

1054
00:58:32,119 --> 00:58:37,239
the enormous least sensitive issue if

1055
00:58:35,299 --> 00:58:40,309
the person leads on good terms

1056
00:58:37,239 --> 00:58:43,640
then just new job they gonna leave your

1057
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:45,109
job and there's no hostility work out a

1058
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:46,819
deal with them so that you're gonna

1059
00:58:45,109 --> 00:58:48,469
you're gonna download their contacts

1060
00:58:46,819 --> 00:58:51,288
you're gonna but you're gonna take your

1061
00:58:48,469 --> 00:58:52,849
email off their device but you're gonna

1062
00:58:51,289 --> 00:58:54,529
let them keep their contacts there's no

1063
00:58:52,849 --> 00:58:56,660
reason why they can't have the phone

1064
00:58:54,529 --> 00:58:58,729
numbers of people I deal with and if

1065
00:58:56,660 --> 00:59:00,890
there's email on their system that is

1066
00:58:58,729 --> 00:59:02,509
really critical information to them such

1067
00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:04,900
as attorney-client communications with

1068
00:59:02,509 --> 00:59:07,759
outside counsel their divorce lawyer

1069
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:09,920
their doctors sensitive information like

1070
00:59:07,759 --> 00:59:11,450
that you you don't want to have that you

1071
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:13,910
find a way to make sure that they can

1072
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:16,069
pick it out and have essentially another

1073
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:19,279
referee in the HR section it makes a

1074
00:59:16,069 --> 00:59:21,430
decision and turns over what email they

1075
00:59:19,279 --> 00:59:25,190
want they designated and you turned over

1076
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:26,390
the other issue is always and what

1077
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:28,339
really becomes a problem is if you've

1078
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:30,799
got a hostile situation somebody that

1079
00:59:28,339 --> 00:59:32,900
you think may be doing break-ins or is a

1080
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:34,910
hacker inside your company or a stealing

1081
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:35,710
company information and it's a hostile

1082
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:38,700
fire

1083
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:40,799
[Music]

1084
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:44,160
i I follow kind of a scorched earth

1085
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:47,549
policy would we go in we take their

1086
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:51,990
phone we take their computer and take

1087
00:59:47,549 --> 00:59:54,059
the keys to their car no we take all

1088
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:56,038
that up up front and they're gonna have

1089
00:59:54,059 --> 01:00:03,779
to establish to us through their lawyer

1090
00:59:56,039 --> 01:00:06,269
why don't you get it back yes and I go

1091
01:00:03,779 --> 01:00:08,069
so far as to do civil search warrants on

1092
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:10,288
behalf of some of my clients on the

1093
01:00:08,069 --> 01:00:13,319
premises of employees that are hostile

1094
01:00:10,289 --> 01:00:15,390
employees because I know for my

1095
01:00:13,319 --> 01:00:18,089
histories of prosecuted that they are

1096
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:19,618
going to be cashing stolen information

1097
01:00:18,089 --> 01:00:22,349
at home on their home computers and

1098
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:23,910
putting it up on LimeWire or to be found

1099
01:00:22,349 --> 01:00:27,150
out of line work putting it in various

1100
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:29,940
clouds and you need to find the tracks

1101
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:33,150
of that inside the home system and

1102
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:34,529
believe it or not judges they balk at

1103
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:37,109
that the first time you go in on that

1104
01:00:34,529 --> 01:00:39,240
because the idea of breaking a civil

1105
01:00:37,109 --> 01:00:41,400
company private company going into a

1106
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:45,750
person's home and taking an individual's

1107
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:50,269
computer is appalling to judges but what

1108
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:52,769
you yeah the fight and the consumer yeah

1109
01:00:50,269 --> 01:00:54,359
but you need you go in and you justify

1110
01:00:52,769 --> 01:00:58,410
the basis for what why are you doing

1111
01:00:54,359 --> 01:01:01,348
that and the thing that always sells the

1112
01:00:58,410 --> 01:01:03,240
judge is after you've laid out all your

1113
01:01:01,349 --> 01:01:06,029
other evidence you point out to the

1114
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:09,269
judge judge this is a highly volatile

1115
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:12,240
medium and if you don't let us do this

1116
01:01:09,269 --> 01:01:13,950
our ability to prove our case and for

1117
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:15,508
justice to be done and for a correct

1118
01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:17,848
resolution to happen in this case is

1119
01:01:15,509 --> 01:01:19,910
going to be lost forever because that

1120
01:01:17,849 --> 01:01:22,200
information is going to be destroyed

1121
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:24,990
judges are very sensitive to that and

1122
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:27,480
then on the strength of that I haven't

1123
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:30,180
lost one of these yet they give you the

1124
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:34,339
authorization to go in with a US Marshal

1125
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:37,078
or a state police officer to preserve

1126
01:01:34,339 --> 01:01:38,970
dignity in the situation and they'll let

1127
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:40,829
you go out and get the computer you post

1128
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:41,939
a bond but then you return the computer

1129
01:01:40,829 --> 01:01:44,190
after you've had a chance to do

1130
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:46,410
legitimate and I have third-party

1131
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:47,849
forensics people do the sweep to

1132
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:50,180
determine what's on the system and

1133
01:01:47,849 --> 01:01:50,180
what's not

1134
01:01:53,849 --> 01:02:00,630
no I had no the party fun except I've

1135
01:01:57,369 --> 01:02:00,630
enjoyed this so thank you for coming
