1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,960
okay like I see on the agenda there my

2
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,960
name is Tony Ruchi and

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:19,369
data center for the Reno data center for

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:20,869
in jvc down in Reno and I also run

5
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:22,820
critical infrastructure protection so

6
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:24,439
this is a little bit out of my realm of

7
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,080
what I do this day and age but in my

8
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:30,349
previous life before I retired I was a

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,629
counterintelligence agent for about 21

10
00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:33,560
years and spent a little bit of time up

11
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,660
there in the white house so that's a

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,800
little we're going to talk about today

13
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,970
it was kind of timely with this

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,680
conference and that's part of why I

15
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:42,829
submitted this talk in addition to

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,289
another but you know 9/11 is something

17
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:47,449
that is gonna real room remain with all

18
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:49,070
of us throughout our adult lives and

19
00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:52,640
we're gonna pass that on but a lot of

20
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:54,410
the younger generation now it's already

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,390
passing them by I don't even know what

22
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:59,178
9/11 was except for what they see in the

23
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:02,480
news and and everybody else's

24
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:06,980
speculation so I do want to give you a

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:09,950
little bit of a warning that this is all

26
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:11,659
my perspective these are the events as I

27
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:16,340
saw them and is always engaged that day

28
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:19,100
I was with the first lady and so if you

29
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:21,110
asked ten people in a room you know what

30
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,939
who was involved in from the staff that

31
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,649
day and if you talk to each one of them

32
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:26,210
you're going to get nine or possibly

33
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:30,110
even ten different perspectives on any

34
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:31,579
given event so does everybody remember

35
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:34,340
what they were doing when they get word

36
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:36,710
of the attacks that day it's going to

37
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,840
kind of live in our generation as kind

38
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:41,000
of the Kennedy and Martin Luther King

39
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,360
jr. attacks you know everybody remembers

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,159
that moment in life so with that said so

41
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,899
here's there's a little bit about my

42
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,750
background and the time that I served

43
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:51,950
and and and suffered and I hope you guys

44
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,170
don't mind if I roam a little bit

45
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:57,649
because that's just what I do but I was

46
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:59,960
there at the White House from 1998 to

47
00:01:57,649 --> 00:02:02,149
2004 kind of came in at the very tail

48
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,149
end of the Monica Lewinsky investigation

49
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:06,939
under the Clinton administration and

50
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:08,449
left about halfway through Bush 43

51
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:11,510
administration it's a two-year

52
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:13,670
assignment and do the math right so it's

53
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:15,170
to your assignment but if you you kind

54
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,600
of gravitate to that role or something

55
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,980
like that they keep you around and I was

56
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,950
active duty military I was a Warrant

57
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,329
Officer agent and there are a lot of

58
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,220
folks there who spend their entire

59
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,470
careers in the military

60
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,910
sign to the White House there are 2300

61
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,260
military members who are signed to the

62
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,450
White House military office it's a

63
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,040
number organization that supports 15

64
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:36,049
different organizations under the White

65
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,810
House you're familiar with some of them

66
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:41,600
so the more popular ones Marine one Air

67
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:44,150
Force one the White House mess the guys

68
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,650
who the chefs and the valets aren't and

69
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:49,610
the president's underwear and socks and

70
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:51,620
things like that and it's actually a

71
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,630
hard job to recruit those guys because

72
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,580
their perception in the in the Navy regs

73
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:58,549
and all of them our Navy and the Navy

74
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,690
ranks their perception is is that they

75
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,760
have to clean the toilet for the White

76
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:05,180
House and that's somebody else's job

77
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,380
that's a subcontractor but so I worked

78
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,940
in the White House security office I was

79
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,109
a counterintelligence operations officer

80
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,990
and I also worked technical policy

81
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:13,610
oversight I was a I tracked early my

82
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:15,550
career as a computer crimes investigator

83
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:18,020
and so so do you have any kind of

84
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,910
technical or zeros and ones flavor in

85
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,070
your background they they threw you in

86
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:24,620
the technical policy and back then when

87
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:26,299
I when I came in there in 98 that's

88
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,440
about the time that we're all migrating

89
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:30,080
to these little things we called

90
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,079
personal electronic devices and you know

91
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,670
it was all the it wasn't even iPhone and

92
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,930
it wasn't a lot of cell phones and

93
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:39,488
blackberries and things like that

94
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:42,019
it was the peds and it was a little I

95
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:43,430
pack sand things like that the Palm

96
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:45,110
Pilot and everything was associated

97
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,160
everything was called a Palm Pilot if

98
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,709
you had anything that was handheld

99
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,209
device with a Palm Pilot so helping

100
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:51,769
write some that policy it was kind of

101
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:53,269
comical throughout the community because

102
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:54,799
people were scared to death of them now

103
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:57,560
yeah they're all going hate Congress

104
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,239
inside your secure facility but I spent

105
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,630
a lot of time on trips working in

106
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:04,850
advance and working the threat package

107
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:07,519
and I travel all the world 71 trips as

108
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:09,170
you can see to 94 countries so you learn

109
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,730
how to say hello goodbye and thank you a

110
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:13,160
lot of different languages that's kind

111
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:16,488
of a be the door to opened to get any

112
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,750
kind of share that that was one of the

113
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:19,219
privileges you got to travel a lot of

114
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,040
places that you'd probably never travel

115
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,870
in your life so that was probably one of

116
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,030
our our neat little privileges that we

117
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,810
got to share of course to the wall China

118
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:31,429
then out in Pema and Jung the

119
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,990
Demilitarized Zone and this is kind of

120
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,390
interesting here because as you're

121
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,590
standing in that little Hut in there is

122
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,940
about the size of this room as the

123
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,568
yellow line drawn right across it so

124
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,830
we're all walking

125
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,270
crossing nobody warned us though you

126
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,279
can't walk across that line as soon as

127
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,448
you do this guy from North Korea bangs

128
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:45,679
on the window and looks like he does

129
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:48,080
that quite a bit because they had a big

130
00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:49,549
old store on his hand so I think they

131
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,128
get a lot of tours there on his watch

132
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:53,779
but it's kind of comical and of course

133
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:54,830
one of our privileges back home was that

134
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:57,529
you get to go to the Kennedy Center

135
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,758
whenever the president wasn't using the

136
00:04:57,529 --> 00:05:01,399
presidential Fox you could put your name

137
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:04,039
on a little rotation list so a lot of

138
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:04,879
neat little privileges that come along

139
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:08,029
with the duties but a lot of

140
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:10,249
responsibilities as well and so here's

141
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:11,689
how our office was broken up I want me

142
00:05:10,249 --> 00:05:14,539
to stand right in somebody's way here

143
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:16,099
but here's how our office was broken out

144
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:17,719
an organization chart we had personnel

145
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:20,688
security industrial security information

146
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:21,860
security and the aspects of the

147
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:23,990
counterintelligence and technical

148
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,479
security so I wore a couple of these

149
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:29,089
hats right here in that piece of it so

150
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:32,539
we were always send somebody on a trip

151
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:34,129
and work with Secret Service and working

152
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:36,919
that threat development and work the

153
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:38,419
host nation that's right we also travel

154
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,529
quite a bit inside the cotton in the

155
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:41,209
United States whenever there's a lot of

156
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:42,379
foreign presence for the Olympics and

157
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:43,369
things like that where you had a lot of

158
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:44,899
foreign nationals

159
00:05:43,369 --> 00:05:46,459
that were going to be involved in the

160
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:49,759
trip so this was our true mission

161
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:52,699
statement as it was back in 2004 when I

162
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,740
left upfront just let you know I'm not

163
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:56,449
giving you any kind of super super uh

164
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,969
you know secret stuff that's not already

165
00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:01,550
out there well maybe a little I got a

166
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:03,558
couple pictures may be good turn the

167
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,729
camera off lock it out just for a second

168
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:06,680
so that was our mission statement

169
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:09,649
there's really force protection and

170
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:12,800
security of the the traveling staff and

171
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:14,689
the senior staff and the presidency it

172
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,490
was really not a democratic or

173
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:17,809
republican position it was a political

174
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,059
and you're really working for the office

175
00:06:17,809 --> 00:06:23,269
as opposed to the person so when

176
00:06:20,059 --> 00:06:25,610
administration's changed employees in

177
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:26,899
the Secret Service and the White House

178
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,139
military office didn't necessarily

179
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:33,229
change unless they were the directors in

180
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:34,430
those respective nations so a lot of

181
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:35,449
people have the misperception there when

182
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,249
you work at the White House is what

183
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:39,110
everybody the office looks like and it's

184
00:06:37,249 --> 00:06:40,279
not you know hey you got to go in there

185
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,749
every now and again when they were out

186
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:43,189
of town you can go in and sneak pictures

187
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:45,229
like this but this is really what my

188
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:47,479
office looked like so it's pretty sexy

189
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:50,849
you know and if you knocked on that that

190
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:54,960
was ghetto hard hard steel desk

191
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:56,570
and not a lot of not a lot of decoration

192
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,060
there I'd sneak my little UT Vols

193
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:01,530
stickers on there but anyway so it

194
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,140
wasn't as sexy as you might think

195
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:04,950
we did have some pretty nice

196
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:06,690
communications gear we had White House

197
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:09,750
communications agency for all of our

198
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:12,000
infrastructure and technology assets out

199
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,830
there so we had 19 simultaneous trip

200
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,230
sites that we would support on any given

201
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:18,359
day around the world and inside the

202
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,740
continental United States those guys in

203
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,700
White House communications agency I

204
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,730
don't know if you've ever met any of

205
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,740
those guys they do a lot of really great

206
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:27,300
work with a lot of legacy technology

207
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,610
we've never experienced any kind of like

208
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,280
legacy technology in our world I'm sure

209
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:33,660
in the IT world but we use to have a

210
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,479
saying we'd say yet you know Waka

211
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,740
yesterday's technology tomorrow and it

212
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,710
was kind of thing because they were

213
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:43,200
using a lot of a lot of analog devices

214
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,489
to be able to support the president itíd

215
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,840
States and you'd scratch your head when

216
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,760
you see it the first time you see a lot

217
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,739
of these road boxes there you pop that

218
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,060
open and you know you there's the

219
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,740
servers in there and that ends up being

220
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,630
a comm center inside that little box you

221
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,010
don't Wow and then you open up another

222
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:58,980
box and you see breadboards in there

223
00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:02,610
punch it down you know telco clocks in

224
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:04,680
there Running Room telco to room Kimi

225
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:07,140
we've got to be digitized well in some

226
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,850
instances you are we used a we call

227
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:12,000
counterintelligence human automated tool

228
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:14,790
sets for for our services and really it

229
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,050
was just nothing more than but I'd hold

230
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,220
up my little laptop right here and it

231
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:20,370
was really about as powerful with my

232
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:23,100
laptop was you had a regular old laptop

233
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:24,870
in there with some some secure devices

234
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,640
on it but he had a big old battery that

235
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:28,800
would sustain you for about it you know

236
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,840
half the time that my iPad or my Mac

237
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,360
does now and you had to always

238
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,740
constantly plug him in but we did have

239
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,260
some communications where we could use

240
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,450
an mr set and and talk from wherever we

241
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,939
were and iridium phones and I'll talk to

242
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:46,110
you a little bit how valuable iridium

243
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:47,250
phones were on that day so here's one

244
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,900
little secrets I'm gonna I'm gonna

245
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,070
divulge to you a lot people want to know

246
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,449
what's going on underneath the White

247
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:53,610
House they hear about all these shelters

248
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,020
everything like that so all right you

249
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,350
can cover it up or you can not cover it

250
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,390
up

251
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,710
we'll go public with it all right now

252
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,880
but I'm just kidding we'll go public

253
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:01,810
all right there you go so there's a

254
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,670
bunch of you

255
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,649
it's all the rooms that you go on the

256
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:06,729
public tours in the White House I'm not

257
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:08,230
really gonna give you many secrets

258
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,399
except for this one right here inside

259
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,529
the Secret Service the Joint Operations

260
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:13,959
Center in there where they're monitoring

261
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:16,120
all the assets so anybody have any kind

262
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:17,888
of IT rooms and you run any kind of

263
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,629
knocks your socks and your in your

264
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:22,079
spaces out there what's one of the big

265
00:09:19,629 --> 00:09:26,559
no knows inside of your computer room

266
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:26,888
well number one he gets there there you

267
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:31,300
go

268
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:32,620
look here oh yeah yeah they don't have

269
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,430
they don't have Starbucks cups over

270
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,019
there they got a little white house

271
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:38,439
logos on them they got white house M&Ms

272
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:41,680
water yeah I think they are there

273
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:45,248
probably are it says it says POTUS is

274
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,329
and that's the password it's FLOTUS and

275
00:09:45,249 --> 00:09:48,180
then this some way over here on the

276
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:51,579
right you see that that's a big no-no a

277
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:57,189
stapler on the yeah no I'm sorry there's

278
00:09:51,579 --> 00:10:03,388
a 9-mil sitting over there yeah we don't

279
00:09:57,189 --> 00:10:06,069
allow staplers in there damn it yeah

280
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:08,680
it's just a commie there you know my

281
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:10,120
sense of humor so one of the indicators

282
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,410
for whenever the president's inside

283
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,839
residents you'd always know that there's

284
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:16,300
an open security guard standing out

285
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,100
there in front of the West Wing and

286
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:21,519
those guys really sharp and they're

287
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:23,259
they're all well beyond any kind of

288
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,370
regulations that fit they had to have

289
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:26,230
about a waist that's about that big

290
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,759
around add just looks super strat in

291
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:30,459
their uniform just like the guys who are

292
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:31,689
guarding the Tomb of the Unknown they're

293
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:34,359
the best of the best of those guys are

294
00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:35,889
really on top of it and and that was

295
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,339
just one of the ways that you could tell

296
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:46,389
that the president was in in residence

297
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:48,970
and there's snipers all around there all

298
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:50,259
the time somewhere but you know they're

299
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:54,160
probably a little more vigilant when

300
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:55,629
POTUS is in town so rest of time they're

301
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,660
playing cards up they're doing crossword

302
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:57,660
puzzles

303
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,950
sir Oh

304
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,390
continental United States sorry and oke

305
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,000
own us outside the continental United

306
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:11,699
States sorry I should explain each one I

307
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,410
try to make my slides abbreviated so I

308
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,810
don't leave a lot of text on there but I

309
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,699
should fill it out and I'll do that for

310
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:21,420
the next one so this is a time like I

311
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:23,310
said that I was there from 98 to 2004

312
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,719
through the first half for the last half

313
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:27,270
of Clinton and the first half of Bush

314
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,700
and so there was there was the people in

315
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,140
charge on the paper but really the

316
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,760
people who were in charge everything

317
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,840
kind of revolved around the pets in the

318
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,060
White House and it seemed like they get

319
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,660
a lot more publicity than everybody else

320
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:41,010
and I put the dogs in there because

321
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:44,640
Barney and spotty get a little a little

322
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:47,069
bit of press on the 9th on 9/11 so as I

323
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:51,569
explained in the front of my talk was

324
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:52,920
that my role on 9/11 was a little bit

325
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:57,960
different than it probably had been in

326
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:59,880
any other day in that administration I

327
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,410
don't generally support our I didn't

328
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,140
generally support the first lady it was

329
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:05,310
always really in a presidential role or

330
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,439
a vice presidential world whether

331
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:09,300
wherever they were going to travel but

332
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,010
everybody just stepped up and we did

333
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,020
something that was out of your box that

334
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:14,580
day your ass you didn't say no I would

335
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:17,460
just wasn't wasn't part of the equation

336
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:19,230
but I learned a lot about her that day

337
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:21,840
and and learned to respect her a lot

338
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:27,000
more than I had ever imagined that I

339
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:29,040
could for a first lady so we're all very

340
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,350
familiar with what took place that day

341
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,949
and the events around it and just to

342
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:36,990
kind of refresh your memory that was

343
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:40,290
really surfing around for flights the

344
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:43,230
American Airlines flight 11 175 for

345
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:49,140
United and then one set our 77 and

346
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:53,670
flight 93 and 93 is the last flight to

347
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:54,990
take off that morning so we kind of run

348
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:57,000
down the timeline and talk about

349
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:58,380
President and vice-presidents roles and

350
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,900
first lady's role then and they kind of

351
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,460
might my actions are in red captured

352
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:06,540
down here so I won't bore you too much

353
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:08,220
with a lot of text but so as was the

354
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,319
case in the most case in most days

355
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,430
president was down in

356
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,780
on a trip and he happened to be in

357
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:15,660
Sarasota Florida getting ready to speak

358
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:16,949
with a class no much your school class

359
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,270
he was gonna read some books with them

360
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:23,640
and spend some time in that kind of a

361
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:24,900
less diplomatic role that day ended up

362
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,000
being one of the most diplomatic roles

363
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,699
that he had to encounter in his in his

364
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,740
administration while he was going out

365
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,880
for a nice leisurely run the rest of us

366
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,490
who were working there we were finishing

367
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,410
up our two-hour commutes in the Beltway

368
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:38,610
my I lived up in Frederick Maryland up

369
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:41,310
north of Frederick marriage so my Q

370
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:43,710
commute was two hours each day each way

371
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:45,839
so you spent four hours on a good day

372
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:47,760
without any kind of traffic accidents if

373
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,290
you were in town and not traveling so I

374
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,700
get to look at a whole bunch of red

375
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:54,839
lights on my way to work

376
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:59,210
so and about 8:45 is when flight 11

377
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:01,230
struck struck the North Tower and

378
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:02,880
everybody was speculating well maybe

379
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,230
with some crazy pilot who fell asleep or

380
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,090
smart that they didn't have an autopilot

381
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:09,180
so really nobody was really up in arms

382
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:11,040
on the public sector yet I was on the

383
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:13,380
phone with guy named Brad Brad Weber who

384
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,180
was head of our technical surveillance

385
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,860
the guys who would sweep rooms for

386
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:19,079
listening devices and in place them if

387
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,880
you were an offensive capacity but in

388
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,950
our role we were always defensive and

389
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,870
protective so Brad now we're talking

390
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:27,540
about an upcoming trip and then he said

391
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:29,160
wow you watch that on CNN and I didn't

392
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,240
have TV on so I clicked it on real quick

393
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:34,439
when watching this and all of a sudden

394
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,930
everybody's going live and and then the

395
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,610
next thing or I'm sorry this is Bush in

396
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:42,540
the meantime she was in route to the

397
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:45,000
Capitol and she was to speak to the

398
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,829
house that morning and she was going to

399
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,740
have a meeting with senator Kennedy

400
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:51,000
ahead of time and talked about they're

401
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,730
gonna get their story together and

402
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,110
probably put together their little

403
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:57,720
presentation before they they briefed at

404
00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:00,360
the house and she was briefed ahead of

405
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:04,350
time that the first plane had hit and as

406
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:06,720
she arrived the second plane it struck

407
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:08,430
the South Tower up there all bets are

408
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,800
off everybody knew what was going on it

409
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:13,260
was it was a very targeted attack and

410
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,020
things started rolling into gear we have

411
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:18,660
very directed action plans and prepared

412
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:20,699
action plans and any kind of hostile

413
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,630
event so chaos was going on in the

414
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,820
hallways and I heard a lot of commotion

415
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:25,050
outside of my office suite out there and

416
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,490
so I walked out there and I ran into

417
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:29,280
this guy who was anti Scaffidi and he

418
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:31,470
was one of the directors of the colonel

419
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:34,949
in the Air Force for what we called it

420
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:36,420
PPR plans programs plans requirements

421
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:39,570
and they really worked a lot of these

422
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:42,060
kind of emergent action event is what

423
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:43,560
they were always planning for he looked

424
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:46,469
over Mason's Chafee says you need to go

425
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:52,199
in there and call the NMCC National

426
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:54,180
Military Command Center and in the

427
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,980
meantime he's saying you need to call an

428
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,689
MCC and get an air cap over there I

429
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,040
never had any kind of plans to get an

430
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,900
air cap and I said now I'm not really

431
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,189
sure what that's going to involve I knew

432
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,569
that any time we called somebody like

433
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:05,990
that we were gonna have to authenticate

434
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:08,580
now pulling out my attend ocation card

435
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:12,330
anyway at the same time that that was

436
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:13,530
going on that's when any secretary card

437
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,720
who was the chief of staff with

438
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:17,939
president interrupted his meeting with

439
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,250
the kids and whispered over his shoulder

440
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,750
that the second plane hit attacked we're

441
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,820
under attack or he said either the

442
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:25,140
United States is under attack and that's

443
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,330
when if you ever watch any the video

444
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:29,160
footage president bush all of a sudden

445
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:31,620
his his whole demeanor changed his face

446
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:34,829
got very serious he didn't want to jump

447
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:36,500
up and execute his mission he wanted to

448
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:39,510
make sure that he was being you know

449
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:42,000
looting a calm posture for the children

450
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:44,939
and let them know that he's in charge

451
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,980
and he knew that they were gonna find

452
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,900
out about it later on more importantly

453
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,100
anytime the president's in a room and if

454
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,959
you were talking to a group like this

455
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,970
even if it were a small group right

456
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,800
behind everybody would be the reporters

457
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:57,060
and so you have a whole crew of

458
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,459
reporters back there and they're all up

459
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:02,160
on podiums and all of a sudden he sees

460
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:03,870
their phones and and pagers buzzing and

461
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,300
going off so he they're getting the same

462
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:08,970
information that he just received

463
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:11,730
moments ago so now he knew that he was

464
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:14,250
on public stage and all the cameras were

465
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:16,079
oriented on him and he needs to exude

466
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,579
that presence of leadership instead of

467
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:23,040
you know waiting out like I would have

468
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:26,010
done so so I called the military command

469
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,300
center for air cab just a couple of

470
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:30,120
Fighters over over the White House

471
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,620
that's all and so I called him up and I

472
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,139
told the guy exactly what was going on

473
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:36,030
and there he knew and says requesting

474
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,690
air cap we need whatever you guys going

475
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,309
to provide

476
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,690
the White House we needed surveillance

477
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:42,960
over the White House for security

478
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:45,240
he said Roger that got it click I got my

479
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,440
card ready to go and I'm I'm I'm ready

480
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,350
to thinik eight there's a whole process

481
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,909
for that and I was kind of blindsided in

482
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:52,289
like three minutes later there are two

483
00:17:50,909 --> 00:17:55,080
fighters flying around the White House

484
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:56,940
up there Wow I did that now thinking now

485
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:01,199
I'm an insider's kind of threat guy I'm

486
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:04,769
a security guy I'm thinking hey I got

487
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:07,679
this but that that's something that came

488
00:18:04,769 --> 00:18:09,149
out a month later as we as we kind of

489
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,070
ran down the whole lessons learned of

490
00:18:09,149 --> 00:18:13,258
what could we have done better what

491
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:17,658
could anybody have done that or what did

492
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:17,659
we do right what are you wrong yes sir

493
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:29,169
they were armed absolutely yeah

494
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,170
yeah

495
00:18:30,149 --> 00:18:33,748
and they were followed up with armed as

496
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:35,569
soon as they were able to get I mean

497
00:18:33,749 --> 00:18:39,149
it's really a lot of it a show of force

498
00:18:35,569 --> 00:18:41,849
type of and and it was it was they were

499
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:49,619
in rooting and turned hey Bank left

500
00:18:41,849 --> 00:18:51,509
why just shut up and turn left yeah so

501
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:54,448
alright let's continue on a timeline

502
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:56,039
about nine nine eighteen is when after

503
00:18:54,449 --> 00:18:57,299
that directed attack that second

504
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,439
directed tag was like all right let's

505
00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:00,359
start evacuating so they started

506
00:18:58,439 --> 00:19:01,679
evacuating the Capitol and the White

507
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:02,999
House at that time because there were

508
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,819
reports that were all flying around

509
00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:07,349
saying the White House's imminent threat

510
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:10,549
under imminent threat the Capitol any

511
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:14,339
kind of National Archives in in the

512
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:17,400
Washington DC area was under attack and

513
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:20,599
we had also heard that

514
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,599
[Music]

515
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,230
dia / Bolling Air Force Base had been

516
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:29,000
attacked as well so there was a lot lots

517
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:32,360
of chatter coming on on the radios at

518
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,450
that time and so we started evacuating

519
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:37,010
our staff out of it out of the East Wing

520
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,030
and the new executive office building

521
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,400
and the old executive office building

522
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:41,510
out there as well I happen to have 10

523
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,800
iridium phones because we would take

524
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:44,150
them with us on travel because some of

525
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,740
these places we travel to we didn't

526
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,720
necessarily have any kind of secure comm

527
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:49,370
so everybody's familiar with the Iridium

528
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,840
phone is it's just a satellite phone it

529
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:52,040
has a little secure card in here and we

530
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,870
have our own operator that we'd go

531
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,360
through and then we could patch secure

532
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:59,419
calls through it well during that that

533
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:01,219
time the whole cell networks becomes had

534
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,750
become saturated so you couldn't pick up

535
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,910
a phone and call anybody and let anybody

536
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,650
know that you were okay at that time now

537
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:08,780
there were foam boxes around and you had

538
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:12,580
you know believe it or not you had some

539
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:14,990
regular old phone systems out there and

540
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,310
AT&T and Ma Bell whoever was out there

541
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:18,500
at the time you could you could get in

542
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:19,669
and throw a quarter in the phone but if

543
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,620
you had a cell phone you weren't gonna

544
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:22,940
get through to anybody these right here

545
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,100
we're working great we're rock stars

546
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:26,450
bigger services grabbing up front okay

547
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,790
we knew by when your phones would

548
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:30,740
distribute mouth and my guys and we were

549
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:32,600
able to communicate back with the peoc

550
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,520
the presidential Emergency Operations

551
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,649
Center which was downstairs in the

552
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,150
basement of the White House that's where

553
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:41,630
our guys were kind of running command

554
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:43,910
and control down there about that time

555
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:45,770
President Bush was preparing to address

556
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:48,860
the nation from the elementary school

557
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:51,950
and everybody really expected that he

558
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:53,449
was going to or the kids I'm sure were

559
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,190
the ones who were expecting that he was

560
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:58,040
gonna you know do this little clothing

561
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:59,300
speech and thank all them for having him

562
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,270
out there that day then he dropped the

563
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:04,460
bomb on the on the nation and the kids

564
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:06,290
all had to look a surprise in their

565
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,940
faces they had no idea what it was going

566
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:11,389
on they're pretty sheltered from but the

567
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:13,640
public that was going on so I had gone

568
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:15,140
out outside of the the grounds now

569
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,480
outside of the 18 acres and we began

570
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:19,340
building pushing out everybody and

571
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,400
evacuating all the buildings around the

572
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:24,020
White House is around the 18 acres as we

573
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,460
called it outside the security perimeter

574
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,870
and was pushing him out as far as we

575
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:29,540
could everybody was coming out of the

576
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:30,949
buildings and all the way out to 19th

577
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:34,820
Street which is out there by world bank

578
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:35,870
and so the businesses were just leaving

579
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,389
their doors open and they were running

580
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,459
out and there was

581
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:40,380
security out in the streets but very

582
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:43,590
quickly the street started becoming a

583
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:45,300
little ghost towns out there as as the

584
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:48,870
envelope began pushing out further and

585
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:52,110
further and thicker service rent and

586
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:54,449
grabbed Vice President Cheney out of the

587
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:55,800
West Wing and evacuated him the National

588
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:57,240
Security Adviser and some of the other

589
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,919
key staff downstairs into the

590
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:03,090
presidential Emergency Operations Center

591
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:04,710
and this is my boss right here at Jeff

592
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:09,270
Thompson no coming to play in just a

593
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:11,790
little bit so as we're standing out

594
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:13,020
there we're on 19th Street you know

595
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,950
there's a lot of speculation that there

596
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,840
was never a plane that hit the Pentagon

597
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:18,270
out there and you can listen to the

598
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,159
conspiracy theorists group conspiracy

599
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:22,290
theorists who say that there was never a

600
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:25,500
plane I'll tell you what I watched that

601
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:27,870
plane fly at rocket speed right at

602
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,160
treetop a building top level and I

603
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:30,719
thought it was going to the World Bank

604
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,340
is where I thought it was hitting but

605
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,510
you could hear it just screaming and I

606
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,980
thought it was the fighter jet and he

607
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:37,350
looked out there there was a big monster

608
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,730
jet coming down there and then we went

609
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:40,770
out of sight and then a few seconds

610
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:43,740
later you heard it impact over the

611
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:46,139
Pentagon and of course more speculation

612
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:48,540
was coming out that other sites were

613
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:50,990
being hit around around DC which were

614
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,990
all false

615
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:58,509
so after the impact I was called back

616
00:22:56,259 --> 00:23:00,100
into the peoc and they said I we need

617
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:03,700
you to link up with the first lady she's

618
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:04,809
going into to a safe house and I said

619
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,919
well you know how am I gonna get around

620
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:08,200
they're all the streets are blocked off

621
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,820
and I can't just go you know be-bopping

622
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,860
up you know run down the street so it

623
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:15,220
got me in a Secret Service vehicle and

624
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:17,229
it was almost surreal because the

625
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,789
streets were all complete ghost town at

626
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:21,279
that time and we were ripping up

627
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:22,779
Pennsylvania Avenue and heading up

628
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:24,490
towards the capital B to link up with

629
00:23:22,779 --> 00:23:30,580
her and we were probably going 120 miles

630
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:31,690
an hour but you can't go anywhere in DC

631
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,549
if you ever been dead who's driven

632
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:35,799
downtown DC or tried to drive downtown

633
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:38,200
DC right it's always you know you go

634
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:39,639
about from here that projector and

635
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,590
that's about as far you can go at any

636
00:23:39,639 --> 00:23:42,758
given time so it's really just one of

637
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:44,320
those moments you say wow this will

638
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:49,210
never happen again

639
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:51,399
so vice-president at that time was down

640
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:55,389
there and one of the call-outs came from

641
00:23:51,399 --> 00:23:57,219
the air cap that was following and

642
00:23:55,389 --> 00:24:00,008
chasing the the plane it was going out

643
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:01,509
the Shanksville Pennsylvania they said

644
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:04,029
hey we've got an unidentified aircraft

645
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:06,909
they're not responsive and they're

646
00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:08,080
heading towards the White House and it's

647
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:09,970
imminent threat they're coming to

648
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,699
Washington DC and they're gonna hit the

649
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:15,460
White House and the request was can we

650
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:17,379
engage this commercial aircraft and so

651
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,730
Jeff Thompson right here in that picture

652
00:24:17,379 --> 00:24:20,379
of my boss today as president Vice

653
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,970
President Cheney he engaged the

654
00:24:20,379 --> 00:24:25,330
president and then with the answer was

655
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:26,470
weapons free and well I'm kind of get

656
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,820
emotional in that because that's one of

657
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:30,429
those things that you're getting ready

658
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:31,629
to take out civilians lives and that's

659
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:33,940
the kind of emotional things you just

660
00:24:31,629 --> 00:24:35,980
even kind of run through your head the

661
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:37,720
the moral and ethics thing and the

662
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:39,250
pilots really had a hard time the still

663
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,769
as though real a later on in their life

664
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:49,120
that was a really tough decision for

665
00:24:41,769 --> 00:24:51,159
them to actually get that response so I

666
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,939
can link up with probably strongest

667
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:58,059
person that day and linked up with the

668
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:59,679
first lady and she's already down in the

669
00:24:58,059 --> 00:25:01,178
the safe house at the time and she's

670
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,039
she's in a little conference room it's

671
00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:04,330
about this size and she's got TV and

672
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,960
some drinks and everything set up in

673
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,909
there

674
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,820
and at non-alcoholic drinks she's she

675
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:11,530
drinking water but she's being taken

676
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:14,020
care of and we've got Ron sprinkle and

677
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:15,879
Nick trata from Secret Service and dr.

678
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,990
bill Lang who's the white the deputy

679
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,510
director of the White House

680
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:25,150
medical unit at the time are down there

681
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:29,170
and right about that time is when the

682
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:31,420
the South Tower collapsed and he only

683
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:33,880
been 56 minutes since the impact on that

684
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:35,260
one and and so that was a really

685
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:38,890
emotional time and then all of a sudden

686
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:42,700
you know these evacuation plans start

687
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:45,130
accelerating and and that's when flight

688
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:48,070
93 crashed in before anybody could

689
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:52,990
execute on the weapons-free order that

690
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:55,689
we've given so that time firstly pulls

691
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:56,110
me aside and she asks s me and Nick

692
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:59,320
Trotta

693
00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:01,840
Nick was head of her protective detail

694
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:04,899
at the time and said here here's what I

695
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:07,360
want I want some Blackhawks and I want

696
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,680
to fly to my next evacuation point and

697
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,790
here's all the staff and she gives me a

698
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,350
piece of paper a yellow piece of paper

699
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:13,780
here's all my staff that I want to bring

700
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:16,060
with me and one of those one of those

701
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,440
challenging question work on it ma'am

702
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:21,300
and we go over there and go talk to Nick

703
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:23,710
and Ron and the challenge was there's a

704
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:26,139
designated evacuation plan for the

705
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:29,380
president and the vice president spouses

706
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:31,120
are kind of ad-hoc we don't you know so

707
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,770
the plan for the vice president as you

708
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,899
age you know it's open source now the

709
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:37,629
vice president's plan was he was going

710
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:39,340
to drive in a motorcade to an officer

711
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:42,640
all aircraft now is you remember were

712
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:44,740
grounded and we weren't flying any kind

713
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:48,250
of helicopters around which is slow

714
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:50,170
movers versus fixed-wing and so

715
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:51,430
vice-president was even gonna roll out

716
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:52,870
in the motorcade so if you think the

717
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:54,610
Vice President was rolling do you think

718
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:58,239
she was going to get six Blackhawks to

719
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:59,169
fly so I got the nice honor of going in

720
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,960
and telling her she wasn't getting

721
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:04,840
aircraft and then I blocked my neck as

722
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,580
she tried to punch me in it no but I

723
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,220
mean it was understood and she's okay

724
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:10,570
well what's the plan and so we went we

725
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,010
went through the plan and the plan was

726
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:15,220
going to be if we had to evacuate we've

727
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:18,070
got a motorcade and and shortly after

728
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:21,290
that is when the North Tower collapse

729
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:23,000
so this word gets kind of good I'm sorry

730
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:24,770
bill I'm a little bit down on this point

731
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,010
but there was a little bit of humor in

732
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:29,830
all kinds of tragedy and so at that

733
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:32,810
point President had already evacuated

734
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:35,060
Sarasota and he and he started heading

735
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:37,550
west wanted to get him as far away from

736
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:39,200
Washington DC as he could he of course

737
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:41,180
wanted to go straight to DC I need to

738
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,380
get home I need to show that I'm in

739
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:44,330
charge and I'm not going to be run off

740
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:46,550
Secret Service had other plans and they

741
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:47,780
trumped them for a little while and I

742
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:53,530
was able to get him out of there so he

743
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:56,899
landed at Barksdale Air Force Base and

744
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:58,610
first lady was told that okay we're

745
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,510
gonna start working evacuation package

746
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:02,090
for you you need to get some things

747
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:07,100
together and it expect to be gone for a

748
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:09,590
few days so she sent Andy and Andy ball

749
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:11,179
which was her chief of staff and John

750
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:13,010
Meyers back there and she's oh by the

751
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,330
way get the dogs and the kitty for me

752
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:15,710
while you're there there's only two

753
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:17,090
living members that were above White

754
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:19,490
House grounds at that time and they were

755
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:23,629
in charge of the nation were spotty

756
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:24,980
Barney and Kitty and and so they grabbed

757
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:28,460
him up and carriers and brought him back

758
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:30,680
and the first thing that she does is she

759
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:32,360
starts putting him on a leash and she

760
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,320
starts coming out the door as she

761
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,350
finally got him she walked out the door

762
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,939
I said man what are you doing she says

763
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:40,310
oh I've got to take the babies out to go

764
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:42,800
walk we can't go outside in the walk you

765
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:44,960
know everybody's state of chaos and

766
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,419
they're gonna see you and they're gonna

767
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,010
know where you're at number one call it

768
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,430
a hiding space a hiding place for

769
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:51,980
nothing

770
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:53,690
for some reason right so I said I got it

771
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,400
I got it so I took the dogs and I walked

772
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:57,200
around the corner and just around the

773
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:00,470
corner in the hallway beautiful carpet

774
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,600
it probably cost one in my house and it

775
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:04,160
was thick and I'm pretty sure can we

776
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:07,459
cover that camera I'm probably but no

777
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:09,890
I'm just kidding I'm kidding it was it

778
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:11,990
was nice and it was Persian probably but

779
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,820
and he was really absorbent too by the

780
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:15,890
way

781
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:17,360
so walk around there and and stand there

782
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:19,280
with the dogs and a leash and said come

783
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,320
on do your thing and they did they went

784
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,370
piddle and walked around and she said

785
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,169
did they go - I said mission

786
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:25,669
accomplished oh thank you and I walked

787
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:27,200
in and I was like yeah so here president

788
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:31,470
so what do you do on 9/11 I walk the

789
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,730
dogs and then I turn to the uniformed

790
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,049
your service Canada we need to get

791
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:36,450
somebody to clean it up but that's

792
00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:40,110
probably gonna stain I don't know I'd

793
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:42,150
love to see that dry-cleaning bill but

794
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:44,070
and that's that's about that time is

795
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:46,320
when President Bush addressed the nation

796
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:48,389
from Barksdale and it was a short speech

797
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:52,500
just kind of letting everybody know that

798
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:53,159
we're gonna retaliate and we're gonna

799
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,409
get him back

800
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:57,210
he says I'm on my way back to the

801
00:29:55,409 --> 00:30:02,480
Washington DC well he wasn't he's

802
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:02,480
heading out to office at that time sir

803
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,840
uh-huh

804
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:26,100
but yeah yeah

805
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:33,710
well so you know Air Force one is from

806
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:35,780
Air Force One is the callsign for

807
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:37,730
whatever fixed-wing aircraft the

808
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:40,190
Presidents on and so when they took off

809
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:41,630
from Sarasota nobody else was in the air

810
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,680
at the time so they only had all the

811
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:44,060
air-traffic controllers in the world

812
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,230
only had one aircraft they're worried

813
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,879
about but they weren't calling

814
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:48,560
themselves Air Force One and we just you

815
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,850
know hey what's the flight plan they're

816
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,820
going hey he doesn't have a flight plan

817
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:55,159
we'll just do handoffs you know on as

818
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:56,899
he's rotating across the country and

819
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,310
well who we were handing off to well you

820
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:01,280
find out at the time so it's just kind

821
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:02,990
of guys just go with it so Mark Tillman

822
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:06,110
Colonel mark Tillman was the pilot at

823
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:07,580
the time and he was having a you know he

824
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:09,740
was going as fast as that thing goes if

825
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:11,240
it the wings would have bowed back he

826
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,380
would have probably gone supersonic on

827
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,360
that thing

828
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:19,130
so anyway am i doing all right on time

829
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:23,030
yeah so about that time first lady was

830
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:27,200
notified that barber Olson was on flight

831
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:28,460
77 that engaged the Pentagon and and she

832
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,640
was a good friend of hers worked for CNN

833
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:35,180
and Fox and she was the husband the she

834
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:38,600
was the spouse of Ted Olson who was the

835
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:40,490
Solicitor General for the Department of

836
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,810
Justice and good friends with them and

837
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:44,270
of course that was an emotional moment

838
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:46,909
right away when you now you start having

839
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:51,770
some personal ties with some of the

840
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:53,900
tragedy so this is another another one

841
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:56,210
of those comical moments during the days

842
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:57,980
when I was called darling by the

843
00:31:56,210 --> 00:32:00,860
president United States doesn't happen

844
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:02,660
very often but we have a protocol when

845
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:04,010
we want to engage a phone call we would

846
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:06,050
call up the White House communications

847
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:07,790
agency operators they want to initiate a

848
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,600
call with the president on behalf of

849
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:10,610
first lady

850
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,560
he's on Air Force One at the time and

851
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:14,570
and so when they get him on the line

852
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:17,149
once they verifies in the line the next

853
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:18,530
thing you hear is the operator will say

854
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:19,730
next voice you hear will be the

855
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:21,410

856
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:22,370

858
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:25,969
supposed to kind of hand them off I

859
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:28,010

860
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:30,530

called Darla now walk dogs you know it

866
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:46,789
was an easy day at work right but he

867
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:48,289
didn't think that was a little cute he's

868
00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:49,850
a he's a river he likes the kid around a

869
00:32:48,289 --> 00:32:51,590
lot worst thing you could ever do is you

870
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:53,480
he's ever given talk and let your phone

871
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:54,860
go off and you'll get kicked out of the

872
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,020
room real quick you your phone buzzes

873
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,399
see you later you get kicked out of room

874
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:02,240
by the president probably not going to

875
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:04,429
cover me more if you're reporters but so

876
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:09,409
this is about that time he 250 he

877
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:11,270
arrived in office and and he was sitting

878
00:33:09,409 --> 00:33:14,330
he took him down the bunker they did

879
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:15,980
some planning and they said this is

880
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:17,750
where he gonna stay for the wall I'm not

881
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:22,159
gonna be down here in the bunker in and

882
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:24,320
off at North Nebraska he says we're

883
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:27,970
going home and they made arrangements

884
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:30,639
and got him home so he returned to

885
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:33,740
Washington DC later on that evening and

886
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,330
and shortly after that we would

887
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:37,640
connected up the first lady and returned

888
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:39,168
her back and it was a nice little Union

889
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,480
down there in the basement real quick

890
00:33:39,169 --> 00:33:43,730
and he got to work right away with his

891
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,760
national security advisors and it began

892
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:48,169
formulating a plan one of the things

893
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,669
that came out earlier in the day was

894
00:33:48,169 --> 00:33:52,970
Vice President Cheney said I want live

895
00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:55,460
footage of Ground Zero from overhead

896
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:58,850
satellites right now I want I want to be

897
00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:00,110
able to pull that in everybody just kind

898
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:01,789
of looked at in dump I'm gonna have that

899
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:03,168
capability what do you mean I don't have

900
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:04,220
that capability so I want to look at and

901
00:34:03,169 --> 00:34:05,539
see what it looks like right now well

902
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,710
you can't just redirect a satellite you

903
00:34:05,539 --> 00:34:09,199
have to catch up when they're in that

904
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:10,668
swath you could turn them on and and you

905
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,658
can you can tune them a little bit but

906
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:13,520
you just can't say all right we're gonna

907
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:16,310
turn that sucker like on Star Trek and

908
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:19,270
he's gonna come back around and hit you

909
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:21,049
so right away it was like all right

910
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:22,668
lessons learned we need some more

911
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:25,490
coverage and then he wanted some footage

912
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:27,500
you want a real-time footage of or not

913
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:30,830
real time but near real-time what it

914
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:33,369
looked like just minutes before the

915
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:35,779
incident out there so he wanted rollover

916
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:38,690
imaging he says well how much do you

917
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:40,450
want all in New York I want the world so

918
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:43,159
we built the server of the world

919
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:45,949
after that lots of money was available

920
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:47,389
after 9/11 that she didn't have when

921
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:50,029
secretary hammers were saying yeah we're

922
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:52,159
putting all the kibosh on a lot of your

923
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:54,230
funding but I can tell you how much it

924
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:57,440
costs and how much how many racks it

925
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:59,750
takes to put the world in at a five

926
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:03,680
meter resolution by the way back then it

927
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:04,760
was five terabytes for the world but I

928
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,049
think it's a little bit bigger than out

929
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,760
now that you can get a lot of that stuff

930
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:09,950
that used to be classified that imagery

931
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,980
resolution now you're down to you know

932
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:16,629
five feet resolution is nothing now it's

933
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:19,430
now it's inches huh

934
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:22,280
yeah and so you know Google for the four

935
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:24,109
hundred dollar fee you're getting you

936
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,210
know one foot resolution and you can

937
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:28,280
even go down some of the other services

938
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:30,140
for inches you know that quarter on

939
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:36,860
heads or tails that add a quarter or is

940
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:39,140
it a yes so about that time 8:30 he

941
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:40,610
dressed the nation you know from from

942
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:43,490
the White House and that was kind of his

943
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:44,780
posturing that okay back in the seat

944
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:46,399
you're not going to run me off and

945
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:48,770
here's what's gonna happen next and

946
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,510
you're gonna pay for it so he had a long

947
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:51,800
day he and the first lady decided

948
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:53,810
they're gonna go upstairs the residence

949
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,850
and take a nap or go to sleep and so

950
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:57,080
they went down and just after ten

951
00:35:55,850 --> 00:36:00,589
o'clock is when they went to bed and

952
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:05,750
then one of the f-16 that was pulling

953
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:07,370
air cap covered he was pulling air cap

954
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:11,210
he was go ahead and back to Andrews Air

955
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:13,430
Force Base and had not checked in as he

956
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:15,200
is he crossed a sector out there and all

957
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:16,310
of a sudden it sent up alarms and I

958
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,020
thought the White House is under attack

959
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:19,430
and they grabbed Secret Service ran

960
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,890
upstairs shook the president awake

961
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:24,649
brought him downstairs first lady's

962
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:27,100
wearing very nice nightgown with a robe

963
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:29,690
over top of some fuzzy slippers

964
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:33,290
president's wearing some boxer shorts

965
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:35,000
and this probably more read like your

966
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:37,850
necklace right there

967
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,840
t-shirt that's got moth holes all beaten

968
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:40,160
up and eaten up on there I'm thinking

969
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:43,490
that's the president United States

970
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,020
you've got a mafia shirt awesome you

971
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:46,520
know so when I've got a little hole in

972
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,680
my shirt my wife's ready to throw a I

973
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:51,430
was like POTUS can run around with it so

974
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:53,339
that was that was the last moment of

975
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:55,140
comedy that night and

976
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:56,609
they realized and they said it was one

977
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:59,368
of ours one of ours and actually one of

978
00:36:56,609 --> 00:37:03,269
the air force guys who was working Night

979
00:36:59,369 --> 00:37:05,099
Watch in there said hey no sway bars he

980
00:37:03,269 --> 00:37:08,069
was like great I got out of bed for this

981
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:11,789
and nobody really had a whole lot of the

982
00:37:08,069 --> 00:37:13,170
humor at that point of the day but all

983
00:37:11,789 --> 00:37:16,289
in all it was one of those emotional

984
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:17,789
days that everybody kind of stepped out

985
00:37:16,289 --> 00:37:20,489
of their comfort zone and stepped out of

986
00:37:17,789 --> 00:37:23,539
their box and when irrespective of what

987
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:25,890
your role was an environment like that

988
00:37:23,539 --> 00:37:28,019
somebody asks you to do something we did

989
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:29,759
it and very commensurate to a lot of

990
00:37:28,019 --> 00:37:31,828
times when we run through emergency in

991
00:37:29,759 --> 00:37:33,119
our own environment out there when

992
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:35,910
you're a team player you just kind of do

993
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:39,229
what you're supposed to do but with that

994
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:41,910
I know it's a little bit shorter than

995
00:37:39,229 --> 00:37:46,669
expected but I offer it up and I welcome

996
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:57,930
questions about anything on that day or

997
00:37:46,670 --> 00:38:03,299
outside the realm of 911 sir so watching

998
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:06,690
her comfort us here we were Ron sprinkle

999
00:38:03,299 --> 00:38:07,650
who was her deputy Secret Service lead

1000
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:12,180
and Nick Trotta

1001
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:14,700
was her lead and bill Lang we were all

1002
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:16,019
back in there trying to figure out how

1003
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:19,019
we were going to tell her that there

1004
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:21,508
wasn't a designated evacuation package

1005
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:23,758
to the certain to the same extreme that

1006
00:38:21,509 --> 00:38:25,170
she was expecting and she saw us

1007
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:27,119
struggling with that when we're all in

1008
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:31,710
there huddling up going on it's kind of

1009
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:34,049
like pulling straws and they know her a

1010
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:35,819
lot better I mean Nick and and Ron were

1011
00:38:34,049 --> 00:38:37,410
with her every day so they could you

1012
00:38:35,819 --> 00:38:45,538
know go up I didn't see her every day

1013
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:47,038
and she probably came out kind of like

1014
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:50,400
you know this isn't my first rodeo she

1015
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:53,039
didn't say the exact word she's just

1016
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,019
very approachable and watching her her

1017
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:58,840
demeanor all day long with the exception

1018
00:38:55,019 --> 00:39:01,839
of when Barbara Olson

1019
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:04,090
announced that she had died in the was

1020
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:08,380
on the plane that hit the White House or

1021
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:10,660
the Pentagon she broke down then but she

1022
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:12,930
was consoling and she when she had

1023
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:17,560
called her daughter's earlier than a day

1024
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:19,830
and family she was consoling everybody

1025
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,830
else

1026
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:40,920
I don't know that will we'll ever know

1027
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:46,010
that lots of speculation but no not that

1028
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:51,380
I know of no no they were at school and

1029
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:51,380
they were taken to safe houses

1030
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:07,968
yeah

1031
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:10,459
yeah and and so it was all over the map

1032
00:40:07,969 --> 00:40:14,180
on national archives you hit the first

1033
00:40:10,459 --> 00:40:15,739
hit the first monument or first National

1034
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:18,828
Archive or anything that really

1035
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:22,690
signifies you know history and

1036
00:40:18,829 --> 00:40:22,690
Washington DC and America

1037
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:34,060
Oh

1038
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:40,430
yeah well I learned how to build servers

1039
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:42,050
right away that was never in my realm I

1040
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:44,390
mean again I was a computer crimes kind

1041
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:46,250
of guy so I was always looking from a

1042
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:47,540
different perspective and the guys who

1043
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:49,580
are building in the defense I was

1044
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:53,540
looking from the perspective of

1045
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:54,980
forensics CFE kind of background and all

1046
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:58,070
of a sudden I'm thrown in because I

1047
00:40:54,980 --> 00:41:03,110
happen to have a technology title in my

1048
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:05,600
name and because I'm in security so well

1049
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:08,300
as a security protected security measure

1050
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:10,040
we need to have the world at one meter

1051
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,510
well some place you didn't even have

1052
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,130
that resolution so there loves if

1053
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:16,000
there's a lot of spirit play development

1054
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:19,520
or no way that you don't have that but

1055
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:24,080
learn what it took and how how much

1056
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:25,910
bandwidth it took time but you know

1057
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,770
communications are key to anything I

1058
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:29,299
mean you can't accomplish any mission

1059
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:31,430
without communications and

1060
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:36,080
communications were down so there are a

1061
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:39,980
lot of dark communications now that we

1062
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:41,900
didn't have back then and a whole lot of

1063
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:45,440
people who are believers an Iridium

1064
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:47,300
phone that you know shortly after that

1065
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,860
they were investing in iridium phones if

1066
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,630
you were in the iridium business I think

1067
00:41:48,860 --> 00:42:00,800
you probably saw a spike in your

1068
00:41:50,630 --> 00:42:03,110
customer base yeah yeah so I mean for me

1069
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,180
a lot of it was planned

1070
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:07,040
plan plan planning you know kind of run

1071
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:09,379
through the pardon my language the aw

1072
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,210
 scenarios think about the things

1073
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:12,560
that are bad if you run a data center

1074
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:16,160
think about all the things that could

1075
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,990
run and and cause mayhem how many how

1076
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,270
many data centers have we read about in

1077
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:23,439
the last six months or a year that have

1078
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:23,440
been shut down by squirrels

1079
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:29,970
yeah hey you know what Vegas just got

1080
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:32,400
hit two days ago

1081
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:35,040
do you see the flood that they have down

1082
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,890
there they had a rain that hit like for

1083
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:42,360
four hours down in Las Vegas out there

1084
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:45,450
towards University of Nevada Las Vegas

1085
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:47,250
and they got slammed it was on the news

1086
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:48,600
the night before I flew there were

1087
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:50,760
people standing out in front of their

1088
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:52,259
homes and and emergency relief was out

1089
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,710
there and their houses were half under

1090
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,330
water

1091
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:56,400
I'm pretty I'm pretty sure they didn't

1092
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:58,860
have a flood plan out there and so if

1093
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:01,680
you're in switch data centers down there

1094
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:03,990
in Las Vegas I don't know how how you

1095
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,730
know how they are in that area I don't

1096
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:11,069
know where they are in relation to that

1097
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:13,380
downtown you know they were probably one

1098
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:17,570
who relooked their their flood plans

1099
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:17,570
that they probably don't have sir

1100
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:37,790
so in my role my job was to go out and

1101
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:39,319
travel in advance but a month and a half

1102
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:41,029
in front of the president or wherever he

1103
00:43:39,319 --> 00:43:43,579
was going to travel to he was going to

1104
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:45,140
you know three stops in Europe we would

1105
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:47,000
travel out there work with host nation

1106
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:48,650
security to talk to those intelligence

1107
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,030
folks and work you know what are the

1108
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:52,339
local threats that you have we'd bring

1109
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:53,720
that together and pull that and sync it

1110
00:43:52,339 --> 00:43:56,808
up with our intelligence and put

1111
00:43:53,720 --> 00:44:00,859
together a threat package for that's for

1112
00:43:56,809 --> 00:44:02,990
me and working with Secret Service in a

1113
00:44:00,859 --> 00:44:05,089
you know a true protective role and

1114
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:08,000
evacuation well it was out of my box it

1115
00:44:05,089 --> 00:44:09,828
wasn't something that I had to do on a

1116
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,770
day-to-day basis so I was winging it

1117
00:44:09,829 --> 00:44:15,490
right along with it a lot of it was

1118
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:18,200
being responsive to the leadership and

1119
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:20,328
addressing those those questions and

1120
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:25,279
demands in a lot of cases the best you

1121
00:44:20,329 --> 00:44:27,760
can without without losing any more that

1122
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,760
we already had

1123
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:35,830
yeah true you're gonna wing it you're

1124
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:37,870
gonna you're gonna have to have that

1125
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:39,250
that fallback plan every time and

1126
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:42,029
sometimes it's best to just go shoot

1127
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:42,030
your fallback plan

1128
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:08,220
and the worst thing anybody wants to

1129
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:10,650
hear when they call somebody for

1130
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:12,390
assistance is it's not my job right you

1131
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:14,640
know everything's your job when you're I

1132
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:16,170
look at myself in a customer support

1133
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,930
role right I've got people in my data

1134
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:20,060
center relying on me to provide them

1135
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:22,770
space power and cooling and

1136
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:27,110
communications everything's my job if it

1137
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:30,110
means I'm getting a zero 1password

1138
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:30,110
sir

1139
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:06,308
