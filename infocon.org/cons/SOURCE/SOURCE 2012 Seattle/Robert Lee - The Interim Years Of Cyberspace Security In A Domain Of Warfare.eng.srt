1
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,910
all right good morning

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,800
robert lee they'll be presenting

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,870
years of cyberspace sort of just my

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,119
views on where we currently aren't in

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:19,099
the domain I am an airforce Irish

6
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,130
cyberspace operations officer

7
00:00:19,099 --> 00:00:23,689
I work in Germany for viscera which is

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,669
the Air Force Intelligence Surveillance

9
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:29,420
reconnaissance agency and we'll be able

10
00:00:25,669 --> 00:00:31,609
to work with and I do cyber alright so

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,140
first things first just lever we'll know

12
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:34,430
that these are my opinions these are my

13
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,620
thoughts but not the government's not

14
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,970
the Air Force no one else so if anyone

15
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,739
has any issues with them feel free to

16
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:42,680
email me I love good intellectual

17
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:44,959
debates but again not representative of

18
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,010
the government alright so these are the

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,500
takeaways that I want to give everyone a

20
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,180
day I really want to focus on lessons

21
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,559
learned from airpower and some of the

22
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,360
things that they picked up when they

23
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:55,760
went through the interim years of air

24
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,469
power aspects of the interim years of

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,030
cyber so to talk about how I define it

26
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:01,010
and some of the aspects that I believe

27
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,329
in compass for the man currently the

28
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,220
need for civilian and military

29
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:05,509
partnership for really tackling advanced

30
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,670
threats things you can't just create

31
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:09,979
signatures for and the seriousness of

32
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:14,060
what the future holds beyond just the

33
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:15,950
security budget or CIO so meeting so

34
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,610
jump right in we'll get into the lessons

35
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,950
learned from airpower

36
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:21,319
so the interim years of airpower really

37
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,420
this time when between World War one and

38
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:25,640
World War two where airpower really came

39
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:28,069
into its own this is the time of

40
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,750
advocates and pioneers and air shows and

41
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:31,849
technological developments that really

42
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:35,479
secure the air domain it allowed us to

43
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:37,220
win the air domain that's what I sort of

44
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:38,869
feel how we are currently in cyber but

45
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,979
if you'll notice some of the things that

46
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:41,750
are going on air show is are very

47
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:44,030
similar so the technological conferences

48
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,489
that we go to I think that we have we're

49
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,959
a little bit off on our approach if you

50
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:50,539
remember air shows they were cheap

51
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:51,800
they're free they're inspiring kids go

52
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:53,090
to air shows they see these

53
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,590
technological developments they get

54
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,840
inspired they look up they go man I

55
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,520
won't fly that or I want to build that

56
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,050
or I want to have some part in this

57
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,940
domain I think that we're currently

58
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,830
missing out on that and in terms of

59
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,920
cyber conferences are great including

60
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:10,128
this one they appeal to different people

61
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,020
that different companies whatever but we

62
00:02:10,128 --> 00:02:13,489
have very expensive conferences very

63
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,319
expensive training very expensive

64
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:17,390
developments in the domain that's not

65
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:19,570
available to everyone I feel that that's

66
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,890
part of where we're failing as a domain

67
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:24,209
we need to really have affordable

68
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,500
solutions for everyone to take part

69
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:26,909
and we need the advocates and pioneers

70
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,819
to go out there whether it's civilian or

71
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:31,379
military people that are really gonna

72
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:33,450
embody the de Bain like Billy Mitchell

73
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:36,120
and huge ventured and Julio - hey talk

74
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,649
about cyberspace doctor and an aspect so

75
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,780
we just currently don't have we don't

76
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,250
have tenets of cyber power it's hard to

77
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,230
lead a war or talk about cyber

78
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:47,939
capabilities without having doctrine and

79
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:49,469
tenants now this is a phrase that was

80
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:51,870
coined in 1932 in the British Parliament

81
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:53,730
the bomber always gets through that's

82
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,650
sort of how I view cyber right now

83
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,970
you never hear of the attack that

84
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,620
doesn't get through you hear about the

85
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,659
text constantly getting through the

86
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,829
bomber always gets through this is

87
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:04,500
something the defence industry is

88
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:06,629
currently faced with we always have

89
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,090
attacks that succeed now attacks

90
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:10,560
obviously sometimes fail but the bomber

91
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,719
eventually will always break through

92
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,879
whatever defenses happen it's the idea

93
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,138
of fighting through that attack trying

94
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,018
to recover trying to have an instance

95
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:20,280
response plan try and move past this but

96
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,719
it isn't where we need to keep the

97
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,209
domain when you start talking about

98
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:26,819
solutions outside this if you looked at

99
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:27,810
this term you also had people like Billy

100
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:29,518
Mitchell that came out said you know

101
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,049
what farmers aren't the only way we need

102
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,760
a pack aircraft we need intelligence

103
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:34,769
with surveillance aircraft need other

104
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,388
approaches to this little box an idea

105
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:38,430
that we have and that's really what

106
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:40,919
allowed us to expand the air domain and

107
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,790
again quote-unquote win it so that's

108
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:43,919
something I feel that we should be

109
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,750
focusing more on it's different ideas

110
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,939
instead just firewalls and solutions

111
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:51,060
that we hear a good talk going on

112
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:52,379
downstairs the BYOD well that's an issue

113
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,449
that we have to be faced with but it's

114
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:56,728
again I point out yesterday it's not

115
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:58,620
something that's really new is access to

116
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:59,970
data well we need to be thinking outside

117
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,739
the box and thinking about how we're

118
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:04,620
gonna do data and how we're gonna do

119
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:08,549
defense differently anybody know what

120
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:10,709
this picture is 1947 President Truman

121
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:12,989
signed the National Security Act this

122
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:15,030
was created the Air Force this was the

123
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:16,470
vectored approach you had the Department

124
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,000
of Navy and apartment of arming

125
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,299
bickering over who is going to control

126
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,229
air power who is gonna have air assets

127
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:23,849
well this is something that I sort of

128
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,409
see us right now in cyber we're

129
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:27,120
bickering we're complaining like well

130
00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:29,250
who's bubble is this you know whose area

131
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,810
this well you own defense you should do

132
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,880
that or well this is your security

133
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:34,080
policy in the military we have a little

134
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,849
bit of bickering on who's really going

135
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,380
to own cyber the Air Force is try to

136
00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:38,270
stand up

137
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,909
they will we are the leading cutting at

138
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,140
people will be will do cyber the Navy

139
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:44,000
has got some pretty talented guys and

140
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,200
gals too saying with the army and then

141
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,190
you've got the National Security Agency

142
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,539
doing cyber as well so I see it is us

143
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,400
having currently sort of a split

144
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,770
approach which doesn't necessarily work

145
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't think that we need a cyber force

146
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:58,010
this isn't what I'm trying to get across

147
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,550
I know there are some good debates for a

148
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:03,680
cyber force I think very good discussion

149
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:05,060
points that need to be had but again

150
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,200
just more of a vector approach both in

151
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,670
the military and the student community

152
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,740
to understand that we live and operate

153
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:12,320
in the same domain we need to understand

154
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:16,100
what we're doing as an industry as a

155
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,930
just a domain take it forward even next

156
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:22,190
this one's a bit harder to guess it's

157
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:23,750
the airport tactics school acts it was

158
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,969
first of its kind in the world we had

159
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,440
education and tactics for air power you

160
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,660
had this school that stood up and said

161
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,100
hey let's take these pilots and teach

162
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,640
other pilots what they've already

163
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,230
learned

164
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,360
let's take tactics and strategy and

165
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:36,980
doctrine and embody it of schools that

166
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,570
can have culture and education and

167
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,670
tradition and it's how we're gonna take

168
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:42,170
our domain forward well this is an

169
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:44,090
awesome idea that we're still sort of

170
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:46,280
lacking in fibers we have a few schools

171
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:48,799
in the military that kind of approach

172
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,969
this we have undergraduate cyber

173
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,890
training which is pretty good in the Air

174
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:55,190
Force trying to get going on teaching

175
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:57,260
cyber officers what it is the cyber a

176
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:59,990
really good step we have is this past

177
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,610
year they stir up the cyber track of the

178
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,230
weapons school so you now have cyber

179
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,420
weapons officers in the Air Force which

180
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:07,040
is awesome it's someone who again is

181
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,230
gonna go look at tactics and doctrine

182
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,760
and look at how we go forward but it's

183
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,980
something in the security industry that

184
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,909
we really don't ifs ands and EC counts

185
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,860
and we have all these different schools

186
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,930
but again it's not so much a culture

187
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,240
that everyone can buy into they're great

188
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,440
programs but very expensive again I want

189
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,240
to focus on the fact that we have to

190
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,540
have education available to everybody on

191
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,800
this from much earlier standpoint then

192
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,480
you got the fact that capabilities can

193
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,490
be more than just capabilities

194
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,740
capabilities can be statements political

195
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:36,010
economic socio socio political

196
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:39,410
statements that's right here's a b-52

197
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:40,940
Vietnam linebacker - that was a big

198
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:43,640
statement to the rest of the world when

199
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:45,560
we did this this wasn't just blowing up

200
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,870
a few trees and blown up people and and

201
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,040
the b-52 flying in this was a political

202
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,199
statement to the rest of the world that

203
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,830
look at our

204
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:55,120
look at what we have and what we can do

205
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:57,310
anytime that you use the capability

206
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,659
we're making those same statements when

207
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:00,879
we'll get into a little bit later you've

208
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:04,029
heard plenty of four years now Stuxnet

209
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:06,610
that was more than just capability waged

210
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:08,650
by some country that was a statement and

211
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,449
had a large statement all the other

212
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:12,698
nations in the world I guarantee you

213
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:14,110
after Stuxnet came out that nation-state

214
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:16,090
leaders in various countries called

215
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,639
meetings and said first of all was that

216
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:21,279
us and second of all how do we do that

217
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,349
cuz that is a big statement and third of

218
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:25,240
all for everyone else is how do we

219
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:27,639
defend against it a signature just

220
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,169
wanted me to do it then you have the

221
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:31,689
idea that you can blur the lines of war

222
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:33,188
war can be a very ugly nasty thing

223
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:34,479
including with cyber technological

224
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:37,419
advancements don't just make the ugliest

225
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,669
no for ugliness of war go away who they

226
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:41,020
do hey start talking about the fact that

227
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:43,150
air power can reach out and touch

228
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:45,698
anybody no more do you have these lines

229
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:47,349
of war we have the aspects of air power

230
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:49,180
reaching into the heart of a country

231
00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:51,878
attacking civilian populations or the

232
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:53,650
leadership he truly believed that if you

233
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,750
attack the civilian population they

234
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:58,419
would crumble and then the war be over

235
00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:00,009
now he tried to pontificate on this not

236
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:02,500
to say attacking civilians necessarily

237
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:04,240
good but he thought that by doing that

238
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,849
they would end war sooner and you have

239
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,669
left casualties in War problem doing

240
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:10,990
that is we found out that you would

241
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:12,460
attack civilian population they rally

242
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,750
around the cause they rally around the

243
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,089
government they'd rally around what was

244
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:18,580
going on and say hey those guys the bad

245
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:21,279
guys we're the good guys we should be

246
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:22,508
doing something about this right now we

247
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:24,129
can't really do that with cyber so much

248
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:26,469
to that rebuking attribution for this

249
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:29,199
hard mythical beats of paint if you have

250
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:30,460
cyber capabilities and you blurred the

251
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,260
lines of war and you were able to

252
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,299
attacks data are you able to take down a

253
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,948
power grid if you can't figure out who

254
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:38,019
did it well now you have a civilian

255
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:39,728
population there from fear that's a very

256
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:41,948
scary thought to be able to be reached

257
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:43,599
out and touched by anybody your privacy

258
00:08:41,948 --> 00:08:45,790
your home computer whatever it is it's a

259
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,500
very scary thought and so we can really

260
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,829
understand attribution and really obtain

261
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,060
it

262
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:50,829
we're not going to be able to rally

263
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:54,819
around and move forward respect

264
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:57,370
responsibly so beginning the aspects of

265
00:08:54,819 --> 00:08:59,349
interim years for me the interim years

266
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,060
of cyberspace began around the Gulf War

267
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:02,410
so you're looking at Operation Desert

268
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,400
Storm II start having these cyber

269
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,650
capabilities come to

270
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,480
before that it was just the ones and

271
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:08,920
zeroes and data starting to figure out

272
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,470
what the internet is starting to look at

273
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,660
our Pinet you're really figuring out

274
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:15,130
what is the Internet

275
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,779
another storm regardless that they were

276
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,380
offensive defensive I don't know wasn't

277
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:20,200
there

278
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:22,300
they still use cyber capabilities they

279
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,130
were able to connect up and talk to the

280
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,079
troops they were able to understand what

281
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,610
was going on in a larger area it allowed

282
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,370
the military leaders have much more

283
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:32,800
today on what goes on the battlefield so

284
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:35,050
you move that forward and and it's a

285
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,520
time of nation state testing out the

286
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:38,680
capability try and develop those

287
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,270
strategies we also have non nation state

288
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,859
actor involvement I think this is

289
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:43,329
something that is really key to our

290
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,430
domain something I'll touch on a little

291
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:47,020
bit is the fact that you didn't have too

292
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:49,150
many civilian pilots during World War

293
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:51,040
two going up and taken down German

294
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,779
aircraft but now you've got cyber

295
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,480
operators that have computers that they

296
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:56,620
can weaponize with programs and and ones

297
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,930
and zeros and whatever they want to do

298
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:01,900
and they can actually have physical or

299
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:04,569
espionage base capabilities that they

300
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,319
can employ against political enemies so

301
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,730
it's something that we have to really

302
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,380
look at and then you have ongoing

303
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,029
nation-state operations run it's time

304
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,589
again the boundaries haven't been set

305
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:13,209
the legal aspect part there you have

306
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:15,970
nation-states that say well this isn't

307
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:18,310
war or this isn't something that's title

308
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:20,380
10 title 50 whatever it may be we can do

309
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:22,150
this and it's legal that's something

310
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,500
that every nation state currently or not

311
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:26,110
every nation say but most nation states

312
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,390
are looking at ongoing cyber operations

313
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:30,339
and how to use them we also have

314
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:32,199
powerful statements I don't how many top

315
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:33,640
this mo news but Marine Lieutenant

316
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,520
General Richard Mills came out and said

317
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:39,010
that he used cyber capabilities in

318
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,420
Afghanistan 2010 a very public statement

319
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:42,640
once the only public statements about

320
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:45,579
things like this that said yes we were

321
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,910
using cyber capabilities to impact the

322
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:50,620
enemy again this is the time when these

323
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,400
things are coming to light the

324
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,560
cyberspace

325
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,390
domain is not going to be the super dark

326
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,369
secret domain II more even talk about

327
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:58,870
f-22 and f-35 and talking about the

328
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,980
weaponry on it we talk about cyber

329
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,779
weapon and all the sudden people start

330
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,100
going to jail but now things are

331
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:04,689
starting to come to life now we started

332
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,160
getting an aspect of the domain where

333
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:08,260
people are talking about it and trying

334
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,579
to push it forward but we also have

335
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,560
other things that happened like Stuxnet

336
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,360
for instance we have the New York Times

337
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,160
article that most people saw and said

338
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,670
yes the US and Israel are responsible

339
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,280
now

340
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:20,990
to meet a speculative attribution yes

341
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,270
I'm in the air force yes that I am

342
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:26,270
responsible for my statements regardless

343
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:27,829
of my statement beginning but I still

344
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,060
believe it's speculative you don't have

345
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:30,830
the government coming out saying yes

346
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,020
this is up you may have a lot of proof

347
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:34,910
may have a lot of understanding I mean

348
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,439
when people originally analyzed the code

349
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,760
and you're looking at it it was pretty

350
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,540
clear that there was only a few nation

351
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,730
states in the world that could have

352
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,020
possibly pulled it off I wasn't until

353
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,030
two years later than New York Times

354
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,740
article came out and everyone oh my god

355
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:47,319
yes this was them which people have been

356
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:49,790
saying that for years

357
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,070
but again still speculative because a

358
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,319
lot of the aspects of the attribution

359
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:56,000
are still false if you read through from

360
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,380
a technical standpoint on the leaks a

361
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,330
lot of information is physically

362
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,710
impossible

363
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:02,810
however the attribution is there and how

364
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:04,130
you deal with that is very important so

365
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,660
now you have the rest of the world that

366
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:07,550
truly believes the US and Israel did it

367
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,380
regardless that they did or not they're

368
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:11,390
responsible regardless if they want to

369
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:13,790
come out say this was it was not us we

370
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:16,400
have to deal with it nations will look

371
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,910
to us as that person that drops the

372
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,130
figurative

373
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:21,589
atomic bomb which is a quote I've heard

374
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:24,140
and hate because it's nothing like an

375
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:25,700
atomic bomb but it's that key moment so

376
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:27,500
this is what I see is that piece of the

377
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,090
interim years so this is where I think

378
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,170
we're gonna start going back down we

379
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,910
have to figure out these things in a

380
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,439
hurry as we start speeding up and

381
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:35,240
eventually the interim years are gonna

382
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,190
stop and hopefully before we get that

383
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,050
next conflict I don't think it's a new

384
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,790
world war three but four get that next

385
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:43,130
major conflict hopefully we understand

386
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:45,349
cyber hopefully we understand the legal

387
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:48,320
aspects cyber deterrence aspect and

388
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:49,940
really define our terms and doctrine so

389
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,930
then we have anonymous everyone loves an

390
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:55,130
honor

391
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:56,569
I don't but they're a group that uh most

392
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:59,780
of you are familiar with they go out and

393
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:00,740
and do whatever they want but there's

394
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,810
someone that you have to consider again

395
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:05,660
it's civilian pilots right it's the

396
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:08,329
group that go out and have real effects

397
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:10,370
on people if anonymous for instance says

398
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,600
yes we're based in the US which they're

399
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,860
not they're all around the world as we

400
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,150
all know but they there were us and

401
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,490
there are groups and they went out and

402
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:18,500
had a real impact on another nation we

403
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:19,700
could be responsible for them we have to

404
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,920
understand how these groups are going to

405
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,540
impact the domain you have to capitalize

406
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,120
on it but we also have good people right

407
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:28,219
this is a guy I really like sunny long

408
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,550
does hackers for charity he says hey

409
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,290
I've got a set of skills I like this

410
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,819
untalented I'm gonna go make a

411
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:35,529
difference she raises money and take the

412
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:38,200
skills and he works in Africa and he

413
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:40,480
tries to teach people and give them

414
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,370
access to IP and Internet facilities and

415
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,930
say hey go out and learn and I'm gonna

416
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,730
make your quality of life just that much

417
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:48,550
better you've got these independent

418
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:49,779
actors you got the gesture most people

419
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:53,019
want to know about the gesture he's

420
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:55,180
hacktivist for good I don't typically

421
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:58,329
advocate for people to go out and do

422
00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:00,729
their own things I think that's uh going

423
00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:02,199
out against al-qaeda going out and get

424
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:05,200
terrorist organizations doing cyber

425
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:07,959
operations there alone can be a very

426
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,700
scary thing it's something that everyone

427
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:11,410
should take some seriously he's using

428
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,690
take seriously if you ever considered it

429
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:16,899
because there's real-life consequences

430
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:20,079
to it the gesture really good guy lives

431
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:23,110
in fear he understands that people want

432
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:25,510
to kill him so even though he does great

433
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:27,430
things in my mind and he is pro-military

434
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,720
and sportswomen Warrior Project and and

435
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:30,519
I like what he does

436
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,529
I still empathize with the fact that as

437
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:34,779
a cyber operator acting outside of the

438
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:37,089
military there's real consequences and

439
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:39,910
sometimes you can have consequences of

440
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:42,220
messing up an operation if the US

441
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:44,339
military is currently monitoring forums

442
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:46,690
and they're getting real intelligence

443
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:47,950
capabilities out of that and someone

444
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:49,480
goes in and takes down the forum

445
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:52,810
thinking they're done a good job well

446
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:55,120
now they just ruin an operation so again

447
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:57,849
I like this guy I think he or gal I met

448
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,100
him or her but I like the person but

449
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:02,649
again there's an understanding that

450
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,570
everyone can be an operator how you do

451
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:05,709
it have to be well defined and have to

452
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,270
figure out as a domain how we're gonna

453
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:09,790
handle these type of things how we're

454
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:11,560
gonna handle cyber militias but there's

455
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:14,349
also this group of intellectual people

456
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,819
like this operation ona it's this group

457
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:17,560
that got together of individuals that

458
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,600
said hey we're forensics responders

459
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,790
we're incident guys or malware reverse

460
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,560
engineers let's create an email distro

461
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,579
and talk about signatures and malware

462
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,380
and everything that's out there right

463
00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:27,819
now and the advanced threat and talk

464
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,769
about how you counter them at your

465
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,060
security location and how we can apply

466
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:33,339
it other ways there's all this

467
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:35,560
information sharing and incredibly smart

468
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:37,720
people going on in the world in the

469
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,369
domain and it's out there everyone wants

470
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,790
to play a part no one really wants

471
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:43,530
skills and divers to sit back and not be

472
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,550
part of the domain so again this is

473
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,930
something in the interim years that we

474
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:47,640
have to be ready for we have to

475
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:50,670
capitalize on we're gonna figure out how

476
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:53,280
we're gonna use it productively so civil

477
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:55,800
sharing this is where I think that we

478
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,300
really get the bang for our buck you get

479
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,069
the varied expertise like I was talking

480
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,469
about the operation ona you get threat

481
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:04,830
intelligence sharing that's awesome

482
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:07,620
that's how you do cyber defense writing

483
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:09,450
a signature as it is a reactive thing to

484
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,550
a cyberattack but understanding or have

485
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:15,270
a theory having real actionable threat

486
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:16,349
intelligence on intrusion sets and the

487
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:19,740
type of capabilities they might use

488
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:23,760
allows you to create proactive defense

489
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:26,820
against those attacks AV scanners just

490
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:28,230
simply don't prevent the advance the

491
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,300
rest I don't want the term apt but they

492
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:32,160
don't prevent the advanced threat but we

493
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,229
also get the development times we do

494
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,660
patches right so we've heard talk

495
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:38,190
yesterday it's great to see patches that

496
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,870
get developers near days in a month or

497
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:42,000
two that's actually pretty fast and it's

498
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:44,520
pretty sharp B that's that month or two

499
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,230
that people are vulnerable to that and

500
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,220
really it's probably that year or two

501
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,870
that people are vulnerable is that

502
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,270
before that vulnerability was disclosed

503
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:53,520
so we need to reduce those development

504
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:55,470
times by doing threat intelligence and

505
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,420
sharing and getting out there as a

506
00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:00,060
community better and more than that

507
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:02,189
education and innovation solutions when

508
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,859
we have again schools that are teaching

509
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:06,720
cyber and have real cyber educators and

510
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:09,209
real availability in terms of

511
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,650
conferences and and cheap solutions

512
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,970
you're gonna have people thinking

513
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:14,040
outside the box and you're gonna have

514
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:14,870
people getting to defense and doing it

515
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,869
correctly

516
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:20,159
so the serious in the future so this is

517
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:22,619
a pretty powerful statement here I'll

518
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,390
have a secretary panetta talking about

519
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:25,949
the fact that there's a true cyber

520
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:27,990
capabilities threat of bringing down

521
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:30,030
power grid everyone's heard of this and

522
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:32,180
there's a lot of fun out there cyber war

523
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:35,850
and all of this but at the end the day

524
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:37,800
some aspects of it are real cyber war it

525
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:39,689
of itself I don't like that term because

526
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,340
you don't have just cyber war you'll

527
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,630
never have just air war you'll never

528
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,610
have

529
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:45,710
just land war you will have war and

530
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:47,629
you'll have aspects of that from every

531
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:49,460
single domain you don't just have cyber

532
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:51,680
war we have cyber conflict in

533
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:54,350
cyberattacks which is what I believe

534
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:56,000
he's talking about here and those are

535
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,350
still very serious threat so when get

536
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,210
past the flood there still is a very

537
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:00,649
serious threat that has to consider we

538
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:02,840
talked about turning off the light

539
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:04,820
talking about generators and turbines

540
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:08,030
that are custom made and they take four

541
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:09,740
months to replace you take down the

542
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:11,330
power in Seattle and you can't get it

543
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:14,540
back for four months life is going to

544
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:16,820
change a little bit but then you have a

545
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:18,080
nation-state weapons so nation state

546
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,300
weapons in general are not single

547
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,280
purpose anymore as a military we don't

548
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:24,500
go out and say hey let's create a

549
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,570
Tactical Fighter that's only good

550
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,430
against one other fighters it's not very

551
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:30,470
efficient we have to plan out we have to

552
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:32,630
have approval process of an acquisition

553
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:34,040
phases we have to look at multiple types

554
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:37,430
of payloads that we can put onto the

555
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:39,590
platform to say hey this UAV can do or

556
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:41,120
for the people unmanned aerial vehicle

557
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:43,100
this unmanned aerial vehicle like a

558
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,840
predator can do this mission but if we

559
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,760
stick to this pod on it now if we do

560
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,320
something else you have an f-35 we say

561
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,600
hey this missile is good against air

562
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,460
targets but this bomb is good against

563
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,260
ground targets well I think that's what

564
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,030
we're coming with cyber you have to have

565
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:59,210
platforms from an offensive standpoint

566
00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:01,580
that are able to adapt to changing

567
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:03,500
threats and changing landscapes you

568
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,939
don't have static targets you have to be

569
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,770
able to adapt on the fly especially

570
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:10,220
having a lot of unknowns there's a lot

571
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:12,160
of the true buck is from intelligence

572
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,750
and a lot of times intelligence is wrong

573
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,770
so we actually feed it with what happens

574
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,260
ducks I do too

575
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:20,600
so we're stuck second Dooku and this is

576
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,830
just my own graphical understanding of

577
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,600
it do you have the different modules

578
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,580
inside stocks that inducers of the two

579
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,350
very similar threats made by the same

580
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:29,540
nation-state made likely by the same

581
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:31,310
group inside the nation-state but they

582
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:33,170
share that common driver they share

583
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:34,370
programming to share source code there's

584
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:36,590
a lot of modules that are staying

585
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:39,469
between the two but you have two very

586
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:41,360
different weapon you have do - which is

587
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:43,220
not so much a weapon it's information

588
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,870
stealing Trojan it was able to get in

589
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,120
and feel large enough information from

590
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:48,830
various companies and laboratories and

591
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,239
elsewhere in the world and it sucks net

592
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,169
which everyone knows destroyed the

593
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,720
centrifuges

594
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:56,060
actually ones and zeroes physical

595
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,470
degradation on systems blowing out of

596
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,120
their shells and casings very

597
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:02,270
interesting very cool and scary at the

598
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,159
same time but again one common driver so

599
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:06,110
you're looking at this same aspect of

600
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,000
nation-state weaponry right here you're

601
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:09,919
looking at a weapon how to go through an

602
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,570
acquisition phase it had to go through

603
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,640
approve processes

604
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:15,139
regardless shows us Russia China does

605
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,960
not matter every country has very

606
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:20,630
similar approaches to procuring weaponry

607
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,950
so you have a common platform you have

608
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:24,440
something that they're looking like an

609
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:26,120
f-35 for instance that's very advanced

610
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,100
but that's harder to defend against to

611
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,360
me for security people now you can't

612
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,409
just write a signature for this because

613
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,030
they'll change this you module with it

614
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:33,470
something else again getting back to the

615
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,080
education and intelligence sharing

616
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:37,430
there's really counter these threats

617
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,740
you've got powerful statements again for

618
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:41,300
the interim year sort of feel you have

619
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,860
general norton school norton sports

620
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,480
while he was the chief of staff he came

621
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:47,090
out and says the Air Force is pursuing

622
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,070
cyber methods to defeat aircraft pretty

623
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:53,080
crazy ones and zeros dropping that

624
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:55,669
sixteen or the enemies counter for that

625
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,860
out of the sky claims dropping out of

626
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:59,570
the sky for with cyber messes now the

627
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,889
cyber guy I love that that's cool that's

628
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:02,689
awesome right we have all we want to be

629
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:04,640
all excusing all want to be operators in

630
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:06,530
cowboy and all that great stuff but it's

631
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,030
also really scary you start talking

632
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:10,520
about being able to plug into USB than

633
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:12,560
an airplane and you have access you have

634
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:15,200
air gapped right something like that

635
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:19,370
between the pilots cockpit and the rest

636
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:23,450
of the passengers works super well for

637
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:26,120
everybody yeah it's it's this real

638
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:28,940
aspect of carry carry capabilities out

639
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,080
in the world but again you see the

640
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,640
Russians and Chinese have designed

641
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,970
specific electronic work our platforms

642
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,230
to go after all our high-value assets we

643
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:38,210
have a lot of high-value assets or the

644
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:40,790
military that are pretty miffy and we

645
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:42,590
don't want them being countered that's

646
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:44,629
the deputy second Deputy Secretary of

647
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:46,370
Defense Ashton Carter we've got people

648
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,780
like the chief of staff and the

649
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:49,550
Secretary of Defense and the deputy

650
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,410
secretary coming out and making these

651
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:53,030
statements they're not doing it selling

652
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,800
products they're not doing this budget

653
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:56,780
game yeah there's a whole aspect of

654
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:59,000
Congress and funding these guys put

655
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:00,649
their name on the line to represent the

656
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,130
domain to talk about real things that

657
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:03,590
are going

658
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,760
they're not just making things up so now

659
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:06,800
you've gotta wonder about these cyber

660
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:09,590
capabilities again how do security

661
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:11,270
professionals counter against them we

662
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:13,760
start looking at the aspects of cyber

663
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:16,550
espionage again with information

664
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,260
stealing from certificate authorities

665
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:20,120
and destro control systems and

666
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:22,070
laboratories where no information is

667
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:25,159
really secure how do you counter that

668
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:26,629
what you do with that sort of having the

669
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,070
aspect of cyberattacks to look at

670
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:30,830
satellite communication networks and

671
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:32,360
data systems and and Internet nodes we

672
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,980
all take advantage of how the Internet

673
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,570
is formed and what it looks like but

674
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:38,360
it's not that secure and it's not that

675
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:39,590
uh difficult to mess with and these are

676
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,510
things that we take for granted and that

677
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:43,610
we want to pretend that are safe we want

678
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:45,350
to pretend that we have privacy and the

679
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:46,750
privacy and safety religious perception

680
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:48,590
and how we move forward and how we

681
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:51,290
understand how we're going to defend it

682
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:52,429
that's important but then you have

683
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:54,080
military conflicts as I was talking

684
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:56,000
about earlier it's not cyber war right

685
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,439
you have conflict we start looking at

686
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,570
military conflict you start thinking

687
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,330
about the field good defenses coastal

688
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:04,310
defenses make a population feel good

689
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:06,080
mobile command control and attack and

690
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:09,139
defense aircraft and make a population

691
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:11,810
feel good in general if 9/11 you know

692
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:13,610
9/11 happened f-16 is where the sky and

693
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:15,230
patrolled around in case Russians

694
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:17,689
whoever I mean early on no one really

695
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:19,160
knew what was going on there feel good

696
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:21,190
defense they're there to protect the

697
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,600
population missile and radar systems

698
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:25,310
those are very important to a population

699
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,379
but again you start talking about being

700
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:29,419
able to out reach and touch anybody at

701
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:31,250
any location and you talk about cyber

702
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:32,990
capabilities to take down these defenses

703
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,880
well that's something different than

704
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:37,820
security that's very serious threat

705
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,040
that's not a hey my security company is

706
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:41,720
making quarterly profits that people are

707
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,820
dying I think that's something that we

708
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,740
don't generally grasp that well I think

709
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:47,330
a lot of these discussions can be one of

710
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,820
the same but we just don't tackle these

711
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:51,860
issues you all have to be professionals

712
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,970
and researchers and educators and

713
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:55,729
whatever it is that you do in your

714
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:56,780
aspect every one of you play a part in

715
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:58,640
this domain and every

716
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:00,620
one of you responsible in some aspect

717
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,820
for your own skills and what you do in

718
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:06,889
your job and so some of the reasons I

719
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,360
come out here is almost a plea everyone

720
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:10,490
to take things a little more seriously

721
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,649
does an air force officer I have guys

722
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:14,270
and gals that I leave people that are

723
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:16,730
very important people that I care about

724
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:18,680
and I don't like to think of them dying

725
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:21,050
to the cyber capabilities I want to

726
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:24,680
think of people losing and conflict and

727
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:26,000
truly people dying when there's educated

728
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,190
and smart people that can tackle these

729
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,870
issues whether you like the military or

730
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:31,640
not is not a big thing whether you trust

731
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,810
the government or not is other thing I'm

732
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,340
not off the platform trust the

733
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:38,149
government I would never go out there

734
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:39,260
and say that but I still think it's

735
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:40,520
something that we all play a role in

736
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:43,310
it's very important that we all take

737
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:46,010
part and have that combined attitude

738
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:47,450
towards it so inclusion I really want to

739
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:48,830
just focus on the fact that education is

740
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:51,230
what I consider to eat all of it

741
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:52,790
we have to have true education from an

742
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:54,080
early standpoint we have to have

743
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:57,080
opportunities for the young generation

744
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,580
to take advantage of if I did not go in

745
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,399
the military I would have nothing to do

746
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:02,870
with fiber I can't afford $4,000 classes

747
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,820
and fans as great as they are and as

748
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:07,399
much as I love them I cannot afford

749
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,820
3,000 law conferences it's not gonna

750
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,900
happen

751
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,220
I'm originally from Alabama and

752
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:12,350
currently live in Germany though it's

753
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:14,870
very sweet deal for me but I would never

754
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:16,520
even touch this domain however you all

755
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:19,370
got involved with a black hat hacking

756
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:22,070
what hacking early on falling into it

757
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:23,360
doing consulting work whatever it is you

758
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:26,480
got here and you're able to participate

759
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,189
most likely chose your job we need to

760
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,260
push this out we need to push education

761
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:32,120
and conferences and aspects for the main

762
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,500
for everybody we need to be able to have

763
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:36,590
those kids that look at the capabilities

764
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:38,540
and go man I want to fly fightin man or

765
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:39,709
whatever the key term of the day is I

766
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,970
wanna be able to go out and I want to

767
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:42,560
get a pardon that I want to develop a

768
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:45,020
solution that are really protecting my

769
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:47,899
country or or whatever it is that's very

770
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:49,730
important and on the other side is also

771
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,530
an aspect to deterrent women have an

772
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:52,910
educated population when you have

773
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:54,680
capabilities that are being displayed

774
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:57,950
now you've got other nations looking

775
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:59,540
going man they're pretty sharp you may

776
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:02,210
not wanna mess with them a cyber is that

777
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:04,250
real deterrence aspect

778
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:06,560
me security and privacy is another big

779
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:10,100
thing that I always step on our stomp on

780
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:11,629
I I really feel that security and

781
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,010
privacy can go on Hannah Hannah I'm that

782
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:15,530
optimistic person that believes that

783
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:18,230
privacy can happen I don't think that we

784
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:20,420
as population you as civilians most of

785
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:22,640
you should ever think that giving a

786
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:25,400
privacy of a good idea in terms of fiber

787
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,530
you have to demand more you have to say

788
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,100
I want privacy and security and it's

789
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:30,110
doable

790
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,250
and it's doable through education and

791
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:33,560
share information sharing and

792
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:35,810
intelligence this is something that we

793
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,220
all can take part in we have to apply

794
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:38,870
lessons learn not only from air power

795
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,880
from the other domains we have to take

796
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:42,590
lessons learn from the cafe or semantic

797
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,510
or Adobe and things that they do and

798
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:46,550
apply them to everything that we do you

799
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:49,220
have to understand that the adversary

800
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:50,899
they're not sitting by thinking man I

801
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:52,310
wonder what new threats I can take

802
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,630
advantage of they're out there in forum

803
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,940
sharing information they're out there

804
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:56,960
understanding the landscape of what

805
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,070
they're gonna attack the Jui

806
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,530
intelligence gathering and then they

807
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:03,080
attack we need to operate in a similar

808
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:04,910
manner and then we must work together

809
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,949
government civilian hackers whatever it

810
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:09,050
may be we all have skills and I want to

811
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:11,060
just butt stomp that again we all have

812
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:12,530
skills and we should really start

813
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,490
working together a little better I know

814
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,260
this is sort of like an optimistic

815
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:18,230
speech you know holding hands privacy

816
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:19,520
and and defence it sounds great but I

817
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:21,860
truly believe in it or wouldn't come any

818
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,810
kind of comical speech I truly believe

819
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:25,250
that we can make the domain a more

820
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:26,690
secure place by all truly working

821
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:28,790
together and pushing education and

822
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:30,650
general I think that's pushing the

823
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:33,399
domain and in a darker direction is not

824
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:37,310
the correct way we start talking about

825
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:40,310
an IAE of cyber links are talking about

826
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:41,870
regulating cyber weapons and and saying

827
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:44,330
yes only this country can have them or

828
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:45,889
that country can't I think that pushes

829
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:47,480
the domain in a wrong way because those

830
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:50,390
capabilities always be there anytime

831
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,770
that you have hacker kids or whoever

832
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:53,810
they have a computer they're gonna come

833
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:55,310
up with capabilities so instead of just

834
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:56,899
trying to pretend that it doesn't exist

835
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:58,760
and not talking about it we should be

836
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,140
out there beauty professionals and the

837
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,720
military and the government talking

838
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:04,730
about what's available and bring it into

839
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,900
the light and discussing openly how are

840
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:07,540
we going to fix these issues that we

841
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:10,420
have

842
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:11,260
so I would kind of kept this short

843
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,940
because I figured this would be it's

844
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:15,640
more of an interactive kind of

845
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:18,010
discussion any of you have questions or

846
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,840
comments about cyber in terms of the

847
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:26,040
domain or the interim years or religious

848
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:26,040
air force and government in general yeah

849
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,120
right

850
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:52,639
yeah so I mean that's a really good

851
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:54,980
point I feel that it's always gonna be

852
00:29:52,639 --> 00:29:56,149
so that dual had it approach and some

853
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,679
extent we have to accept that but we

854
00:29:56,149 --> 00:29:59,209
have to structure ourselves and inject

855
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,760
ourselves properly to tackle that issue

856
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:04,429
when you have the military or the

857
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,350
military's purpose is National Defense

858
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:08,659
national security so we have to wage

859
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:11,059
offensive capabilities so you look and

860
00:30:08,659 --> 00:30:12,260
if Stuxnet was us and obviously there

861
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,668
was intelligent people smarter than I'm

862
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:15,320
sitting around the room figuring out one

863
00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:17,179
how do you do this in two why do we need

864
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,220
to do this I guarantee a lot of people

865
00:30:17,179 --> 00:30:21,889
winning that discussion no one wakes up

866
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:23,360
the morning goes huh how do we screw

867
00:30:21,889 --> 00:30:25,428
things up today like it just doesn't

868
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,139
happen people generally have ideas and

869
00:30:25,429 --> 00:30:28,309
they want to take them forward so we

870
00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:30,229
start looking at those capabilities

871
00:30:28,309 --> 00:30:31,549
making statements they will always make

872
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:34,279
statements on behalf the military they

873
00:30:31,549 --> 00:30:36,460
always make those statements about often

874
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:38,899
but to your point there are a lot of

875
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:40,850
resources like this we have to take

876
00:30:38,899 --> 00:30:43,820
advantage of in terms of defensive

877
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:45,649
standards it's not just with government

878
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:47,210
programs again it's with everybody a lot

879
00:30:45,649 --> 00:30:49,340
of the programming I picked up with the

880
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:51,710
open courseware MIT does classes for

881
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:53,570
free online code Academy or in YouTube

882
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:54,830
videos any tool you ever wanted to think

883
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:56,480
about using you can do that YouTube

884
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:58,279
video on it you can watch it and learn

885
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,809
it a lot of that information is not out

886
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:04,279
there but you can learn things for free

887
00:31:01,809 --> 00:31:06,230
and I think that we really again all

888
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:08,179
have to pitch in what saying hey I may

889
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:10,010
not like this government organization

890
00:31:08,179 --> 00:31:11,000
but you know what I've got an idea about

891
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:13,309
how they can do it better

892
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,929
I guess I'll contribute that's one thing

893
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:17,330
I usually tell people if you hate the

894
00:31:14,929 --> 00:31:18,950
government then jump on board and try to

895
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:21,110
change it you know try to do something

896
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:22,940
you can't sit there and criticize and

897
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:25,279
not have a solution I mean that's the

898
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:27,110
most anti productive thing possible just

899
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:30,049
that you suck I don't know why I'm being

900
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:31,969
sucked it's not a good approach so we

901
00:31:30,049 --> 00:31:33,019
look at these organizations again

902
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:35,029
they're putting all these documents and

903
00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:37,760
security and putting out understandings

904
00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:39,230
of here's how you can do security I feel

905
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,879
that it's very important for everyone to

906
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,620
take part look at those documents but to

907
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,419
teach them to say hey you're you're

908
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,768
pretty good on most of this but here's

909
00:31:44,419 --> 00:31:48,230
how I would do this differently and this

910
00:31:45,769 --> 00:31:49,970
is why it's important again sort of that

911
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:51,950
huggy feely all of us can do this

912
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:54,370
together a kind of aspect but to an

913
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:57,680
extent we have to I can tell you that

914
00:31:54,370 --> 00:32:00,199
not in my government role but just in

915
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:02,180
theorizing how I would attack say a

916
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,680
SCADA plan I would go up the low-hanging

917
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:05,240
fruit and I would do information or in

918
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,700
constant I would say hey I want to get

919
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,320
in this local power plant that's not

920
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:11,030
that well secured it may not have a lot

921
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,500
of access to stuff but it has documents

922
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,970
a schematic that has information and I

923
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,230
can gather I would do information

924
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:16,490
gathering and get ready front of that

925
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:18,500
and then I would do it against the

926
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:20,090
larger target there's no reason that we

927
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,230
aren't tackling that low-hanging fruit -

928
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:23,540
there's no reason that we're not going

929
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:25,160
around saying hey all right well this

930
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:27,409
company has a lot of access to my data

931
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:29,510
or this Power Company has accessed the

932
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:31,550
internet and has access to electricity

933
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:33,470
around the area how do I make it better

934
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:35,419
how do I contribute everything doesn't

935
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:37,460
have to be done for dollars and cents it

936
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,900
can be done for the aspect of getting

937
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:43,540
things done and actually subscribing the

938
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:43,540
domain any more questions yes

939
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:24,049
I absolutely agree I think that really

940
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:25,910
is where it comes down to your sphere of

941
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:27,320
influence I think you have to get out

942
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:28,970
and wherever it is that your sphere of

943
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,350
influence is and make it better

944
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:31,910
and if you can't get that General

945
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:33,260
Council that's fine educate and mentor

946
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:35,419
the people below you and around you

947
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:36,980
again with my foot for education that's

948
00:33:35,419 --> 00:33:38,809
something that's incredibly important is

949
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:42,110
making your sphere better and it will

950
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:43,639
ripple out in terms of sharing I'm going

951
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:45,709
to quote from Jurassic Park which is

952
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,250
whatever but when it says you know like

953
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,110
we'll find a way

954
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:50,600
well information sharing will find a way

955
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:51,409
if you're an advocate about it you say

956
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,178
now I really want to get this

957
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:55,400
information out there it's not illegal

958
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:56,720
to do so you will find threat emailing

959
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,549
list and people that are intelligent

960
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,440
personnel that are sharing and

961
00:33:58,549 --> 00:34:01,789
understanding these ideas and that

962
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,130
general council person whoever it is

963
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:06,110
that above hopefully they either get on

964
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:07,730
board or get out of the way and if it

965
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,839
doesn't happen with Wall Street

966
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:10,699
specimens you know it doesn't

967
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:13,250
necessarily happen sometimes the best

968
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:15,049
guy and gal don't get picked the job you

969
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:18,040
still have to find a way to influence

970
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:18,040
your spirit and make it better

971
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:02,090
so I would comment with that back to my

972
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:04,080
earlier point about security and privacy

973
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:06,780
exactly what's talking about you have to

974
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:08,790
demand both you can't demand one can't

975
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:11,730
say you know what here's all the access

976
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:13,680
of my networks and I guess I'll be

977
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:15,390
secure now you can't do that it's not a

978
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,950
win-win solution but the same time you

979
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:19,529
can't sit there and go well unless I get

980
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:20,368
100 in my way I'm not budging so that

981
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:22,170
doesn't work from the government

982
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:23,430
standpoint either whether it's the

983
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:29,430
threat company or the government coming

984
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:32,250
in there has to be a compromise Yeah

985
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:34,470
right you know I actually find though

986
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:36,510
again that a lot of these people that we

987
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:37,529
sort of feel cynical about again don't

988
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,880
come in and say I want to screw

989
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:40,920
everything up today I want to be a jerk

990
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,990
it just doesn't happen everyone wants to

991
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,070
influence their sphere to some level but

992
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:45,930
I think a lot of people just aren't

993
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:47,940
informed I think a lot of we talk about

994
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:49,259
congressman generals whoever a lot of

995
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,520
people get bad information they have

996
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,200
people on their staff that probably

997
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,940
shouldn't be on the staff that feed them

998
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,799
information that makes them look bad or

999
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:57,330
make them choose wrong decisions but

1000
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,890
again that's where you all think

1001
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:00,779
security mind people understanding

1002
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:02,450
learning pushing think to yourselves

1003
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:05,160
about how your servant wants me better

1004
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:05,819
get getting involved makes a big

1005
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,700
difference

1006
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:10,470
and I think that really once we start

1007
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,060
pushing on education and tactics and

1008
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:13,439
doctor and all this up it may be not all

1009
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:15,090
that exciting is the ones on zero than

1010
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,770
zero days that people come up with but

1011
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,790
still very important aspects I think

1012
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:19,730
we're going to see ripple effects in the

1013
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:22,619
domain on how insecurity is really done

1014
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:26,790
we have those educated people I can

1015
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:28,650
point the various colleges and high

1016
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:30,210
schools around the globe that are trying

1017
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:32,240
to do security and trying to talk about

1018
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:35,340
cyber and they're just doing it poorly

1019
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,049
with the trying so get involved and help

1020
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:38,940
there's universities that I go to and I

1021
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:41,010
give them information I just go out and

1022
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,960
I guess lecture or I try to help them

1023
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:45,030
out to try to guide because that's my

1024
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,990
small sphere of influence and any way

1025
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:48,090
that's ever worked with me knows that

1026
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:49,919
I'm not that intelligent other person so

1027
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:52,320
you all being intelligent can do a whole

1028
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,780
heck of a lot more get involved go out

1029
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,640
and make your sphere better and I know

1030
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,960
that it's a very pious approach but I

1031
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,609
really think that's the only approach we

1032
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:02,190
have going for us for the long term win

1033
00:36:59,609 --> 00:37:03,049
signature-based defense and and trying

1034
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:05,820
to do

1035
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:07,780
BYOD defense or whatever for today of

1036
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:09,130
not going to fix the issues we're

1037
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:11,680
in a we getting hit with you have to

1038
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:13,780
look at a long-term approach any more

1039
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:22,980
questions we got plenty time discussion

1040
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:22,980
one yeah right

1041
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:28,480
yeah so so it's controversial for a

1042
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:30,310
number of reasons one money when you

1043
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,650
talk about the government budget you

1044
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:34,240
look at the DoD's budget and then you

1045
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:36,430
say hey everyone split off a portion

1046
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,540
that budget can build a fiber course you

1047
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,500
have generals and congressmen and

1048
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:41,020
everyone else there aren't forecasters

1049
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:43,330
back when you look at what it took to

1050
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:45,130
get in Air Force it was the interim

1051
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:46,750
years on the verge of World War two and

1052
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:50,170
you're looking at you think after War

1053
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:51,850
two we were looking at losses and

1054
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:53,590
lessons learned and going man we got our

1055
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:55,390
tails kicked in some aspect because we

1056
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:58,600
were bickering and fighting they look at

1057
00:37:55,390 --> 00:38:01,150
the Navy building aircraft for ground

1058
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,440
defense and army building aircraft for

1059
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:04,030
coastal defense they were stepping all

1060
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,860
these others lines and finally Congress

1061
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:08,350
had a Stephanie so you know what we'll

1062
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:13,090
do an Air Force it takes a lot to get

1063
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:15,009
past that and I think currently we don't

1064
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:16,500
need a cyber force I think we need a

1065
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:18,310
vector approach in the Air Force

1066
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,170
something that is probably not that

1067
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:21,790
popular to me to speak on but that I

1068
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:24,220
feel pretty passionately about if we

1069
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:27,580
currently have 17 Delta cyberspace

1070
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:29,080
officer but I can go do routers and

1071
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:31,650
switches and network connectivity with

1072
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:33,279
cat5 or I can do cyber operations for

1073
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:36,190
agencies and stuff

1074
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,619
that's how varied the career field is so

1075
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:40,900
now I might get trained up with taxpayer

1076
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:43,420
money to do a cyber operation and the

1077
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:45,760
cyber mission large investments and tax

1078
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:47,140
payers and then turn right around and do

1079
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,450
something that has no effect on what I

1080
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:51,190
do and my training for a state now I

1081
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:52,180
understand that there's aspects of that

1082
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,950
was very intelligent and good

1083
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:55,629
conversation on why we should or should

1084
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:57,009
not have it that way I feel it's the

1085
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:58,390
wrong approach other intelligent people

1086
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:00,280
probably so it's right approach well you

1087
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:03,009
can bring your defensive solutions to

1088
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:04,359
monitoring the routers that we gave all

1089
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:06,220
the access to someone else instead of

1090
00:39:04,359 --> 00:39:07,690
ourselves like it just doesn't work in

1091
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,100
my mind so I feel that there's things

1092
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:10,840
that we can do before getting to the

1093
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,430
point of meeting a cyber force we may

1094
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:14,020
need the cyber force one day we may have

1095
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:15,399
to do something could be a civilian

1096
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:17,080
solution there's been good success in

1097
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:20,290
tears conference even on how you would

1098
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:21,609
have a almost DHS role of having a cyber

1099
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:24,160
force but actually people that

1100
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:27,940
understand it and do it well and not

1101
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,290
saying the DHS doesn't but I don't think

1102
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,760
we're that point yet I think there's a

1103
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:32,440
lot of stuff that we can do and do

1104
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,420
better again with education and

1105
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,370
vectoring our own approach and our own

1106
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:45,050
doctrine and tactic

1107
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:45,049
before getting to that page yeah right

1108
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,319
right

1109
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,400
mm-hmm so it agree it's very tempting

1110
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:08,740
the whole black hat side of things the

1111
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,599
information as a person that can figure

1112
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:12,359
out how to you know strip passwords and

1113
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:15,790
documents whatever it's very tempting to

1114
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:18,848
pirate you know classes that I want to

1115
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:19,960
take I don't come moral decisions of

1116
00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:22,750
course I would say that's an answer any

1117
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,920
ways that I really don't but it's very

1118
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:25,060
tempting for people especially people

1119
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,640
have a little bit of understanding about

1120
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:30,160
how to do it I don't have to keep that

1121
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:31,930
obviously but to your point you have to

1122
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,190
make sure that we allow education to be

1123
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:35,169
available to going back to you

1124
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:37,060
conference ideas imagine a conference

1125
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:38,740
where you would have three entry and you

1126
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:40,359
would have all sorts of displays and

1127
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,259
people could be recruiting as well so it

1128
00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:43,990
could be sponsored made by those

1129
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:45,849
personnel you have kids of all ages and

1130
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:50,279
adults and whoever coming in and looking

1131
00:41:45,849 --> 00:41:52,480
at real cyber stuff not talks like this

1132
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:54,010
so a lot of stuff like that but now

1133
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,510
think about things that are sponsored

1134
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:56,950
and helped by the government start

1135
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:58,690
thinking about the government coming out

1136
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:59,890
and saying hey here's a cyber capability

1137
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:01,990
that we haven't weaponized and then

1138
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:03,759
we're not gonna use but look at it play

1139
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:05,439
around with it you have a guy in uniform

1140
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,940
talking to kids and showing them on a

1141
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,890
laptop how to do something pretty neat

1142
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:16,589
like that'd be a powerful statement I

1143
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:16,589
yeah so he's sort of a DEFCON and pretty

1144
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:23,089
exactly so right

1145
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:54,320
I agree I mean look at so again somebody

1146
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:56,030
that really liked giant long talking

1147
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,620
about how he went out and said you know

1148
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:59,330
my sphere of influence is X and I'm

1149
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:00,620
going to take it and push it to Y I want

1150
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:02,259
to go out after and do some good work

1151
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:04,759
and and help people get some education

1152
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:06,740
that was a sphere of influence and it's

1153
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,060
doing really great work again you all

1154
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,439
are incredibly intelligent people you

1155
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:11,779
have skills you have things that you

1156
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,550
give back volunteers sometimes go to

1157
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:16,550
local high school and keeps me program I

1158
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:17,750
find it very rare even for myself for a

1159
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:20,120
personnel to say no we don't want your

1160
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:21,830
help there's not been a university yet

1161
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:23,060
that I've said hey I can come in and

1162
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:25,910
help you on your favorite program that

1163
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:27,860
has turned me away now granted like it

1164
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:30,319
or not being an Air Force officer

1165
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:32,450
carries a little bit more weight than if

1166
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:34,130
I was just you know some normal guy but

1167
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:35,899
the same time you all have skills and

1168
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:37,460
tactics things and professional

1169
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:39,560
certifications or whatever it is that

1170
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:42,200
makes you more professional and even a

1171
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:43,970
military officer so go out and influence

1172
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,620
riskier I don't think that we're going

1173
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:47,209
to fix to the main by having a

1174
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:48,980
conference and don't think that this you

1175
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:51,200
know slideshow Star Wars everything else

1176
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:52,820
is really gonna fix the domain but it's

1177
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,529
what I see is my sphere of influence if

1178
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:56,780
I'm trying to do something about it I

1179
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:58,490
would challenge you all to go do the

1180
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:00,080
same thing give back to your local high

1181
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:02,720
school give back to local university

1182
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:04,580
close that gap make somebody better and

1183
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,259
it will ripple out and people will do

1184
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:08,200
the same thing and eventually you'll

1185
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:09,860
have a real impact off of a good

1186
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,750
humanitarian kind of work that you're

1187
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:14,000
doing and I think that there's nothing

1188
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:16,310
more fulfilling than realizing hey I'm

1189
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,080
making a difference so yeah help out the

1190
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:20,180
programs help out the schools make those

1191
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,590
curriculum I'm working right now with

1192
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:23,960
the university to develop their

1193
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:25,430
cybersecurity tracks instead of showing

1194
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,900
people hey we can do attribution through

1195
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:30,169
traceroute which is why I left one of

1196
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:32,060
the universities you can do realize

1197
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:34,190
abusin and talk about real cybersecurity

1198
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:35,930
aspects and a curriculum program and

1199
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:37,610
educate people I think that's what we

1200
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:42,759
really really have to do the long term

1201
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:45,760
any other questions yeah

1202
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,760
either

1203
00:45:04,859 --> 00:45:08,239
yeah yep there it

1204
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:48,850
mm-hmm right

1205
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:10,950
so in terms of the high-level stuff in

1206
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,089
terms like Congress and what do you be

1207
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:13,950
down there obviously the certain

1208
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:15,840
legislation has to happen we have to

1209
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:17,189
find terms we have to pick up what it is

1210
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,540
we're gonna call us our weapons load is

1211
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:19,830
we're gonna call actionable threat

1212
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:25,529
intelligence and how you're gonna share

1213
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:28,290
it it has to be done the term cyber I

1214
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:30,950
love to turn fiber so obviously I like

1215
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:33,480
the term cyber being a favor officer but

1216
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:36,930
no but we should kill some other words

1217
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:38,520
and like several war anyways back to

1218
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:40,890
your point though I feel that there's

1219
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,390
really a way for us to do it when it

1220
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:44,009
comes with legislation it has to come

1221
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:46,080
from that area but again talking about

1222
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:47,670
sphere of influence of times tie it back

1223
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,170
those people are only good at the

1224
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:50,700
information I get their intelligence

1225
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:52,109
evil they've deserve to get in the

1226
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:54,240
position maybe maybe not it doesn't

1227
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:55,650
matter they're there how you influence

1228
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,470
how you share that information how you

1229
00:46:55,650 --> 00:47:01,400
try to make them a better product is

1230
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:01,399
really what it comes down to

1231
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,539
[Music]

1232
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:22,480
I agree and and I think that hits on

1233
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:25,029
some points made about the cyber force

1234
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:28,360
like is the military the right role for

1235
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:30,220
this whole cyber aspect is it against

1236
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:31,210
our nature you go out and do some of the

1237
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,770
things that are required

1238
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:34,810
you know what lines across and when now

1239
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:36,100
it's inside our borders you know what

1240
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:38,110
about outside borders you know all those

1241
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:39,400
different aspects and I think again

1242
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:40,420
talking back to Protectorate approach

1243
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,010
that's something that we really have to

1244
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:43,900
take a proper look that are we the right

1245
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:47,050
people and if we are let's figure it out

1246
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:49,540
and it's not get out of the way but I

1247
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:52,060
really I really truly believe that in

1248
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:54,520
the day if we take that vectors approach

1249
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:55,990
and we start pushing through those walls

1250
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:58,180
that's we're gonna win so the agencies

1251
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:59,020
that don't like to communicate or people

1252
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:01,629
that don't want to share information

1253
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:03,310
usually you'll find people in the middle

1254
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:04,870
range or maybe a little bit high range

1255
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:07,299
that push them back because they don't

1256
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:09,759
understand things it has to be that your

1257
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:11,980
generation educating and pushing out and

1258
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,090
then I say new generation include

1259
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:15,340
everyone is from the confines

1260
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:17,470
20-something years old just our

1261
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:19,090
generation of people to in cyber have to

1262
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:20,259
push through those borders and say no we

1263
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:21,760
are going to share we're gonna create

1264
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:23,560
this network this is how it happens and

1265
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,630
I think there's an over classification

1266
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:28,029
of data we start looking at actual

1267
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:29,680
threat intelligence I was fortunate to

1268
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:32,620
get a chance to talk to general Lord who

1269
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:37,810
is Air Forces leads I ever got charged

1270
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:39,250
all the sever aspects and he he agreed

1271
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:40,720
that there's an over classification of

1272
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:42,580
data so don't you think that it's a

1273
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,600
little odd that some things at TS and

1274
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:46,360
some things are at Sand

1275
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:50,170
something's unclassified and there's no

1276
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:51,580
real measuring stick on why that's BS or

1277
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:52,960
not secret

1278
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:54,310
some people claim there is and he's a

1279
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,960
little reports and yeah that's how we

1280
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:57,880
classify things with a lot of things are

1281
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,140
over classified we go oh that's shining

1282
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,850
BAM classified

1283
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:03,009
that's not preparing to approach the

1284
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:04,750
sharing because now I can't give serve

1285
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:09,180
all my security at PS no foreign

1286
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:09,180
documents that does XYZ

1287
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:32,870
right

1288
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:32,870
absolutely and that's yeah

1289
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:45,650
absolutely

1290
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:10,030
yeah so there go ahead and

1291
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:39,049
well we are out of time so I just want

1292
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:41,060
to go ahead and close it out and say

1293
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:43,010
first of all I think it's coming in

1294
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:45,049
second of all if you could take anything

1295
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:46,580
away from it please know that this is

1296
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:47,930
where I can so the interviewer has to

1297
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:49,640
happen now defense was not going to get

1298
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:52,520
easier so please go out and try to

1299
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:54,200
influence your spear and educate those

1300
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,160
around you try do something positive so

1301
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,939
the only way we're gonna win the long

1302
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,940
run thank you
