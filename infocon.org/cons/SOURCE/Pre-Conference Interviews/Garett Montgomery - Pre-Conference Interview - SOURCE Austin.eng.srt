00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,560
hi this is Rob Sheen with a source

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,450
conference and I'm here with Garrett

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,130
Montgomery who is a security researcher

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,100
at the application and threat

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,750
intelligent group at keysight and he is

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,420
going to be speaking at source Austin on

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,970
December 5th and 6th and his talk is on

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:30,330
target based security model mapping

10
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:33,480
attacks to controls so so Garrett I'm

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,190
curious how is the new target based

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,940
security model different than what we

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:41,670
currently do well what what I found is

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:46,080
that there's not really a good way to

15
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:49,110
identify the right controls for specific

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,849
attacks if somebody asks you as we

17
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,199
frequently get asked as security

18
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,449
professionals what's the best way to

19
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:58,050
block something well there's not really

20
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:59,879
any accepted vendor neutral standardized

21
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,489
way to say you should do it with this

22
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:05,280
type of device or this type of control

23
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:06,750
that just doesn't exist and we kind of

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,190
stumbled upon something while doing

25
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,190
research for a product that we're

26
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:15,950
developing ourselves and we think it can

27
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:19,590
kind of fill that need got it

28
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:21,060
now you mentioned in the abstract you

29
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,430
mentioned that it's similar to the OSI

30
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,930
model now for those who haven't been in

31
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,219
a computer science class in a while if

32
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,140
you could give them the 30-second

33
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,949
overview of what OSI is first and then

34
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:33,119
we'll go from there

35
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:36,840
sure so OSI is a breakdown of the data

36
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:40,320
sent in packets that uses a layer based

37
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,789
model to kind of identify the parts of a

38
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,949
packet that contain information relevant

39
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:49,530
to be used for different devices like

40
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,420
you have IP information at layer 3

41
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,920
that's down at the bottom and it'll be

42
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,810
processed by routers determining which

43
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,450
hosts that you go to then you'll see

44
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,420
some port information or presentation

45
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,649
information which one sits on that host

46
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,990
determines where that data gets into

47
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:06,539
what service is processing it on the

48
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:09,329
host and then even further in up the

49
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:13,200
stack you have additional metadata for

50
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:18,210
further sending the data to the right

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,220
place so this is similar in that we have

52
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:23,140
a layer based approach where you

53
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,990
assigned controls based on

54
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:28,809
we're the bad part is within the packet

55
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:31,630
that's being sent got it yeah I think

56
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,430
the thing of it I think I hear most

57
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,750
people talk about with LSI is the

58
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,990
different layer three and four so

59
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:41,410
application versus network layer yeah

60
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:43,450
but so with yours what are some examples

61
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:45,609
that you said it's layers based on where

62
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:47,230
the bad data is sent is that mapping to

63
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:49,480
OSI or is it a different layered model

64
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:52,269
that you come up with so it's very

65
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:55,239
similar we've kind of condensed some and

66
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:57,610
renamed others because for the most part

67
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,250
devices that deal with layer 3 layer 4

68
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:02,080
IP address and port information they're

69
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,150
going to be the same devices they don't

70
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,480
really need to be separated we have a

71
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:09,880
logical separation but essentially

72
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,320
network layers in our model are going to

73
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,019
be processed by certain kinds of devices

74
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,600
and if there are attacks targeting the

75
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:19,380
services that use those they'll be seen

76
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:24,880
by devices that operate at that layer

77
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:26,980
nicely now what would be an example of a

78
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,680
target within your model that you would

79
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:31,869
have a specific control for so an

80
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,959
example is some of the older attacks you

81
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:37,690
may have heard of that targeted IP

82
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,239
processing engines network services you

83
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:42,250
would have a options field an IP options

84
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,060
field with a really long string it'd be

85
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,870
a buffer overflow

86
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:49,030
that's a layer 3 attack and if you have

87
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:51,360
a device like a laff Web Application

88
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:54,130
Firewall that's inspecting HTTP traffic

89
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,739
it's never gonna see that and it's easy

90
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:59,829
to see with say a layer based model to

91
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:01,720
show that laughs the web application

92
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:04,420
protocols they inspect web traffic

93
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,120
they don't look at network or layer 3 so

94
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:09,399
if you have an attack against a layer 3

95
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,650
device it's only gonna go as far as say

96
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:18,399
the first layer 3 device that processes

97
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:20,019
it so basically you're for any given

98
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,210
attack you're basically kind of mapping

99
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:25,360
out here are the various different ways

100
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:26,799
that one could defend against this is

101
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,240
that is it kind of meant to be meta like

102
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,640
that

103
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,360
exactly it's you have a certain part

104
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,270
that's bad

105
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,610
it's at a certain level in this layered

106
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,969
model and if you have a device that can

107
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,309
read

108
00:04:36,969 --> 00:04:43,259
anything at that level or below you

109
00:04:39,309 --> 00:04:43,259
could use it to block an attack

110
00:04:45,309 --> 00:04:49,509
so who's the kind of the target audience

111
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:50,769
faces this generally who would be using

112
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:56,619
this security

113
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:58,119
research question for our use case we're

114
00:04:56,619 --> 00:04:59,739
developing a product where we had a

115
00:04:58,119 --> 00:05:01,809
certain kind of attack and for each of

116
00:04:59,739 --> 00:05:03,669
these attacks we wanted to say this is

117
00:05:01,809 --> 00:05:06,129
the right kind of device you should be

118
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:09,339
using you would use this to buy this

119
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:10,719
attack to test how well a device

120
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:15,309
performs against we didn't want to

121
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:16,779
assign or test certain devices against

122
00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:19,059
the wrong kind of attacks so we came up

123
00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:20,649
with a classification system all right

124
00:05:19,059 --> 00:05:23,319
and at some point we realized hey this

125
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:24,999
this is actually a thing and it could be

126
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:29,079
useful outside the scope of what we're

127
00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:31,059
trying to do so I don't necessarily yet

128
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:33,519
have a target audience in mind it's just

129
00:05:31,059 --> 00:05:34,569
one of those Eureka moments you want to

130
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:38,199
share with as many people as possible

131
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:39,489
and hope that it finds a home and maybe

132
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:41,349
gets published or people start

133
00:05:39,489 --> 00:05:43,058
gravitating towards like let's all use

134
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:45,489
the same terminology let's all think

135
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:47,949
about things in a in a way like this

136
00:05:45,489 --> 00:05:50,739
that kind of makes sense so we can avoid

137
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:53,110
each vendor having their own terms and

138
00:05:50,739 --> 00:05:54,248
their own scoring methodology based on

139
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,219
how they do things

140
00:05:54,249 --> 00:06:00,009
hmmm are you releasing an open source to

141
00:05:57,219 --> 00:06:01,569
kind of encourage that so my intent has

142
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:03,669
always been to produce a white paper

143
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:06,219
unfortunately I've just been caught up

144
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:07,869
and have it actually published it I'd

145
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:10,919
certainly like to get additional eyes on

146
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:14,379
it I'd like to put it out for comments I

147
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:16,568
I don't know what else I could do other

148
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:17,919
that it's more just like a mindset or a

149
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:21,519
way of thinking about it I don't know

150
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:25,748
that it's so much a proprietary system

151
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:27,039
that we would own right so it sounds

152
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:28,599
like the kind of thing that once you do

153
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,818
the talk you can get some feedback from

154
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:32,229
the community and then write the white

155
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:33,909
paper and then that starts to become

156
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:36,039
something that people can then use as a

157
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:39,849
framework for going forward that's

158
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:41,860
that's that's the hope well that sounds

159
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:43,378
great I love it when people there's

160
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,490
somebody else doing something around

161
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:46,809
health care systems and doing threat

162
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,279
modeling based on templates and they've

163
00:06:46,809 --> 00:06:49,779
built out some templates for that so

164
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:50,560
like so it sounds like there's a little

165
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:52,000
bit of a running theme

166
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,860
I'll introduce you to those guys when

167
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,790
we're at the conference that that sounds

168
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:57,490
great that sounds like a great

169
00:06:54,790 --> 00:07:01,389
opportunity to you know compare systems

170
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:02,710
and merge them or synergetics yeah yeah

171
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:04,180
I know I definitely like it when people

172
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:06,070
come together and start sharing and

173
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,200
expanding what they're currently doing

174
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,849
so we're not all reinventing the same

175
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,940
wheel over and over again and at least

176
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:15,700
we can I vent some new wheels

177
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:18,160
occasionally cool well I definitely look

178
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:20,409
