00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:10,360
hi this is Rob Sheen with a source

3
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:12,430
conference and I'm here with Caroline

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,530
Wong and she's the VP of security

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,110
strategy at Cobalt and she's going to be

6
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:20,430
speaking next week at the Phoenix Mesa

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:22,900
event on February 28th and March 1st so

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,430
the title of your talk is the only

9
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:27,609
reason security really matters for

10
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:29,590
DevOps so DevOps is a you know fun topic

11
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:31,900
these days and everybody's starting to

12
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:34,390
think about it in various capacities and

13
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,800
I really liked your abstract so we

14
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,300
wanted to get you in to talk about it so

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:41,080
when you start do I need you tell us a

16
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:43,540
little about your talk in the

17
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:47,170
information security field now for 13

18
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:50,049
years and I'm always interested in the

19
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:53,229
really basic questions so I actually

20
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:55,690
start my talk out by saying first of all

21
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:58,239
why does DevOps matter and then I get

22
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:01,089
into okay so then why does security

23
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,489
matter for DevOps I talk about some

24
00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:06,330
different approaches that people might

25
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:09,369
take and and I provide my own

26
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,800
recommendation primarily based on my

27
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:15,340
experience leading security teams that

28
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,720
eBay and Zynga so I'm glad you mentioned

29
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,770
the zinger things that was something

30
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,780
that jumped out at me from your abstract

31
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:21,399
you were actually there when they went

32
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:24,100
from zero to ten million users on

33
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,680
farmville it was a pretty wild time I

34
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:30,720
joined right after that so I joined when

35
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:34,540
it was like the coolest place to be yeah

36
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,270
but I definitely was there when they had

37
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:38,680
some explosive games and and the reason

38
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:41,080
they could do that from a technology

39
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,540
standpoint was because they were a

40
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:46,150
pretty early adopter of amazon's cloud

41
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:49,060
services so they they needed that

42
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:50,920
elasticity because in entertainment and

43
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:53,860
essentially online video gaming is

44
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,960
entertainment you really never know how

45
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:58,450
successful something's gonna be until it

46
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:01,210
happens so from a capacity planning

47
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:03,820
perspective the cloud was a perfect

48
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:05,048
technology fit yeah yeah I mean the

49
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,940
cloud is a game changer it kind of

50
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:08,409
allows for stuff like that to exist when

51
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:11,019
previously you'd have to have a zillion

52
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:12,459
dollars in funding to be able to buy all

53
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:15,910
the equipment and hope it's going to

54
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:17,530
work you know so how did how did that

55
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,140
crazy experience of dealing with that

56
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:23,430
kind of volume how did that

57
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:26,010
translate into gallows for security yeah

58
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,140
so for us one of the things that we

59
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,260
realized right away was that as a

60
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:34,200
security team we were not in a position

61
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:38,970
to go and tell any of the engineers what

62
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:41,780
to do that was not gonna fly and so what

63
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:45,120
we what we did instead was we kind of

64
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:48,660
took the time to really understand okay

65
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,300
how does game development work at this

66
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:54,240
company and how can we work with those

67
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,270
folks in a way where you know first of

68
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,890
all they're gonna take a meeting with us

69
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:00,750
second of all you know they're gonna be

70
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:03,750
interested at all in what we have to say

71
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:06,150
and then we're in a position to advise

72
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:09,240
and to teach them and we really took

73
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:11,280
quite a high-touch approach with pen

74
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:15,959
test teams that were very integrated

75
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:20,459
with the game studios in person live

76
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:22,430
hands-on threat modeling courses so when

77
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:25,470
people talk about DevOps

78
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:29,780
certainly automation is a really big

79
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:34,200
factor that makes DevOps what it is

80
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:38,340
security for DevOps you know automation

81
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:41,518
comes up a lot and I actually I have a

82
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,620
bit of an unpopular opinion which is

83
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,200
that I think that in order to

84
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,959
effectively do security for DevOps and

85
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,049
actually requires quite a high touch

86
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,459
which is the opposite of what you hear a

87
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:56,100
lot which is to automate everything I

88
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,810
don't actually believe that everything

89
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,359
in security can or even should be

90
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,530
automated right yeah I would actually

91
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,940
agree with you there I think when people

92
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,080
try to automate everything or try to

93
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,100
have the technology fix everything

94
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,410
that's when they get themselves into

95
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,450
serious trouble and they end up with

96
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:13,530
massive institutional blind spots behind

97
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:14,700
things that they're doing okay so so

98
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,459
what are some some of the key

99
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,200
differences between the pre DevOps world

100
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:22,200
and the post DevOps well there's clearly

101
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:25,500
some major differences yeah so you know

102
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,469
in the pre DevOps world you've got a

103
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,900
waterfall software development lifecycle

104
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:32,670
you've got these phases of software

105
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,979
development that

106
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:37,250
of them take long enough that it makes

107
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,510
sense to put in a security gate

108
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,550
extensive security reviews can be

109
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:45,210
conducted and approvals can be put in

110
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:49,440
place you know the other the other thing

111
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:53,580
is that in a pre DevOps world you have

112
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,610
this security mindset of you know the

113
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:59,539
the organization or the assets you're

114
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:02,940
trying to protect you know they're there

115
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:06,000
Walden right it's it's an M&M like hard

116
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:07,740
candy shell you know soft gooey Center

117
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,530
sort of situation and it's all about

118
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:14,160
preventing the attack from happening and

119
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:17,760
keeping everything out that model works

120
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:21,240
better in an isolated private data

121
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:24,750
center environment but what DevOps what

122
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:28,200
you've got is extensive use of cloud

123
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:31,650
technology reliance on lots of

124
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:34,700
third-party software components free and

125
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:36,960
open source software components and so

126
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:42,360
we've really moved from this sort of

127
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:45,930
isolated situation to an ecosystem where

128
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:48,690
so many different organizations are

129
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:52,980
dependent on each other and that creates

130
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:56,790
a very different scenario one of the

131
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:58,530
things that I like about DevOps and you

132
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:02,010
know correspondingly the security

133
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:05,250
approach to DevOps is that there's an

134
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:07,320
acknowledgement that incidents will

135
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:11,370
occur and in fact are occurring right

136
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:14,330
now some of the coolest DevOps tools

137
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:18,830
that I'm aware of our ones that actually

138
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:22,349
you know create incidents for teams to

139
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:23,880
practice responding to because it's such

140
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:26,730
an own thing it's such an acknowledged

141
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,680
thing since we're no longer trying to

142
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:30,420
prevent the incident and fooling

143
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,820
ourselves into believing that an

144
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:34,800
incident is not going to occur we

145
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:37,020
acknowledge that incidents are occurring

146
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,660
all the time and I think that's a very

147
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,609
different mindset yes I like the point

148
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,340
about acknowledging that it always

149
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,990
happens because I see so many people

150
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,530
that it's like they're offended that

151
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,690
there was an

152
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,250
you know and and they get punished for

153
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:52,380
their being in incidents like it's not

154
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,060
realistic because you know Sony wants to

155
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,320
get him badly enough you know if you

156
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,050
know anything about the bad guys you'll

157
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:00,360
know that they will get in so I like

158
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,950
this idea of you know assuming it'll

159
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,400
happen and then it's then figuring out

160
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:07,860
all right now what so one thing I've

161
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,380
noticed though is you know I started in

162
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,630
security back around 1998 or so and

163
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:15,150
there was kind of a big push back then

164
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:16,980
to get us off of the you know you know

165
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:18,870
this big open academic model where

166
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,760
everything was connected and shifting

167
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:24,210
towards more of a you know more of a

168
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,770
secured model what I've been telling

169
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,419
people for a while now is that there was

170
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:30,810
the security bus that left the station

171
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:32,190
back around 1998 2000 and along the way

172
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,990
it's kind of broken down a few times

173
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,820
we've had some flat tires we did they

174
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:39,750
get up and fix but it still could been

175
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:40,500
kind of limping along over time but

176
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:44,880
there are a bunch of people that never

177
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:46,380
got on the bus so there's basically I

178
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,270
see it a lot with DevOps now because I

179
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:51,780
teach classes where I talk to people and

180
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:54,240
find out what they're doing and the ones

181
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:58,590
that aren't doing DevOps yet are so far

182
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:01,020
behind the curve in so far up to their

183
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:02,099
eyeballs in technical debt that I don't

184
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,530
know how they're ever going to catch up

185
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:07,080
you have any tips for those guys because

186
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:10,260
that's a lot of them huh yeah it is a

187
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:13,530
lot right so puppet is an organization

188
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:15,000
that releases this date of DevOps report

189
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:18,809
they've been doing it for four years now

190
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:23,880
and the 2017 versions that the of their

191
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:26,040
survey respondents only 27% are actually

192
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:28,380
doing DevOps today so there's tons of

193
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,330
talk about it the reality is there's a

194
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:33,360
ton of organizations that are not doing

195
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:35,069
it yet I think your comment with regards

196
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,080
to getting on the bus is a really

197
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,789
important one because there's this idea

198
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,310
that traditionally

199
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:42,718
security has had this position where

200
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:46,020
they could sort of tell people what to

201
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,420
do and then now the idea is that well in

202
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:51,390
DevOps things move so fast you know

203
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,709
security can't can no longer sort of you

204
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,959
know come into the room and say no you

205
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:57,300
can't do that you know it's got to be a

206
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:00,410
different conversation I actually

207
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,410
subscribe to the belief that

208
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:05,620
we as security people never had that

209
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,120
right in the first place right who gives

210
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,890
us the authority to come in and tell

211
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,140
people what they can or cannot do I

212
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:13,149
think that often so I've got a toddler

213
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:15,580
and when I tell my daughter what you can

214
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:17,529
and cannot do you know I I get different

215
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,720
responses right it's human nature people

216
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:22,060
don't like being told what to do but if

217
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,920
I sort of like acknowledge how she feels

218
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,959
explain the situation

219
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,829
you know maybe tell her about some like

220
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:31,719
real life consequences then even it you

221
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:33,790
know almost three years old she's more

222
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,580
willing to listen so one of the things I

223
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:39,130
like a lot about DevOps and the way that

224
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:41,440
it's shifting culturally is that for

225
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:44,140
security people to even have a seat at

226
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,200
the table in a DevOps world I think

227
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:50,770
there's got to be trust and there are

228
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:53,140
ways to gain and build that trust and

229
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,939
there are ways to destroy and I think

230
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:57,819
one of the ways to destroy it is when

231
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:59,649
you come into the room and you say you

232
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,060
know you cannot do this thing that you

233
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:03,040
want to do I think another way to

234
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,140
destroy trust is when you come in and

235
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,329
you say hey we ran this automated

236
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:09,550
security tool you know I'm gonna I'm

237
00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:11,620
gonna give you this pile of 300 findings

238
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:14,140
you know good luck and and and I'll see

239
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:17,520
you later I think it's a completely

240
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:20,020
different conversation when you say look

241
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:23,230
you know we've got this really

242
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:25,000
highly-skilled pentest team and we want

243
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:28,180
them to work with your development teams

244
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,040
to try and find security vulnerabilities

245
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,569
in the application we want to work with

246
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,130
you to fix those who want to work with

247
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:35,320
you to prevent those in the future I

248
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:37,300
think I think that's a different that's

249
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:41,190
a different discussion because I think

250
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:44,050
that developers and engineering teams

251
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:46,480
they they want their code to be secure

252
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:49,359
you know they want their product to be

253
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,730
as awesome as it can be and I think if

254
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,670
security teams are positioning

255
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:56,560
themselves in such a way that they're

256
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:58,719
saying to engineering teams look I'm

257
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,849
curious and I want to listen to you and

258
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,510
I want to understand how you work and

259
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:07,089
understand how I can help you then I

260
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:10,569
think that can go a long way awesome

261
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:11,829
awesome so uh all right I have one left

262
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,930
I was thinking of leaving it till the

263
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:15,969
conference but I'll ask it to you now

264
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:18,069
you mentioned the the N is F

265
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:21,010
cybersecurity framework in your abstract

266
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:23,440
and how you've taken the the traditional

267
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:25,720
ID identify prevent detect respond

268
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,480
recover and simplified it down to three

269
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,490
which is identify prevent react yeah so

270
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,170
I'm gonna throw out one little challenge

271
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:35,230
here for you

272
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:38,410
my challenge is this a lot of folks seem

273
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:42,700
to only do one of those three things and

274
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:44,650
it's reacting so by simplifying it down

275
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,900
to those three things how do we kind of

276
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:49,000
make sure that they at least do the

277
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:54,310
identify and prevent parts first yeah

278
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:58,000
yeah so I think the question so I

279
00:11:54,310 --> 00:12:01,000
actually of all of them I actually think

280
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,360
that identify is the most important one

281
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,850
I think that if you don't know what

282
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,920
you're trying to protect and how it

283
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,570
works and how it got put together and

284
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,510
what's going on with it you know how

285
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:15,700
could you possibly you know think that

286
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:17,590
you'd be in a position to be able to

287
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,750
prevent and prevent bad things from

288
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:21,580
happening and to protect those assets if

289
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:23,860
you don't even know you know what they

290
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:26,080
are or various important attributes

291
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:31,090
about them and I think that's kind of

292
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:33,790
what leads to so much emphasis really

293
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:37,000
out of necessity on the reaction part so

294
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:39,040
in my talk at source Mesa Phoenix next

295
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,480
week what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna talk

296
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:46,270
about these three categories of security

297
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:48,090
techniques identify prevent and react

298
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:51,310
and I'm gonna share a couple stories

299
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:54,000
from my background about specifically

300
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:56,650
how we did that in various environments

301
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,400
great that sounds awesome I'm looking

302
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:01,120
forward to continuing the conversation

303
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:02,829
next week and hopefully if you guys see

304
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,450
this online then you'll want to come and

305
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:05,860
join us for this conversation that's one

306
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,880
of the nice things about sources you

307
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,880
actually could hang out and chat with

308
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,870
the speakers about these topics so we're

309
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,700
looking forward to it so I'll see you

310
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:14,740
all next week

311
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:17,400
source Phoenix Mesa and February 28th

312
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,400
and March 1st
