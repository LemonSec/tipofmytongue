1
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,090
by the Straub Sheen with a source

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:12,210
conference and I'm here with Brianne

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,830
Hughes from Bishop Fox and she's gonna

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,000
be speaking at the Mesa Phoenix

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,180
conference coming up at the end of

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,180
February and March first and her talk is

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,529
security needs a style guide so I found

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,230
that abstract interesting when I read it

9
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:26,039
so I decided I wanted to check it out

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,990
and see what you were going to talk

11
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:33,150
about so tell us a little bit about your

12
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:35,519
talk so what I'm talking about is

13
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:37,260
basically a security style guide that

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,079
we've been using internally at Bishop

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,030
Fox for the last year and a half is

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,309
something that when I started the job I

17
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,829
felt like we could really use having

18
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:49,680
three editors and over 50 consultants

19
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:54,690
who write all of our reports but as it

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,399
started to sort of expand and mature we

21
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,260
also realized that other people in

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,510
similar positions other technical

23
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,089
editors and also security researchers

24
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,379
and tech journalists and you know your

25
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,900
sales department and your marketing

26
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,310
department and your legal department

27
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,369
they could all use a handy guide there

28
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,770
are so many difficult to understand

29
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:15,960
terms and inconsistently written terms

30
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:19,080
and acronyms that could mean two or

31
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,020
different things so it just seemed like

32
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,869
something that the industry could use as

33
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,509
it matures and we're happy to provide a

34
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:30,079
free PDF of v1 to sort of start that

35
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:34,290
language conversation with the community

36
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:35,639
awesome so yeah I've definitely been in

37
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,979
the position of writing deliverables and

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,450
editing people's words and I can

39
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,369
definitely vouch for the fact that

40
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:45,210
people really need to be better at

41
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:46,530
writing in general I can i definitely

42
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:52,020
feel for you I know what your job is

43
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:53,579
like so what can people expect from the

44
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,079
talk like if they're gonna go in and

45
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,880
understand you know about the style

46
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:01,079
guide like what should they walk away

47
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,420
with yeah you know um I've found that a

48
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,219
lot of security researchers are in a

49
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,259
similar position that you've been in

50
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:09,119
where you didn't really plan to be a

51
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,490
writer but a lot of your job is writing

52
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,410
and explaining what you've done and you

53
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:15,090
usually don't have an editor you're

54
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:19,319
editing your own things or you're doing

55
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:21,540
it for your peers and so the first

56
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,939
part of the talk is sort of explaining

57
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,459
you know this isn't some some you

58
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:29,638
couldn't ignore people judge you based

59
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:31,319
on your use of language and if there are

60
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:32,219
errors in your writings then you have to

61
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,078
spend your time

62
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:36,450
you know reassuring your client that you

63
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:38,129
really did do valuable work and they

64
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,920
start looking for other red flags if

65
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:43,590
there are smaller errors so it's just a

66
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,510
general way to be professional to think

67
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:49,519
about your language more it's also

68
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:52,849
something for people to think about as

69
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:55,620
the industry is constantly in the news

70
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:57,869
as a way to explain things to the public

71
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,699
and when you're writing you know the

72
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,199
first draft should just be getting all

73
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:03,540
of that stuff out of your head like what

74
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:06,000
what did I do how did I do this exploit

75
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,340
and and figuring that out but the second

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,780
draft should be who is my audience and

77
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,370
will they understand what I'm trying to

78
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:15,840
say so the the talk is sort of about

79
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,579
deliberately thinking about the ways

80
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,319
that you use language and the ways you

81
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:21,389
could be more inclusive and expand your

82
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:23,099
audience and look more professional so

83
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:25,169
that you can spend more time you know

84
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:31,048
doing the fun stuff but also realizing

85
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:32,609
that writing is a part of this career so

86
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:33,780
it sounds like they'll not just get kind

87
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:35,370
of like here's the style guide is but

88
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,439
also a little bit of process around how

89
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,819
to go about you know thinking about your

90
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:40,620
writing and a lot of y'all don't like

91
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:42,358
that don't write a lot don't realize

92
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,409
that writing is in fact a process and

93
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:45,209
you definitely hit the nail on the head

94
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:47,189
with that yeah you know first you get

95
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:50,239
the mess out and then you refine it and

96
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:53,370
clean it up and you know get it clear

97
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,590
right so that's cool I love it when

98
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,299
folks like to give things back to the

99
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,040
community so that was definitely one of

100
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:01,379
the factors in picking the talk because

101
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,659
I definitely see the need for this I

102
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:05,069
would invite my way every security

103
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:09,870
consultant on the planet would go to

104
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:11,429
your session yeah well I'm very excited

105
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,609
to share it with the public the other

106
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:16,440
thing just for the the content of the

107
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:18,959
talk is that you know there are over

108
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:22,108
1,700 terms in here and a lot of them

109
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,940
are sort of the you know serious usage

110
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:25,650
advice about you know how you capitalize

111
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,139
and hyphenate man-in-the-middle or

112
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:30,570
denial of service but we've also come to

113
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:33,030
realize that this community is really

114
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:35,099
steeped in internet culture so I'll

115
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:36,690
side you know the serious things talking

116
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,850
about sequel injection and cross-site

117
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,070
scripting we also have you know some

118
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:43,230
corporate jargon and some means and some

119
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:45,780
sci-fi terms because when people write

120
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:47,700
about hacking they refer to pop culture

121
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,700
things cuz that's the only way they they

122
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:52,289
understand it so it's it's not it's not

123
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:56,820
dry there's there's a lot of weird stuff

124
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:57,240
in there oh yeah I can imagine yeah very

125
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,159
cool

126
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,800
now I thought your background was really

127
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,540
interesting you're a member of the

128
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,080
American copy editors Society which I

129
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:08,520
didn't even know existed you remember

130
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,580
the dictionary Society of North America

131
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,229
which I also didn't know existed and

132
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,330
you're heavily involved in word Nick so

133
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,920
you're definitely like clearly a subject

134
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:21,930
matter expert in this particular topic

135
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:25,470
so yeah a lot of people are our only

136
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:27,270
editors or they are just academic

137
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,180
linguists or they just work as

138
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:32,609
lexicographers in dictionaries but I've

139
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,460
just loved words all of my life and so I

140
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:37,260
just want to be involved and be around

141
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,840
people who are interested in really

142
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:41,640
getting into you know the history of

143
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,719
things but also having a whole lot of

144
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,530
fun though

145
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,000
yeah I basically want to yeah I want to

146
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:49,890
be around all the word people and then

147
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,690
I'd like to sort of share that passion

148
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:54,180
you know a lot of people have a very

149
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:56,160
negative connotation when it comes to

150
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,860
editors they sort of think of English

151
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,870
teachers and red pens and really editors

152
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:03,870
were on your team we're sort of you know

153
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,940
this secret weapon that helps you look

154
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,830
better like our names don't go on it

155
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:10,770
we're here for your greater glory so

156
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:13,770
just being out there and saying hey I'm

157
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:15,359
a person I would just love to have you

158
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,190
know wordplay all the time but we have

159
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,320
serious things to say so you know let's

160
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:20,640
say them in a professional way right

161
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,200
that's great

162
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,760
yeah I definitely have been in a

163
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,190
position where having to break the news

164
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,469
to consultants that no really the

165
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:30,060
document is our product it's it's really

166
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,560
