1
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,530
hi this is rob machine with the source

2
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,790
conference and I'm here with Vince

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,799
Warrington who was the founder of

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,809
protective intelligence and he's gonna

5
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,869
be speaking at source Boston on May 9th

6
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:22,070
and 10th and his talk is titled selling

7
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:23,390
cyber to the board so tell us Vince tell

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:35,540
us why we need to sell cyber to the

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:38,240
board businesses but it tends to be

10
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:40,370
stuck within IT departments and what we

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,770
found is the my experience of going to

12
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:47,300
boards in the past is I have this idea

13
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:49,160
you know we take is amigo I talk tech if

14
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:52,519
I demonstrate how well I know the

15
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,349
technology how well I know the problem

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,180
then the board will listen to me and

17
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,440
they'll give me my money but

18
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:01,150
unfortunately what tends to happen is

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,150
boards don't understand technology

20
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:09,049
presentation and you think yeah I've

21
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:13,249
nailed it that money's definitely we're

22
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:15,829
going to get funding what happens is you

23
00:01:13,249 --> 00:01:17,719
talk a lot of Technology and the board

24
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:19,579
open sit there listens to you and then

25
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:22,369
they you know you walk out the door and

26
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:25,249
then the old thing I didn't understand a

27
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:27,380
word of what that man was said you know

28
00:01:25,249 --> 00:01:29,210
but the important thing is because there

29
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,369
are that senior level then don't turn to

30
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:36,619
each other and say I didn't understand

31
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:38,210
that did you sitting not understanding

32
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:40,429
what you've just said none of them

33
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:45,158
discussing it and nobody funds producers

34
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:48,409
they don't understand so happen so why

35
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:50,539
talking to boards which says actually

36
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:52,999
what affords care about what a board to

37
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:56,209
know and they talk about risk you know

38
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:58,490
it's a business they understand risk so

39
00:01:56,209 --> 00:02:00,590
I found in the past changing it around

40
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:02,749
making it less about the technology more

41
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:05,209
about the problem you solving more about

42
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:06,529
what the risk mitigation is get you a

43
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:08,360
lot better results when he talked to the

44
00:02:06,529 --> 00:02:09,429
board level and that's tell me what my

45
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,410
talk is about

46
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:14,959
so why the board at all why not just

47
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:17,420
convince your manager the seaso or the

48
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,610
or the CEO why goes straight to the

49
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,959
board well

50
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:25,760
same sort of job you've got to convince

51
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:31,070
those people and then you know it's with

52
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:33,890
the great CTO who started in a very very

53
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:35,840
large multinational business and he

54
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,609
gathered all the troops around day one

55
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,040
through the front of the entire IT

56
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:42,080
department in the UK we've got people

57
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:45,170
dialing in from all over the world and

58
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:50,110
the CTO stood up and said I know nothing

59
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:50,109
about technology and every kind of cat

60
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:57,650
technology I know so your job is to

61
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:59,600
convince me of why I need to support

62
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,370
your project and then I will convince

63
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,190
the board that we need to support it so

64
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:06,320
it's kind of them it's one of the things

65
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,970
where you need to kind of it's a

66
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,530
convincing job they see more than

67
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:12,440
anything else and the more people you

68
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:13,880
convince the better you have and you see

69
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,380
you find the same with like cyber

70
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,239
awareness programs more people you talk

71
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,709
to you the more you convince them the

72
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,209
more protected they'll be in their

73
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:23,300
behaviors their exhibits the same sort

74
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:24,500
of process right so you've definitely

75
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,000
highlighted some points that I the

76
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,010
things I've noticed as well as which is

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,620
that there is this significant

78
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:32,660
communication gap between technical

79
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,160
folks and non-technical folks and I

80
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,230
actually think that there's three big

81
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,060
ones there's security and business

82
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:40,579
business and technology and technology

83
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:43,519
and security all three of them have gaps

84
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:45,019
so so what are some examples of some

85
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,820
strategies you could use to bridge some

86
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:48,980
of those gaps particularly between the

87
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:57,220
technical side and the non technical

88
00:03:48,980 --> 00:04:00,040
side of the house people and actually

89
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:04,609
pretty much like we're doing right now

90
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:06,679
you're talking to or you're saying hey

91
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:08,120
you're in front of from school children

92
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,700
you've got to explain what this

93
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,100
technology does and so what I found is

94
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:18,738
their insecurity we all know what a DDoS

95
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:20,029
attack is security defense but most

96
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:22,489
people outside you don't so I ever say

97
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:25,010
to people can you explain to me a DDoS

98
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,990
attack in three sentences and it's

99
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:29,210
really really hard to do when you've

100
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:32,180
lived the technology for so long it's so

101
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:33,469
hard to break out of the technical

102
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,730
issues around it

103
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,980
but then we think of any lottery

104
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:38,960
sentences and or explaining to somebody

105
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,000
and then you just realize it's just you

106
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,039
just think it's it's a form of attack

107
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,260
which prevents your people from using

108
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,820
your website for example and then you

109
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,340
know just break those barriers down

110
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,740
great if you've got young children no

111
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:57,229
not to you because they were understand

112
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:58,610
but if you kind of got children also

113
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:01,150
tell you very honestly when you're

114
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,150
talking rubbish

115
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,590
talking rubbish I think as a UK phrase

116
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,210
but my son watches Peppa Pig and he

117
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:13,580
recently told me I was talking rubbish I

118
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:15,950
couldn't believe it so I know what that

119
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,460
means now so um so what are some

120
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:21,710
examples of some things you should not

121
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:24,640
maybe do or say to the board when you're

122
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,640
trying to convince them of something

123
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:37,790
these people are not stupid you know

124
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:40,850
some of them can be not their world so

125
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:42,140
what they're looking for is a solution

126
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:45,560
to a problem what they're not looking

127
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:47,030
for is to say how great you know the

128
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,620
subject technically so that's one of

129
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:52,070
things before don't get too bogged down

130
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:54,020
in detail if the board wants to know

131
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:55,280
detail about a specific system whatever

132
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,719
you're going to put in then they will

133
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,849
ask for it and normally the last we're

134
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,660
after you doing the presentation though

135
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:03,500
don't worry too much about the technical

136
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:06,290
capabilities or whatever you want to put

137
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:09,110
in or anything like that that's one

138
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:11,720
thing second thing is to be prepared

139
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:14,419
okay so there's nothing worse than going

140
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,010
into a board meeting and talking to the

141
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:17,450
board and then they ask you a question

142
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,560
and you don't know the answer to it if

143
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,760
you don't know the answer the question

144
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,919
and be honest and so you don't know

145
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,810
you're blowing up one but always be

146
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,299
prepared that kind of thing normally

147
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:28,250
what you can do there will be especially

148
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,750
in larger companies there will be PA use

149
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,700
who will kind of work with people who

150
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,810
work the board have a chat with them

151
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,510
they'll normally tell you information

152
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:37,280
like oh you know John likes to know a

153
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:39,860
lot of technical detail he's very very

154
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,109
into it or they'll say you know the CFO

155
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,490
he's you know he's not a techie guy at

156
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,419
all you need to kind of dumb it down

157
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,130
sort of think so

158
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:46,889
get some pointers from people like that

159
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,240
and

160
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:50,159
really help out when you when you're

161
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,050
going in talk to the board because then

162
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:53,248
you're talking exactly the right level

163
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,370
you're pitching into the right there

164
00:06:53,249 --> 00:06:58,710
with them so know your audience

165
00:06:55,370 --> 00:07:01,699
exactly that's a good tip for any

166
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,698
