00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,250
hi this is Rob Sheen with a source

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,840
conference and I'm here with Richard

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,480
Steinem and he's going to be a keynote

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:19,550
at source Boston coming up on May 1st

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,860
through 3rd and he's going to be

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:25,400
speaking about zero trust networking and

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:27,259
cloud transformations so those are big

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,729
terms and we we hear them thrown around

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,940
a lot I'm curious to hear your take on

11
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,560
it

12
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,940
so why you tell us just a little bit

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,628
about what your keynotes about Richard

14
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,350
okay

15
00:00:32,628 --> 00:00:38,599
thanks rod so the first of all zero

16
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:40,580
Trust has you know at least two meetings

17
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,100
and the first meeting I was familiar

18
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:45,739
with was for you know data storage when

19
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:49,610
you're sharing information via Dropbox

20
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:51,680
or box a zero trust model for those

21
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:54,530
kinds of services was one where you own

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,660
the keys and he didn't trust the

23
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:59,690
administrator of the service you are

24
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:01,699
using to encrypt and keep your data safe

25
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,680
because if you try if you hold the keys

26
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:07,700
you don't have to trust anybody so zero

27
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:10,460
trust means not the bad side where I

28
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,930
don't trust you it's it means I'm not

29
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:15,830
gonna trust you and your technology

30
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:18,190
doesn't require me to trust you but it

31
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:22,009
translated and it's being picked up by

32
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:25,340
network providers is kind of a different

33
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:28,000
meaning so in the keynote you know I

34
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:31,190
walk through examples and describe how

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,770
zero trust networking can be implemented

36
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:37,429
there's actually a lot of things that

37
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:40,880
can accomplish it today and what means

38
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:43,910
for the future and in short your trust

39
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,369
means you no longer expose your

40
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:48,580
applications to the entire Internet

41
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:51,020
so it's undiscoverable sometimes

42
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,849
implementations are called stealth so

43
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:55,880
the applications not there there's

44
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:58,520
invariably a broker in between you

45
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,818
authenticate you know each user of an

46
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,259
application authenticates to the broker

47
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:04,819
and the broker checks with Active

48
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:07,910
Directory or whatever level of

49
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:10,069
authentication is required make sure

50
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:12,290
you're authorized to see an app and then

51
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:15,260
it tells the app hey this guy's trying

52
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:18,500
to talk to you it reminds me of back in

53
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:21,828
the early days of modems when you used

54
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,180
to have the phone home feature in the

55
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:24,830
advanced modems

56
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,409
you could just you know set it a little

57
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:29,720
setting in the in the firmware and it

58
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:32,209
would never answer the phone so you

59
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,950
couldn't war dial a bank of phone

60
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:36,530
numbers and try and figure out which

61
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:39,530
one's had modems attached to it if you

62
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:41,720
did happen to call a modem it would

63
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:43,909
immediately hang up and then call home

64
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,909
to the one phone number that it was

65
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:49,489
allowed to connect to via via the phone

66
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:51,920
lines and that's how you know all of I

67
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:53,569
thought you deployed in the Alyeska

68
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,018
pipeline so the big pipeline across

69
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:58,940
Alaska has to have sensors and things

70
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:02,269
and turbines that I have to report home

71
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:04,010
so the operators would call the modem

72
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:06,489
and it would call back making action and

73
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:09,709
then they could tell that in so

74
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:12,140
accomplishing that in my cloud posed

75
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:14,540
some difficulties but people are

76
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:17,720
overcoming it with either you know way

77
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:20,750
down at the protocol level like host

78
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:23,480
identity protocol which is built for

79
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:25,310
this kind of thing or merely a cloud

80
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,200
service that does that brokering in the

81
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:29,690
middle and now it means that you can

82
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,608
launch your application you know say an

83
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:34,579
internal HR app or one for your

84
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:36,470
customers only they are allowed to ever

85
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:39,769
see the application so it could be an

86
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:42,709
you know some cryptically named AWS

87
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:45,410
bucket but nobody knows it's there can't

88
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:47,269
scan for it can't find it but you can

89
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:50,989
get to it so immediately it you know

90
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:52,699
takes out a huge proportion of the

91
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:56,030
potential attackers against your

92
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:58,160
application so you know which reduces

93
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,510
how much you have to worry every day and

94
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,698
it means you know only attackers are

95
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:03,769
gonna be authorized users and hopefully

96
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:06,709
you can take the next layer of security

97
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:08,569
to monitor their activity and identify

98
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:11,660
when either they've been compromised

99
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:15,798
or they're acting inappropriately right

100
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:17,870
so that's definitely the an interesting

101
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:19,789
place that if we can get to that clearly

102
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:23,900
that takes away a lot of the normal

103
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:26,630
attack vectors you know but I gotta say

104
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,580
I see a lot of companies that are so

105
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:32,810
buried in technical debt I can't imagine

106
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:34,490
them getting there anytime soon so how

107
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:37,130
do you see this evolving in a way that

108
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,750
you know more just like the few have

109
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:40,880
can pull it off and then it's kind of

110
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,320
like without with agile like a bunch of

111
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,120
people are doing it really well and

112
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,700
there's a whole bunch of people there

113
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,560
not right that are kind of muddling

114
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,780
along and trying to make it work and

115
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,850
most people I see actually have like

116
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,559
agile and a half it's like you know some

117
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,180
version of waterfall merged in with

118
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,990
agile and it they kind of just make it

119
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:01,640
work but it's not really yeah or they'll

120
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,440
air it in you know they say okay we're

121
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:08,870
gonna still do all the old waterfall

122
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:10,940
stuff yet another hybrid right where

123
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,110
people are gonna doing one part of it

124
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:15,020
correct and the other part of it kind of

125
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:18,200
half-assing it yeah well I was looking

126
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:20,450
into this and started talking to a bunch

127
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:23,479
of what we would think of normally as

128
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:26,590
maybe big stodgy slow-moving companies

129
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:30,470
and I interviewed 16 of them for my book

130
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:31,840
cured cloud transformation and that's

131
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,800
why I derived a lot of this

132
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,719
understanding of what's happening so

133
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:40,460
we're talking about Siemens Pulte Homes

134
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:42,500
Fannie Mae all have discovered that they

135
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,210
have to go this way and it wasn't a

136
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:48,050
security thing that led them down this

137
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:51,289
path it was like the guys at Nov which

138
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:52,940
is kind of a small version of slumber

139
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:56,960
Jay at least that's how I think of them

140
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:59,090
they make oil drill heads for oil and

141
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,430
gas exploration after the financial

142
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:06,080
crisis in 2008 they you know we're

143
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,970
unprofitable and you know losing money

144
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,440
and they had to cut costs in their IT

145
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:14,060
department so they moved to this model

146
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,790
where first of all it was kind of a

147
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:19,370
cloud first model hey it's too expensive

148
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:21,560
to maintain our data centers all those

149
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:24,340
operating systems and servers and all

150
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,630
the rest we're gonna move to Amazon or

151
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:30,950
we're gonna move all of our email to

152
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:32,780
office 365 and how do we do that how do

153
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:35,810
we accomplish that and they decided that

154
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:38,750
a cloud transformation was the right

155
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,790
direction so they started moving all

156
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:45,080
their apps to the cloud started using

157
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:48,560
app delivered clouds or cloud delivered

158
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:50,248
apps in order to get lower cost and

159
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,349
costs it would you know scale

160
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:55,919
with usage not just be fixed like

161
00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:58,859
regular software costs are and they got

162
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:02,279
to the point where internal users of the

163
00:06:58,859 --> 00:07:03,808
systems thought IT was you know at a

164
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:05,429
time of strife for the rest of the

165
00:07:03,809 --> 00:07:07,769
company with layoffs and all the rest

166
00:07:05,429 --> 00:07:09,388
that that IT was was they had a carte

167
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:11,159
Blanc to spend money because they got

168
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:14,249
new features every single day new

169
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:16,889
capability and better performance and

170
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:18,809
their email for office 365 and of course

171
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:22,739
they got everything office 365 throws in

172
00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:24,239
there all the time so you know that was

173
00:07:22,739 --> 00:07:26,698
just one example and that was probably

174
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:29,008
the smallest company I talked to though

175
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:31,679
frankly you'd be surprised Fannie Mae is

176
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:34,439
a very small company though it impacts

177
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:37,649
trillions of dollars of transactions

178
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:42,209
every single day and they made that move

179
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:45,059
but but Siemens you know some of these

180
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:46,259
companies you know and their CIOs we're

181
00:07:45,059 --> 00:07:50,849
just telling me their whole whole

182
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:56,069
journey at our Camus's on and Microsoft

183
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:58,199
and Google of course the Kelly services

184
00:07:56,069 --> 00:08:00,389
actually here in Michigan had made this

185
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:03,749
transition it was kind of driven by a

186
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:06,599
move to office 365 so that's what what

187
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:08,729
led me to discover the transformation

188
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:12,839
that was going on because anytime you

189
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:14,729
see a IT any a type of IT adaption that

190
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:17,399
saves money and gives you better

191
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:19,079
performance and better security that's a

192
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:24,569
real movement to keep an eye on so

193
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:26,099
that's I've seen for a long time cloud

194
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:28,769
is kind of like the great enabler

195
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:30,509
it's amazing to me I remember starting

196
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:34,558
up companies that we had to buy server

197
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:36,329
racks that stuff up and now I can I

198
00:08:34,558 --> 00:08:38,370
could literally while we're on the phone

199
00:08:36,328 --> 00:08:39,568
right now I could with a few clicks of a

200
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,979
button and a credit card we could start

201
00:08:39,568 --> 00:08:42,088
a company right the second and have a

202
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,769
website going by the end of the call

203
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:46,800
yeah can you don't even need a credit

204
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:48,300
card because Google or a lot of use for

205
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,979
free right they give you a credit for a

206
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,740
while yeah so what I'm curious about

207
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,660
though is I remember we spent a lot of

208
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,100
effort and energy learning and figuring

209
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,959
out how to lock down the physical

210
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,179
infrastructure and then as we started

211
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:01,859
rolling out cloud we we basically spent

212
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:04,110
a lot of time trying to figure out that

213
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,210
and it seems like every time

214
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,590
just about to kind of figure it out we

215
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,940
move out of the next bright shiny thing

216
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:12,600
and the latest bright shiny thing has

217
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:14,010
been IOT so I'm wondering like do you

218
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:19,170
see a point where we're actually going

219
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:21,450
to arrive at this transformation where

220
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:23,280
things are actually done correctly or

221
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:26,340
are we just going to get halfway there

222
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:30,449
and go to the next bright shiny thing I

223
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:32,610
do I'm an optimist so I'll admit all of

224
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:36,480
our efforts to counter what the

225
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:38,700
attackers are doing is a economic game

226
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,550
and we have to increase the cost for the

227
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,410
attackers so they stop you know right

228
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:45,300
now attackers are still in the mode

229
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,829
where they can attack for free right

230
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,329
because people aren't protecting

231
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,610
themselves or you can always find

232
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:53,790
somebody that's not protected and steal

233
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:56,040
their data but there are companies you

234
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:58,680
know the ones I've interviewed Lockheed

235
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:01,469
Martin probably everybody in the defense

236
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,880
industrial base who and the big banks

237
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,770
have all invested hundreds of millions

238
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,450
of dollars in security they've paid down

239
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,610
their security debt and I think they're

240
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,470
ahead of the game they're still attacked

241
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,150
by nation-state actors who've got

242
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:14,850
infinite resources compared to what

243
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:17,760
we're used to and they just have to

244
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:20,130
continuously increase the expense for

245
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,069
the attackers and but we all have to get

246
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:25,580
there and the cloud reduces that total

247
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:28,650
investment in the expense because the

248
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:30,840
people developing the defenses you know

249
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:32,760
we saw Microsoft now it was really

250
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,550
helping their customers identify when

251
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,620
attacks are underway they've invested

252
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:39,540
the billions that are needed in order to

253
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,210
make it effective so they're going to

254
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:45,719
share that as cloud services or being

255
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:49,140
part of the cloud so it's a it's

256
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:51,990
exciting times I think might be an

257
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,580
inflection point in security certainly

258
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:56,570
in network security

259
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:59,010
endpoint security still has ways to go

260
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:02,280
but I'm starting to see some pretty cool

261
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:05,970
things on the server side companies that

262
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:09,750
will basically reimage your server every

263
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:12,000
60 seconds so an attacker now has a time

264
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:16,010
frame of 60 seconds take advantage of a

265
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,990
vulnerability if they can't execute and

266
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:19,819
you'll launch their internal attack from

267
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,970
there in 60 seconds it's too late that

268
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:25,250
servers gone they got to start over

269
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:26,900
which just means the attackers will get

270
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,480
to the point where they can do is an

271
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:31,970
attack in 60 seconds and then what if

272
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,950
they come up with you know really but

273
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:36,170
now we got a dial we'd say okay it's

274
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,220
gonna cost more and power you know

275
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:40,250
because we got so many virtual machines

276
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:42,590
on standby waiting to go but we can

277
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:44,780
crank it down to 15 seconds that we keep

278
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:47,720
replacing these servers pretty cool

279
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:49,880
right so I kind of wonder though

280
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,620
one of the big challenges I've been

281
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,620
beating the drum on for probably close

282
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:57,200
to 20 years now is the internal security

283
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,520
problem and I actually when I go out I

284
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,580
ended up interacting with a lot of

285
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:04,490
developers and and end-users and

286
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:06,140
non-technical folks and I I've been

287
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,970
telling people for a while now that back

288
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,830
in the early 2000s a bunch of us got on

289
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,900
the security bus and it just kind of

290
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:14,450
kept going and a bunch of people didn't

291
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:16,850
get on the bus and really never have so

292
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:19,310
I feel like when I talk to people now

293
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:22,220
you're gonna 2019 the the misconceptions

294
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:24,229
around security are tremendous and I'm

295
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:27,920
wondering if like if we get to a point

296
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:29,210
where we act like you know on the inside

297
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,709
a lot of times we have this false sense

298
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:33,920
of security they go it's on the inside

299
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:36,440
so it's good so if we hit a point where

300
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,000
we actually get to zero trust networking

301
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,160
I'm wondering is that gonna make the

302
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,510
problem in that regard better or worse

303
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,770
because we are people gonna have an even

304
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:45,170
more sense of hires that's a false

305
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:47,060
insecurity than they do now or will we

306
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:48,890
actually be moving the needle there well

307
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:51,040
certainly you know if you think of I

308
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:52,330
like to think of most of the threats are

309
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,150
[Music]

310
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:58,880
consistent and continuous right so there

311
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:01,790
are just as many activists out there

312
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:05,090
today as there were back in 2000 when we

313
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:06,380
got into this and in there more of

314
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:08,480
course and they're defacing more and

315
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:10,010
more websites it's just that you know

316
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,500
the news doesn't report about them

317
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:14,480
because cybercrime came along and it's

318
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,980
layered on top you know all of them are

319
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,320
growing at some rate you know twenty

320
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:21,560
four percent a year or something in the

321
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,660
nation states came on board and DDoS

322
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,839
attacks always there so oh that's

323
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:28,730
growing but if you eliminate a lot of

324
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,840
those layers say all the cybercrime all

325
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:32,960
the outside hacker

326
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:35,330
then you down to the insiders who are

327
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,790
still sitting there and still as much of

328
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:40,070
a risk I call it when you look at a

329
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:43,160
security model you have to look at the

330
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:46,339
trust in in terse disease I can barely

331
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:50,000
say that word so look we're in your data

332
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:52,430
flows and in your models is only

333
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,730
protection that you trust the end-user

334
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:59,449
right and most every employer does this

335
00:13:55,730 --> 00:14:02,360
right I trust my end-users not to rob me

336
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:04,279
blind right I'm gonna now mind you you

337
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,500
see examples every time you go to a bank

338
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:08,600
you see a security camera looking over

339
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,100
the shoulders of the tellers and it's

340
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,690
kind of your perception that's there to

341
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,670
get the bank robber when they come in

342
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:16,220
right get a good picture of their ski

343
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:18,050
mask not at all it's to keep the tellers

344
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:21,200
honest so they know that they're being

345
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:24,260
videotaped constantly so and yet they

346
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:28,130
still steal from the tilt and that's the

347
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:30,200
kind of you have to you I'm not saying

348
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:32,720
distrust your employees I'm saying

349
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:35,300
remove those areas where you have to

350
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,180
trust them and you do that you know

351
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:40,010
through stronger authentication and you

352
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:43,239
know you look at probably my favorite

353
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:46,819
insider abuse case is Jerome Kerviel

354
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:49,160
with society a society General Bank

355
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:51,530
right during the financial crisis they

356
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,510
discover that here's a guy who came from

357
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:57,290
the back office where he was actually an

358
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:59,689
IT guy became a traitor and traded this

359
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:03,650
French Bank up into a 50 billion dollar

360
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:06,410
exposure and when they any he did it by

361
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:07,550
authorizing his own positions even

362
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:09,410
though he wasn't allowed to have more

363
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:11,660
than a billion in exposure at any one

364
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:13,550
day he would authorize all of his

365
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,069
positions by using somebody else's

366
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:19,400
password you know in the server room to

367
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:20,870
get in and you know just you just don't

368
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,660
do that right you don't have shared

369
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:26,600
passwords in a bank's operation so you

370
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:28,699
shouldn't but they did and he you know

371
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,459
cost them about forty five billion

372
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:33,260
dollars right when when the market could

373
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:36,560
least take it and that helped contribute

374
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:38,870
to the global financial crisis so you

375
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,030
look for those places where you trust

376
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:43,670
your employees or contractors or

377
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:46,180
suppliers and start taking the

378
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:50,930
trust part away so it's authenticated

379
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:52,969
verifiable monitored tracked etc so it

380
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:55,670
sounds like it actually couldn't

381
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:58,270
theoretically improve the situation if

382
00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:02,870
we've taken away the external things

383
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:05,180
then that's a good prediction we'll have

384
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:07,130
to talk about this another ten years in

385
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,630
don't forget you know the the

386
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,590
sophisticated text when we talk about

387
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:13,660
apts

388
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:17,570
in nation-states and all those gangs

389
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:20,180
invariably they get the credentials and

390
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:21,980
the capabilities of an insider before

391
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,890
they actually get to do a lot of really

392
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:27,380
bad damage right so in that sense a

393
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:31,060
insider threat and an outsider threat

394
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:31,060
actually coincide they're the same thing

395
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:36,949
speaking of predictions I was on policy

396
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:39,080
Dorian security weekly recently and he

397
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:41,210
reminded me that you had made the IDS

398
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,190
prediction back in the early 2000s about

399
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:46,250
90s kind of not being long for this

400
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:48,260
world now we obviously still have IDs

401
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:50,150
products but how do you how do you feel

402
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,860
your prediction is held up and how does

403
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:54,740
it play into kind of this new world

404
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:57,130
order of zero trust and which ideas

405
00:16:54,740 --> 00:17:03,170
product can you name

406
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:06,440
which one yeah name one why because the

407
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:09,040
industry is is gone right you know

408
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:11,900
nobody want police with an IDs product

409
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:15,079
the one that everybody uses is free and

410
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:22,460
open source snort right all the rest of

411
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:25,970
them yeah so yeah just like for data

412
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:28,820
erasure use Deeb and you know which is a

413
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:32,270
freeware thing that barely works anymore

414
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:34,970
cuz done work on solid-state stuff IDs

415
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:36,920
is you know yeah sure set it up but if

416
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:39,590
you're an IT manager and your team is

417
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:42,620
setting up IDs you better be staff to

418
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:44,570
monitor that 24 by 7 including holidays

419
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,229
and weekends back when I made that

420
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:49,939
prediction

421
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:51,800
I met the IDS ops team from Cisco and I

422
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:54,530
said how many people in your team and

423
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:56,210
the guy said well there's six wow that's

424
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:59,330
really hard to cover how

425
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:01,690
days in weekend's with six people 24/7

426
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:07,189
yeah you need a lot more than that and

427
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:09,740
Isis out we we don't watch our IDs in

428
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:12,230
the weekends or holidays in other words

429
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:14,840
they did what every single person does

430
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:17,390
who sets up tonight yes they blog

431
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,550
everything until the disk space gets

432
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:22,670
filled up and they buy more disk space

433
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:24,530
and and then finally somebody comes in

434
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:26,780
and says hey you know you're supposed to

435
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:29,690
be doing something with those logs if

436
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:32,000
you're ITIL or ISO compliant they're

437
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:33,350
trying to get certified oh gosh you know

438
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,820
we don't have the time for that so the

439
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:37,219
outsource it to a managed security

440
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:41,120
service provider who ignores the logs

441
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:44,840
for you for a pretty hefty fee so you

442
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:47,659
know what I mean IDs spawned a bunch of

443
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:51,470
businesses managed security services and

444
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:53,300
the sim industry so sim you know gives

445
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:56,710
you a place to collect and a place to

446
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:59,120
analyze your IDs logs but most people

447
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:00,650
deploy they've got it they can

448
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,159
demonstrate to the auditors that they

449
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:06,950
can create reports but obviously they

450
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,050
still get whacked in a big big way I

451
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:11,810
mean you look at remember sony Sony

452
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:14,180
Entertainment when they got whacked they

453
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:16,850
were in the process of pulling back

454
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:19,250
there's sim monitoring from a third

455
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:20,270
party and doing it internally and

456
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,920
they're about a third of the way through

457
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:25,190
that and then you know they got

458
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:30,020
completely owned and disrupted based on

459
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:33,200
attackers so sim doesn't help so I'm

460
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:37,040
still sticking to it I ran into somebody

461
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:40,760
at ours say a couple years ago and I was

462
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,960
in the W lounge there and he comes up to

463
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,700
me he pokes me on the chest you know

464
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,130
steam and when when you're dead they're

465
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:49,250
gonna put IDS's dead on your tombstone

466
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:53,120
and I said I said nope they're gonna put

467
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:57,050
steam in his dead on my tombstone which

468
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,159
will be true all right Richard well

469
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:00,050
we're definitely looking forward to

470
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,500
seeing you a keynote at source Boston

471
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:05,290
again coming up on May 1st to 3rd and

472
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:07,700
we'll be seeing you there so write that

473
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:11,470
conversation come on by a source yeah

474
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:11,470
come on bug great talk to you soon
