00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,740
hi this is Rob Sheen from the source

3
00:00:08,969 --> 00:00:12,719
conference and I'm here with Roxy D from

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,160
hurricane labs and she's going to be

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,349
speaking at the source Phoenix Mesa

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,900
conference that's being held on February

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:22,050
28th and March 1st so we're happy to

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:24,270
have her on the show so the topic of

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,950
your talk is unlocking the value of CVEs

10
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,870
which is really interesting because I

11
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,910
think a lot of people have a lot of

12
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,860
confusion around what the Seavey's are

13
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,390
and how you can use them so we're happy

14
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:37,999
to have someone that can shed some light

15
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:40,589
on that for us so so for the uninitiated

16
00:00:37,999 --> 00:00:45,030
what are the CV is it really high level

17
00:00:40,589 --> 00:00:46,589
like 20,000 feet yeah sure and first of

18
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,339
all thank you for having me at source

19
00:00:46,589 --> 00:00:54,149
conference I'm pretty excited so sea

20
00:00:50,339 --> 00:00:57,839
bees are what we use to gain information

21
00:00:54,149 --> 00:01:00,629
on what vulnerabilities are and they

22
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:03,149
will be numbered sometimes they'll even

23
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:05,250
be assigned or most of the time they'll

24
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,920
even be assigned before vulnerability is

25
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:11,520
released so there's always that CV

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:16,110
attached to it that you can go look up

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:19,469
and see the description and different

28
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:23,810
vectors which are what I'll get into in

29
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:25,979
my talk that kind of explained you know

30
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,840
the different aspects of the

31
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,929
vulnerability and whether or not it

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,899
might affect you or or your company I

33
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:36,439
should say awesome

34
00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:39,960
so you mentioned in your abstract that

35
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:41,490
CV user generally they look like kind of

36
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,520
like a giant mess for people that aren't

37
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,820
really familiar with them so what are

38
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,320
some of the challenges with organizing

39
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,689
them in a way that's reasonable and you

40
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,979
know what are people that are not kind

41
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:57,298
of the uninitiated what are they to do

42
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:59,969
to kind of get started yeah when I

43
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:05,789
started out information security I

44
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:08,100
wasn't familiar with CBE's and it kind

45
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:10,380
of there's a lot of words and a lot of

46
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,720
terminology that you may not immediately

47
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:15,290
be familiar with and sometimes the way

48
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,490
that the descriptions are written can be

49
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:23,040
a little confusing and I admit

50
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:25,320
years later it still takes me time to

51
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,780
like re read descriptions sometimes and

52
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:33,120
understand you know what exactly is

53
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:35,220
going on so I wanted to explain some key

54
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,530
words and some of the terminology to

55
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:40,440
help people kind of understand it a bit

56
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:43,200
more and how to use some of the other

57
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:50,100
data involved as well like the vectors

58
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:51,679
and the cbss score and what's the cbss

59
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:56,880
score for those that don't know

60
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:59,190
so the CSS score is a score that goes

61
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,650
along with the CVE and it's on a scale

62
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:05,430
of one to ten and it's kind of a best

63
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:06,900
guess for the severity of the

64
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,900
vulnerability

65
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:13,260
however there's many factors that go

66
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:17,070
into that score and sometimes you do

67
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:20,519
need to rescore it based on your your

68
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:24,269
own infrastructure and your own your own

69
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:26,520
threats awesome what do you see is kind

70
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:28,740
of the target market for the cv is it

71
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,330
security researchers is it developer is

72
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,770
it management or is it kind of all of

73
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:34,770
the above like what do you see most

74
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:39,390
using these things it would be mostly

75
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:44,430
infrastructure people we we do hear a

76
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:46,739
lot a lot of just go ahead and patch

77
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:50,670
like regardless you know patch

78
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:53,330
everything keep it up-to-date however

79
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:57,690
for people that are in infrastructure

80
00:03:53,330 --> 00:04:03,600
that are the engineers they need to be

81
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:06,480
able to prioritize patching and as well

82
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:09,209
as be able management needs to be able

83
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:13,859
to understand and communicate what the

84
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:15,480
priorities are as well so I would say it

85
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,910
would be great for both engineers and

86
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,640
management to understand and especially

87
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:25,980
because it takes a lot of the theater

88
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:29,010
out of out of vulnerabilities so that

89
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:32,100
management and you know infrastructure

90
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:33,190
engineers can react in you know a

91
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,700
focused and

92
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:39,070
and organized way yeah one of the things

93
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,450
I've always found useful with them is if

94
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:43,990
I'm trying to research a particular

95
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:46,450
issue like just a sequel injection if

96
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,550
you just google sequel injection you're

97
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:50,349
gonna get all kinds of information some

98
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,780
written by professionals much of it not

99
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,400
and so I've always found them to be

100
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,700
useful to be able to figure out all

101
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,870
right

102
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,940
the ones written by professionals

103
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,380
probably tact with the CVE and you're

104
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,210
gonna definitely get information about

105
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:04,750
you know the issue no matter what it's

106
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:06,820
called or labelled in the wild right and

107
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:09,610
and also with all of the media coverage

108
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:13,530
that vulnerabilities are getting right

109
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:17,410
now it's very easy to read an article

110
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:20,200
you know and and there may be some

111
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:22,690
inaccuracies or may just be difficult to

112
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:26,110
understand so whenever I hear about it

113
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:29,890
vulnerability I look for the CVE and I

114
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:34,320
look at the CVE before I start reading

115
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:36,990
the media coverage and that helps yeah

116
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:41,169
ya know I've definitely found that too

117
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:43,330
said there's some issues - like like

118
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:45,820
cross-site scripting you know some

119
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:49,599
people call it stored and reflected some

120
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:55,330
people call it you know where they call

121
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:57,100
it now drop losing the word it's the

122
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:01,539
word that I hate using so I've blocked

123
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:03,370
it out of my mind okay it's basically

124
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,830
the there's two different ways that

125
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,540
people refer to it and one of them

126
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,770
drives me crazy so I stopped using and I

127
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,570
said tell people to stop using but

128
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,919
people still refer to it so if you link

129
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:15,730
it with the CVE at least you can kind of

130
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:20,560
figure it out yeah it leaves a lot less

131
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:23,980
for interpretation right yep so all

132
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:27,100
right cool so for those that aren't

133
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:28,210
using them yet yeah you know is this

134
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,730
something that people would generally

135
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,930
use as part of a large organization or a

136
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:35,440
small organization or is this really

137
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:38,500
something for everybody I think most

138
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:44,880
organizations are using it in the form

139
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:46,990
of the scoring which they may not be

140
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,180
analyzing the score or

141
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:52,630
reassessing the score but most

142
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:54,310
vulnerability management programs it

143
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:58,960
would be easiest to just pull in the

144
00:06:54,310 --> 00:07:02,620
cbss score however I think in order to

145
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:07,900
analyze and understand and prioritize

146
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:11,500
and have a really really good

147
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:13,539
vulnerability management program you do

148
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,180
need to consider the other vectors as

149
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:20,140
well which describe other aspects of the

150
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:26,190
vulnerability what are some examples of

151
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:30,099
other vectors so for example there's one

152
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:33,160
that indicates the level of access the

153
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:35,440
attacker must have in order to exploit

154
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,540
the vulnerability and this could be

155
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,540
useful if you have mitigating factors or

156
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:42,430
if you have things that may restrict

157
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,690
that access already so you can

158
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:49,180
prioritize that a bit differently than

159
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:51,130
one that you know would require you know

160
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:53,410
the one that could be exploited with

161
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:54,850
remote access got it

162
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,380
and I just popped into my head

163
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:58,960
persistent and non-persistent was the

164
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,760
word I was looking for oh right

165
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,780
sometimes they call it persistent not

166
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,039
persistent sometimes they call it

167
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,570
reflected in stored I actually think

168
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,930
reflected and stored is more clear to

169
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:09,280
developers who I teach a lot of and if

170
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,990
you say persistent not persistent

171
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,750
sometimes people don't know what that

172
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,670
means exactly so anyway that's just by

173
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,170
tagging it with the CVE you kind of know

174
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:20,320
oh that's what they're talking about you

175
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:24,370
can read about it makes sense it bugs me

176
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:26,590
when things the way we word things and

177
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:29,230
and you know words mean different things

178
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:31,419
to different people those can both you

179
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:33,760
know affect our interpretation right

180
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,590
absolutely absolutely

181
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,880
so look at definite looking forward to

182
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,950
the talk I love talks that kind of shed

183
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,480
light on things that we sometimes take

184
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,680
for granted in the security community if

185
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,940
we've been using it every day and we

186
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,180
don't realize that you know I always

187
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:48,490
tell people you know 15 10 15 years ago

188
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,959
the security bus left the station and

189
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:51,460
took off and a lot of people have been

190
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,380
you know following along and every once

191
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,700
in a while the bus breaks down and we

192
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,200
got to replace the tires and whatever

193
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,460
else but we're still on the bus but

194
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,880
there's a lot of people who never got on

195
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,910
the bus

196
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,470
so it basically things that levels

197
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:04,209
for them and help them understand the

198
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:06,310
tools that we use on a day-to-day basis

199
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:09,160
are great so I'm happy to have you speak

200
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:11,800
at the conference on this I'm so excited

201
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:14,980
I've been wanting to address this issue

202
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:17,020
for a while because I myself had to go

203
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,670
through and look at the vectors and I'm

204
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:21,640
just really excited to share it to

205
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:25,300
hopefully take away some of the fear

206
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:28,180
when it comes to vulnerabilities awesome

207
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:30,490
taking away the fears good all right

208
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:33,189
cool well we'll see you at the source

209
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:37,270
Mesa Phoenix conference on February 28th

210
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:38,740
and March first and for those listening

211

along if you want to continue the

212
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,090
conversation about CVEs or anything else

213
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:47,130
on security we're going to have a great

214
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:50,940
group of people there join us in Phoenix

215
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:50,939
thanks thank you
