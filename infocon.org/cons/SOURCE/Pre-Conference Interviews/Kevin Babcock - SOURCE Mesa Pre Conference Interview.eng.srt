1
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,600
hi this is rob machine with the source

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,969
conference and I'm here today with Kevin

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,850
Babcock who is a principal security

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:17,380
engineer at pager duty and he's going to

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:19,689
be speaking at the Phoenix Mesa

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:22,290
conference coming up on February 28th

7
00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:24,610
and March first and his topic is

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:26,349
starting a career in cybersecurity which

9
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:29,380
is great so we're actually gonna be

10
00:00:26,349 --> 00:00:30,669
doing a mini career track at at the

11
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,190
Phoenix Mesa events that's gonna be cool

12
00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:38,289
so uh why don't you start just tell us a

13
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:40,420
little about your talk or I am talking

14
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:43,149
as you said about starting a career in

15
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:45,219
cybersecurity and I have found that at

16
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:47,440
cybersecurity is an excellent place for

17
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:50,559
a career I've been doing it for nearly

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,989
20 years and I ended up following it

19
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:57,039
into it by accident and have really

20
00:00:52,989 --> 00:01:00,489
enjoyed working in the area and I have

21
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,710
found that one of the big challenges we

22
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:07,000
are having today is that there's a real

23
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:09,880
shortage of people with the well with

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,950
the experience to work in the field and

25
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,679
I'm hoping that by sharing some of my

26
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:18,040
experiences and some of the pathways

27
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:20,170
that you can take to move from adjacent

28
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,720
fields into cybersecurity

29
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:24,190
we'll be able to help address that

30
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,140
shortage of workers in the field and

31
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:28,750
therefore be able to better protect our

32
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:31,330
systems and our people great

33
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:33,670
what do you see as some examples of some

34
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,929
adjacent fields they could be easy to

35
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,840
transition into security there's a

36
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:39,670
number of areas if I look at what skills

37
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,250
I need to have that are most important

38
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:45,240
to my job every day a lot of people

39
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:49,210
would assume immediately that technology

40
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:51,759
development programming are key skills

41
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:54,009
and well that's correct I would say that

42
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,800
actually working with technology is only

43
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:58,990
about 30% of my job it turns out that

44
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,830
the vast majority and the most important

45
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:05,560
parts of doing cybersecurity are often

46
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:08,280
more I guess you'd call them soft skills

47
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:11,620
things like communication negotiation

48
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:14,080
being able to work with people and come

49
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,880
to an understanding of the kinds of

50
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,770
approaches that you would take to solve

51
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,940
a problem and I think that though

52
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:22,550
skills are something that you can

53
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:25,070
develop in all kinds of different jobs

54
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,500
it doesn't have to be a technology job

55
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:30,709
it doesn't have to be a security job

56
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:33,680
though things like well software

57
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:35,710
development you could move into security

58
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,460
from and that is a technical skill but

59
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:41,690
something like an auditor position is

60
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:44,690
somewhat technical but it is really

61
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:46,850
involved more in looking at data and

62
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:50,320
working with people to understand their

63
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:53,090
processes and those kinds of rules are

64
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:56,359
really natural to go into a

65
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:58,970
cybersecurity I could see people coming

66
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,530
from a maybe a legal or a paralegal

67
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,870
background where you've got those really

68
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:05,840
strong analytical skills and excellent

69
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:08,180
written and verbal communication those

70
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,490
kinds of skills and experience would be

71
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:13,760
extraordinarily valuable in being able

72
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:15,380
to do cybersecurity work right we could

73
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,649
certainly use some better writers in our

74
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:20,030
field that's for sure we actually are

75
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,880
gonna have somebody that the conference

76
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:24,650
also who is an expert in writing and

77
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,240
gonna be doing something called the

78
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:31,010
style guide for security so that's gonna

79
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:32,750
be cool so here's here's the big

80
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:34,060
controversial question when we're

81
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,470
talking about career development

82
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,550
this one's been you know beaten to death

83
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,450
over the years but I always just like to

84
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,620
throw it out there and get people's

85
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:44,799
opinions certifications yes or no should

86
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:50,420
people get certifications and which ones

87
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:52,130
if so it depends so I am a certified

88
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:56,089
information systems security

89
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:58,850
professional and I got certified back at

90
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:01,520
the beginning of my career because I saw

91
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:03,560
it as a way to learn more about the

92
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,709
profession there are certain

93
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:09,740
certifications that can you know they

94
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:13,490
catch the eye they will get your foot in

95
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:16,579
the door but it's really the the skills

96
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:18,859
and the abilities that you have that

97
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:20,238
will enable you to do the job and so I

98
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:25,190
would say there are certain

99
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:27,979
certifications that are better regarded

100
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:30,830
and and may be in demand and there are

101
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:32,688
other certifications where you know

102
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,248
you're probably just putting

103
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:37,039
and money into something that doesn't

104
00:04:34,249 --> 00:04:39,019
provide provide a lot of value in terms

105
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:41,089
of what you learn

106
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:44,599
going through the certification I have

107
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:48,219
found that the the on-the-job experience

108
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:51,860
is much more valuable than any kind of

109
00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:53,509
preparation class or study guide or

110
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:57,349
anything like that that you might go

111
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:58,759
through right right yeah when we were

112
00:04:57,349 --> 00:05:01,519
putting together the little mini career

113
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:02,689
development track somebody asked about

114
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:04,399
you know maybe doing a talk on

115
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:05,599
certifications or whether or not people

116
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:07,579
that are new to the field should get

117
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:08,869
them and I was like well we don't need a

118
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:10,279
talk for that because if you're new to

119
00:05:08,869 --> 00:05:11,360
the field of course you need to get them

120
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:14,058
because you got to get past the

121
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,509
checklist on that the recruiters have so

122
00:05:14,059 --> 00:05:19,069
you know that seems to become a no

123
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:21,349
brainer but so that that kind of leads

124
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:23,599
on my next question which is how do

125
00:05:21,349 --> 00:05:26,688
people with you know limited experience

126
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:28,429
in security or even a little bit of

127
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:29,929
experience but just you know maybe not

128
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:34,068
all the checkpoints how do they get past

129
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:36,318
those those checklists driven hiring

130
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:40,219
managers where they're looking for all

131
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:42,769
the buzz word resume well I will look at

132
00:05:40,219 --> 00:05:45,349
myself as an example I did not start my

133
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:47,360
career in cybersecurity and in fact when

134
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:49,759
I was starting out they weren't even

135
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,249
teaching classes and in university or in

136
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:55,069
college because it just hadn't become an

137
00:05:52,249 --> 00:05:59,179
important field yet and I learned by

138
00:05:55,069 --> 00:06:01,399
doing work as a software engineer and I

139
00:05:59,179 --> 00:06:03,768
started working on security related

140
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:06,349
projects and found it to be really

141
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:08,719
fascinating so I intentionally went to

142
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:11,779
learn more about it and by doing work

143
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:13,939
that was related to security or security

144
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:16,999
work that I could do in my current job I

145
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:18,739
started to build up a portfolio of

146
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:21,319
expertise that I could talk about and

147
00:06:18,739 --> 00:06:22,698
this is what I would recommend to anyone

148
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:25,699
who's interested in moving into the

149
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:27,979
field is look for places in your current

150
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:32,679
job where you can start doing work that

151
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:35,599
relates to or is specifically in

152
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:37,938
cybersecurity and as you start to build

153
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:40,789
up that experience you will be able to

154
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:43,309
honestly represent yourself as having

155
00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:46,128
knowledge and skills in the area and at

156
00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:46,430
some point you'll be at the tipping

157
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:49,430
point

158
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:51,140
where you'll have enough that you can

159
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:54,890
represent yourself as someone who isn't

160
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:57,409
just a person on the outside but a

161
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:59,599
person who has the capabilities to

162
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:02,270
actually perform and when we look at the

163
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,180
statistics it's been posted that there

164
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:07,310
is zero percent unemployment in

165
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:09,640
cybersecurity there's a research survey

166
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:13,940
that says there will be a 1.5 million

167
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:15,890
job shortage by 2019 there's a lot of

168
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:18,530
pressure on the hiring side to pull in

169
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:21,140
people who have the ability and the

170
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:22,820
interest to do these jobs and there's

171
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,789
not going to be a lot of friction you

172
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,930
are interesting right right I think

173
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,520
that's great advice for anybody that

174
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:30,350
wants to pivot into any careers start

175
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,780
doing the job you want to be paid for

176
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:34,280
before you are getting paid for it and

177
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,349
then eventually you build up enough of

178
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,599
experience you know you can totally

179
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:41,180
design the resume you need if you're

180
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,710
thoughtful about it it just might take a

181
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,260
little bit of time to get you there so

182
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:47,630
that's cool sorry one last thing you

183
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,430
mentioned in your abstract NIST's nice

184
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:52,250
security a cyber security workforce

185
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:53,180
framework how does that just at a high

186
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,880
level cuz I know you're gonna talk about

187
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:58,570
it in your talk but at a high level how

188
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:01,909
does that help you map to a career path

189
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:05,210
yeah well NIST is the National Institute

190
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:07,430
of Standards and Technology and they put

191
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:09,380
together a framework that you related to

192
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:11,660
the nice cybersecurity framework that

193
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:14,330
actually maps out all the different

194
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:16,490
kinds of cybersecurity work that people

195
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:19,310
are doing in different industries and

196
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:21,830
they've created this standard taxonomy

197
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:24,410
that talks about here's the kind of work

198
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:26,900
that needs to be done regardless of what

199
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:30,350
the particular job title might be and so

200
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:33,409
it's a nicely broken down way of looking

201
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:35,390
at what jobs are out there and then what

202
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:37,459
skills are required to be successful in

203
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:39,890
those jobs I'm going to talk about this

204
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:43,270
framework in my talk and I also am going

205
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:45,710
to pull in some information that I have

206
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:48,199
collected through interviews and surveys

207
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:50,270
with hiring managers in the cyber

208
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,580
security field to highlight really what

209
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:54,260
of those skills and jobs they're looking

210
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,350
for when they're trying to bring someone

211
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,590
into a position they have on the team

212
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,850
awesome

213
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,990
awesome so this will be great for

214
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,089
anybody that's looking

215
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:04,459
for you know making the transition into

216
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:05,480
cybersecurity or just you know starting

217
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:06,770
from wherever they're at and getting to

218
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,470
the next level so I think this would be

219
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:11,029
a good talk to people so so great thanks

220
