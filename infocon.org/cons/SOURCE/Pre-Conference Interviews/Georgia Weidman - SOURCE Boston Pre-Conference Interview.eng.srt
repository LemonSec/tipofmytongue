security startup founders which is

10
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:29,769
something I definitely like talking

11
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:31,710
about so as somebody who's founded a

12
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:34,809
number of companies myself I definitely

13
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:38,589
appreciate having founders on on the

14
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:40,959
show how did you get started starting

15
00:00:38,589 --> 00:00:42,309
companies how did you decide let's let's

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,180
start a company rather than let's just

17
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:50,290
go get a job well actually I got a DARPA

18
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:56,290
cyber fast track grant in 2012 and that

19
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:58,659
was a great program from the paperwork

20
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:01,869
for a lot of the usual government stuff

21
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:03,369
and I had totally planned on keeping my

22
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:05,199
job and just doing it you know it's

23
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:07,900
research to comprehend something like

24
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,300
things like that but then you know my

25
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,790
job fired me about it basically they

26
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:17,620
wanted put their name and get the money

27
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:20,820
and I was like no no so I kind of was

28
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:23,650
forced out of the nest if you will and

29
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,960
then I did you know consulting because

30
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:28,210
I've been a penetration tester as a job

31
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,649
and I did training and generally

32
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:32,619
anything that didn't involve like

33
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:35,200
touching insects to make money you know

34
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:37,540
as one does and you know after doing

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,670
that for a little bit I you know I had

36
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:41,740
done the DARPA work and had continued to

37
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,240
do research and wanting I wanted to

38
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,490
productize it you know it was a good

39
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,560
hacker tool but wanted to you know make

40
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:51,009
it into you know product I stuff that

41
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,290
enterprises would buy so I came to the

42
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:56,680
Mach 37 accelerator in Northern Virginia

43
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:58,750
and you know they were specialized in

44
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,370
taking you know really technical people

45
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,470
like me that maybe didn't have the best

46
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:04,840
business sense ever and helping them

47
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:06,640
along that route so going from you know

48
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,220
the little consulting business to you

49
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,840
know the product business so constantly

50
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,760
learning but you know it's always just

51
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,840
been like well I think I'll go do this

52
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:19,630
today not really some master plan right

53
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,360
so that shift from so you

54
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:24,430
you have some jobs before you worked at

55
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,810
a start-up so what was that initial I

56
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,630
mean it sounds like you kind of got a

57
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,920
nudge instead of you know having it be

58
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,630
you know a complete leap of faith but

59
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,989
what was that kind of transition like

60
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:36,090
going from having a job to suddenly now

61
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:38,740
you're on your own doing your own thing

62
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:41,680
well it was really stressful

63
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:43,450
I actually naturally I mean people think

64
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,600
that it's a lot easier to work for

65
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:48,670
yourself but I work much much harder you

66
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,070
know and I had a job you know it was

67
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:54,700
like okay get your work done III played

68
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:57,609
a lot of Halo now I don't even know

69
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:59,799
where my game consoles are so I mean it

70
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,060
was and on top of that it was things

71
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,660
that you know I never had to think about

72
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:07,510
like you know what are these like weird

73
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:10,660
text documents for LLC's and now for you

74
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:12,640
know ste corpse and Delaware and you

75
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,410
know getting registration paper you know

76
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,700
I'm always getting nasty grams from like

77
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,079
the state of Virginia being like you

78
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,799
didn't pay this sounds like well I

79
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,810
didn't know I had to so yeah I mean it's

80
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,670
a lot of different stuff that as a

81
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,490
technical person you know I didn't

82
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:29,200
really know anything about so I've had

83
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,850
to learn you know a lot of different

84
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:36,339
things

85
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:38,109
hmm so so along those lines like have

86
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,740
you found it now that you've kind of

87
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:42,970
made that transition you know I noticed

88
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,710
you've you've been actually you've been

89
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,359
you basically in c-level positions now

90
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:49,900
for the last couple things you've been a

91
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:52,450
CEO a CTO I mean would you ever go back

92
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:55,950
to a job at this point absolutely I

93
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:58,450
would I you know I actually have done

94
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:01,030
just very recently in the last few

95
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:04,299
months have it's been a real coup for my

96
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:07,050
company gotten some some really big like

97
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:10,480
non reoccurring revenue like research

98
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:12,040
projects for my for my product you know

99
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,320
they were wanting additional features

100
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,940
and you know having to really dig in

101
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,829
back into the research which was you

102
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,170
know how I got started that's how I you

103
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:21,969
know fell in love with Infotech so you

104
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,680
know and it was really hard because it's

105
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,540
like while I've you know continued to

106
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,650
develop my technical skills it's just

107
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,140
like you know I've been doing all these

108
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:33,008
other things as well and I was like yeah

109
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:34,628
I really miss like research and

110
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:37,569
speaking of conferences all the time we

111
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:40,150
say that less now and you know a lot of

112
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:42,309
things that you know I really like

113
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:45,369
better say than going to meetings with

114
00:04:42,309 --> 00:04:48,729
venture capitalists kind of get pushed

115
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:50,469
out so I mean I'm definitely 100% you

116
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:54,460
know shabbir is what I'm doing right now

117
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:57,460
but you know after exit or you know when

118
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:59,649
when that comes to its fruition I could

119
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,568
totally see myself you know either you

120
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:03,699
know the people who acquire us or you

121
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:05,889
know what have you being you know in a

122
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:08,620
research position and you know doing

123
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:11,589
conference talks on research and more

124
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:13,839
you know the PR thing so yeah I could

125
00:05:11,589 --> 00:05:15,669
definitely see doing again as well s you

126
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:18,339
know I still do pen testing on the side

127
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:21,399
I'm you know keep the bills paid these

128
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:24,279
products are expensive so I mean I could

129
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:29,709
definitely see doing that again I miss

130
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:31,240
it alright cool what advice would you

131
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:37,349
give to someone who is considering

132
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:41,439
starting their own company really I

133
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:43,569
think that I mean the thing that you

134
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,309
know as a technical person I think you

135
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:46,979
know I hate to bring up the woman thing

136
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:49,330
because it was you know such a divisive

137
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:51,639
topic right now but you know especially

138
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:53,919
being you know a technical female it was

139
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:56,409
you know almost a badge of honor to be

140
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,748
like bad at social skills it's like you

141
00:05:56,409 --> 00:06:01,058
know I'm really technical not really

142
00:05:58,749 --> 00:06:04,240
good at the people stuff sales marketing

143
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:06,550
all that of the lesser mortals which is

144
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,769
you know having gotten out of that

145
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:11,050
little bubble of you know technical

146
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:12,909
people and into the real world you know

147
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:16,120
II realize that's a complete nonsense

148
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:18,519
like yeah I know this you can have a

149
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,830
really great product really great idea

150
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:22,659
really great everything thing works it

151
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:25,120
can really solve a problem but you know

152
00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:27,669
if you can't communicate that like with

153
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,740
actual people who are not as technical

154
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:31,209
as you you're not gonna be able to sell

155
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,839
any and if you're not gonna be able to

156
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:34,930
sell anything

157
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:37,240
you're gonna go out of business so I

158
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:39,009
mean I think that I mean at least if you

159
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,930
were you know someone who's thinking of

160
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:43,240
it coming from you know that same you

161
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:45,219
know technical black at DEFCON kind of a

162
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,930
background I would definitely be like

163
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:49,750
you know check your ego

164
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:51,820
the door because those things that you

165
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,009
almost are proud of not being good at or

166
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,210

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:09,940
fill in the gaps you know you check your

173
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:14,860
ego at the door is probably probably

174
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:16,419
pretty good advice I would say so what

175
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:19,650
has been kind of the most rewarding

176
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:23,198
thing for you about starting companies

177
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:27,400

178
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:29,830
just you know seeing you know my dreams

and ideas like you know come to fruition

180
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:34,150
you know it's like I still you know when

181
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:36,990
I look at my product when we're doing a

182
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:41,020
demo or something I still kind of like

183
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:44,440
surprises like all this some idea I had

184
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:47,440
one day so I mean that's really exciting

185
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,210
as well as you know being able to to

186
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,150

187
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:53,830
industry go from you knows again I kind

188
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:56,349
of came from you know very hard core

189
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:58,840
research conference you know that was my

190
00:07:56,349 --> 00:08:01,030
tribe if you will and it was you know

191
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,669
other pen testers were using my stuff

192
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:06,159
but you know it wasn't necessarily being

193
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:09,280
used you know to help an enterprise or

194
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:11,260
save the world if you will and you know

195
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,750
now having that opportunity where you

196
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,699
know big enterprises are you know using

197
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,849
my stuff to make you know their

198
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:21,070
enterprises more secure I mean that's

199
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:24,370
mind blowing doing that I've been able

200
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:26,889
to have that sort of impact well that's

201
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:28,570
awesome yeah that's that's definitely a

202
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:30,280
theme I've seen with other people I know

203
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:32,529
that start companies is that idea that

204
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,598
you can kind of manifest something from

205
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:36,939
nothing just by oh I have this idea and

206
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:39,820
then you sent your fingers and well and

207
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:41,650
then a lot of work but then you

208
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,479
basically build the team and you build

209
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:45,069
the the ID you know the whole mechanisms

210
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:46,270
around it to make it you know come to

211
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,650
market and all that stuff and then you

212
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,060
have this thing that's out in the world

213
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:52,569
