1
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,340
hi this is rob machine with a source

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,620
conference and I'm here with Bob Adams

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,780
who's the product marketing manager for

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,610
security at mime cast so he's going to

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,789
be speaking at source Boston on May 9th

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,550
and 10th and the title of his talk is

7
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,140
the Nigerian prince has been dethroned

8
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:24,660
but email remains King which is an

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,430
awesome title so I think I know what

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,070
you're alluding to there the whole

11
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:33,000
Nigerian email scam so how is that

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,770
Nigerian prince been dethroned so you

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,510
know the attack you know you'll still

14
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,700
see it people will probably still fall

15
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,800
for it but it's really evolved what we

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,480
really see is that attackers you know

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,578
saw that tactic as something that they

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,319
could use in the early days of email but

19
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,390
now that people have become smarter more

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,850
technologically advanced they've had to

21
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,289
kind of develop their tactics so the

22
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,660
people that still try to pull off that

23
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,910
scam they're you know back in the early

24
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,050
90s whereas we're looking towards you

25
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,578
know the future in terms of what

26
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,819
attackers could actually find and then

27
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,760
using these attacks right so how have

28
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,049
some of these attacks evolved like what

29
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,820
because I'm sure they've gotten a lot

30
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:11,970
more sophisticated in some cases what

31
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,130
are some examples so the key thing is

32
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,200
you know this is a lot of malware and

33
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,899
viruses and things of that sort but I

34
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,700
look at kind of the the social aspect of

35
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,860
because social engineering is really

36
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,780
what's becoming popular you know it's a

37
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,759
lot of it's a lot easier to manipulate a

38
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,340
conversation and trick people to do

39
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:32,430
things rather than say code a new virus

40
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,590
to try to break in to say firewall what

41
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,509
have you our network it's much easier to

42
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,450
just spin up different ways to actually

43
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:41,159
manipulate somebody to send money or get

44
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,720
their pad give their passwords up and

45
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,280
then from that standpoint I don't need

46
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,740
the user anymore I can take control

47
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,170
myself so it's really evolved in terms

48
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,298
of you know it's especially the

49
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,090
multi-pronged attacks you know it's not

50
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,560
just you know one attack it's multiple

51
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,210
different things coming at you at one

52
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,229
say you really need to defend against

53
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,969
hmm interesting so as far as dealing

54
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:07,920
with this should we be primarily focused

55
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:12,170
on blocking the issues or detecting them

56
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,970
and you know why don't we start there

57
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,309
I always look at I kind of you know you

58
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,930
obviously want protection but protection

59
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,340
is just part of it it's the training

60
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,590
aspect that you really need to take

61
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:25,580
advantage of because so many times we

62
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:27,440
just say stop to a user into a regular

63
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,750
user that that doesn't teach me anything

64
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,550
I'm just being told I can't do it what

65
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,200
you'll have is a user call the admin

66
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,910
saying I've been trying to get here I

67
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,549
clicked on this link six times I'm being

68
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:39,620
blocked that's that's kind of the idea

69
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:42,230
so what we need to do is take advantage

70
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,269
of these teachable moments so yeah you

71
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:45,768
can block it you can detect it but what

72
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:48,530
you need to do is then translate that

73
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:50,330
into kind of the next phase in terms oh

74
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,709
okay now I need to cascade this down to

75
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,450
my environment so they can understand

76
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:55,459
you know what happened why it's

77
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:58,548
happening and you know if it happens

78
00:02:55,459 --> 00:03:00,019
again maybe bypasses X detection they

79
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:03,799
could be that last line of defense to

80
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:07,400
protect you right that makes sense but

81
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:09,230
just one of the the things I hear from

82
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,180
people and I've asked a few people just

83
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,530
recently say you're just kind of the

84
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,299
latest in the line so I'm just kind of

85
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,120
going down and seeing who everybody's I

86
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:18,769
want everybody's opinion on this one so

87
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,170
can end users actually be trained for

88
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:23,060
this stuff because what I hear often is

89
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:25,399
like some of them can but some of them

90
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:28,519
can't and because some of them can't you

91
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,690
know you only need one right so is this

92
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:32,989
whole exercise and training people

93
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:34,820
futile it's not and I'll tell you

94
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:36,859
exactly why because you can look at you

95
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,870
know every different organizations you

96
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:40,970
know you know we're friends with you

97
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,200
know fish me there now rebranded a co

98
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,420
fence and there's other companies like

99
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,828
no before and you know their whole

100
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,328
business is e security awareness

101
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:49,340
training and it's very important because

102
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:52,070
when you first deploy those trainings

103
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:54,350
you'll see a massive amount of failure

104
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:56,239
rates you'll never get down to a zero

105
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:58,880
percent failure rate but what you can't

106
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,160
do is drastically reduce that I want to

107
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:03,769
say it was I want to say 2016 Verizon

108
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,510
data breach report the average you know

109
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:07,100
failure rate was about thirty percent of

110
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,149
users were opening and clicking on

111
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,400
phishing links which is a high

112
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:13,100
percentage but if you can drop that down

113
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,340
to 15 or maybe it's hard but under even

114
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:18,529
10 percent you now no longer at a 30 to

115
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:20,899
70 percent in failure e what you can see

116
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:23,330
when you start from so you know it's not

117
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:25,789
futile it's kind of like you know you

118
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,440
create documentation for your users

119
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,880
that offsets some of your helpdesk

120
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,260
tickets but your users are still gonna

121
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,060
call you does that mean you don't create

122
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:34,730
documentation absolutely not

123
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,150
it's trying to do your best ahead you

124
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:38,000
know

125
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:39,080
solving an uphill battle right yeah I

126
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,440
mean I've always kind of seen it as a

127
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,060
necessary layer just you know you get it

128
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,250
to the degree you can get it and you're

129
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,510
good and then you know the things that

130
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,340
still slip through you find other ways

131
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,930
to deal with those things and just kind

132
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:54,979
of making the problem a little bit more

133
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:57,350
manageable that's hi and Masha Sedova

134
00:04:54,980 --> 00:05:00,200
who is on the the podcast recently her

135
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:03,740
take was that let having some of the

136
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:06,140
users you know be aware of it allows at

137
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,910
least one person to notice and report it

138
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:10,070
that way you can help train your

139
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:12,890
internal systems that that was a really

140
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,849
interesting one that I think is probably

141
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:16,090
one of the more important reasons

142
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:18,530
actually now that I heard her say it I

143
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:20,210
mean it that is true and one of the

144
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:23,239
things I love that on mine cast has is

145
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,979
user awareness so if I were say a

146
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,080
problem user it learns from each user

147
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:28,430
and I'm say that use that just

148
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,260
constantly clicks on things I'm not

149
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,390
supposed to what you actually can be

150
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:34,250
prompted with is information about the

151
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,690
email about the link and then you're

152
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,880
actually given an option which I like

153
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:40,040
it's you know it's safe it's harmful and

154
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,719
if I'm that user that know it's safe and

155
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,490
I can click it's safe I'm actually

156
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,460
brought to another page it tells me it's

157
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:48,350
bad tells me why in the back end my

158
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,299
favorite part is logged an admin could

159
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:52,370
actually see Bob Adams click this link

160
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,080
Bob was given a choice and he made the

161
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,550
wrong choice and now looking

162
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,219
historically he's made that wrong choice

163
00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:00,190
twelve times this month so it also helps

164
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:03,080
really identify those problem users

165
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:04,790
right I'm just imagining the Microsoft

166
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,109
Clippy popping up and saying hey I've

167
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:10,940
noticed that you like to click on email

168
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:12,440
attachments we actually toyed with doing

169
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,180
a joke campaign about something like

170
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,040
that because everyone remembers Clippy

171
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:21,260
as as much fun as he was it drove

172
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:24,470
everyone nuts it was a funny point in

173
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:27,110
time so overall do you think we've

174
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,810
gotten better or do you think we're kind

175
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:31,850
of just running on the treadmill here

176
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,900
this stuff you know I live I like to

177
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,610
think we're getting better we have

178
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,010
people that are definitely getting

179
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:39,230
better we still have the the users that

180
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,620
are still kind of oblivious to a lot of

181
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,600
things

182
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,610
but it's a matter of the technology

183
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,950
that's being used to stop the attacks

184
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:47,900
cuz you know from my standpoint we look

185
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:50,300
at a lot of different studies people

186
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,650
don't realize it's well over ninety

187
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,010
percent of attacks start with an email

188
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:56,390
people are you know inherently trusting

189
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,190
well I got an email you know it's like

190
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:00,890
someone sent me a package I'm gonna open

191
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:03,020
this or a Microsoft wants me to reset my

192
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:04,640
password so we're getting better at

193
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,950
teaching users what to look out for

194
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,330
especially thankfully while we don't

195
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:10,280
have the nigerian prince as much anymore

196
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:13,099
we still have the bad Microsoft Tech

197
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,750
Support caller so it's being reported on

198
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,150
a lot more as a lot more visibility so

199
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:19,400
people are becoming more suspicious so I

200
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:21,650
definitely say the oh we're getting more

201
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,479
towards in the favor of the users what

202
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,820
attackers are still getting smarter I

203
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,530
mean there's four key pillars I always

204
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,630
look at there are really driving the

205
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,140
success factor its simplicity

206
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:34,130
credibility psychology and urgency

207
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:36,560
attackers are sending simple emails

208
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:38,120
using credible information using

209
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,640
psychological tricks whether it's a

210
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,800
executive to a lower ranking person or a

211
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,510
government authority to just a general

212
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,490
you know citizen and they're always

213
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:48,710
urgent do it now or there will be

214
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:50,870
consequences so when you can find those

215
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:53,299
four elements that's really what's

216
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:55,070
taking into a perfect storm to make a

217
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,200
user fall for something but or just a

218
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,550
general person but thankfully we still

219
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,840
do have the people that are becoming

220
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:02,570
more and more suspicious whether

221
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,460
actually stopping before they do it so

222
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:06,050
it's not as prevalent but we will

223
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,750
continue to have a back-and-forth battle

224
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:13,250
for sure

225
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:14,210
actually so in your talk itself I think

226
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,180
I heard you're going to give some

227
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:18,849
examples and we have really kind of

228
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,230
real-world things people are doing now

229
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:22,730
yeah without giving too much away

230
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:25,340
actually give an example of a perfect

231
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:28,520
spear phishing attack I got it actually

232
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:30,380
involves social media involves actually

233
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,530
you know different countries different

234
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:35,990
you know compromised accounts so it was

235
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:38,390
literally a perfect storm where nothing

236
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:40,820
actually could have stopped it it was me

237
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:43,159
being a smart user that actually stopped

238
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,360
it I mean if I had tried to go through

239
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,790
with it you know I would have been

240
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,650
blocked but to me did it for her to

241
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,780
actually get to the point to get to me

242
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:52,939
was really impressive where I was kind

243
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,329
of like I almost want to respond to find

244
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,610
out who

245
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:57,469
that was pretty good so I give some

246
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:59,509
examples like that and then just some of

247
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,759
the general examples and why they're

248
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:03,439
working but then also I like to

249
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:05,869
highlight some of the other tactics you

250
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:07,248
know some things I mentioned but really

251
00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:10,129
some of the other simple things that

252
00:09:07,249 --> 00:09:13,160
actually work like I a real-life example

253
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:16,549
where the signature was just president

254
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:18,139
in all caps and someone fell for it so

255
00:09:16,549 --> 00:09:20,239
it's a little bit of simple stuff you

256
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:21,439
know I like to talk about you know you

257
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:22,879
know something for people will be

258
00:09:21,439 --> 00:09:24,559
sitting there yeah yeah what else you

259
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,910
gonna tell me you kind of set the stage

260
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:27,679
and then bring it to the point where

261
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:29,929
it's like okay bring a full circle and

262
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:31,519
really just hope people think about you

263
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:33,040
know these attacks and the way they work

264
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,179
in a different way

265
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,730
awesome well it sounds like you're

266
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:39,889
