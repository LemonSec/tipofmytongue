00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,219
hi this is Rob Sheen from the source

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,200
conference and I'm here with Harry

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,150
spurred love who was the CTO of edgewise

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,520
networks and he's going to be doing a

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:22,009
talk at source Austin on December 5th

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,730
and six the Tyla talk is from zero to

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:28,220
hero zero trust networking distilled so

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:30,500
for those that are uninitiated in zero

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,880
trust networking Harry um could you give

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,360
us kind of the 30 second elevator pitch

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:37,339
on what zero trust networking is sure it

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,080
actually was a term started by a forest

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,699
or 10 years ago so we're at the 10-year

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,230
anniversary of zero trust networking but

16
00:00:40,699 --> 00:00:44,180
only in the recently has it caught on

17
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:46,550
and basically if you think about the way

18
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,200
we've done networking for thirty years

19
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,709
it's always been a matter of trust but

20
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,890
verify

21
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:54,230
so now zero trust is a way of looking at

22
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:56,000
things and saying perimeters addresses

23
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,709
the types of things that we use to make

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,019
those decisions on no longer make sense

25
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:02,989
and we should move to a model where we

26
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:04,850
never trust but always verify so in its

27
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:06,590
essence it's about doing network

28
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:08,538
security and doing security in general

29
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:10,369
with a mantra that it doesn't matter

30
00:01:08,539 --> 00:01:12,440
whether you're inside a perimeter at

31
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:14,959
your office at a coffee shop outside a

32
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,330
perimeter in the cloud you're always

33
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:19,580
assumed to be untrustworthy until you're

34
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:21,679
verified and to do that kind of

35
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:25,009
verification on things that are not

36
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:26,420
based off of location or address the

37
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:28,910
types of things that traditional network

38
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:31,819
security has historically been based off

39
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:35,179
of so what kinds of things do can you

40
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:36,770
verify on instead then so essentially at

41
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:39,170
its essence zero trust networking is

42
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:41,330
about verifying identity true identity

43
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,950
so if you think about it from sort of

44
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:45,170
two ways of looking at that if you're

45
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:47,240
talking about users so you're looking at

46
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:49,369
people your employees or people who are

47
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,229
using your services it's about verifying

48
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:52,250
their identity using multi-factor

49
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:54,890
authentication

50
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:56,690
using other biometrics other means to

51
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,880
verify who is it that's making the

52
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:00,979
request as well as verifying the device

53
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,380
that they're requesting from so is it

54
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:05,390
trustworthy has it been patched does it

55
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,940
have a digital certificate on it if

56
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,690
you're talking about automated process

57
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,639
these are things that are happening

58
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,349
within the cloud or inside your data

59
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,750
center it's about verifying the identity

60
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:15,890
of the applications of the workloads

61
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,989
that are actually doing the

62
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,929
communication what is it that's actually

63
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:22,459
requesting access to your database it's

64
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,370
a think of it in this sense it's

65
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:25,580
basically multi five

66
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,900
after authentication for your workloads

67
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:30,989
the same way you might imagine doing

68
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,940
that for users and the kick caches to do

69
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:35,040
this always not just to do this one time

70
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,989
you know when the system boots up or

71
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,900
when you log in but every time you make

72
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:41,519
a request it's continuously authorizing

73
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,610
the identity of who is making that

74
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:48,030
request and what are they requesting

75
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:50,909
interesting so I used to work with a guy

76
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,560
named Dan gear who you might know and I

77
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:55,679
remember sitting on a company meeting

78
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,959
with Dan about 18 years ago and he

79
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,150
actually predicted that we would reach a

80
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:01,530
point where we just couldn't trust

81
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,450
anything on the network had to assume it

82
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,069
was bad and it feels like I'm actually

83
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,768
hearing it we've come full circle here

84
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:09,000
and we're actually there now is that I

85
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:10,890
think that's absolutely right you know

86
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,359
we used to once upon a time we used to

87
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,309
think okay we could build mode so we

88
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:16,260
could build fortresses and there would

89
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,700
be a sone of trust and then a zone of

90
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,739
untrustworthiness and we'd definitely

91
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,089
come to a point both because of

92
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,400
Technology and just because of the

93
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:25,530
threat landscape where you have to

94
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,540
assume your machine is compromised your

95
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,489
access is everything is compromised but

96
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,319
most importantly the network is come is

97
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:32,880
basically compromised and so if you're

98
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:34,589
living in a world where instead of

99
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,959
thinking okay I'm inside my house and

100
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,730
I'm safe you're always walking in that

101
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,319
dangerous district in that dangerous

102
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,328
neighborhood how would you deal with

103
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,768
security that way and and we would do

104
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:46,319
things differently and that's basically

105
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:47,430
where we're at today right I like that

106
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,089
you're promoting this model because a

107
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:54,359
lot of my customers still today even now

108
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:56,940
still have a challenge with the insider

109
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:59,160
threat and there's and they basically

110
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,569
make assumptions about what's safe on

111
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,980
the inside because all we trust our

112
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:03,958
people we trust our networks our trust I

113
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,280
can be all this stuff and it's just it's

114
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,799
a wrong assumption on a lot of levels

115
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,540
and you're approaching it from the you

116
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,519
know you're probably compromised point

117
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:15,929
of view I tend to approach it from the

118
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,699
you know if you build it as if it's as

119
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,548
if there is a secure outer perimeter

120
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:22,169
when they do get in you're kind of hose

121
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:23,489
because you've not designed around it so

122
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:24,299
it sounds like you're actually doing

123
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,550
some things to do

124
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,860
fix it and actually design around it now

125
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:32,039
absolutely absolutely I think we found

126
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,570
that at this point they will get in so

127
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:35,760
that that idea of this assumption of

128
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:37,260
breach it's not just a platitude it is

129
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,760
true they're going to get in and

130
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,590
when they do if you've built your models

131
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,090
that way then they now have free reign

132
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,289
they're going to get to your database

133
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,260
they're going to get to your keys to

134
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:48,180
your kingdom and instead exactly as you

135
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,740
pointed out it also addresses that same

136
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,360
problem that people worry about which is

137
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,970
it's not just malicious actors it's

138
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,860
sometimes insider threat or you know not

139
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,720
even intentionally it can be insiders

140
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:03,450
that are doing malicious activity or

141
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:04,470
unauthorized activity right so if you're

142
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,380
starting from it kind of that

143
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,730
traditional model where you have that

144
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:12,000
quote/unquote secure perimeter that we

145
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:13,770
now know is not how difficult is it for

146
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,740
someone to transition or a company to

147
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:19,590
transition from full trust internal to

148
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,270
zero trust yeah I think well you know if

149
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:23,159
you look back why did why did we do it

150
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:25,289
the other way that with perimeters one

151
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,450
is well it may have made sense in a

152
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:29,040
cleaner or safer world if you will but

153
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:31,680
the other really has to do with that was

154
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,540
the technology we had we had firewalls

155
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,160
you basically plug them in you create

156
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,990
firewalls and people come in or they

157
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,990
come out basically gates the equivalent

158
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,100
of gates in terms of difficulty today

159
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,500
what one of the things that's changed

160
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,270
aside from the fact that the landscape

161
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,970
has changed is the technology has really

162
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,469
made it a lot easier so to make this

163
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:52,640
kind of shift so that we have tools

164
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:55,080
today that can automatically map out how

165
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,700
applications how users how things

166
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,260
communicate so you actually have a true

167
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,969
model of how are things

168
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,980
communicating inside your network not

169
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,450
just a bunch of NetFlow and addresses

170
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,490
that are floating around that you know

171
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:08,159
ranging the terabytes and petabytes and

172
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,930
pretty much is unconsumed Bowl but

173
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,640
rather using technology to actually map

174
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,830
out what are the flows and once you have

175
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,520
that mapped out again with technology

176
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,710
with automation

177
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,930
it really isn't difficult the key is

178
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,820
like with any transition any sort of

179
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,450
change in security don't try to do it

180
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,210
all at once

181
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:26,490
don't try to boil the ocean take smaller

182
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:28,380
environments you know a critical

183
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,330
business application or even a simple

184
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:32,040
application that you know well and build

185
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:34,740
upon your success build a model where

186
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,180
this application is secure no matter

187
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,490
who's accessing it no matter where

188
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,500
they're accessing it so there is no

189
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:42,360
inside user outside user you're securing

190
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,940
one model and then you build upon that

191
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:48,000
success to the rest of your company

192
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:49,560
great so so who should attend this talk

193
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,540
and what are they which they expect to

194
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,510
get out of it

195
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:54,980
so anybody who well anybody certainly

196
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:56,360
who's concerned about security but you

197
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,370
know most specifically aside from

198
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,930
security professionals as well as

199
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,480
network security and network

200
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:04,130
administrator's people who are who you

201
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,330
know there's two sort of folks involved

202
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,400
in this there's your security

203
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,900
professionals or security analysts that

204
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,489
are constantly on the lookout for bed

205
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,840
but at the end of the day there's your

206
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,490
network administrators and they're the

207
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,049
ones that are currently managing the

208
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,570
highways they're managing the perimeters

209
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:19,850
they're managing the fences and so they

210
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,530
should attend as well because to

211
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,180
understand what does this new model look

212
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:25,549
like and how would I apply how can I

213
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:28,310
apply the principles of the model to

214
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:30,560
what I'm doing so I think both security

215
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:32,180
as well as operational administrators

216
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,250
should attend this to get a sense of

217
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,050
well what are these new principles and

218
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:39,410
how can I apply them to what I'm doing

219
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:40,870
in my at my work awesome all right well

220
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,920
I look forward to seeing the talk and

221
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:44,840
look forward to having you at the Austin

222

225
