2
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,840
hi this is Rob Sheen from the source

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,760
conference and I'm here with Chris

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,079
Cornett who is the an application

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,150
security engineer for duo

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,000
and he's gonna give a talk at source

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,680
Austin on December 5th and 6th and his

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,710
talk is called things I wish I had known

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,720
before starting a bug bounty so Chris

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,280
tell me what are some things you wish

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,279
you knew before starting a bug groaning

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:39,930
yeah yeah not too much you know I think

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,309
some of the main things that were kind

14
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,320
of a shock to me you know at the outset

15
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:44,730
whenever you're setting up a bounty you

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,540
think oh this is gonna be great I'm

17
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:50,580
gonna give you all these bugs in one of

18
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,940
the things that I wasn't quite prepared

19
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:55,769
for at the very beginning was how much

20
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,599
work actually was involved in it you

21
00:00:55,769 --> 00:00:59,339
know it sounds easy enough you get the

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,309
bugs in you triaged only hand them off

23
00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:04,890
to the developers and they get the work

24
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:08,908
and then the other thing was the amount

25
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:12,479
of bugs that would come in there's a lot

26
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:13,920
of the work upfront it's done kind of as

27
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,369
the tree and during the triage process

28
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,430
and at the time I'm the one that I was

29
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:23,219
running it was I was the the lead person

30
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:26,939
on the bug bounty for poor dot there was

31
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:29,609
an acquisition of Salesforce you know

32
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,199
just handling the sheer number of bugs

33
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:33,329
that were coming in and distributing

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,700
them to the multiple development teams I

35
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:37,758
mean it really became almost a full-time

36
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,320
job there there at the very beginning

37
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,500
you know and on top of the other work as

38
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,960
a security engineer that I was doing so

39
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,820
it's you know it was more work than I

40
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,229
was expecting

41
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,729
but you know and then there's some other

42
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:53,700
stuff that you kind of learned during

43
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:55,799
the process you know and it was it was

44
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,100
kind of a trial by fire for me because

45
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,259
I'd done some customer interaction stuff

46
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,288
in the past which it's kind of similar

47
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,479
to you but there's a lot of stuff that's

48
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:08,610
very specific to a bug bounty program

49
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,258
that you just you know like the talk

50
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,340
said that it didn't know before we

51
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:17,429
started it does that that trial by fire

52
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:21,150
right so I could see that being a

53
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,920
challenge you have a company that has I

54
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,460
see this all the time with other things

55
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,230
I can

56
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,790
a challenge here too but if you have

57
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,049
like executives that have their mindset

58
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,730
like oh we got to do a bug voting cuz

59
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,740
everybody's doing a bug bounty and they

60
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:35,070
probably bring to the table a bunch of

61
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:36,780
misconceptions around that specifically

62
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,220
around you know how much work it is or

63
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,330
you know how much staffing you need to

64
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,710
support it and all that kind of stuff

65
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,140
how would you think you would go about

66
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:45,480
convincing them that you know no this is

67
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:50,220
really a bigger project than you think

68
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,959
it might be so usually a good approach

69
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,030
is just kind of lay it all out you know

70
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,280
you gather the information either from

71
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,140
other companies you know that have run

72
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,230
their bounties you talked to other folks

73
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,149
you know I to some of the other groups

74
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,040
we actually had a slack that was

75
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,020
specifically for some bug bounty

76
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,570
maintainer zand people that were

77
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:12,990
managing on you know so I got some

78
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:15,120
feedback that way and then you can kind

79
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:17,790
of show some of the results and say you

80
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,470
know this is how much how much traffic

81
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,350
they're seeing on their side and how

82
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:23,250
much has improved their security posture

83
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,690
you know and then you can take that back

84
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,850
kind of apply it to your own

85
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,710
infrastructure and say you know maybe

86
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:30,570
they had a web application and a mobile

87
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,550
application over here but we only have a

88
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:35,160
web application you know do you provide

89
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:37,080
those results and you kind of have to

90
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,000
provide that high level information you

91
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,190
know that I found that you know once you

92
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,440
start talking about specific bug counts

93
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,060
and you know anything down into the

94
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,090
details that it starts getting a little

95
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,820
shaky you know with the with a higher up

96
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:54,000
level so if you talk about you know

97
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:56,670
meeting SLA is and improving the overall

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,280
security stance of the application you

99
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:02,010
know all that kind of stuff you lay that

100
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,840
out and then you kind of go through your

101
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,970
current development process and say

102
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,650
here's how much work it's gonna be

103
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,420
involved in each piece of this you know

104
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,060
here's the things we don't have we don't

105
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,470
have a full-on communication system

106
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,270
between all of the development teams

107
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,220
it's gonna be one off between each one

108
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,660
here's how much works involved with that

109
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,700
you know so you can kind of break it

110
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,040
down a little bit better and say look

111
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:26,099
this is I mean this is a project this is

112
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,080
a mate and undertaking you know if

113
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,330
you're a small development shop or small

114
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,550
company and you have you know two

115
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,740
security engineers and maybe a handful

116
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,480
of developers ok it's gonna be a little

117
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,180
bit easier you know obviously just

118
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,870
because the group

119
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:43,000
small enough but when you start talking

120
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:45,250
about you know 20-plus development teams

121
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,810
all working on one project then you

122
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,340
start having all the overhead that comes

123
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,050
with it all the communication that has

124
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,750
to happen between the development groups

125
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,370
between you know the security group and

126
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,889
the development groups there's just a

127
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,960
lot of extra stuff that it's easy to

128
00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:01,030
forget about when you just think I'm

129
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,289
gonna get a security bug I'm gonna you

130
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,789
know pass it off to the development

131
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:06,729
group and they're gonna handle it and it

132
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:08,860
sounds simple but there's a lot of extra

133
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:11,620
stuff and enumerate those extra things

134
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,330
helps right and I imagine you're gonna

135
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:17,610
want to have the app be as secure as you

136
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:17,609
can make it before you start otherwise

137
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:22,690
yeah now the question I just thought of

138
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,849
as you were kind of going through all

139
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:28,030
that is do you get people kind of

140
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:30,310
quote-unquote color outside the lines so

141
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:32,619
maybe you know but yes they're supposed

142
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,970
to be going after one application but

143
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,410
because they're there anyway and they

144
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,419
start poking around or other things like

145
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,039
do you have to actually be more secure

146
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:42,580
even are all around than you would have

147
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:45,340
otherwise so what usually ended up

148
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,810
happening was you know whenever you

149
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,789
create your program you define that

150
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,169
scope you know saying okay you're only

151
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:52,000
going to be able to go after this

152
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:55,780
particular piece of the application or

153
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,340
this particular application but yes even

154
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:00,070
though we defined that there will always

155
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,539
be people that would come in and say you

156
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:03,669
know hey I was investigating this

157
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:05,260
particular thing it looks like it links

158
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:07,870
over to this other part this other

159
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:10,539
service you know on your same platform

160
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:12,009
and I found a bug over there now

161
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:16,419
normally we would say thank you very

162
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:17,289
much we appreciate that and that's so

163
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:19,479
that's actually one of the more

164
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:21,909
difficult things when you define that

165
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:24,250
scope and you say these are the only

166
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:26,889
pieces of the application that you're

167
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:29,259
supposed to be testing you have to

168
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:31,389
figure out if you want to award them

169
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:33,360
about me if they found something in some

170
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:36,340
other place or if you want to just say

171
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,930
not part of the bounty you know we're

172
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,429
not really gonna pay you which is not

173
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:42,789
great you know researchers don't

174
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:45,099
particularly appreciate that but you

175
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:46,810
know it depends because then if you say

176
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:48,969
it for one person then you have to start

177
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:51,510
slowly expanding it and yeah

178
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:54,850
it gets to be a mess after a while

179
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:56,409
but usually the ones that I worked with

180
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,670
in the past the the researchers I

181
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:00,730
communicated with they were pretty

182
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:02,800
understanding the bounding we did was

183
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,890
actually a private dining and so the

184
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,690
ones that were as a part of the program

185
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:09,969
they they knew us they had worked with

186
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,940
the wider Salesforce organization and so

187
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:14,470
they were pretty understanding about it

188
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:16,150
but it definitely helped because you

189
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:18,340
know I think one of them found like some

190
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:20,799
open s3 buckets that we had just kind of

191
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,299
forgotten about which is great you know

192
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,120
because then we could go in and lock

193
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,440
those down some more but as it turns out

194
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,210
that researcher had plenty of other

195
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,550
bounties that we actually paid them for

196
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:32,680
so they didn't care as much about the

197
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:38,250
one particular one that wasn't a part of

198
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:40,510
the platform but you know that helped ya

199
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:43,030
think in terms of that and also just you

200
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:44,950
know if it's a public bounty if you

201
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:46,809
might see any bad actor show up just is

202
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:49,539
it like hey they looking for bugs maybe

203
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:51,720
they got some holes you know you do you

204
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:55,810
hear about people doing stuff like that

205
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:57,160
like like about it likes about me

206
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,620
actually turning you into a target a

207
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,080
little bit more than just in the obvious

208
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,640
way that you want yeah I mean there's

209
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,710
always a possibility of that you know

210
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,060
especially if it's a like a self-service

211
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,739
kind of thing where they can sign up for

212
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,470
an account and you know set up as many

213
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:14,260
accounts as they want to and you know go

214
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:16,900
after it as a part of the bounty you

215
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:20,110
know ideally you hope that it doesn't

216
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:21,460
happen you know we're not more the bug

217
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:24,610
bounties that I've seen have actual

218
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:26,169
codes of conduct in there so some ends

219
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,240
up for the bounty and it's found out

220
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:29,440
that they are you know doing something

221
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,080
they're not supposed to do they're

222
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,549
immediately kicked off the system now

223
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,849
where the self-service kind of thing is

224
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:38,679
really hard to track obviously it's a

225
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,419
little easier with a private bounty yeah

226
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:43,478
it's you know we were kind of spoiled in

227
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:46,360
that aspect but yeah I mean it's you

228
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:48,490
know it's it's gonna be the same level

229
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,100
of exposure honestly I mean if a bad

230
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:51,910
actor wants to come after your system

231
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:55,680
regardless of whether you have a bug

232
00:08:51,910 --> 00:09:00,100
bounty they're gonna do it you know a

233
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,510
good excuse I guess yeah so what are

234
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,550
some of the typical bounty amounts that

235
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:05,080
get offered and is there kind of an

236
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:06,969
optimal range that you you know

237
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:10,330
to incent people enough to get him to

238
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:13,030
come and help so it depends you know

239
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:14,710
I've seen some things where you know the

240
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:16,360
company was smaller and so that the

241
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:18,940
bounties that they offered were a little

242
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,680
bit smaller now the application was a

243
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,870
little you know more restricted and

244
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:26,500
everything you know I've seen everything

245
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:29,700
from $50 you know as far as monetary

246
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:31,780
rewards you know $50 all the way up to

247
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,970
I'm trying to remember what the highest

248
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:36,459
reward was it was at least a couple

249
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:39,760
thousand I want to say six or seven

250
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:41,050
thousand for an SSRI it might have been

251
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,710
a little bit higher I don't remember

252
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:46,510
exactly but it depends on the company

253
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:48,460
you know some companies can't afford to

254
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:51,040
pay a lot for the balinese and so

255
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:53,230
sometimes they'll just pay in swag or

256
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,089
they'll do a thank-you page you know

257
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,710
there's there's even some larger

258
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:58,450
companies out there that don't have

259
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:01,900
paying bounty programs

260
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:04,150
I think it's bugcrowd or I forget which

261
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:06,850
one has the list of the major companies

262
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:08,680
that have their bounties and you can go

263
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:12,070
look and see if they're monetary rewards

264
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,989
or what they are but you know you tend

265
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:17,320
to find the ones that offer the money or

266
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:18,790
offer you know whatever monetary kind of

267
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,580
thing whether it be you know a gift card

268
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:24,099
or whatever those do get a little bit

269
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:26,380
more traffic obviously you know it's

270
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,990
nicer to get a check in the mail or

271
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:30,430
something like that rather than here's a

272
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:34,870
t-shirt you know you can get it's easier

273
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:36,849
than go to a conference but but yeah and

274
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:38,680
it just ranges I think Google had one

275
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:43,600
where they did like what was it like

276
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:47,109
twenty thousand dollars or something oh

277
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:50,140
yeah yeah it depends you know obviously

278
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:52,090
you have Google or Facebook that have

279
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:54,130
the the higher amounts that they can

280
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:55,840
provide but it's also a lot harder to

281
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,280
find stuff on those platforms because

282
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,260
they have gone through so much more

283
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,060
security hardening and they've really

284
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:04,900
integrated that into a lot of their

285
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:05,680
development processes awesome all right

286
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,270
great

287
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,589
well I definitely look forward to

288
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:10,329
continuing the conversation about bug

289
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:12,700
bounties with you at source Austin and

290
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:14,500

291
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,600
