1
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,100
hi this is rob machine with a source

2
00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:10,450
conference and I'm here with Hayden

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,850
Johnson who's going to be speaking at

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:15,280
the source Phoenix Mesa event coming up

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,390
on February 8th and March first so

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,669
that's coming up in a few weeks we're

7
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:21,550
looking forward to that and hidden your

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:23,529
talk is on humane security in a world of

9
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,750
business and you've actually done a

10
00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:29,670
little play of words on human humane so

11
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:32,619
tell us a little bit about your talk so

12
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,809
my talk is humane or human because

13
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:36,820
security works in a business which is

14
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:39,400
with people they try to make profit and

15
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:42,220
whatnot and I just wanted to build out

16
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:45,460
the idea that the most efficient way for

17
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:47,710
us to help security is through human

18
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:50,260
interactions so the relationships we

19
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:52,750
have sort of inspired me to work on

20
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:56,409
those skills to talk from everyone from

21
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:58,360
the CIO CEO CTO to the juniors and the

22
00:00:56,409 --> 00:01:02,229
team such as a co-op or help desk or

23
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,400
things like that yeah the reason why

24
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:06,010
your talk Connor jumped out at me was

25
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,420
the the conference itself we've been you

26
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:09,189
know shifting focus a little bit to

27
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,050
really focus on people in communications

28
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:13,720
and that's exactly what your talk is

29
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:16,300
about so now you mentioned relationship

30
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,340
building a lot it's one of you maybe you

31
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,110
could provided some specific examples of

32
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,650
you know times where building a

33
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:28,720
relationships helped get security done

34
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:30,280
well back relationships sort of I learnt

35
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,110
that they were really helpful because I

36
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,810
used to be extremely technical and a pen

37
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:36,820
tester and focus on the exploit code and

38
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:39,010
then I was doing the pen tests and

39
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:41,259
handing a report away and sometimes the

40
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:43,750
client or someone was like so what why

41
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:46,150
what matters so what I was learning was

42
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:48,729
that a lot of my skills in not just

43
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:51,970
handing the report over by talking them

44
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:54,010
through the actual exploit or the data

45
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:55,990
that's involved with the reputation of

46
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:57,430
the business and then having a back and

47
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:00,369
forth conversation with them really

48
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:02,710
added a what a value for them and in

49
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:04,930
return I learnt that you know this

50
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:07,619
cross-site scripting attack that I think

51
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:10,509
is all where critical might actually be

52
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,920
minimal with if it's only touching say

53
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:13,659
someone's date of birth not a credit

54
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,030
card like there is context with what's

55
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:18,760
actually happening so I get a lot of

56
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,480
examples from my consulting days is

57
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,269
dealing with

58
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:25,690
and walking through them the pen test

59
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,980
report that's cool yeah that's a good

60
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:29,859
one I've actually seen that in real life

61
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,690
myself you know it's a lot of times when

62
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,069
we're really deep into technical stuff

63
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,050
we get focused on the technical stuff

64
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:36,958
and sometimes lose sight of the fact

65
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,849
that context actually does matter and

66
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,940
and that maybe the people you're giving

67
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:44,649
the report you don't have the context to

68
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,540
understand what it is you just mentioned

69
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:49,120
to them even so they might not even

70
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:51,160
understand what the issue is I see a lot

71
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,019
on Twitter or a lot of the podcasts

72
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,420
where they're like oh this super-awesome

73
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:58,989
exploit code is really great that it's

74
00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:01,000
it's a gimmick work in 1% of 1,000

75
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:03,849
chances so the relevance or criticalness

76
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,430
is quite lower than the like the exploit

77
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:08,470
code and what they've done their skill

78
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,120
is really amazing but in the context of

79
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,410
business and all the different

80
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,799
priorities they have to deal with

81
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:16,329
security it's um not really doesn't

82
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:19,660
touch scratch the surface of what they

83
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:20,650
should be focusing on right right now it

84
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,510
sounds like for me too through your

85
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:24,310
abstract in your notes that you've kind

86
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:27,700
of done some work around getting in the

87
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,930
mindset of the non-security person so I

88
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,548
was wondering if you could just shed a

89
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,900
little bit light on you know how does

90
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:35,160
how do non security people think

91
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:38,319
differently about security than we do

92
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:41,230
well for example one of our juniors in

93
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,569
the itlp teams is a bit hashtag is or

94
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:47,440
quote-unquote pessimistic every time I

95
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:49,480
say oh how cool exploit or or this man

96
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,040
yet report like see what they did there

97
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,569
he's like Oh as if that would happen

98
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,120
here the chance that happening is

99
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:56,950
nothing hang on a minute no I'm like

100
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,560
totally into security and these things

101
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:02,048
are amazing and really interesting but I

102
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:05,260
was starting to get experience where say

103
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:07,000
this guy is showing me that there are

104
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,980
different mindsets to security and we

105
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,459
can get caught in that bubble so when I

106
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:14,380
talk to my manager or upper management

107
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:16,750
or say a girlfriend or boyfriend or

108
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:20,108
family their view is totally different

109
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:22,900
and the way differs is that security to

110
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:24,370
them is seen as a cost Oh like why

111
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,080
should my past would be twenty

112
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:28,930
characters long what a pain in the a to

113
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,060
have to type that out remember that what

114
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:33,280
why why are you asking me ten million

115
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,470
questions for my my credit card when I

116
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,729
just want to pay a bill and things like

117
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:41,950
that so with that in mind it allows me

118
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:44,740
to think of their position ahead of time

119
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:48,039
to try to have as much influence as I

120
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:50,169
can when I speak to them about security

121
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,750
because if I can understand that their

122
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:55,030
their attention span is one-tenth of

123
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:58,000
mine for security it gives me a better

124
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:59,409
way to to talk about security in a more

125
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,419
positive way that might have something

126
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,520
actually be done so sort of like

127
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:05,710
thinking about explaining security in an

128
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,570
elevator pitch like down five floors

129
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:09,549
have you spit it out and quickly they

130
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,560
get the important bits and they're like

131
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:14,380
oh that makes sense without them going

132
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,990
no you're just a mister no you don't let

133
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,659
us do anything and you cost us money or

134
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,930
time and effort right right

135
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:24,040
it's definitely some interesting points

136
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:26,169
one of the things I've definitely seen

137
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,390
is a huge problem as this communications

138
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:29,830
gap between the business folks and the

139
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:31,780
security folks and the security folks

140
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,219
the technical folks and we all kind of

141
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:35,260
speak slightly different vocabularies

142
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,630
and I've been telling people recently

143
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,130
when I speak to security people like the

144
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:42,850
bucks got to stop with us we got to just

145
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:44,770
get better at this so we got to start

146
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,300
you know it's not just being able to do

147
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,500
it but II able to teach other people in

148
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,760
our field how to do it do you have any

149
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,680
thoughts on like how we can get the

150
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:55,270
message out wider to more of our peers

151
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,800
well as to what why I was doing this

152
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:59,049
talk because a lot of my talks have been

153
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,550
more technical focused but I do a lot of

154
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,350
my talks to share knowledge and help

155
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:05,229
people and think that my experiences

156
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:07,060
aren't so unique I think other people

157
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:10,120
can learn so I think talking and

158
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:11,560
presenting is a great way that the real

159
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,830
problem I find is there are security

160
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:17,080
conferences like the b-sides or a circle

161
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:19,150
CD : or no lock on things like that it's

162
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,340
a bit of an echo chamber and a lot of

163
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:24,880
the culture is that really red team or

164
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:27,039
defensive team technical aspects so on

165
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,650
the defensive it's like how we detect

166
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,479
PowerShell or on the red team it's you

167
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:34,479
know how we use PowerShell to get to the

168
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:38,110
domain controller on credentials so it's

169
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:40,240
just the nature of the beast of the crew

170
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:43,060
of info sector little bubble in a bubble

171
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:47,220
and there's many bubbles in there so I

172
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:49,080
think growing awareness is just

173
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,570
speaking and blogging and tweeting

174
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,940
because on our Twitter we have a great

175
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:56,670
community but I think we also have a

176
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:58,200
small niche community where again we

177
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:01,080
have the echo chamber that is a lot of

178
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:04,140
InfoSec drama so if we can expand our

179
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:07,729
ideas and look at other industries or

180
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:10,770
look at those that communicate well so

181
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:12,630
that that is really the way to help

182
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,729
others learn to communicate is just

183
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:17,040
saying it's important we value your

184
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:19,050
technical skills very much many hours

185
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,870
you put in and how to learn is helped

186
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:23,940
but the communication skills even if you

187
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:27,120
just put one tenth of EF into learning

188
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:29,400
it you will get much further and you

189
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,650
will feel a lot less frustrated when

190
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,020
dealing with your boss or dealing with

191
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:36,960
management who think about financials

192
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,130
and the dollars instead of code yeah

193
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,630
that makes a lot of sense I've

194
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:42,630
definitely seen some of that myself like

195
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:45,270
as I've become more senior and less

196
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:48,000
technical and you know I can still be

197
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:49,080
technical but I you know definitely more

198
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,150
much more in the business side these

199
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:55,770
days it's given me a new perspective on

200
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:58,349
the way I probably perceived my boss

201
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,969
back you know 20 years ago and what they

202
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:01,980
went through I probably just didn't have

203
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:04,560
any clue what they were actually trying

204
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,630
to manage you know you know I was like

205
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,510
fixated on some technical detail but in

206
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:11,240
reality it didn't really matter compared

207
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:15,659
to you know did the business get done so

208
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:17,419
cool well you mentioned that sorry I was

209
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,320
gonna say you man that security and

210
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:22,049
struggling with management the

211
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:24,750
communication breakdown is on us that is

212
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:27,840
true because if I was really an article

213
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:32,039
about consultants how they learn and how

214
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,539
people will say that externally they

215
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,819
will blame things so like the client

216
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:38,010
didn't want us to teach them the client

217
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,560
wasn't open to our new ideas which is

218
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:43,530
valid but the only thing we can change

219
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:46,349
is ourselves though we have to actually

220
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:48,810
look internally and think how can i with

221
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:51,270
these current restrictions black a pen

222
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:54,000
tester with these little holes how can I

223
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:56,819
get the most value in communicating with

224
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,950
the management or with a non security

225
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,670
person and it's all about looking at

226
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:03,190
yourself and sort of

227
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:06,040
your skills - the way the field is

228
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:08,500
because there's a lot of security talks

229
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,599
I've been to and the people like I kept

230
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,190
screaming at them I kept putting it in

231
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,530
front of their faces and they wouldn't

232
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:18,400
listen to me and and that's fair that's

233
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:19,360
frustrating but you have to play by

234
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:23,470
their rules

235
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,300
but which is unfortunate yeah well they

236
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:27,130
they make the money in the rules yeah

237
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,569
exactly it's I don't see it as fortunate

238
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:31,300
or unfortunate it's just a thing it's

239
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:33,820
like you just yet it's like the thing

240
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,990
happens which is unless you're really

241
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,430
compelling they're not gonna listen to

242
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,600
you or even if you are maybe they're not

243
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,219
gonna listen to you because they might

244
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,680
have weighed they have different weight

245
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,300
on different priorities right and if if

246
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,339
ultimately it's their business that's at

247
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,900
risk and they're choosing to sign off on

248
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,610
the risk well that's there right now I

249
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,290
personally think that a lot of them sign

250
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:52,300
off on things they don't understand

251
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,430
you know so I think it is on us to try

252
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,930
to help better educate what we're

253
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:57,400
actually getting the sign off on but at

254
00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:01,780
the same you know at the end of the day

255
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:03,959
it is their risk so it's it's a it's an

256
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:09,069
interesting balancing point for sure

257
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:10,240
yeah it definitely is well great well I

258
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:12,520
definitely look forward to continue this

259
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,110
