1
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:10,100
hi this is rob machine with a source

2
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,870
conference and I'm here with mingfu who

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,119
is the security solutions architect with

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:16,279
silence and he's gonna be speaking at

5
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:19,880
the source conference on May 9th and

6
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:22,789
10th coming up in Boston and his talk is

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:25,269
on combating ransomware with AI which is

8
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:27,349
it really interesting topic so

9
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:30,439
ransomware has been in the news a lot

10
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:33,110
over the last especially last year or

11
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:34,340
two and you know basically people get

12
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,650
malware in their computers instead of

13
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,700
just erasing their files their computers

14
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:40,960
get locked up and they have to come up

15
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:43,910
with Bitcoin to unlock them so how can

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,270
how can a eyes help us solve that where

17
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:51,610
the other things have failed

18
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:54,620
absolutely so what we've seeing is the

19
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:59,930
Scylla ransomware getting into the

20
00:00:54,620 --> 00:01:02,959
mainstream and as a result of that

21
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:07,159
people are now talking about how can I

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:10,369
possibly keep myself safe when I go

23
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:15,229
online surfing the web answering email

24
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:18,280
and if you look at the stats right where

25
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:22,579
some way has become one of the biggest

26
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:24,829
annoyances right and you hear all sorts

27
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:26,658
of different device from people saying

28
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:29,389
you know you should probably get some

29
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:33,700
Bitcoin just in case which I disagree

30
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:36,770
and then another kept in telling us to

31
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:39,350
possibly get all the files backed up so

32
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:41,990
that you don't lose them so different

33
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:46,240
strategies different kind of our lines

34
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:50,240
of thinking but as a security protect

35
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,818
practitioner what I'm thinking is why

36
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,039
can't we just block them why can't we

37
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:57,499
just stop them on their tracks and

38
00:01:55,039 --> 00:02:01,850
that's exactly what silence is doing

39
00:01:57,499 --> 00:02:04,458
from a technology perspective well we

40
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:07,699
are focusing on is something we have

41
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:11,810
always advocated the notion of

42
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:13,250
prevention so if we can prevent malware

43
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:16,250
from escalating

44
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:19,730
then you don't really have to worry

45
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:22,430
about necessarily backing up your files

46
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:24,200
or getting the Bitcoin account for

47
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:27,319
yourself so you can pay ransom get your

48
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:31,700
files back so this is a completely

49
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:33,708
different strategy and the reason why

50
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,560
not too many people are talking about

51
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:39,379
you know combatting mouth malware or

52
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:44,299
ransomware was the prevention strategy

53
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:46,640
is for the most part they just don't

54
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:50,540
have a very effective way for doing that

55
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:53,540
and again the underlying reason for that

56
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:56,739
failure is really the technology in use

57
00:02:53,540 --> 00:03:00,108
today which is mostly signatures

58
00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:01,940
heuristics and the behavior I have to

59
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:05,359
laugh when I knows your behavior because

60
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:07,790
if we consider their haveá-- in the

61
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:10,370
contest of ransom and that you say let

62
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:12,530
me watch to see if anybody's encrypting

63
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:16,269
my files that's not a winning strategy

64
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:19,370
by the time you watch and then see file

65
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:23,590
being encrypted it's never too late

66
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:26,299
right so in this case the only

67
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:30,049
successful strategy has to be prevention

68
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:32,120
but then ransomware from being able to

69
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:34,459
execute in the first place and that

70
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,650
exact what we do using the

71
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:39,940
next-generation technology nothing to

72
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:42,739
change not heuristics not behavior but

73
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:45,799
something that's driven by machine

74
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:48,590
learning data science these are the type

75
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:52,760
of next-generation technologies that can

76
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:56,139
prevent the execution of ransomware with

77
00:03:52,760 --> 00:04:00,649
the predictive model as opposed to a

78
00:03:56,139 --> 00:04:03,620
reactionary signature where a pension 0

79
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:06,169
is required so that's exactly what we

80
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:09,970
need to really focus on so that's going

81
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:13,069
to be a main theme of my talk and then

82
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:15,889
instead of necessarily putting out a lot

83
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:18,858
of slides PowerPoint or that I wanted to

84
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:22,400
you know show a couple of examples as to

85
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:26,680
how we combat the two ransomware for

86
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:31,640
instance you've heard about wanna cry

87
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:33,289
Arianna Perea and then maybe even that

88
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,149
rabbit so those are the type

89
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:37,399
of a common ransomware that you see in

90
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:42,349
the wild and I can even show you some of

91
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:45,710
the more for the recent developments in

92
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:49,490
terms of ransomware as a service how you

93
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:53,169
can literally channel revenge somewhere

94
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:55,789
on the fly and that those are presumably

95
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:58,339
brand new 0 the integral threat how do

96
00:04:55,789 --> 00:05:01,099
we deal with that signatures and on the

97
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:04,189
workplace so we've got to take a new

98
00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:06,979
approach and then you approach that I'm

99
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:11,059
promoting is artificial intelligence so

100
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:13,058
that'll be the core of my talk all right

101
00:05:11,059 --> 00:05:18,259
cool so I have some follow-up questions

102
00:05:13,059 --> 00:05:20,089
so you've met so the proposed solution

103
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:21,860
where does that live is that something

104
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:25,159
that would be on the endpoint or out in

105
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:27,830
the cloud somewhere or somewhere else

106
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:31,729
so just yeah just like any endpoint

107
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:35,389
based tool you're gonna have an agent

108
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:36,919
that lives on the endpoint but the

109
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:39,860
beauty of that and this is something

110
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:42,859
that's totally different if you look at

111
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:45,080
today's kind of a current generation of

112
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:50,449
in high rise in high malware solutions

113
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:55,188
what you see here is the things that any

114
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:57,740
face is so big you can't possibly stuff

115
00:05:55,189 --> 00:06:01,849
all the signatures into a single that

116
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:04,039
file so you end up literally pouring in

117
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:06,219
all the things from outside world such

118
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:10,969
as you know cloud lookup has to be

119
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:14,680
enabled in all these other sort of Av

120
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:17,558
tools and then in some cases it's

121
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:22,519
relying on some sort of our sandbox

122
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:25,159
which means you are always relying on

123
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:28,009
something that's happening in the cloud

124
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:30,789
somewhere else and then a few minutes

125
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:34,849
later you get a result the truth is

126
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:36,789
users today are not very patient if it's

127
00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:41,058
gonna take more than a couple of seconds

128
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:43,628
that's just not a good solution so the

129
00:06:41,059 --> 00:06:46,729
beauty of our AI based solution here is

130
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:47,240
by having a mathematical model that's

131
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:49,550
good

132
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,060
in nature and their lives on the

133
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:56,180
endpoints the endpoint protection is

134
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:57,319
autonomous meaning it doesn't rely on

135
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,560
anybody else

136
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:03,319
it can make a decision things per second

137
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,110
actually more or less within 50

138
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:08,919
millisecond to say this file is good or

139
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:12,710
bad or this file is vensim and then

140
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:16,430
rocket I'm being able to ask you before

141
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:20,239
it has a chance to do anyhow so there is

142
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:22,729
a much better and a more acceptable type

143
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,530
solution from users perspective nobody

144
00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:26,870
wants to sit around the wait or your

145
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:30,020
sandbox to run and a lot of times as

146
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:32,090
you've heard they have a lot of the

147
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:35,240
tools available on the internet even

148
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:38,419
under dark where the bad guys have

149
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:41,900
developed good technologies to innovate

150
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:44,289
sandboxing detection so if you are

151
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:47,258
relying the type of things that

152
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:50,690
attackers have figured out how to evade

153
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:53,570
that's not necessarily repeating was the

154
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:56,060
problem so that's why we need a new

155
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:59,990
approach and this new approach I'm

156
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:04,070
proposing is machine learning artificial

157
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:06,650
intelligence so you alright so it's an

158
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:08,360
endpoint solution and the software is

159
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:10,849
kind of figuring out on the fly whether

160
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,229
or not things are good or not and so but

161
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:14,060
you mentioned that you're not using

162
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:17,780
signatures heuristics or behavior

163
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:20,560
analysis how what's left like how are

164
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:24,080
you able to detect something reliably

165
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,150
using this kind of an engine so that's

166
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:30,080
why it's so revolutionary so if you

167
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:32,208
think about all the technologies that we

168
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,848
have looked at and then we have deployed

169
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:38,289
within the end hemella world signatures

170
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:42,849
heuristics behavior sandbox and

171
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:47,329
everything so far has proven to be

172
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:50,360
reactionary and kind of a subject to

173
00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:52,279
human intervention someone had to

174
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:56,180
develop a signature or your are rules

175
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:58,850
for whatever malware that we are trying

176
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,609
to prop a lock machine learning and the

177
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:03,130
data science is different so

178
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:08,110
in this case when you have a predictive

179
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:13,540
model in place what you get is the

180
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:16,810
ability to analyze a file statically and

181
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:21,029
then arrive at the conclusion very fast

182
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:23,739
so then this is a something similar to

183
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:27,000
high-frequency trading in the financial

184
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:29,200
world new you know drug development

185
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,410
using some of the data that's been

186
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,170
collected in the past you know ten

187
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:38,019
twenty years and you really have the

188
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:41,339
ability to tell you something and detect

189
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:44,230
something that you have never seen so

190
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:47,140
machine learning model when it's

191
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:51,310
properly developed gives you the

192
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:53,649
complete ability to predict and prevent

193
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:56,380
that type of cyberattack and are we

194
00:09:53,649 --> 00:10:01,480
seeing that happen within our customers

195
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:08,170
to give you example when what that right

196
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:12,100
broke out on May 12 2007 teen how our

197
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:14,079
customers were protected they were

198
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:20,640
running a model that we released in

199
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:24,370
November of 2015 a full 18 months before

200
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:27,870
the release and one acquirement so what

201
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:31,600
does it mean what that means is without

202
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:34,410
having seeing the malware the ransomware

203
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:39,760
you know that came out 18 months later

204
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:42,880
the model had the foresight had the

205
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,760
ability to predict what the next

206
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:49,029
generation of ransomware looks like and

207
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:53,620
then effectively blocking in the

208
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:57,189
quarantine these ransom with files pre

209
00:10:53,620 --> 00:11:00,519
execution so now you're talking about no

210
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:03,279
updates necessary right no cloud look up

211
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:06,070
no relying on signatures heuristics or

212
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,730
behavior or sandboxing so if we think

213
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:09,579
about this

214
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:11,680
this approach is totally different from

215
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:13,810
everybody else and that's why you know

216
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:19,180
I'm always

217
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:23,140
to see way back in 2016 how thousands

218
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:28,060
one the Thomas Edison innovation in

219
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:33,540
security product award and one other one

220
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:37,410
customers you know made this analogy so

221
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:40,390
what does what did Thomas I didn't do

222
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:42,520
that's different right so that the only

223
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:44,860
difference here is for for Thomas Edison

224
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:48,850
everybody using some sort of combustion

225
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:52,560
based technology to generally like so

226
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:55,990
you have like but you do that by burning

227
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,270
some sort of feel it could be a guest

228
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:01,390
that's a Gaslight it could be a wax

229
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:05,610
that's your you know candles right and

230
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:07,900
then you have all sorts of ways but

231
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:12,220
fundamentally it's all by burning

232
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:14,790
something to get her life after Thomas

233
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:17,740
Edison what we are doing today is we

234
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:20,319
take electricity and then we used light

235
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:22,330
bulb it really didn't realize so the

236
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,750
whole fundamental approach is different

237
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:28,420
and then that's exactly what we've done

238
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:32,800
within the Empire virus and tomorrow

239
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:36,300
will do which is to city as opposed to

240
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:40,000
primarily rely on signatures heuristics

241
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:42,790
etc we've removed that dependency we use

242
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,670
predictive modeling and then that made

243
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:48,790
all the difference that means no more

244
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:51,729
daily updates of signatures no more

245
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:52,810
daily skin of your hard drive we're just

246
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:56,140
aware you are trying to do something

247
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:57,579
heavy-duty you're a beast our skin and

248
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,920
then you have to literally take a break

249
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:03,640
because your machine slows down as a

250
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:07,110
consequence of so where's this type of a

251
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:10,300
new technology we see the potential of

252
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:13,240
literally Gary getting rid of all that

253
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:16,029
some old infrastructure and a start and

254
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,300
new do you really have something that's

255
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:20,860
economists and then that's

256
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:24,040
self-sufficient that way you get a

257
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:25,720
protection without all the hassle of you

258
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,740
know the cloud looked up having to

259
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,290
update all the time and

260
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,730
they're so-called you know cascading

261
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:35,810
water function that's typically

262
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:38,089
associated with anti-malware meaning you

263
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:41,329
have you maintain a server you serve I

264
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:44,300
get these updates from whichever vendor

265
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:46,970
and then you push the data signature

266
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:49,310
down to everybody within your company if

267
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:51,380
someone is traveling he doesn't get it

268
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,829
he's not protected he will never happen

269
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,430
again

270
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:57,529
it reduces machine learning right that

271
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:59,989
makes sense as long as it's all working

272
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:03,140
but like so I'll throw you want one

273
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:05,750
tough one because I've I've been doing

274
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:07,880
computers for quite a long time and I've

275
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,440
seen a lot of bold claims about new

276
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,939
technology this sounds fantastic by the

277
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,700
way it sounds like a really good model

278
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:16,370
but Kuban that you're kind of putting

279
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,420
all your eggs in the our software is

280
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:20,089
going to find all the problems

281
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:22,040
predictively what happens when something

282
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:23,390
does something that's unpredictable and

283
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,219
they come up with something new and

284
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:26,899
novel how do you then if you've taken

285
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,060
away the mechanisms to get the updates

286
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:33,440
down to them how do you get that fix out

287
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:36,140
to people so you are pointing to a so

288
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,150
the theoretical you know hole in all

289
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:41,839
this result there's always always

290
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:44,410
theoretical hole of manic exactly so we

291
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,120
are not claiming 100% coverage so

292
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:52,150
through the field hat that we've done

293
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:57,680
things the product was released in 2014

294
00:14:52,150 --> 00:15:02,300
in the past almost four years we are

295
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:04,430
able to prove that our efficacy is way

296
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,199
better than anybody who's using a

297
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:08,989
signature so we are roughly at

298
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:13,370
ninety-nine point eight percent so what

299
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:16,459
that means is we do have holes in terms

300
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:20,900
of the coverage but that's a lot of

301
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:23,209
smaller than any next guy so on average

302
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:25,579
our advocacy in about two to three times

303
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:27,709
better than the next guy so think about

304
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:31,579
what you can achieve with that kind of

305
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:35,390
advocacy but even more remarkable is the

306
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:38,089
notion of false part because in securing

307
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:41,510
you know when you turn your security

308
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:45,050
I'll all the way up in every event

309
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:48,620
things they're concluded boss party but

310
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:51,769
in this case was ninety-nine point eight

311
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:54,010
percent efficacy we are seeing a much

312
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:58,310
lower false positive rate so I'm

313
00:15:54,010 --> 00:16:02,660
averaging our first positively point

314
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:06,560
zero zero zero five percent so three

315
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:10,010
zeros four four five and as a now the

316
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:13,130
industry average is roughly point five

317
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:16,490
percent across the board so this is

318
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:20,449
roughly 1-thousand of the industry

319
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:22,790
average so that just goes to show the

320
00:16:20,449 --> 00:16:29,510
power of our finger and tell you

321
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:31,670
so yeah it's uh really how why our

322
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:33,350
customers are love it because not only

323
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:35,449
they look they don't worry about

324
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:37,360
maintaining infrastructure getting any

325
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:41,199
way up to date and that sort of thing

326
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,820
they tell us now they can you know

327
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:47,029
really spend time with forming and

328
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:49,160
friends over you know the weekend at

329
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:51,920
nights without necessarily thinking gee

330
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:54,980
did I get the latest update to you know

331
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,949
the CFO he's gonna travel somewhere so

332
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:01,370
this is a big relief if you think about

333
00:16:57,949 --> 00:17:04,699
the operational benefit for the security

334
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:07,069
team and it's truly remarkable if you

335
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:11,000
think about all the things that you

336
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:12,649
don't have to do in this context if it

337
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,929
works it's clearly avenge Aegis I just

338
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,760
generally I've learned to be very

339
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:18,049
gun-shy about making any kind of

340
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,209
absolute statements about anything in

341
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:21,619
security because you think you got it

342
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:26,240
like something surprises you and you're

343
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:28,188
like oh that work keep the conversation

344
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,770
balanced around that those ideas just

345
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:32,570
because long-term the bad guys always

346
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,710
it's an arms race and there's always

347
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:38,899
gonna be someone that figures out the

348
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:41,809
way around yeah so I would argue at this

349
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:44,690
point we are seeing a remarkable

350
00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:47,889
difference between our approach and this

351
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:51,760
river traditional approach that's maybe

352
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:55,059
you know a step forward are we gonna

353
00:17:51,760 --> 00:18:00,190
able to stop all the future attacks

354
00:17:55,059 --> 00:18:04,330
I assure you the answer's no it has to

355
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:06,639
be right so that's why you know we are

356
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:09,460
always building the next generation

357
00:18:06,639 --> 00:18:11,949
model taking into account the new

358
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:14,529
tactics techniques and the procedures

359
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:16,809
that's done that's taking used by the

360
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:19,269
attackers and that's why you know at

361
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:21,220
silence we say you know stink evil do

362
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:23,169
good you always want to think like the

363
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:26,139
bad guy I know that for us to really

364
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:27,940
catch the next wave of attacks so that's

365
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:30,549
also the beauty of this industry so you

366
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:33,429
know I will you know work for a long

367
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:35,110
time before the whole thing is finally

368
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:39,279
fixed which I doubt that will happen

369
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:40,899
right new software people are gonna

370
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:41,320
screw up software so it's never gonna

371
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:43,748
happen

372
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:47,289
exactly vulnerabilities will always

373
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:49,899
exist and you know I will definitely you

374
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:53,559
know between this fighting this good

375
00:18:49,899 --> 00:18:55,658
fight for a long time to come question

376
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:57,129
