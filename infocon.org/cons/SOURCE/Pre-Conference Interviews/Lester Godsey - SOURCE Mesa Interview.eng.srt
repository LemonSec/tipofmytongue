[Music]

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,410
hi this is rob machine with a source

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,290
conference and I'm here with Lester

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:16,720
God's T and he is the CSO of Mesa the

5
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:19,150
city of Mesa and we're gonna be having a

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,220
source conference in Mesa at the end of

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:24,698
February on February 28th and March

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,750
first and I just last was gonna be

9
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:28,330
speaking there we'd like to talk today

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:31,180
about his talk the welcome Buster

11
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:33,339
alright thanks so your talk is titled

12
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:36,550
cybersecurity program we don't need no

13
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,960
stinkin cybersecurity program so can you

14
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,150
tell us a little bit about the title and

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,519
what your talks about well unfortunately

16
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:45,970
I try to relate everything in life to

17
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:49,000
movies so the latter part of my talk

18
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:51,699
title I'll leave that to your own

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,860
investigation in googling but the

20
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:55,360
purpose of my presentation is to talk

21
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:59,080
about regardless of whether you're a

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:02,080
small organization one-man shop or a

23
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:05,619
very large organization with a dedicated

24
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,720
cybersecurity staff everybody needs some

25
00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:10,030
context and some organization and

26
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:16,720
planning when it comes to a holistic

27
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:19,150
approach to cybersecurity ok so the one

28
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,310
thing I really noticed that stood out

29
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:24,040
from your talk title in your description

30
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:26,410
was the difference between you know

31
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,030
whether you're a big shop or a little

32
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,350
shop it's still being able to do some of

33
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,750
the same things so what are some of the

34
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:34,780
commonalities whether you have a big

35
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:37,540
budget or no budget well first and

36
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:39,840
foremost the biggest commonality is the

37
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:43,060
fact that regardless of one's

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,800
organization's size everybody still has

39
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:48,070
the same problems everybody still has

40
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,658
the same challenges and so while we may

41
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:52,360
not have the same budget the same

42
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:54,700
resources available to us depending on

43
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:59,229
our situation there are certain things

44
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:04,060
we can and I I propose that we should be

45
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:05,700
focusing on regardless of our size so so

46
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,840
for example not to give too much away

47
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,799
and I'm trying to encourage people to

48
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,650
attend the talk itself is to do things

49
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:17,010
such as not just focus on prevention for

50
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,510
example and a security program should be

51
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,459
should be focus on the fact

52
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:24,040
that it's not a matter of if but a

53
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:26,200
matter when your security is going to be

54
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,179
compromised so if you if you take that

55
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,890
into consideration as you plan for how

56
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,989
your cybersecurity program is going to

57
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:35,369
be developed for your organization then

58
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:39,040
you're one step ahead of the game right

59
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:40,590
so the the knot if it's one thing is an

60
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,190
important point I think that I'd like to

61
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:48,700
rip off a little bit I see a lot of

62
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:52,510
organizations that seem to really want

63
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:54,429
it to be you know adding security equals

64
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:56,290
we're not gonna have an incident how do

65
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,940
you manage those expectations with folks

66
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:00,040
throughout the organization either kind

67
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:04,180
of up or down just that these things

68
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:06,190
will happen sure and again this you just

69
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,049
touched on some LSAT regardless of size

70
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,940
this is an important conversation to

71
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:11,409
have and it's important to have this

72
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,540
conversation with the right folks within

73
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:16,750
your organization so whether you're in a

74
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,750
small business of ten people or you're

75
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,340
working for a city like myself with

76
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,230
4,200 employees and elected officials

77
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,930
and things of that sort the same

78
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:29,018
conversation needs to occur which is and

79
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:33,129
the way I handle that is there's too

80
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:36,310
many variables frankly or anybody or

81
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:38,768
cybersecurity program to account for to

82
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,780
ensure that there are zero possibility

83
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:44,919
that you're gonna have a breach from a

84
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:47,340
security perspective I have also used a

85
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:49,959
conversation about how these

86
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,849
multibillion-dollar organizations

87
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:55,510
frankly with all the resources available

88
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:58,660
to them they have still had a number of

89
00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:01,000
reaches so it's it's not a problem that

90
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,930
you can buy your way out of I guess and

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,199
that's a common thread across the board

92
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:09,459
one thing I would like to emphasize and

93
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:12,190
conversations I've had and I've worked

94
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:16,478
for smaller organizations before your

95
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:17,709
sized or anonymity in regards to the

96
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,029
rest of the environment it's no

97
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:22,000
guarantee that you're not going to be a

98
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:24,070
target either so I think it's important

99
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,199
for very small organizations and I would

100
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:29,650
encourage them to be cognizant of this

101
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:32,740
that um just because they're not a

102
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,159
target or a large organization doesn't

103
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,680
mean they're

104
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:40,810
not an attractive no pun intended target

105
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,920
for cybercrime right so how do you

106
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,750
actually get that message out to people

107
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,640
do you run some kind of an awareness

108
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,530
program you know how what you've been

109
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,330
experienced with that it's kind of

110
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,169
especially you know big shot versus a

111
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,430
little shot because I know there's

112
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:55,470
definitely differences in how they roll

113
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,470
out training and things sure absolutely

114
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:01,539
we've taken a multi-pronged approach

115
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:02,859
along those lines we we have done what

116
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,900
you would consider your traditional

117
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,390
security awareness taking advantage of

118
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:10,630
those opportunities so for the last

119
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:12,039
couple years every every October which

120
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:17,110
is National Cyber Security Awareness

121
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:19,450
Month will host host a booth at our

122
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:22,450
benefits fair actually for the city of

123
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:26,110
Mesa where we hand out materials things

124
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:29,229
to that sort but we also do monthly

125
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,670
phishing exercises I do quarterly

126
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:35,410
updates with my CIO

127
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:37,480
our IT department so we provide

128
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,430
quarterly updates to our city manager's

129
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,580
office where cyber security is a very

130
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:45,280
high priority and we always provide them

131
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,080
data along those lines additionally and

132
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:52,119
as part of my talk about the

133
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:54,159
cybersecurity program itself that's also

134
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,610
factored in as well so it's one of those

135
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,070
things where regardless of your size

136
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:01,750
this needs to be a facet of your program

137
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:03,820
so it's not just about next-gen

138
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:06,280
firewalls it's just it's not just about

139
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:08,440
advanced endpoint software technologies

140
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,210
implemented in your environment but it's

141
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,790
also having a conversation with the

142
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:15,430
owner of your 10-man business or your

143
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:18,000
CEO or whatever the case is you need to

144
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:21,430
find a way to have that conversation and

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,260
at the same time ensure that you

146
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:26,200
demonstrate that you have a program in

147
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,550
place that addresses those concerns not

148
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,159
just from prevention but from

149
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:32,560
remediation from security education as

150
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,300
well yeah you definitely hit on

151
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,160
something I like there which is that a

152
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,800
big part of the solutions to people not

153
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,780
just the you know the big shiny boxes

154
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,390
those are cool but that only gets you so

155
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:45,390
far generally so

156
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:49,610
when you're when you're rolling and

157
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:51,770
stuff like this out do you are you

158
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:54,560
mostly hitting the the leaders in the

159
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:57,530
company or the organization or are you

160
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,180
trying to it the end users as well we

161
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:02,840
try to do all of the above

162
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:05,389
so in our instance yeah we definitely

163
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,938
there's something to be said from this

164
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:10,069
message coming from the top down so

165
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:13,009
there's definite benefit to that but at

166
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:15,139
the same time like you alluded to it's a

167
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:17,539
people person or it's a people issue I

168
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:20,000
should say in a lot of instances so in

169
00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:24,139
addition to our city management in our

170
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,779
instance we talked to representatives we

171
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:28,099
have a group that's called IT liaison so

172
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:30,349
representatives from each department

173
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:32,990
within the organization where IT

174
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:34,849
communicates through them and lets them

175
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:39,139
know what we're doing what's going on I

176
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:42,020
leverage that group we also have pocket

177
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:43,430
little education classes 15-20 minutes

178
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,310
where if you're interested in a

179
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:50,199
particular topic so for example our

180
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:54,139
single sign-on solution that we use or

181
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:56,449
the video based training on fishing and

182
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:58,279
things of that sort so we do anything

183
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:59,960
and everything in between so upper

184
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:07,389
management - middle management all the

185
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:09,289
way to the individual staff that's right

186
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:11,960
yeah you definitely hit on something

187
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:13,520
that I have found to be a challenge in

188
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,669
some organizations which is the top-down

189
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,008
element of security because I've been

190
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:20,900
saying this for years

191
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:22,159
grassroots is great but if the you know

192
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,150
the people at the top aren't saying the

193
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:24,849
right things and doing the right things

194
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:27,169
then people aren't going to do it so

195
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:29,330
have you found any good ways to educate

196
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:31,008
that the upper management so that they

197
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:35,120
are willing to support the organization

198
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:36,430
and do security correctly sure so this

199
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,000
might be one of the challenges

200
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:39,500
especially if you're a smaller

201
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,130
organization where you don't have a lot

202
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:45,019
of resources this could be an issue but

203
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:50,240
what I have found particularly effective

204
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:53,089
is having clearly measurable metrics in

205
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,209
terms of security performance and using

206
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:59,000
that data to drive home the message of

207
00:08:56,209 --> 00:09:02,000
what the security posture is

208
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,160
what the organizations risk is and using

209
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,260
that to frame the story when I have the

210
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,439
conversation with the city manager or

211
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:12,380
the CIO or whoever the individual might

212
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,380
be council member and so a good example

213
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:17,510
that is email spam has been a recent

214
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:20,360
point of conversation within our

215
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:23,780
organization so I've been able to use

216
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,850
the data that we've collected we're

217
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:27,079
fairly mature organizational when it

218
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:30,350
comes to some of the tools and the

219
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,000
metrics to demonstrate even though we

220
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:34,640
have all these preventative measures in

221
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,210
place we calculate somewhere in the

222
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:41,689
ballpark of 80% of our threat comes from

223
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:44,630
email and so we're able to articulate of

224
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:46,640
those how many emails we receive of

225
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:50,210
those how many were delivered to our

226
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,800
environment so we can tell how our

227
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:54,890
third-party provider and I won't mention

228
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:57,290
names there spam filtering is working

229
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:59,360
and why we need additional security

230
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:01,490
along those lines so in a lot of

231
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,480
instances I found a lot of success by

232
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:09,130
providing data and some anecdotal

233
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:12,110
information or stories as well too so

234
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:14,360
that seems to have gone a long way so

235
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:17,270
much so that just a couple of months ago

236
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,430
our city managers recognized that this

237
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:21,250
is a cybersecurity should be one of our

238
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:24,380
top priorities and has mandated

239
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:27,380
cybersecurity training to all employees

240
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:30,050
so and again that sends a clear message

241
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,790
from the top down that the city manager

242
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:33,560
in this instance is very concerned about

243
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:36,620
cybersecurity and we're taking those

244
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:41,569
mandatory steps to lessen the likelihood

245
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:43,160
of having breaches well that's a great

246
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,740
preview of your talk so I'm looking

247
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:49,490
forward to seeing the full thing so

248
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:50,990
again you know I was just gonna say I'm

249
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:53,000
not gonna mention what the latter half

250
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:55,130
