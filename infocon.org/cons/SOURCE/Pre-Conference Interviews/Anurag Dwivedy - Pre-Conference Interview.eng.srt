1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,670
hi this is rob machine with the source

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,340
conference and I'm here with Anurag

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:14,710
dwivedi who was a graduate student at

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,960
Northeastern specializing in information

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:20,890
assurance and cybersecurity and he is

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:23,050
now a abstract engineer at Cisco so he's

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:25,180
gonna be speaking at the source Boston

8
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:28,990
event coming up on May 9th and 10th and

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:30,009
his talk is on dissecting malware so it

10
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:32,259
sounds like a really interesting topic

11
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,960
so tell us about love about your talk on

12
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:36,519
rug okay thanks thanks Rob first thanks

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,280
for having me at the souls conference

14
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:42,010
again and the talk is more about the

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,299
real-world maulvis this this whole talk

16
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:47,620
that the inspiration came from my

17
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:50,680
internship at NBC where I got a

18
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,390
full-time exposure to X to the maulvis

19
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,610
which were delivered to the organization

20
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:57,309
so the talk is more about setting up

21
00:00:54,610 --> 00:01:00,220
your own lab and trying to get the

22
00:00:57,309 --> 00:01:02,589
real-time malware onto the system into

23
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:05,229
us into a sandbox and trying to see how

24
00:01:02,589 --> 00:01:07,510
it works like how the malware is trying

25
00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:09,580
to interact with the with your system

26
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:12,040
with your register keys and every other

27
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,650
aspects of the computer and how you can

28
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,290
actually dissect the malware and see how

29
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:19,570
it is working this would help any of any

30
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:21,160
power information security person to

31
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:24,009
actually know how it's working and

32
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,960
getting those ideas in an ink and

33
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:28,540
incorporating them into the development

34
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,399
lifecycle or somewhere to see how those

35
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,200
how to stop those models to work is

36
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:38,650
something I am targeting in this talk oh

37
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:41,590
so how is it you can take a identify but

38
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:43,240
also get these malware out of your

39
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,710
real-time environment and get it into a

40
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,460
safe environment well what kind of

41
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:48,009
things do you do there

42
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:50,889
okay so the approach I would follow

43
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:52,840
would be most of them always as you

44
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,400
would see the data statistics everywhere

45
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,390
the most of the values are delivered

46
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,890
using email so mostly we will transfer

47
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,870
that email into a sandbox environment

48
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:04,000
and we'll try to download that whole

49
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:05,950
mostly I will just like to give an

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,280
example suppose you get an email saying

51
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:11,019
here your iCloud account this will click

52
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,540
here to upgrade and mostly that

53
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:15,370
clickable link will download an exe and

54
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,220
that will do the notorious activity in

55
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,990
your computer

56
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,090
so we will have that male into a sandbox

57
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:22,100
environment try to click it download it

58
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,170
and we'll have our tools ready in the

59
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,570
sandbox to capture the events which that

60
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:28,899
downloadable e^x ability to so this is

61
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:32,180
how I am trying to get hold of the model

62
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:34,760
and once you have it was the process for

63
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,130
analyzing it okay so the process mainly

64
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,399
broadly consists of two things static

65
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:43,070
and dynamic static is just and like just

66
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,470
getting the malware trying to do trying

67
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:47,239
to reverse engineering it and see see

68
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:49,340
how it is coded and what is trying to do

69
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,140
this is a little cumbersome and

70
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,510
difficult to get hold off because most

71
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,160
of the code is off escaping the second

72
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:58,609
and by testing part is the dynamic

73
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:02,210
analysis which is you just download have

74
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:04,370
your tools on the sandbox ready and and

75
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:06,920
just and just look at what it's trying

76
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:09,200
to do for example if a mother is trying

77
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,510
to communicate to an IP address back to

78
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,910
a malicious IP address you just have a

79
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:15,679
network process monitor or a Wireshark

80
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:17,420
we don't use Wireshark much because

81
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,250
quiet shark is something which already

82
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,988
Marvel's detect that there's a water

83
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,610
running so they will just subside and

84
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:24,110
sit down so we will have a network

85
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,610
process monitor which will capture the

86
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:28,220
packets and then they will drill down

87
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:30,080
the packets and see which IP added was

88
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,880
trying to communicate and what data is

89
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,190
trying to send so this is a very small

90
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,680
example of how a dynamic analysis starts

91
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:38,510
and based on the malware there there

92
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,650
what they are trying to do we try to

93
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,090
figure out whether they're trying to

94
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,739
communicate to a different network

95
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,170
they're trying to play with the registry

96
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:46,580
keys what notorious activity they are

97
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:49,640
doing so this would be the approach of

98
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:52,370
the dynamic analysis so in recovering a

99
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,708
basic of static analysis we won't go

100
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,720
into much into deep of static but I will

101
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:59,750
focus more into the dynamic analysis and

102
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,000
see what we can get from there and make

103
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,980
and report of what that malware is

104
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,410
actually doing so this would be my

105
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,880
approach for that talk correct so it

106
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:10,010
sounds like you're kind of instrumenting

107
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,170
the sandbox environment that we can

108
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:14,239
monitor the behavior as much as the you

109
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,780
know looking at individual codes yeah

110
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,079
exactly

111
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:20,298
okay nope I guess that must make it

112
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,280
easier if you you know unless you're

113
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:24,669
really strong with assembly I'm guessing

114
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,530
yeah that here's an easier way to find

115
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:29,479
yeah that goes my next we have been

116
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,630
getting into static is is like you have

117
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:31,820
to

118
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:33,620
very strong with assembly you need to

119
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,570
get into the debugger and try to read

120
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:38,150
the code and see what target location

121
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,740
it's accessing so yeah that is something

122
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,870
I am also trying to learn so I will

123
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,210
share my experiences with static that if

124
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:46,550
static analysis and I have few examples

125
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:48,229
to show that what we can infer from

126
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:51,230
debugging the code and see how the

127
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:53,210
mother was trying to act yeah this this

128
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:55,610
would we will look up I will be covering

129
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,229
that in a short stage but mostly it will

130
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:59,450
be focusing on the dynamic analysis part

131
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,710
oh yeah because it sounds like it's

132
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:03,020
probably a lot you can learn just by

133
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:06,560
observing the behavior yeah exactly so

134
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:08,240
it give you a lot of idea of how the the

135
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,040
person who has written the malware that

136
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,200
actor was it in the mother is trying to

137
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,610
do so so by that you get an approach of

138
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,469
how the hackers are trying to get into

139
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:17,450
your system by just observing the

140
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:20,900
dynamic behavior of the malware and what

141
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:22,490
it's trying to do right right okay

142
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,280
and once you've kind of gone through the

143
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,720
process what I guess it would depend on

144
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,390
the environment about what you do with

145
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,200
the results right yeah yeah mostly

146
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:37,070
mostly in a typical scenario or we will

147
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:39,320
try to like the example I gave up it's

148
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:41,570
fine it's a very simple example that you

149
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,700
that the link downloaded and he and it's

150
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:46,040
trying to communicate to a remote host

151
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:48,110
so in a typical example we will block

152
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,210
that IP address on the firewall or

153
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:52,130
something like that so based on the

154
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:55,460
behavior we will take the follow-up

155
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:57,200
actions to protect from it right yeah

156
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:59,810
and one of the most like basic thing

157
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,729
which we do is we try to remove that exe

158
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,350
and check whether it is persistent or

159
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,970
not like if you try to restart the

160
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,580
system it's still there or it gets

161
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:10,070
deleted or is it creating a copies of

162
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,140
itself and in different location and B

163
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:14,360
and it's still persisting into the

164
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:16,219
system for long so yeah these are the

165
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,050
things which will try to get get out of

166
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:20,300
the dynamic Alice's and we'll put some

167
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:23,480
