[Music]

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,620
hi this is rob machine with a source

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,760
conference and I'd like to take a few

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,110
minutes today to tell you about some of

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,420
the awesome events we have coming up in

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,369
2018 so this year we're gonna have five

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,660
events we have an event coming up at the

8
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,150
end of February in Phoenix

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,529
technically it's down the road in Mesa

10
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:24,900
we have an event coming up in May in

11
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:27,119
Boston in June we're gonna be in Dublin

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,650
Ireland in October we're gonna be in

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,269
Seattle and then at the end of the year

14
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,519
in December we're gonna be in Austin

15
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,830
Texas so you have five opportunities to

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,210
check out what we're up to so some

17
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,890
people asked me well what is the source

18
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,960
conference well it's a great question so

19
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,360
source is really a different kind of

20
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,340
security conference we are one part CSO

21
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,079
conference one part hacker conference in

22
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,480
one part career and personal development

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,420
event so what that means in practice is

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,769
that we have business case studies we

25
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,620
focus on practical solutions to

26
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,629
real-world security problems we focus on

27
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,430
industry trends we have seaso talks

28
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:01,289
where they talk about actual challenges

29
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,850
they've overcome or maybe where they see

30
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:04,620
the industry going the next five to ten

31
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,430
years so we love business talks business

32
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:09,300
talks are great

33
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:11,040
we also have deep connections into the

34
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:14,369
hacker community and we love deep

35
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,810
technical talks tool releases new

36
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:16,920
innovations and some of the most

37
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,210
technical talks I've ever seen have

38
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,850
actually been at the source conference

39
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,289
no we love technical talks too and we do

40
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,750
try to keep a balance so we're a

41
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,799
multitrack event and in any given time

42
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,329
slot there's always a little bit of

43
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,579
something for everybody so we do try to

44
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:31,798
bring together business and technology

45
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:33,990
into one event so we do get some great

46
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,079
talks but that's not the only reason to

47
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,759
come to the source conference we also

48
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,189
really strive to be a career and

49
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:44,280
personal development event as well so

50
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:45,929
here's what that means over the years

51
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,420
I've talked to many people and asked

52
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,579
them what do you think about as the most

53
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,899
challenging problem security and the

54
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,119
number one answer overwhelming that

55
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,799
comes back is people people people

56
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:59,820
people that's the big problem people say

57
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,170
and over the years of doing consulting

58
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,029
and training and teaching information

59
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,159
security to tens of thousands of people

60
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,200
I've identified another problem which is

61
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,090
communications the business people don't

62
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,680
talk to the security people the security

63
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,850
people don't talk to the technical

64
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,050
people and the teton people don't talk

65
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,030
to the business people it becomes this

66
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,010
big cycle of pain around communications

67
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,690
and you know there's just these

68
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,590
communication gaps that occur they speak

69
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:21,000
different languages different

70
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,610
vocabularies so

71
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,230
we see source as an opportunity to help

72
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,720
address the people and the

73
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,340
communications challenges so here's how

74
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,380
it some ways that we do that so well

75
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,090
we've added in workshops that tend to

76
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:37,049
focus on more soft skill related

77
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:38,760
activities so we have workshops on

78
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,190
public speaking now every source event

79
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,200
has a public speaking tract we think

80
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,660
it's that important we have had

81
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,940
workshops on security culture and how to

82
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,650
shift mindsets around security we even

83
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,329
had a workshop not too long ago on

84
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,770
empathy we had a professional

85
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,630
psychologist come in and teach people

86
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:58,290
about empathy and why it's important it

87
00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:00,240
was fantastic we've also started doing

88
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,859
speed networking on the main stage right

89
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,190
after the first keynote on day one and

90
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,900
the reason why is it provides a nice

91
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:09,630
easy opportunity for people to get to

92
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,220
start talking to each other and with

93
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:13,590
light-hearted fun topics that really

94
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,670
aren't a big deal so that gives people

95
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,340
an opportunity to meet a few people

96
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,390
right off the bat and that way

97
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,709
throughout the rest of the couple days

98
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,940
they actually know some people as they

99
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:22,550
pass them in the hallways it just makes

100
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,780
networking easier and gets it going

101
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:26,880
we've also started doing lightning talks

102
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,290
on the main stage at the end of the

103
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,620
second day right before the closing

104
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:34,560
keynote and again public speaking is a

105
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,660
big focus of the event now we really try

106
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,070
to get people to step up and practice

107
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,570
and get out of their comfort zone and

108
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,829
the Lightning talks are a great way to

109
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,239
do that you just give a three to five

110
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:45,570
minute talk on pretty much whatever you

111
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,060
want I've done talks on speed solving

112
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:49,739
the Rubik's Cube I've done talks on

113
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,750
bonsai trees it doesn't have to be

114
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:53,459
security related any anything you want

115
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:57,239
to talk about straight the whole point

116
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:58,920
is to get up and speak so we do all

117
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:00,030
kinds of things like that we've also

118
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,589
started doing career and personal

119
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,600
development panels where we have panels

120
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,750
of experts come up and we interview them

121
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,690
on various topics we do entrepreneurship

122
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:11,040
talks and activities on occasion and

123
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:13,380
lately I've also been doing facilitated

124
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,910
conversations where we'll run a

125
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:17,159
facilitated session where I'll come up

126
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:18,810
and ask a controversial topic to the

127
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,880
group and we'll have a conversation

128
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,710
about it so we actually get business

129
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,290
technology and security people all

130
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:28,380
together in one room speaking about a

131
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:30,900
topic that they find challenging and

132
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,280
interesting and you know so we're always

133
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,950
adding new things that those are just

134
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,109
some examples so really the idea is

135
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:39,420
do transformational work around the idea

136
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,520
of people and communications and the

137
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,810
challenges associated with those so as

138
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,940
far as I know nobody else is doing

139
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,310
anything like this and source is a

140
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,650
really unique event an Essene experience

141
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,810
so we hope that you come share it with

142
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,969
us this year so there are five

143
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:56,190
opportunities to do that again we have

144
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:58,290
an event coming up in February at the

145
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:00,630
end of February in Phoenix down the road

146
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:04,230
in Mesa technically we'll be in Boston

147
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:06,210
in May in Dublin in June and October

148
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:08,340
we're gonna be in Seattle and then in

149
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:10,530
December we're gonna be in Austin Texas

150
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,630
and we really want to bring together

151
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,950
business technology and security people

152
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,810
all into one room and get them to talk

153
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,320
to each other and they've answer a lot

154
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,270
of fun

155
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,140
they're very educational and they're

156
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,969
really excellent networking

157
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,800
opportunities so if any of that sounds

158
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,600
interesting we hope you can join us at
