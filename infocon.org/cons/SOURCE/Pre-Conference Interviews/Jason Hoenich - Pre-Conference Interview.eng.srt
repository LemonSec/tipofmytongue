1
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,190
hi this is Rob Sheen from the source

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,780
conference and I'm here with Jason hey

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,239
Nick who's the founder and security

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,709
awareness expert habituate and he's

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,390
gonna be speaking at source Boston on

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:20,910
May 9th and 10th and his talk is titled

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:24,100
shifting a security awareness 2.0 so

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:26,890
Jason you've done a lot of work on

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,119
security awareness and that's always a

10
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,830
particularly interesting topic to me

11
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:32,049
because my last company I built was all

12
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:34,930
about security awareness and those kinds

13
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:36,760
of programs so when I see somebody

14
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,890
that's doing 2.0 that sounds really

15
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,629
exciting so what did he do what did we

16
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:44,500
get wrong in 1.0 and what are we doing

17
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:46,510
better in 2.0 well well that's a great

18
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,790
question and thanks for having me on I'm

19
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:53,379
really excited to be to be that there

20
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:58,629
and I think I think from my mind

21
00:00:53,379 --> 00:01:00,670
employment what we get wrong in 1.0 is I

22
00:00:58,629 --> 00:01:05,500
think just the approach that the end

23
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:08,110
user is stupid or idiot you know and

24
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,750
that they're always just going no matter

25
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:13,690
what we do it's always going to be their

26
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,720
fault and in the time that they spent

27
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:20,560
managing and building programs for some

28
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:23,020
in my past that's not really what I was

29
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,950
seeing the field right and so I think

30
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:30,070
for me it's kind of the technical

31
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:32,170
approach and being familiar with what

32
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:35,559
works on paper right and what works in

33
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,540
theory and then actually trying to put

34
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:41,050
that into play in the field and seeing

35
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:45,190
that what was research and studies show

36
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:46,870
in a lab on how we learn isn't it goes

37
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,220
out the door once we're at work and we

38
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,409
have all these other distractions and

39
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:53,470
things like that so I think that's what

40
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:54,820
I think we get Rona 1.0 and for me 2.0

41
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,190
is really focusing on the user

42
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:00,419
experience themselves and like creating

43
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:05,048
interesting content and things like that

44
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:08,199
so how do we differ the content I know

45
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:09,789
you know the traditional content was you

46
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:12,849
know original it was basically slides

47
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:15,069
with some notes at the bottom and then

48
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:17,399
we kind of shifted more like animated

49
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:19,869
things and a little bit more interactive

50
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,220
things but how do we tailor it to

51
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:26,410
the users actually need and how they

52
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:28,780
learn yes you're right I think for a

53
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:32,170
long time what we saw what we were

54
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:34,180
seeing or using was maybe a PowerPoint

55
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:37,030
presentation at some point and I think

56
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,950
we can all react this early to even the

57
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,810
term PowerPoint presentation right like

58
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,599
it doesn't doesn't really promote a lot

59
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:46,959
of excitement and then we moved into

60
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,548
this phase for a few years where there

61
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,060
was some vendors in this phase that were

62
00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:53,829
creating LMS platforms for a training

63
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:57,610
platform so that we can actually deliver

64
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:58,989
the training and that was more serving

65
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,599
the purpose of delivering the training

66
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:04,180
and tracking the metrics and I think it

67
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,220
was a necessary step in the evolution of

68
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:10,480
security awareness and training but what

69
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:12,790
we weren't focusing on at all was the

70
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,250
engagement of it and I think we actually

71
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:20,069
got to a point where engagement became

72
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:22,060
confusing and by that I mean there was a

73
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:25,660
two or three year period where a lot of

74
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:27,579
the training platforms with both said oh

75
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,530
we force engagement like they're

76
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:34,359
required to interact with our training

77
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:35,620
modules right and I was i sat on the

78
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:37,540
other side of those trainings there was

79
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,829
a lot of the strings that ones that I

80
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,590
got the program for the Walt Disney

81
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:45,280
Company and when I'm trying to assign

82
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:47,980
training 240,000 users that are reading

83
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,190
the Marvel of galaxy for guardians of

84
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:54,010
the galaxy and frozen and engineering

85
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,569
theme parks not that there any more

86
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,030
discerning users than the average user

87
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:59,470
but I didn't even want to put all that

88
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,840
training in front of them and it was

89
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:04,299
because I found myself when I was just

90
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,769
reviewing the training multitasking and

91
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:07,180
not really paying attention right and

92
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:09,940
forcing them to click on something on

93
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:13,180
the screen or forcing me to click to

94
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:15,519
learn more I get it on paper it makes

95
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,769
sense right but at work like I'm just

96
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,358
trying to get my work done and I've got

97
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:21,310
a hundred tasks I have to do today and

98
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:24,370
you're forcing me the statue is hour

99
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,690
long training and it just didn't work I

100
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,760
didn't see it I didn't want to sit

101
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,140
through it and I'm fine users didn't so

102
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,479
that's when I started exploring a little

103
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,520
more with well what kind of content does

104
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:35,590
engage my users more

105
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,318
right and you know removing the things

106
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:40,299
like at Disney was where I really

107
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,580
started doing the original iteration of

108
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,880
the shoe eight videos but just using

109
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,440
funny videos right like it was it was

110
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,479
really it was really awesome because I

111
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,340
Disney I was at a movie studio you know

112
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:53,440
do I had these resources and they're

113
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,239
like I was pitching these ideas to my

114
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,949
senior leadership and they're like okay

115
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,780
well what do you want to do I like I

116
00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:00,669
just want to try some funny videos I

117
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,559
just want to try some infographics I

118
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:03,758
want to I want to post event you know I

119
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,900
want to do something outside of just

120
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:10,630
staring at an LMS training dream so you

121
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:13,840
know alongside funny videos or whatever

122
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:16,449
we did some really cool live hacking

123
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,940
demonstrations for like live audiences

124
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:21,759
and we brought the FBI and the speed gun

125
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:23,259
you know calm calm and wrists and kind

126
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,479
of flipping it to a more personal

127
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:28,360
approach to how they can protect

128
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:29,620
themselves and their family and hope and

129
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,360
assume that they'll bring those

130
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,360
behaviors mm-hmm

131
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,120
yeah I know I definitely when you were

132
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:42,009
talking about the click to interact type

133
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,840
of trainings like I have to apologize

134
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:45,370
because I'm part of that problem because

135
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,508
I that was definitely one of the things

136
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,860
we were innovating on at the time

137
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:50,050
because that was and that was the

138
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,060
necessary next step because where we

139
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:54,250
were coming from was basically spoken

140
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,509
PowerPoint and it was god-awful and the

141
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:58,080
at least the interaction was getting

142
00:05:55,509 --> 00:05:59,889
them to kind of do a little bit more and

143
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,318
but it was I always found it interesting

144
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:05,380
because I would I had at that point when

145
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,300
I started the the training company I had

146
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,699
already been teaching for a while and I

147
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,530
kind of figured out my in-person formula

148
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:13,030
for how to get an entire roomful of

149
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,859
people to follow along and be like yeah

150
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,568
the security thing is great so I thought

151
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,940
like yeah I got this man this is easy

152
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:22,000
and then I tried to convert that and

153
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,919
translate that exact basic script into

154
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,319
an e-learning module it's really hard

155
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:30,068
it's it's it's really challenging to get

156
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,840
that same level of connection that you

157
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:33,250
would get in an audience so what I kind

158
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:39,599
of learn from that is you just need a

159
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:39,599
different approach yeah yeah absolutely

160
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,319
interaction focus you know interactive

161
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,330
module focus

162
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:52,119
training to allow us to kind of grow

163
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:54,339
further because we have to learn that

164
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:56,589
stuff right and you're right and you

165
00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:58,360
just mentioned what is like the core my

166
00:06:56,589 --> 00:07:00,069
approach will be security awareness any

167
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,550
type of a security where's training or

168
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:07,629
presentation or program is when I'm in

169
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:08,770
front of 1,500 users on delivering and

170
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:11,619
training it's a much different

171
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:14,258
experience right it's like the

172
00:07:11,619 --> 00:07:16,509
difference between a band that you go

173
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:18,159
see that's really great live and maybe

174
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:19,330
try and capture that in the studio and

175
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:21,969
it there's always like an element

176
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:23,199
missing here is that I think that's kind

177
00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:24,669
of where we're at right now I was trying

178
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,789
to try and capture that live sound in

179
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:29,229
the studio and said oh I didn't kind of

180
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:31,899
sort of taking the approach and I think

181
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:35,438
that moving to 2.0 to kind of circle

182
00:07:31,899 --> 00:07:37,180
back is like thinking differently on how

183
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,099
we're building these things from the

184
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,649
very beginning so if we're if we're

185
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:43,779
saying okay we need to send something as

186
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:46,839
simple as a mass communication out on

187
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:50,289
this fishing risk that's out there right

188
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:52,360
now the latest fishing right thinking

189
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:54,550
how that's going to land in your

190
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,229
co-workers inboxes and like what do we

191
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:59,229
do like at that moment when they read it

192
00:07:56,229 --> 00:08:01,539
and maybe if you decide you mean to do

193
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:04,029
that communication which I have lots of

194
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:06,128
opinions on that as well but if you

195
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:08,558
decide that you need to do that like not

196
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:09,789
putting five paragraphs worth of

197
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:11,019
detailed information that they're just

198
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:12,998
not going to read give it to them so

199
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:15,240
they can read it 10 seconds and show

200
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:19,110
them value and get out the door right

201
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:21,789
right so you've kind of alluded to

202
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:25,389
expanding beyond the original scope of

203
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:27,009
training a bit so one of the things we

204
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:29,019
used to recommend is that you don't just

205
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:32,229
do this you know one and done training

206
00:08:29,019 --> 00:08:34,089
course once a year and then they never

207
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:36,219
see anything else again you try to make

208
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:37,479
it part of an overall program like how

209
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:39,399
do you see some of this stuff kind of

210
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:41,169
building out into more of a program and

211
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:44,110
programmatic approach rather than just

212
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:46,029
the one and done things yes that's a

213
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:48,310
great that's a great question and I

214
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:51,490
think that first part of your statement

215
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:55,810
is really really defined in my my

216
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:57,579
opinion like 1.0 it is that okay we need

217
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:59,109
to do this so we're signing the training

218
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:00,729
once a year and they take it just like

219
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:04,990
harassment and

220
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:09,639
bribery and all those things and if that

221
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:13,810
doesn't work we know that and so I think

222
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:16,660
the first couple years of my experience

223
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,279
doing security awareness I didn't even

224
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,750
know I was doing security was first of

225
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:22,570
all right it was just something I was

226
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:25,329
doing talking to my co-workers and my

227
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:27,310
employees explained to them like why did

228
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:28,479
they get that virus on their computer

229
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:31,268
and why do I have to clean it off their

230
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,360
computer for them right and then when I

231
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:36,040
was at Disney what actually when he was

232
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,550
first set of Activision I was at

233
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:42,699
Activision that are doing awareness and

234
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:44,019
I mean doing the thing right like we

235
00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:46,060
were gonna start doing the fishing

236
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:48,790
simulation we were doing the training

237
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:50,800
you're doing in-person thing but there

238
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:53,620
was no I didn't have like a method to

239
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,660
the madness and then I carry I kind of

240
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:58,449
took that with me over into the Disney

241
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:00,519
when I went there and I'm a much broader

242
00:09:58,449 --> 00:10:03,339
scale I found myself doing similar

243
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:06,760
things right fishing simulation annual

244
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:10,290
trading onboarding training things like

245
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:13,779
that right and I would notice some other

246
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:15,240
department whether they're ite or

247
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:17,769
marketing whatever that had these

248
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,360
programs and we're just telling it right

249
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:21,190
like they were just really well done

250
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,810
they good marketing a good metrics and

251
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:24,670
everything and so I would reach out to

252
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:26,619
someone like my co-workers and I would

253
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:28,180
ask them what how do you like I feel

254
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,980
like my security awareness program is

255
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:32,019
pretty similar in scope and approach to

256
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:35,470
what you're doing with core

257
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:37,149
communications or the marketing like

258
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:38,290
three or four that's different people I

259
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:40,690
talk to like oh we should have like a

260
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:44,230
really great program plan and I was just

261
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:46,269
like oh how did I not realize that I

262
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:49,560
need a program plan so I started to

263
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:54,010
borrow some templates and kind of

264
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:56,170
Frankenstein the program plan for when I

265
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:58,600
what I felt was an effective awareness

266
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:01,300
program and then sharing with my peers

267
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,430
at conferences just in conversation you

268
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,779
know I noticed that a lot of the other

269
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,760
companies and my peers were doing

270
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:09,850
similar things that are they up so we

271
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,860
just need a program plan and that once I

272
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:14,499
he initiated that and decided I'm going

273
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:17,199
to use a plan my security

274
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:19,959
program just like skyrocketed it grew

275
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:22,269
and it got respect from senior

276
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:23,618
leadership you know and it's just about

277
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:25,929
that approach of treating it like an

278
00:11:23,619 --> 00:11:28,329
actual program and not just a process

279
00:11:25,929 --> 00:11:30,669
that you have to go through and so in

280
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:32,669
programs I can get into what I think are

281
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:36,609
part of the programs I don't know the

282
00:11:32,669 --> 00:11:38,739
question yeah definitely definitely

283
00:11:36,609 --> 00:11:39,939
knows yeah we used to definitely tell be

284
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:42,069
like think of it like a marketing

285
00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:45,579
program and you'll be better off because

286
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:47,169
it really is a you have an idea you're

287
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:49,659
trying to communicate to a certain group

288
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:51,459
of people and you need to make sure they

289
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:53,229
all get it now how did you how do you

290
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:54,549
recommend that people measure that it's

291
00:11:53,229 --> 00:12:02,139
working like what kind of metrics do you

292
00:11:54,549 --> 00:12:05,529
collect that is I think I think that

293
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:07,719
there's common metrics that we gravitate

294
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:09,339
to because the industry is kind of push

295
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:11,139
those to us I immediately think of the

296
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:13,509
fishing click rate right I think that's

297
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:16,779
probably the first major metric that

298
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:19,779
pieces or program administrators our

299
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:21,549
first subject to and I think that's a

300
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:23,289
decent starting place right that's

301
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:25,598
usually one of the first initiatives

302
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:27,009
that you take on is outside of your

303
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:29,829
compliance training and your annual

304
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:33,220
training you're doing fishing training I

305
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:35,079
like to get into ways to when I'm

306
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,669
building out my program I'm trying to

307
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:38,019
take an end you know six months 12

308
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:41,619
months 18 months down the road to where

309
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:42,939
I want to be and thinking okay if I want

310
00:12:41,619 --> 00:12:45,970
to be here my goal is to have a

311
00:12:42,939 --> 00:12:49,478
bachelor's program and I want to be able

312
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:51,279
to do four events each October during

313
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:53,919
National Cyber Security Awareness Month

314
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,929
what do I need to start doing now here

315
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,669
and what kind of building to start

316
00:12:55,929 --> 00:13:00,429
collecting data so I can provide metrics

317
00:12:57,669 --> 00:13:02,769
to that's up for me like I was only as a

318
00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:05,049
single resource and so in order to get

319
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:06,819
budget I had to kind of like prove my

320
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:09,220
Worth and prove that there was a method

321
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:11,529
to what I was doing it so it would start

322
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:14,109
with something as much data as I could

323
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:15,819
from fishing programs you know the data

324
00:13:14,109 --> 00:13:16,959
and the fishing and you can start

325
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:18,819
looking through that there's a lot of

326
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,368
really good data there the click rate to

327
00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:24,429
me is kind of junk like I don't think

328
00:13:21,369 --> 00:13:26,739
it's a despair metric to represent your

329
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,910
program with there's there's too many

330
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:29,920
outliers on that

331
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:32,050
how many people were on vacation that

332
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,329
month you know is there holidays there

333
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:36,939
are things like that that can affect the

334
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:39,370
response rates for me I always like the

335
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:41,110
report rate which is how many people

336
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:45,100
reported in email because that actually

337
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:47,470
should behavior change that you're that

338
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:50,410
you're working on so I look at things

339
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:54,700
like that reporter II I would go outside

340
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:56,439
of just your completion airy for your

341
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,700
annual training which is the most common

342
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,530
probably the second most common one it's

343
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:03,370
not the first the most common one

344
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:06,310
because that just kind of I like you're

345
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:09,940
either ability or inability to annoy

346
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:12,729
people right and it really comes down to

347
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:14,710
in a larger company if you want people

348
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:16,840
to complete a training at some point if

349
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:18,370
there's a if there's repercussions and

350
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,440
not completing its gonna have to get

351
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:22,990
transferred to HR at some point right

352
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:26,770
because security awareness professionals

353
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:29,110
we shouldn't be in charge it should just

354
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:32,079
be our job to you know to assign the

355
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:35,350
training and follow online and so I

356
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,940
think that side it out if you are

357
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:39,340
obtaining your program you can look at

358
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:42,910
things like okay I want to have one or

359
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:44,050
two live trainings a year and events

360
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:46,630
that they can attend you can start

361
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:48,160
tracking attendance then and then I one

362
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:50,920
thing that I really liked was using

363
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:54,160
hours spent learning each month outside

364
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:56,020
of training so for instance in October

365
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,240
for national cybersecurity Awareness

366
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:01,270
Month the last two years we had event

367
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:05,020
that I did we clean cyber security 101

368
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:07,180
trainings we're anywhere from 10 to 8

369
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:09,460
people can show up and talk and learn

370
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:11,620
about security risk and then we had

371
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:13,720
speakers come in and we did they

372
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:16,660
mentioned a life hacking demonstration

373
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,940
where I volunteered to be the target and

374
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:21,699
I worked with my internal red and blue

375
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:23,830
teams and basically in the life in the

376
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:26,140
live audience we have two screens up one

377
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:28,300
was my computer and one was the red

378
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,860
team's computer you know this computer

379
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:33,010
is like a mr. robot screen where they're

380
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:35,770
seeing all the Kali Linux commands going

381
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:37,750
on and all they did was really go

382
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:39,579
through my social media accounts find

383
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,160
some information that's readily

384
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:45,390
available about me just from GRU

385
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:48,980
and then they send me an email and I

386
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:50,730
click on it for the sake of the demo

387
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,650
this is in front of like a hundred

388
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:54,870
people where they literally see them

389
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:56,670
clicking on the link and then my webcam

390
00:15:54,870 --> 00:16:00,390
is being broadcast on the mr. robot

391
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:03,930
screen you can like hear people mind

392
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:07,050
being blown and it was like a ten minute

393
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:08,670
demo right like you do things like that

394
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,490
and then you can say okay well 100

395
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:13,110
people attended and it was an hour long

396
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:15,240
presentation so there's a 100 hours

397
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:16,890
spent learning that you know voluntary

398
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,140
right and then it gives you like a good

399
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:21,390
baseline okay well next year if you only

400
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:25,140
get 200 hours and you won't get $500

401
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:26,850
there's a game or event so for me you

402
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:29,810
the strength of your security awareness

403
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:32,520
program is determined by your ability to

404
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:34,109
engage people and so how do you do that

405
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:39,260
how do you show that for me its intended

406
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:41,040
its surveys you know things like that

407
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:43,860
yeah that's great those are great

408
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,319
examples I've always found live demos of

409
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:48,930
a real hacker or simulated hack that

410
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:52,860
could you know is realistic more

411
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:54,329
accurately it really gets people's

412
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:58,520
attention in a way that almost nothing

413
00:16:54,330 --> 00:17:01,260
else does they're like oh that was easy

414
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:03,720
because in their minds they think it's

415
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:05,879
like hacking is this like hard super

416
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,069
technical difficult thing that you know

417
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,959
you're gonna be a rocket scientist to do

418
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:11,310
and it turns out that a lot of the

419
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,449
things people do on a regular basis

420
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,829
aren't really that hard at all they're

421
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:16,680
just you know they're pretty

422
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:19,050
straightforward and yeah I've heard of

423
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:21,089
them to think about it you know yeah

424
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:27,750
yeah it's great like when they when they

425
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:29,970
see me talk to and I was easily hacked

426
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,650
in ten minutes right now I'm saying like

427
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:33,960
look I'm pretty good with my information

428
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,490
like most of my encounter private all

429
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,530
these things like imagine how easy it

430
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:39,840
was for you and everyone's like so we

431
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:43,050
did surveys on the you know exiting that

432
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:46,139
and like 85% of those that attended to

433
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:47,970
the day were going to change their their

434
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,550
Facebook profile and instagrams the

435
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:52,050
private and they were going to review

436
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:54,870
what information they had on LinkedIn

437
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:56,850
and like that's a win that's a huge win

438
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:58,649
and they're gonna tell their friends

439
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:01,320
they're gonna talk to their spouses or

440
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:02,850
their families like that and that's the

441
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,879
type of engagement it's really you know

442
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:08,909
you can't you can't buy like that's just

443
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:11,730
the in person that's a unique experience

444
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:15,240
for that yep awesome well I feel like we

445
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:17,670
could talk about this all day so given

446
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,380
our both of our background so um when I

447
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,520
asked you to do the talk I've mentioned

448
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,950
that we were going to do this as the

449
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:26,460
8-hour new snap talk format so you're

450
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:28,410
one of our inaugural speakers to do our

451
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:31,710
18 minute format which is kind of you

452
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:32,700
know Ted style talk so you you actually

453
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,170
had an interesting response you're like

454
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,940
oh I actually prefer those kinds of talk

455
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:37,470
so why is that like why do you prefer

456
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:45,720
the shorter talks versus the longer ones

457
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:48,720
oh I mean I'm a fan because just it's

458
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,100
the user experience really right like if

459
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,350
I'm sitting in the audience I want to be

460
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,300
told a story as humans we want to be

461
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:57,659
told stories and I mean that's what a

462
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:59,669
TED talk does well is it didn't seem in

463
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:03,170
a journey through a couple different

464
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:06,780
stories that provide feedback and

465
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:08,610
knowledge and interesting like pieces of

466
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,710
I like to call it social currency right

467
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:14,909
like things that are just interesting

468
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:17,220
and if you are listening to someone who

469
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:18,990
who isn't reading off the cue cards or

470
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,570
isn't reading off a PowerPoint deck and

471
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:25,200
engaging you with a story like that's so

472
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:28,110
powerful and I enjoy that I enjoy doing

473
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,540
that I enjoy kind of violating

474
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:32,159
expectations unlike if they're sitting

475
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,659
there thinking like okay this is going

476
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,190
to go through like thirty five slides

477
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:38,070
I'm going to do this I'm gonna start out

478
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:39,960
with a story of some type and no you're

479
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:41,760
gonna like wait what how did we even get

480
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,560
here and how did you how did you weave

481
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,080
that information into that story like

482
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:48,570
that that's so fun so it's a challenge

483
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,949
I'm excited they want in the inaugural

484
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:56,149
ones we'll see I hear I'm following up a

485
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:58,740
opening one which talks about why most

486
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:02,390
what's the title of it I believe it's

487
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,390
why most presentations suck

488
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:14,309
so I just loved it I loved it you know

489
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:16,889
awesome well look at definitely looking

490
00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:18,059
