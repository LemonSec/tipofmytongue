1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,940
hi this is Rob Sheen from the source

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,799
conference and I'm here today with Aaron

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:14,200
Katz who is gonna be speaking at the

4
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:16,990
source Boston event in on May 9th and

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,910
10th and he's the director of Threatened

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,278
Moulton ability management at Standard &

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:25,300
Poor's and his title of his talk is

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:29,980
defense can be sexy - so tell us Aaron

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:32,439
why is defense sexy defense can be

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:35,440
extremely sexy it's not just put on red

11
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:37,390
spandex go attack find all the cool

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,040
zero-days there's a lot of really cool

13
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,989
stuff you could do on the defensive side

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,699
that doesn't really get the attention it

15
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:44,440
needs because you have to stop not just

16
00:00:42,699 --> 00:00:46,570
one attack that's successful you got to

17
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,150
stop everything so people come up with

18
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,820
really cool innovative ways on trying to

19
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:53,799
tie a lot of different tools techniques

20
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:56,440
together that normally aren't supposed

21
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:58,570
to go together but we don't have

22
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,760
unlimited funding we don't get the

23
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:02,860
budget we need for a variety of reasons

24
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,839
so it's just really cool seeing how can

25
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:08,020
you chain together all these disparate

26
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:10,030
systems and figure out a way to both

27
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:12,100
defend against the attacks that come in

28
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:15,970
and should something come in take really

29
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:17,410
quick action so that red team leaves off

30
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,929
right after they found the cool sexy

31
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,940
attack we have to pick up everything

32
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:25,930
afterwards and sometimes that can be a

33
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:27,399
really fun journey right so so tell us a

34
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,950
little bit more about that journey so is

35
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,690
your abstract you mentioned the idea of

36
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:34,300
being proactive instead of reactive

37
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:35,440
which is great how do you actually do

38
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,020
that how do you get the people that

39
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,480
matter to care about that though

40
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:43,179
sometimes if you want to be cynical it's

41
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,220
a breach that takes it now you did

42
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,659
consulting I found lots of people the

43
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,100
minute they get a breach suddenly they

44
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:49,720
started spending they started looking at

45
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,460
defense rather than just paying a third

46
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:54,300
party to do a pen test once a year so

47
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:58,389
they could tell a regulator we're secure

48
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:00,580
but reach out like I figured out who's

49
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:03,010
our chief privacy officer who do I deal

50
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:04,630
with in the event of a breach who from

51
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,580
each of the different business units are

52
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:09,340
there the minute you start reaching out

53
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:11,200
to them they appreciate it they start

54
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,250
thinking about it from their end if I go

55
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,549
to someone who heads one of our

56
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:17,410
divisions non-technical and I say what

57
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,120
happens if the entire source code got

58
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,290
leaked to a competitor

59
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,519
obviously a very bad thing so then they

60
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,989
start thinking what can we do to prevent

61
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:26,540
that from happening how do we get

62
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:29,090
involved too often people just stick

63
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,890
with the security team alone operating

64
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,599
in a vacuum or just with the technology

65
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:34,159
side you have to get every single

66
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:36,798
different stakeholder involved whether

67
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,599
it's a quarterly meeting just to review

68
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:40,690
here's what we have here what are your

69
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:42,738
risks what do you think is an issue

70
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:45,049
express interest and learning what the

71
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:46,910
business is when I sat down with a sales

72
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:48,860
rep I learned more about how they sell

73
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,239
an application to a customer than I did

74
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,790
by sitting down with the dev team and

75
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,349
then I immediately figured out how do I

76
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:59,450
break it and how do I prevent someone

77
00:02:54,349 --> 00:03:02,140
like me from breaking it right yeah now

78
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:05,119
that's interesting interesting point so

79
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,349
who drives this though is it does it

80
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,180
have to be somebody in your role or

81
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:10,298
could it be somebody further up the food

82
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,230
chain or like just in general like

83
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:13,930
because I've seen exactly what you're

84
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:16,488
talking about you basically have

85
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,170
security people or even developers that

86
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:19,670
you know they know their own little

87
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:22,458
piece but they don't necessarily know

88
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:24,559
how it fits into the big picture and you

89
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:26,419
know those that make the connections of

90
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,370
how bad this would be if it's broken

91
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:31,370
don't necessarily get that message out

92
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:34,549
to everybody that matters so who needs

93
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,450
to drive it so that that happens so part

94
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:37,730
of that is what the chief security

95
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:40,339
officer should be driving if you have

96
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:43,069
one if you don't to be honest you need

97
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,720
that support from the CEO and sometimes

98
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:46,970
it's daunting and the large companies to

99
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,069
say well finding the CEO to mandate this

100
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,700
I don't want to reach out to him I'm

101
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:51,668
scared

102
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,418
like I don't want him to know who I am

103
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:55,069
but at the end of the day he's

104
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:56,959
responsible look what happened to

105
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:58,488
Equifax like the mint the minute that

106
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,109
that's one of the breaches that I had to

107
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:02,810
deal with that didn't happen to my

108
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:05,299
company right but that got all of the

109
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:07,280
visibility and that actually helps send

110
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:09,379
out some reports like what we'll do at

111
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,750
times no matter where I've worked was

112
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:12,739
we'll send out some highlights here are

113
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,109
some interesting things that have

114
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:16,970
happened in the news so Equifax breach

115
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:21,769
has led to this person getting arrested

116
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:24,889
this person getting like retiring they

117
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:27,200
care about that right and just reach out

118
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:28,550
and get their support reach out yourself

119
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,289
even just to the developers to the

120
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,060
product owners and eventually it does

121
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:32,810
trickle up because you are asking them

122
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,610
now to spend

123
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,080
their time that they don't get a bonus

124
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,389
for security they get a bonus for

125
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,310
delivering a feature how do you make

126
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:42,650
them see security as the feature to

127
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,090
deliver I've had customers that have

128
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:46,909
actually said the reason we went with

129
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:49,039
you over someone else was because of how

130
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:50,540
your security team and IT team came over

131
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,060
to us with the business side with the

132
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,260
sales side and showed how we take it

133
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,930
seriously and how we take their

134
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,490
information seriously so you have a huge

135
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:01,160
opportunity that most companies don't

136
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:03,980
take right now right now I've just

137
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,050
definitely I've seen as well so to get

138
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:08,090
more folks outside of it was second

139
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:10,190
volved what are some ways that we might

140
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:12,020
be able to do that to get some of the

141
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:13,760
you know the people that aren't security

142
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,340
people and don't care about security on

143
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,620
a day to day basis well some of the ways

144
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:21,049
to do that is literally why do they care

145
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:23,330
why should they care about security so

146
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:26,419
you can't go and say here's all the cool

147
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:29,750
shiny tools we have here's all the fun

148
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:31,880
dashboards all the radar screens but you

149
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,320
sure like here's the issues that affect

150
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,510
your environment here's the threats that

151
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,070
affect you here's what we're gonna try

152
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:39,590
to do to partner with you as an actual

153
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:41,840
partnership to make sure it doesn't

154
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,789
happen well answer your questions we'll

155
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,190
take your feedback the rather than

156
00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:48,500
security mandating thou shalt do an

157
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:50,120
application scan it's let's learn how

158
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,010
your application works and figure out

159
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,080
where we can target how do we work with

160
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:55,760
your developers how do we work with the

161
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,550
product team to make sure that a feature

162
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,639
that's being built is done right and how

163
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:05,660
do we make security an actual feature of

164
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:07,100
your application right awesome so I

165
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,720
noticed you mentioned your abstract that

166
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,460
security is everyone's job which is one

167
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,270
of my mantras that I love thinking on

168
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,770
and so what are some examples where

169
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:18,200
security is everyone's job where it's

170
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:19,070
beyond just you know your job or you

171
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,200
know the person who's finding

172
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:23,150
vulnerabilities are looking for breaches

173
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,190
or red teaming or whatever else how can

174
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:28,520
it be the developers job or the CEOs job

175
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:32,000
or what not well Equifax is my favorite

176
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,650
example always you have the architect

177
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,690
that could have looked and said maybe we

178
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:38,299
should have our database on a separate

179
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:40,280
server than the web server so that there

180
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,770
needs to be some type of defense and

181
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,960
death a lot of times devs don't think

182
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:46,159
about that a lot and it's not a knock on

183
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,039
them it's you got

184
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,140
get stuff out you're working on that not

185
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,870
everyone gets trained so what we try to

186
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:57,110
do and everywhere I go we try to do is

187
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:59,240
make sure we get training for developers

188
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:00,860
with the training we make sure that

189
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,750
they're involved with the security

190
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,880
system as much as we can we want to make

191
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,440
it self-service let them feel they're

192
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,240
involved that they have a voice and they

193
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,140
take a lot more ownership no matter

194
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,450
where the whether they're on the

195
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,890
business side or the technical side so

196
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:14,719
get them into training to learn the

197
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,760
security tools instead of hoarding all

198
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,310
the access think I'm only gonna run

199
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,870
these vulnerability scans myself give

200
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:23,090
them that ability audit what they do

201
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:25,670
help them out so that you free up your

202
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:27,409
time to run more targeted tests that try

203
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:30,010
to break their business logic and let

204
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:33,230
them do some of the more automated

205
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:35,599
useful tests get them to conferences

206
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:39,140
send them 200 apps X send them to

207
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,640
blackhat or whatever Def Con they need

208
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,870
to be out there going we're trying to

209
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,280
make sure that some of our lawyers are

210
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:45,410
going to these conferences so that they

211
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,469
see what is the risk to them what is the

212
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:51,380
risk to the company with gdpr coming out

213
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:52,820
that's a huge buzz word now and now

214
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,040
everyone's looking how do we secure all

215
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,180
of this data I've gotten more requests

216
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:02,060
from lawyers in the last couple months

217
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:03,290
than I have in years right right so how

218
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,580
does it what role does threat

219
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,169
intelligence play in all this I know she

220
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:09,650
mentioned that threat intelligence nerd

221
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:11,900
abstract so for intelligence is trying

222
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:14,210
to be a little predictive of what's

223
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,469
gonna happen so for example depending on

224
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:18,349
your industry if you're in the energy

225
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:20,660
industry you see right now the US has

226
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:23,210
accused certain countries of espionage

227
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:25,340
and of trying to break in you see these

228
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:27,680
types of cases throughout the world if

229
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:29,210
you have that Intel of operations

230
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,650
happening different vulnerabilities that

231
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:33,679
might affect you and where they may come

232
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:35,929
from that's how you prioritize I can't

233
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,478
go to my management and say I need

234
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:39,500
budget to fix everything everywhere I'm

235
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,260
gonna be told to pick and choose my

236
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,210
battles that Intel helps drive your

237
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,850
focus and figure out where do I focus my

238
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:48,620
time here's where a lot of attacks are

239
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:51,320
in the wild here's where I see

240
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,810
nation-state actors going after maybe

241
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:57,800
that's gonna be meat more important than

242
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:59,839
upgrading from Windows 2012 to 2016 on

243
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,819
these servers

244
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,970
there's it's all about prioritization

245
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:06,770
and you have to get people involved in

246
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:08,540
the intelligence though partner with

247
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:10,550
your physical security there's not just

248
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:12,589
cyber Intel make sure you provide

249
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,930
actionable reports that can go to the

250
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:16,670
business side here's what we're seeing I

251
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,829
know that you use this stack and there's

252
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,729
a huge exploit that came out and now

253
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,650
people are trying to install

254
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:24,260
cryptocurrency mining software if you

255
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:27,339
use this component I know you're

256
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:30,350
vulnerable let's talk about it right

257
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:31,550
examples all right well I'm very much

258
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,450
looking forward to seeing your talk it

259
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:35,329
sounds like you have a lot of great

260
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:37,040
content that goes behind this so looking

261
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:39,980
forward to seeing you at source Boston

262
