1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,650
hi this is Rob Sheen from the source

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,610
conference and I'm here with Walter

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,770
Williams who's the director of

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,299
information security at monotype and

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:18,140
he's going to be speaking at the source

6
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:22,460
Boston event on May 9th and 10th and his

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:24,980
talk is titled doing ISO 27001 with CICS

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:27,830
CSC as the control set which I found in

9
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:29,689
an intriguing idea so how did you get

10
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:35,060
the idea to kind of Frankenstein these

11
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:36,650
two standards together laughs yeah I had

12
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:41,200
an opportunity of meeting the folks

13
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:44,239
behind the CISC SCE of standard and

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,610
learned that this wasn't just your

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,980
standard laundry checklist of security

16
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:50,660
controls which is how it came across to

17
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,910
me when I was published by hands

18
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:56,239
turns out that the folks behind the

19
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:57,769
standard are working with the security

20
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,320
research community especially the

21
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:02,450
Incident Response community to take the

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,549
lessons learned from breach responses

23
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:08,659
and to catalog it into a set of controls

24
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:11,420
the problem with the CIS CSC is however

25
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:17,030
that there is no maid of the order date

26
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:20,090
against it I I used 27001 somewhat

27
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:22,310
solves that problem it's always been a

28
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:24,679
modular standard well most people who

29
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:27,409
implement it just blindly and without

30
00:01:24,679 --> 00:01:29,329
thinking implement dice of 27th of a

31
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:32,149
lock - is the control set there's

32
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:34,008
nothing in 27 to block long which is to

33
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:36,920
establish a management system that gets

34
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:39,170
audited that mandates that you use the

35
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,749
eyesore 27th of allowed to control set

36
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:45,079
you can use any controls that you want

37
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:48,499
and so the you thought was he was away

38
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:52,520
putting in place the control set that

39
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:54,979
would help our organization as much as

40
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,859
any controls that can prevent data

41
00:01:54,979 --> 00:02:00,740
breaches while in the process putting in

42
00:01:57,859 --> 00:02:03,889
place and battle management systems so

43
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,958
that I can measure its success I'd

44
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:08,720
report on that the senior management

45
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:11,150
I've incorporated in part of my risk

46
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,989
management framework but also most

47
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:17,290
importantly provide a mechanism of how

48
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:18,860
to be reviewed by a third party

49
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:21,679
so that

50
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:24,290
we can demonstrate to our customers to

51
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,480
our business partners that these

52
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:29,239
controls are being put in place

53
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,579
rigorously one of the things I've always

54
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,550
liked about the ISO standard is that

55
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:36,110
it's again it's not a list check boxes

56
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,750
on my pci-dss

57
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:41,780
or nests you'll require it on an annual

58
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:45,410
basis to show that you not only measured

59
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:47,990
your successes and CICS he gives you a

60
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:50,480
very very lovely set of metrics to do

61
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:53,390
that against their control set but that

62
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:57,130
each year you've made efforts to improve

63
00:02:53,390 --> 00:03:00,549
upon your successes from the prior year

64
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:03,859
so the idea of constant continuous

65
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:07,280
improvement of your security program is

66
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:09,620
somewhat unique to ISO and it just

67
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,709
enhances the value of what you get out

68
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:14,900
of the control so especially with the

69
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:18,380
way that they've redone the controls in

70
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:20,990
the version seven of the critical

71
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:24,769
security controls the metrics in version

72
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:27,470
7 are designed around maturity they're

73
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:29,180
designed with the flaws that our

74
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:32,060
security is a journey it's not a

75
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:35,920
destination so over time you're going to

76
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:39,050
be enhancing your control set they

77
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,500
pointed their measurements against the

78
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:47,620
six simple principles where over time

79
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:51,530
you would move from much as possible

80
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:55,519
simple level six that fits in very

81
00:03:51,530 --> 00:04:01,959
nicely with Isis for constant

82
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,959
improvement and provide security measure

83
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:08,208
right right so the the talk didn't

84
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,920
really intrigued me because I've always

85
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:12,350
thought of twenty seven thousand one and

86
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,679
two and you know their predecessors as

87
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:17,478
being kind of inseparable thing so it's

88
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,519
it's a really intriguing idea to swap

89
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:21,320
out a different control set so for those

90
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,650
that don't maybe aren't as familiar with

91
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:28,400
27001 and CIS CSC could you just provide

92
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:30,710
likelike a 50,000 foot view of what each

93
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,210
control set has like literally like a

94
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,659
couple sentences on each one just people

95
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,930
can understand

96
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,550
the difference really 27th of a lot WOM

97
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:41,210
is about putting in place a management

98
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:42,980
system it has no controls it whatsoever

99
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,840
so you're doing risk management you're

100
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,430
doing a security awareness you're

101
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,950
measuring the effectiveness of your

102
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:50,750
controls you want porting on these to

103
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:53,090
the appropriate levels of management

104
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:57,230
that management carries whether or not

105
00:04:53,090 --> 00:05:00,219
you're being successful or not and that

106
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:04,880
you put in place a process to handle

107
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:08,840
when things go get broken 27th of about

108
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:11,570
2 is this this prescriptive set of

109
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,150
technical controls that most security

110
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:16,490
standards but it requires things such as

111
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:19,609
you undergo penetration test you have a

112
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:22,010
security and incident response 5 you

113
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:26,740
evaluate your third-party vendors you

114
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:30,800
onboard and off-board employees properly

115
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:33,740
the is CSC doesn't do all of those

116
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,530
things it's really organized around

117
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:40,820
breach response but what they've done

118
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:43,789
for you is they've pre set up a mapping

119
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:46,340
between their standard and NIST their

120
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:50,180
standard ISO principle about to their

121
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:53,659
standard PCI DSS etc so that you can see

122
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:55,430
where the gaps would be so what you want

123
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:58,570
to do is you're putting together our

124
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:00,800
management system so that you're

125
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:03,320
properly managing risk in your

126
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,480
enterprise if you want to take a look at

127
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,669
that gap between where the CIS yes he

128
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:11,630
begins and ends and understands the

129
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:13,909
places where it doesn't cover so as an

130
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:15,830
example there's nothing in the CSC about

131
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:18,500
employee onboarding or or waiting

132
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:22,880
there's nothing in the CIS DSC about

133
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:25,430
third-party risk evaluation because the

134
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,520
standard is entirely focused on data

135
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:31,669
breach prevention when he said in the

136
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,710
blog - doesn't have anything in it that

137
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:34,870
would require you to use into Web

138
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,859
Application Firewall

139
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:39,169
twenty-seventh of allowed to doesn't

140
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:41,450
have anything in it that requires you to

141
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:45,409
do both static and dynamic testing of

142
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:46,340
your applications 27 to broad - in other

143
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,860
words

144
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:51,260
is written a bit more abstractly about

145
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,630
how you implement technical controls

146
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:56,110
with the thoughts that pure cutting

147
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:59,930
place those controls that manage risk

148
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:03,620
while the Yahoo the CIS ESC controls

149
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:07,400
were specifically written to control the

150
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:11,060
risk of database and then you can put in

151
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:16,310
place pardon me are the controls I've

152
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:19,130
been from 27.2 or PCI DSS that are

153
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:21,169
appropriate team organization so if you

154
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:22,990
have third parties that you need to

155
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:28,130
evaluate you'll want to put in place

156
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:30,979
something in the way of that will have

157
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:34,580
nothing to do with CIS e se but it will

158
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:39,500
become part of your management system if

159
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:42,109
you have need to terminate employees or

160
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,729
even more importantly the need to move

161
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:46,250
an employee from one position to another

162
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:48,800
and ensure that they no longer have the

163
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,720
access rates they had before well those

164
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,740
are things that are covered to a point

165
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,330
inside of CIS CSC so you've got a

166
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,850
one-to-one mapping between those

167
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:01,840
controls in the CA SE se and those

168
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:06,349
controls that are nice of 27 devote to

169
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:09,310
alright if you're if you have an

170
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:11,810
environment that has the requirement be

171
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:14,210
NIST compliance because you're doing

172
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:17,330
business which by the government then

173
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:19,219
obviously you would want to look at the

174
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:22,820
mapping stupid ground either one of the

175
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:26,870
kick the mappings to this cybersecurity

176
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:30,400
framework or to SB hundred - 53 and

177
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:32,719
similar documents well again this

178
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,020
internet security gives you those

179
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,020
mappings

180
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,830
you want to be careful a little bit

181
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:42,589
about using those mappings because

182
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:45,320
they're one way they don't tell you the

183
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:48,980
things that come out of the CIA SC SC

184
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,980
that are not represented inside of these

185
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:55,690
other standards so if you have the

186
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:59,000
requirement to be missed or PCI DSS or

187
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,690
etc component you didn't want to make

188
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,520
certain

189
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:05,450
you've gone through done that gap

190
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:08,720
analysis yourself and put in place the

191
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:11,120
appropriate controls that go beyond what

192
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,120
the assessment of that security is

193
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,410
recommending so that you can do more

194
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:24,710
with your information security

195
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:27,050
management system then just right so one

196
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:29,360
thing I'm curious about is what

197
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:32,449
environments would it be appropriate to

198
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,130
swap out the control set for one for the

199
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:36,710
other because I know like a lot of

200
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:39,200
vendors might require you to be 27001

201
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:42,260
and to compliant or at least 27001

202
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,180
audited you know if that's true are they

203
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,530
going to easily accept that you've

204
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:48,140
swapped out the controls etc you're

205
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:49,310
gonna have to do a lot of explaining I'm

206
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,590
actually gonna have to do that

207
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:54,199
explaining to buy auditor to my third

208
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:56,960
party one of the things about cleaning

209
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:59,950
up the iso reports is that the end

210
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:05,300
result is a certification of compliance

211
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:10,400
and my responsibility is to make certain

212
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:12,920
that I met the full requirements of the

213
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,380
standard which includes by the way that

214
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:18,319
I have done that cap analysis of mapping

215
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:20,480
back to 27th of about two and then I'm

216
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:25,100
putting in place appropriate controls to

217
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:27,230
manage risk so if I if I have the

218
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,090
requirement of the third-party vendor

219
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,410
risk analysis and that's not going to

220
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:32,660
come from the Center for Internet

221
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:35,449
Security standard I need to have

222
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:39,350
something in place to do that I'm still

223
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:42,680
going to need to have the rigors of the

224
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:45,230
full price of $27 to control set

225
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,449
available to me but because I've

226
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:50,210
replaced controls where there is mapping

227
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:53,620
with something more precise I can have

228
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:56,270
more deliberately designed controls

229
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,790
around things such as application

230
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:02,120
security where I need to now demonstrate

231
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:04,550
that I am doing a static analysis but

232
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:07,010
I'm doing dynamic testing that I have a

233
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:08,900
web application firewall a place things

234
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:11,660
that I said doesn't require things that

235
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,390
NIST doesn't require things that PCI is

236
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:17,140
DSS doesn't require

237
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:22,029
but you come very much out of all of

238
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:23,319
these insecurities cool so it sounds

239
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:25,510
like it's more of making sure the

240
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,130
controls are appropriate then having it

241
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,630
be any specific well that's actually

242
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:31,450
cool because it sounds like this

243
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:33,399
actually is a plus plus version of take

244
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,750
you know takes the baseline of 27001

245
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,829
makes it better rather than just

246
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,380
swapping it up for something completely

247
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:41,859
different so I like this yeah that was

248
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:43,689
my foot exactly kind of about the

249
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,490
management system around the center for

250
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:49,360
internet security is critical control

251
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:52,779
set and allow it to become an auditable

252
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,089
standard to areas that in the existing

253
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:59,230
incarnation of the different security

254
00:11:55,089 --> 00:12:01,089
standard our missing gaps brandy there's

255
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,829
the fact of conversation within the

256
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:04,839
center deferring to that security as to

257
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:07,899
whether or not they need to go there and

258
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:10,300
future videos but Ison provides me in

259
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:12,310
that with a path to do that now and the

260
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,649
best thing of our life so is it's an

261
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:17,260
internationally recognized standard and

262
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:19,810
if implemented properly allows me to

263
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:23,800
demonstrate compliance with external law

264
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:28,000
such as the gtp are a factor of a number

265
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:30,969
I don't want to say hints from some of

266
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,949
the European of member nations but darn

267
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:35,709
close to hints that they're going to be

268
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:38,310
looking for organisations to certify as

269
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:42,489
ISO compliant as a mechanism to

270
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:44,290
demonstrate compliance right so this

271
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,420
gets ourselves a little bit ahead of

272
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:47,980
that game awesome

273
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:50,640
yeah that's definitely going to be a big

274
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,870
thing going forward for focus oh well

275
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,939
all right well I look forward to seeing

276
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:57,339
your talk and we'll be seeing you at

277
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,990
source Boston so for those of you

278
00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:00,550
watching in if you want to come continue

279
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:05,290
this conversation or learn more about

280
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:09,870
ISO 27001 or two and D is CSC come and

281
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:14,160
see Walter stock at source Boston in May

282
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:14,160
all right talk soon thanks
