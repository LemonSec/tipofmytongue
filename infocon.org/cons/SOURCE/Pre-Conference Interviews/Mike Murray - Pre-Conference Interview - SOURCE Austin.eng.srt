00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,110
hi this is Rob Sheen from the source

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,879
conference and I'm here with Mike Murray

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,160
who is the chief security officer of

5
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:18,990
lookout and he's gonna be speaking at

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,119
source Austin on December 5th and 6th

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,909
and his he's doing a keynote called a

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,660
blip in time the birth life and death of

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:29,820
the security perimeter which is uh I

10
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:31,110
can't wait to see this talk dude we've

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,090
been talking about the death of the

12
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:35,190
security perimeter almost as long as

13
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,539
I've been in the security field and I've

14
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,110
been in the security field for a long

15
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:41,339
time so I'm curious to hear it you're

16
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,109
gonna kind of go through the history of

17
00:00:41,339 --> 00:00:47,550
the network perimeter and how its kind

18
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:48,929
of evolved in basically declined yes I'm

19
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,140
pretty excited about this one too this

20
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:53,460
is this is a new talk for me and you're

21
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,359
right we've been talking about this for

22
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,519
a long time but I think I I've come to

23
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,199
them to believe something that my

24
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:04,199
grandmother used to tell me when I was a

25
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,610
kid about those dooms those who don't

26
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,250
learn from history are doomed to repeat

27
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:12,450
it and and I've spent a lot of time

28
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,860
lately thinking about I spent a lot of

29
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,720
time thinking about what the world is

30
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,610
like now that the perimeter is not

31
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,770
necessarily as interesting but that led

32
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,450
me to think a lot about how do we get a

33
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,179
perimeter in the first place

34
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:27,630
what was it in the pre perimeter times

35
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:30,180
that caused us to go with this sort of

36
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:33,660
moat and drawbridge approach to security

37
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:36,240
as a general principle and and then as

38
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:39,420
we've moved towards a world of mobility

39
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:43,320
and of cloud how that moat and Castle

40
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:46,440
approach really has died and and you

41
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,910
know I I hate to be I hate to be one of

42
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,100
those people right I remember when

43
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:54,270
Richard steamin got up and said IDs is

44
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,190
dead in about 2002 and people spent the

45
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,110
next five years telling him how IDs

46
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:00,210
wasn't dead even though he turned out to

47
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,360
be right I mean you know look at where

48
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:05,399
we are now with with and and SSL and

49
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,908
start pinning everywhere and all of that

50
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,929
it makes IDs nearly impossible I was

51
00:02:08,908 --> 00:02:11,760
right he might have just been a little

52
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,900
early I don't want to be in that same

53
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,120
boat but I think it's really interesting

54
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,430
to look at how we got to where we were

55
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,050
why we built perimeters in the first

56
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,350
place and what that means for the future

57
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:24,300
especially as now

58
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,340
I'm is likely to be connecting on this

59
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,040
device as I am to be connecting on a

60
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,960
laptop and frankly this device doesn't

61
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,450
really store anything so I'm probably

62
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,700
not behind a perimeter I don't have a

63
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,810
perimeter and it's connected to a whole

64
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,600
bunch of services that are not

65
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:42,330
themselves behind my perimeter so it's

66
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,250
an interesting it's an interesting

67
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,680
history that we've lived I mean you and

68
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,580
I have been doing this for a long time

69
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,680
you know I've known each other for a

70
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,650
long time I starting to feel old every

71
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,510
time I see some of my friends but they

72
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,430
it's it's just to me a really

73
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,560
interesting way to think about the world

74
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,570
and I think understanding where we came

75
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,770
from and and where we're most recently

76
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:05,340
coming from will tell us a lot about

77
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:07,110
where we go yes interesting you're doing

78
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,250
is talk is um Harry spread love from

79
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,530
edge wise is gonna be doing a talk on

80
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,720
zero trust and it's kind of a similar

81
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:15,450
take on the network of perimeter is dead

82
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,900
and I mentioned to him how back in the

83
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:23,070
at stake is Dan Gere got up in a meeting

84
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,750
and basically in around 2000 or so it

85
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,250
was like the network perimeter is dead

86
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,690
you know it's basically we're all gonna

87
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,520
be doing end-to-end encryption and

88
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,140
everything else and it was so far ahead

89
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,900
of its time when he mentioned it then

90
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,890
but I feel like we're kind of there now

91
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:38,490
yeah that's what Harry and I talked

92
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:41,750
about that on our podcast but this to me

93
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:44,430
this ties into the issue of insider

94
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:46,140
threat in a lot of ways because

95
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,320
historically I know from my customer is

96
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,399
very very frequently even now I'll go

97
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,019
into companies and talk to them about

98
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,000
their security and they're like oh well

99
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,100
you know we have this perimeter and we

100
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,510
have we trust our people and especially

101
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,190
if it's like a smaller company where

102
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:02,070
they know everybody they have all these

103
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,720
misconceptions I'm like well that's what

104
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,040
if they do get in what if someone gets

105
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,750
in pretending that they're you all that

106
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,730
stuff like why is it been so hard for us

107
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,470
to get people to see that well I think

108
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:13,470
we keep doing things like calling it

109
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:15,420
zero trust right the idea of zero trust

110
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,160
is a really interesting one but there's

111
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,719
no such thing as zero trust if my

112
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,070
company doesn't have some amount of

113
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,260
trust for me they don't even give me

114
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,240
email you know there there is some

115
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,789
amount of trust now what we're saying is

116
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,470
with the zero trust is the device is no

117
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,870
longer trusted but you're still trusting

118
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,580
the identity so if I can get on your

119
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:36,240
device when you are logged into the

120
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:38,070
corporate set of resources I am suddenly

121
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,930
even in as your quote-unquote zero trust

122
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:42,780
environment if I have if I have root

123
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:45,720
access on your MacBook and your MacBook

124
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,909
is logged into workday and your email

125
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,350
and your calendar and slack and all of

126
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:52,080
these things I'm logged into those

127
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:54,000
things too and so the idea of zero trust

128
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,289
is kind of a bit of a misnomer and so

129
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,240
you know we have all these people

130
00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:00,150
running around talking about zero trust

131
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,910
specifically where what they really mean

132
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,950
is the device is no longer trusted but

133
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:06,660
we still have to trust the user and that

134
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,770
makes a really interesting sort of

135
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,840
contradiction in terms

136
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:12,090
I think Microsoft was the ones that set

137
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,619
identity is the new perimeter and I

138
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,080
think that that's a little bit cheesy

139
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,660
but I think there's a lot to it there's

140
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,330
a lot to understanding the interplay

141
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,340
between the user themselves and the

142
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,229
device especially as the device is

143
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,969
becoming an Authenticator for the user

144
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:30,270
with things like face ID and

145
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:33,000
fingerprints the identity is becoming

146
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:35,789
established by that device but that that

147
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,650
actually it's it's funny this is this is

148
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:39,240
why where I came to a lot of this this

149
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:42,060
it feels like a lot of back to the

150
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,370
future to me Tim Kamini who was the CTO

151
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,500
at n circle when I was there now is a

152
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,210
distinguished engineer at Cisco and and

153
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:52,500
spends a lot of time on problems like

154
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:56,099
this I think was probably 2007 or 2006

155
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,930
ish where he wrote a hero to talk and

156
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,660
did a talk called fire suits not

157
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:03,570
firewalls with the idea that the device

158
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:07,890
and the person in it would become the

159
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:10,530
central the central locus of network in

160
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:14,219
C roll right that the device itself

161
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:17,190
asked to both establish identity for the

162
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:19,800
for the user that's using the device as

163
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:22,590
well as have enough self protection to

164
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,470
be able to offer an assurance that if I

165
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:27,210
log in with with face ID on my iPhone

166
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:28,980
that doesn't mean that I've just given

167
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,810
the person that's running Pegasus

168
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:33,630
software on my iPhone because they

169
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:36,030
fished me and popped my iPhone that

170
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:37,920
they're now not authenticated to all of

171
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:40,289
my services right that they can't steal

172
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,780
my two factors okay actually fun one I

173
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:45,450
spoke to commerce at Congress a few

174
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:48,330
weeks ago and did it we did a demo of

175
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:49,289
hacking phones and one of the the demo

176
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,089
we did was

177
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:53,159
actually it's really eye-opening to

178
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:56,509
think about the importance of the device

179
00:06:53,159 --> 00:07:01,740
in the new world what we did was we

180
00:06:56,509 --> 00:07:03,479
routed the iPhone and stole the Google

181
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,199
Authenticator two-factor token and

182
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:08,789
cloned it to a second phone

183
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:10,289
you know we spend a lot of time doing a

184
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:12,899
really great job telling everybody that

185
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:15,899
two-factor off is their best way but now

186
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:17,879
they've moved to a place where okay

187
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:19,860
two-factor off so if your laptop is

188
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:22,169
popped we still need you to login with

189
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,779
this but then if I can if I can pop this

190
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:26,128
device now I have your two-factor token

191
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:29,490
and I can steal that I can go bu

192
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:31,499
anywhere and it's really interesting to

193
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,819
see the interplay between identity and

194
00:07:31,499 --> 00:07:34,619
device health and I think that that's

195
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:36,990
actually a lot of the things that I'm

196
00:07:34,619 --> 00:07:38,669
going to talk about is is it around you

197
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,319
know the evolution of the perimeter was

198
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:42,990
because we couldn't trust the devices

199
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,149
themselves to be secure and if we're

200
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:47,639
moving away from a world of device of

201
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:50,249
hard you know hard crunchy outside soft

202
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,719
soft chewy inside we have to find a way

203
00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:54,300
that the devices start to become self

204
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:56,279
defending or at least can alert in the

205
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,870
scenario where they're not right where

206
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:00,240
they're where their ability to establish

207
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:03,979
identity in a secure ways is somewhat

208
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,059
compromised or or presents risk you know

209
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:08,550
you know so what I'm hearing from you is

210
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:10,379
like a lot of technology leaps that we

211
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:12,360
need to make so do you think this is

212
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:14,809
fundamentally a technology issue or an

213
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,069
education issue dude is there anything

214
00:08:14,809 --> 00:08:19,050
you you would have to do this to like

215
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:25,259
you that was a that was a setup because

216
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:28,769
you know that III think for as long as

217
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:30,869
we are building technology to support

218
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:33,828
humans and systems that humans build

219
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:36,599
this is a systems and a human problem

220
00:08:33,828 --> 00:08:38,429
and as long as we're in that scenario

221
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,560
all right as long as we're in that place

222
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:42,029
I don't think that there's ever just a

223
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,828
technology problem I think all

224
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:46,470
technology problems fundamentally come

225
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:49,859
down to people in systems and you know

226
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:51,959
and and I I look I'm a technologist

227
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,370
right I love technology but I love

228
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:55,529
technology because of what it does for

229
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:56,790
my people in my systems so what are some

230
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:58,079
things we can do to more broadly get

231
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:02,069
that message out then because I can tell

232
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:02,910
you from my own experience that ninety

233
00:09:02,069 --> 00:09:05,160
plus

234
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,640
percent of people have not gotten this

235
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,110
message yet and that's being generous

236
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,490
yeah you're being very generous I think

237
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:14,880
it's a lot higher than that I think I

238
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:17,280
think there's a fundamental incentive

239
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,920
mismatch to use it to sound like an

240
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,870
economist for a half second I think one

241
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,270
of the problems with this is that most

242
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:27,360
of us and I am a prime example of this

243
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:29,280
and and I always talk about this when

244
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,040
I'm talking about careers in security

245
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,930
and careers especially managers in in

246
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,020
the security realm and of the technology

247
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:39,420
realm most of us in fact almost all of

248
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:41,880
us I think it's probably akin to your

249
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:44,160
98% most of us didn't get into

250
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,689
technology because we like people right

251
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,430
we got into technology because we were

252
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:49,770
the nerdy kids who sat with a book most

253
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:51,209
of the time or sat would rather sit on a

254
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:54,840
computer in the corner with our

255
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:56,730
headphones on then go you know to a bar

256
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,680
and talk to a whole bunch of strangers I

257
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,990
mean you wanna you want to see me

258
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,150
terrified I could speak to a room of

259
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,590
10,000 people relatively easily but

260
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,870
asked me to go stand at a cocktail party

261
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:09,870
and talk and I'm just like no thank you

262
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:11,160
and and yet I've spent a lot of time

263
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:13,110
trying to be good at that because I

264
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,520
realized the thing about people in

265
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:16,530
systems I think a lot of the people I

266
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,640
know you have to write you're you're

267
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:20,459
somebody who's really good at those

268
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,260
things as well and but a lot of the

269
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,580
people who got into technology got into

270
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,040
technology because they didn't want to

271
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:29,430
deal with people in systems and you know

272
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:31,290
now they're a see ISO or a CTO or a CIO

273
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,300
and they're still the same right we

274
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:35,370
don't we don't ever change if you know

275
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,770
I'm still the same shy introvert I was

276
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:40,380
in sixth grade I just had to work really

277
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:42,150
hard to be better at it because I

278
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,340
realized the value of people in systems

279
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:46,020
and I think that you know we're starting

280
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,730
from behind if you go talk to a bunch of

281
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,620
HR people they're not going to give you

282
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,270
a technological products Ellucian to the

283
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,460
problem because naturally there are

284
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,750
people people right if you go talk to a

285
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,730
bunch of people who are in technology

286
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,080
they didn't get into technology because

287
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,190
they liked humans so of course they're

288
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:02,580
gonna give you a technological solution

289
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:04,710
right right yeah yeah it's interesting

290
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,330
you know those of your spot-on with some

291
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:08,250
of the things about you know people I

292
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,750
actually started out as you know the

293
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,000
geek would you know my face in the book

294
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:16,050
as well it turns out over time though I

295
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,589
actually turns out I like people so

296
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:20,880
I kind of have a talent for it just when

297
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:22,200
you kind of figure out you like to talk

298
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,510
to people then you put yourself in

299
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,640
positions where you get to so that's

300
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,810
kind of what I've done and that's kind

301
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,360
of why we've evolved the conference the

302
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:32,369
way we have as well to try to create an

303
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,529
environment where it's easy to interact

304
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:36,600
with people and you know address some of

305
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:38,220
the harder people stuff cuz people tend

306
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,630
to discount that stuff is not important

307
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,940
but it's kind of in my opinion at this

308
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:43,140
point the most important is like how do

309
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,850
you actually talk to another human being

310
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,100
and you know getting practice in doing

311
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:50,250
that I kind of stuff man I got the best

312
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:52,410
advice about conferences from from FX at

313
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:54,300
a Caesars Challenge one night in Vegas

314
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:56,640
when I was early on in my career

315
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,589
FX said one of the best things and and

316
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,209
I'm saying this fully fully knowing that

317
00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:02,250
I'm a I'm a guy who speaks at a lot of

318
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:04,140
conferences he said look like they

319
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,880
record the conference talks they don't

320
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,500
record the hallway talks the hallway

321
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,839
talks are the most important thing when

322
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,730
you go to any event yeah and I was like

323
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,649
that was eye-opening to me and I think

324
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:15,089
you know you're right the one of the

325
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,890
best things about source and one of the

326
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:18,600
things that that has always been present

327
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:20,430
but I know you're continuing to make

328
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,200
this happen is the ability to connect

329
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:24,750
with your peers and actually like

330
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,089
communicate and and get out from behind

331
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,950
the book and you know I'm the worst at

332
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:30,450
this like I'm gonna fly to Europe

333
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,040
tonight I'm gonna put on the big

334
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:35,430
headphones and I'm gonna do my best not

335
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:37,560
to take them off for like 14 hours and

336
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:39,420
talk to like three people in that time

337
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,189
but when I get to be in an environment

338
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,560
with people that are really awesome and

339
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:45,990
group of my peers that's a time when

340
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,449
when I love to actually engage and love

341
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:49,860
to spend time with it so I'm I'm really

342
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:51,270
looking forward to Austin for that

343
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,130
reason as well you know it's it's

344
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,290
networking and it's opportunities to see

345
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:56,760
and talk to people for me too so it's

346
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:58,260
really cool awesome

347
