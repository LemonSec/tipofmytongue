1
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,490
hi this is rob machine with a source

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,680
conference I'm here with Megan Roddy and

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,360
she is a cyber security analyst at the

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,689
Texas Department of Public Safety and

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,000
she's gonna be speaking at the source

6
00:00:16,689 --> 00:00:21,910
Phoenix Mesa event coming up on February

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,160
28th and March 1st and she's a really

8
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,600
interesting talk on strengthening your

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,430
SEC ups team by leveraging

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,140
neurodiversity which is a fascinating

11
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,460
topic when I read your abstract so I'm

12
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,558
really curious if you could tell us a

13
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:35,860
little bit about your talk and what it's

14
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:37,959
about yeah so basically what I'm talking

15
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:41,470
about it's a combination of personal

16
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,750
experience and research I've done so I

17
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:46,330
have Asperger's a form of

18
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:48,489
high-functioning autism and I found that

19
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:50,739
I and many other individuals with

20
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:55,809
high-functioning autism succeed very

21
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:58,959
well in the cybersecurity IT industry so

22
00:00:55,809 --> 00:01:01,959
I'm talking I talk a bit about what I've

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,659
experienced myself and also I've reached

24
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,720
out to people on Twitter and asked for

25
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:10,870
their opinions and also done research

26
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:13,690
into the statistics of InfoSec

27
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:16,390
individuals with high-functioning autism

28
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:19,450
so I discussed the challenges and the

29
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:22,360
benefits and a lot of suggestions on how

30
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:25,240
managers should slightly alter their

31
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,070
managing style to get the most out of

32
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,429
these employees because one managed

33
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:33,250
right they can offer an abundance of

34
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:36,909
skill and extra work to their workplace

35
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:37,810
great great now I imagine out in the

36
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:39,820
wild there's probably a lot of

37
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:41,890
misconceptions about autism and

38
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,330
Asperger's what are some big

39
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,770
misconceptions that you've seen that

40
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,220
people have that you'd like to have a

41
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:50,890
chance to correct I mean the main reason

42
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:54,130
I think in the one that I'm the reason

43
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:56,380
I'm giving this talk is just people look

44
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:59,619
at the side effects and they look at is

45
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:01,270
an illness or disease or disorder rather

46
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:04,570
than just something we're living with

47
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:07,210
and they don't want to look or they just

48
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:10,538
don't think about the fact that some of

49
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:15,640
the things that our weaknesses are also

50
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:19,179
benefits to them what are some things

51
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,779
that that folks with various degrees of

52
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,819
as

53
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,860
Berger's autism might actually do better

54
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:26,619
than folks that don't have it

55
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:29,650
well our brains are very logical and

56
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:31,590
while that's a can be considered a

57
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,330
weakness when it comes to social skills

58
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:36,250
when we're looking at computers

59
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:38,620
information technology information

60
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:41,500
security we have a very wet logical way

61
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:44,410
of prostates seeing the information and

62
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,959
we're also very thorough so one example

63
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:49,959
of a role that people we with like us

64
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,420
are would be good at an InfoSec would be

65
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:54,540
like quality assurance because we'll go

66
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:58,149
over everything with a fine-tooth comb

67
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:02,549
so that's one example of things that are

68
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:05,350
our strengths so even though our logical

69
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:07,569
straightforward thinking can be a

70
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,579
weakness in certain social situations it

71
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:12,839
does become good when we're working in

72
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:15,670
information technology right right now

73
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:19,090
it sounds like there's specific roles

74
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:20,910
that are really well-suited for folks

75
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,959
that are very logical thinking anyway so

76
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,579
are there specific things employers

77
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,560
should be doing differently to try to

78
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:28,630
target certain types of folks to be in

79
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,049
certain types of roles yeah so one of

80
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:34,510
the things because a recent survey

81
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:37,600
showed that 1% of individuals with

82
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:39,730
autism are employed and that is not

83
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,200
because only 1% are capable of being

84
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:44,320
employed yes there's people in the

85
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,089
spectrum that cannot be employed just

86
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,430
because they're on the lower functioning

87
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,850
end but a lot of us are high-functioning

88
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:56,170
and part of the reason for the low

89
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:58,269
employment rate is interviews so not

90
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:03,970
only having interviews but getting

91
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:06,910
interviews because the way that in a lot

92
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:10,000
of individuals with autism read job

93
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:12,549
applications or job postings again very

94
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,040
logical so if it says something very

95
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:16,780
specific and narrow like they're gonna

96
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,130
go oh I can't apply for that they don't

97
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:19,659
have the same thinking of like the

98
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,488
general population where it's like oh

99
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,500
well I have three years experience

100
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:24,969
they're asking for four but I might as

101
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,310
well put in because maybe they haven't

102
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,320
found anyone I see four years experience

103
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,300
ago while I don't have four years next

104
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,639
so it's hard to get into the field

105
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:36,370
because it's hard to find a job posting

106
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:39,280
you feel you can fulfill because really

107
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:41,830
job postings they they're posted with

108
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,859
unrealistic expectations they're looking

109
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:46,448
for the perfect candidate but a lot of

110
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,370
people will apply for them in general

111
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:50,819
because why not just because you're a

112
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:53,860
little bit off on experience or skills

113
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:56,050
right I mean job listings in general

114
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,689
tend to be unrealistic for everybody I

115
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,370
mean I remember when Java came out in

116
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:02,199
like three or four years into Java

117
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,939
people were posting job recs we're

118
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:06,550
looking for 10 years of Java experience

119
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:08,620
it's like it's not possible to have ones

120
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:15,099
that are like 10 years experience with

121
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:17,080
Windows Server 2012 r2 cool in a lot of

122
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:19,509
ways so it's difficult to find those

123
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:22,180
jobs so kind of if you're trying to look

124
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:24,069
for individuals this style kind of not

125
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,629
just be looser like look what you're

126
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:27,789
asking for but maybe you have a

127
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:31,089
disclaimer saying like feel free to

128
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:32,949
apply if you feel that you meet these

129
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:34,330
needs or something like that sure it

130
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:36,249
sounds like this probably education that

131
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,779
happened on both sides to so the

132
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:39,580
employers could be better at writing job

133
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:41,110
listings and maybe they could run

134
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,229
workshops and things to help train

135
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:47,159
people on you know how to you know

136
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:50,080
engage with employers and how does

137
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:52,629
organizations that work with individuals

138
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,460
even specifically focused on information

139
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:56,020
technology and information security

140
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:58,330
trying to get individuals into these

141
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,770
fields and so there are people

142
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,330
organizations working with these

143
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:03,128
individuals helping them find jobs

144
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,469
they'll teach some of the skills but

145
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:06,969
then also try and transition them into a

146
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:09,729
workplace that they think will be a good

147
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:11,259
fit right yeah over the years I've

148
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:13,568
definitely worked with some folks in the

149
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:15,219
security field that are on the spectrum

150
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:16,930
of high-functioning autism size

151
00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:18,370
definitely experienced it and they're

152
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,870
just people like everybody else they

153
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,339
just happen to think in a certain way

154
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,560
and be very focused in a certain way and

155
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,909
it's not necessarily a bad thing so when

156
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,889
I saw your talk is like oh I don't think

157
00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:28,870
I've ever even heard of anybody doing a

158
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:30,279
talk like that at a conference and I

159
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,199
know you've given it a couple places but

160
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:33,789
not too many so this is definitely

161
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:37,539
something that you're on the

162
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:39,068
up-and-coming list of like talks that

163
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:40,659
should be being talked about so I love

164
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:43,629
having things like that it's source so

165
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:46,639
I'm glad somebody recommended I give a

166
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:50,569
talk so I gave it at one of the

167
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,310
at con 26 well I wish I would done a bit

168
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:54,680
better but I'm very critical at myself

169
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:57,020
so I was like well it went well enough

170
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,210
and I had enough good feedback so I'll

171
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:01,609
do it again and I just started blasting

172
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:04,068
it out everywhere and yeah I've got a

173
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:06,860
lot of opportunities and there are a

174
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:07,819
large population of high-functioning

175
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,659
autistic Seether

176
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:14,360
don't want to talk about it openly or

177
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:16,810
haven't disclosed that publicly or maybe

178
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:20,270
they don't mind discussing it but

179
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:24,199
audiences and big groups of people

180
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:26,628
aren't their thing so having the having

181
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:29,449
the love for public speaking and being

182
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:31,969
very open about this condition like I

183
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:34,849
kind of wanted to fill that niche niche

184
00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:36,469
role that it's very rare to find right

185
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:38,810
now it's great and just for the record

186
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:41,330
as someone who's done a lot of public

187
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,680
speaking I can tell you that some of the

188
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,960
best public speakers they only do like

189
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,699
two or three talks ever and they give

190
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,138
those same talks over and over and over

191
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:50,150
and over again and each time they do it

192
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:51,560
they reflect on what I do good what

193
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,489
could I do have done better and then

194
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,360
these make it a little bit better for

195
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:55,669
the next time and they just keep

196
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,889
iterating until it's this amazing speech

197
00:07:55,669 --> 00:08:00,799
so what you're doing is definitely

198
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:03,469
normal yeah and I've been lucky that uh

199
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,050
both my both the previous times I've

200
00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:08,690
given my talk it's been recorded and so

201
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:10,879
I go back I analyze what I can done

202
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:14,870
wrong I also have had some very good

203
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:17,060
audience's Q&A ask questions and it's

204
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,250
things that I'm like oh why didn't even

205
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:22,219
think of that because again even on the

206
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:24,379
autistic spectrum there's such a variety

207
00:08:22,219 --> 00:08:25,849
and so I'll have people in my audience

208
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:29,240
where on the spectrum and live a like

209
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:31,188
well I've seen this conditioning or I've

210
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,320
seen this thing or I'll have people

211
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:35,240
without autism asked me a question and

212
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,399
they'll say like well how would you

213
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,779
manage this I was like I really can't

214
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:40,099
say and that's someone else in the

215
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:41,719
audience will be like oh well I've

216
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:44,810
encountered that situation and this is

217
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:47,089
how I did it so having such an engaging

218
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:50,268
audience is helping me improve my talk

219
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:52,490
and by Mesa all had a lot of a lot of

220
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:54,560
additional inputs I've gotten and so my

221
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,600
talk will reflect that hopefully great

222
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,219
that sounds fantastic yeah my what my

223
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,200
wife is actually a professional public

224
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,240
speaker and speaking coach and

225
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,740
she records literally everything she

226
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,270
ever does in front of an audience like

227
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,190
just one of the like one of those little

228
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,900
life pro tips that the pros use is they

229
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,160
record all the talks and they tell you

230
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,000
you actually have to watch the talk so

231
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,430
you have to actually watch your

232
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,770
recording and then you can even like

233
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:17,479
watch it in forward you can watch it in

234
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:19,370
Reverse you can watch it in fast-forward

235
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,960
and you start to notice if you have

236
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,730
weird tics or things like that you can

237
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,310
refine it that way it's really

238
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:26,570
interesting that the level you can take

239
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,680
it to if you want if you're really

240
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:31,670
