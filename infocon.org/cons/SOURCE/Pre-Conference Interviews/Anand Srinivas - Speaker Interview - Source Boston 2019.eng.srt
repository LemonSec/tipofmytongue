00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:10,360
[Music]

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,559
hi this is Rob Sheen from source

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,180
conference and I'm here with an

4
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:15,700
on-screen Eva's who is the CTO and

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:17,650
co-founder of Nyanza and he's gonna be

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:21,009
giving a talk at source Boston next week

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:23,770
on the wild wild west of IOT security in

8
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,240
the enterprise so lots to unpack there

9
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:28,448
so I know why don't you tell us a little

10
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:31,000
bit about your talk yeah for sure so it

11
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:33,940
comes from being part of a company in

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,010
the answer that we look at a lot of

13
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:39,579
client devices in a lot of enterprise

14
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,290
networks and so different verticals you

15
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:43,750
know there's education so in

16
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:46,720
universities there's healthcare and

17
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:49,060
networks there's manufacturing networks

18
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:52,600
there's distribution warehouse networks

19
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:54,940
and other retail networks as well and as

20
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,770
we sort of look at all these devices and

21
00:00:54,940 --> 00:01:00,040
we're looking at more than 20 million

22
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:02,290
client devices most of these devices are

23
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:05,950
your plain vanilla you know iPhones

24
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:08,740
Android phones windows you know laptops

25
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:11,650
and whatever else but a growing number

26
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:14,470
of these are these sort of RR io T

27
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,790
devices and when we think of IOT devices

28
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,830
a lot of the times we think about the

29
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:19,420
critical ones and obviously these are

30
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:23,860
the most important ones so you think

31
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:26,340
about in healthcare infusion pumps EKG

32
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:29,039
machines you know vital signs monitors

33
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,210
gluco meters whatever have you

34
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,770
telemedicine robots you know those

35
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,630
robots that kind of move around with the

36
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,550
person's face on them or whatever it is

37
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,229
right all of these things are networked

38
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:40,149
and all of these things are critical

39
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:43,060
right if you think about manufacturing

40
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:45,580
you think about handheld tools like the

41
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:48,130
torque wrenches that sort of you know

42
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:50,440
tighten bolts that have to be network

43
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:52,899
connected you think about the robots

44
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,270
that are on the assembly line you think

45
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,280
about you know the autonomous guided

46
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:00,670
vehicles that are transporting things

47
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,229
around the area again you know devices

48
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,750
you don't necessarily expect but they

49
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:07,119
exist in all of these environments and

50
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:09,369
these are critical again and then you

51
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,980
know other examples in retail for

52
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:14,290
instance or distribution warehouse you

53
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,869
think of barcode scanners so in all

54
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:19,540
those really big distribution centers

55
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,010
you know if your your barcode scanners

56
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,030
are critical there in order to be able

57
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,250
to stock the stock

58
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:27,610
the shelves or get products in and out

59
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:29,740
of those areas again that were connected

60
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,270
there are Pickers these like vehicles

61
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,490
that sort of run you know back and forth

62
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:35,950
those are also network connected and

63
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,870
critical and so on and just even in

64
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:40,060
universities and enterprises you see

65
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:44,050
more and more smart lights you know

66
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:46,660
smart HVAC systems and and so on and

67
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,850
these are critical but then you turn

68
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,670
sort of you turn around and you say okay

69
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:54,010
well wait a minute are those all the IOT

70
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:56,350
devices that are on you know people's

71
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,850
networks and you come to find that's not

72
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:59,950
the case at all right there are those

73
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,510
kind of devices and those are super

74
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,690
interesting but there's also things like

75
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:06,280
photo frames connecting to the network

76
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:08,890
you know you'd be shocked at the number

77
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,590
of cars that connect to sort of secure

78
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:16,660
enterprise network like Tesla's or

79
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:19,030
Honda's or four or whatever have you one

80
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:23,850
of the most odd devices that I've seen

81
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:26,230
in both an enterprise as well as a

82
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:29,109
university or university environments is

83
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:31,359
a device called a love box so this is a

84
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:33,730
device that I had to look it up after

85
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,380
the fact but it's a device it's internet

86
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,859
connected I think it came out close to

87
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:41,109
Valentine's Day and basically you text

88
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:43,239
someone like a love note or like a love

89
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:45,760
message or whatever and when you do it

90
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:47,440
the Box starts spinning and then you

91
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,660
sort of open up the box and you kind of

92
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,060
see the message on the other side and

93
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,519
again I mean everything is getting

94
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,739
connected everything is sort of like on

95
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:58,329
the network nowadays and this is all

96
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:00,640
fine and dandy and this is only gonna

97
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:03,250
get crazier but the thing you gotta

98
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,380
watch out for is what are these properly

99
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,780
secured I think on the right networks

100
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:10,299
you know they better not be sharing the

101
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:13,000
same network as my EKG machine for

102
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:15,160
instance right and just you know what I

103
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,380
want to talk about at source is sort of

104
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,510
the experience of seeing all of these

105
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:22,479
different devices in the in different

106
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,860
environments and what kind of you know

107
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,020
things that you never would have

108
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,520
expected both in terms of the device

109
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,859
types themselves as well as their

110
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,310
security posture in terms of where they

111
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,729
are what they're doing you know and and

112
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,710
so on

113
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:38,919
so that's hopefully that gives

114
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:40,599
it gives you kind of an idea sounds like

115
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,770
you've seen a whole wide variety of all

116
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,160
the different kinds of things that can

117
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:47,229
be on the network some some very serious

118
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,730
some kind of you know but all like that

119
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:51,960
you know the love box and things like

120
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:54,250
that in a world where we're kind of

121
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,130
generally all on the network all the

122
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:59,590
time you know that is kind of it does

123
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,930
become pretty risky when those things

124
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,280
might be compromised in like pretty sure

125
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:10,060
the love box probably didn't get a

126
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:12,159
contest before it went a differentiate

127
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,450
between like the critical thing is it

128
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,280
not but even for the things that

129
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,200
technically aren't how do you maybe

130
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,250
discourage people from either putting

131
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,810
those on there or making sure that

132
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,900
they're on a safer part of the network

133
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:25,360
yeah I think the good news is for the

134
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:28,090
most part people have these on guest

135
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,390
networks and sort of guest VLANs and

136
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:33,549
sort of you know separate it out from

137
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:35,680
from from everything everything out

138
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:38,170
there so that's the good news but I

139
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,150
think you know you do see some

140
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:43,240
surprising instances where they are on

141
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:45,429
networks or for instance so the way we

142
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,810
kind of look at it is the reason you

143
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:49,690
should be interested in both critical

144
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:52,570
and non-critical devices is you don't

145
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:55,780
want a critical device on an unsecure

146
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:58,990
Network so we've seen you know like I

147
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:00,849
don't know Lou manometers or actually

148
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,730
even in one invited see an EKG machine

149
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:06,700
on a guest network on a non secured

150
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:08,470
network that's you're super useful to

151
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:12,159
know because obviously there are things

152
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:14,350
like the love box that can be on on the

153
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,090
guest network and then by the same token

154
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:19,090
you don't want to see things like you

155
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:20,530
know a car or an Xbox or anything like

156
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:24,310
this which wouldn't be critical

157
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:26,469
necessarily on sort of a secure network

158
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:29,770
we're sort of it can be used for

159
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:31,300
nefarious or not not even used for

160
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:35,349
nefarious reasons or anything like that

161
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:38,280
it's just that it's just not good policy

162
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:41,350
to have sort of non-critical devices on

163
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:44,070
critical critical networks it's it's

164
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:48,220
it's best to keep these things segmented

165
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:49,389
so let's rip off the segmenting for a

166
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,599
second because I

167
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:55,030
and a lot of cases especially in say

168
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:58,360
healthcare environments the network

169
00:06:55,030 --> 00:07:01,960
tends to be open and flat at least

170
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:04,780
inside there's a tendency there to trust

171
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,789
things on the inside even though I know

172
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,530
that that's probably not the smartest

173
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:14,020
thing because once you're in you're in

174
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:16,659
and it's not that so shift that mindset

175
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:19,090
so that things like EKG monitors are

176
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:19,750
actually on a secured network where do

177
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:23,318
we start

178
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:25,719
yeah I mean it starts with you know

179
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:27,969
VLANs and SS IDs you have your basic

180
00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:30,180
sort of unit of segmentation in in the

181
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:33,279
network and sort of making sure that

182
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:35,969
from that basic segmentation perspective

183
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:38,949
these things you know if you sort of

184
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:40,750
dive into a specific VLAN where you're

185
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:43,419
sort of enforcing ACLs at the router

186
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:45,819
that you have the devices that are on

187
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:48,520
that VLAN sort of share the right level

188
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:51,099
of security that you know that that's

189
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,719
sort of desired or you know for wireless

190
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:56,169
devices a lot of this stuff happens at

191
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:59,050
the SSID level we're on an SSID an SSID

192
00:07:56,169 --> 00:08:01,270
basis you sort of enforce policy and

193
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:03,159
just make sure that that's that's proper

194
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:05,349
then there's kind of the graduate school

195
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:07,360
level of stuff where you get into

196
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:10,089
Software Defined Networking and micro

197
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,240
segmentation right where you can now say

198
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:15,099
well this group of devices regardless

199
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,009
you know I want to create sort of an

200
00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:20,889
overlay Network which kind of has all

201
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:22,839
the security policy and all those sort

202
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:24,610
of requirements that I want and I'm

203
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:26,289
gonna sort of create these grooves and

204
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:29,169
leave it up to my software-defined

205
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:31,568
network to do the micro segmentation for

206
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:34,120
me using overlays as opposed to using

207
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:36,490
basic things like as societies and VLANs

208
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,649
and definitely that's where it's sort of

209
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:40,690
the industry is trending in terms of

210
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:43,809
where where everybody wants to get to

211
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:45,790
because it's the most you know flexible

212
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:48,219
and most general way to sort of do this

213
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:50,890
things or these things but what I've

214
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:53,320
seen sort of in practice is let's get

215
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:58,630
the you know the undergrad level of

216
00:08:53,320 --> 00:09:00,850
stuff done first so that kind of covers

217
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:03,120
the technical aspects of it though yeah

218
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:05,080
but how do you

219
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,100
management's actually do it because

220
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,740
especially in the healthcare environment

221
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,780
they tend to focus on functionality so

222
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,890
like as it work if they don't work and

223
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,150
that you know the doctors don't

224
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:14,410
certainly don't care if it's not a

225
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,689
secure Network are not necessarily

226
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:18,069
unless they have a reason to you know

227
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:20,590
how do we kind of move that needle so

228
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:22,060
it's actually getting pushed by

229
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:24,280
management at the right yeah in the

230
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,810
right times so it's a really good point

231
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,880
I I think the first step there is to

232
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:31,420
even just shine a light on it so if you

233
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:33,730
went to a just an arbitrary IT

234
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:36,219
department or a security department and

235
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:38,530
you asked them the question tell me

236
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:41,320
every single IOT device that's on your

237
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:43,449
neckline right that on the corporate or

238
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,010
the the either the corporate or the

239
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:47,920
secure or whatever it is and just ask

240
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:50,380
the question I almost guarantee you that

241
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,939
most departments wouldn't be able to

242
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,100
answer that question or they would have

243
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,780
ideas they would say I think you know

244
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,580
there's these devices or whatever it is

245
00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:01,030
and I think there are this many of them

246
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:03,040
but I'm not 100% sure right right and so

247
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:05,530
really the first step and and one of the

248
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,449
most interesting aspects of even going

249
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:10,540
to a customer environment and sort of

250
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:13,120
turning on the solution um is just the

251
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:16,270
aspect of okay let's just look at this

252
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,790
SSID did you know that these things were

253
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:21,010
on this SSID or did you even know that

254
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:22,780
these things were on this VLAN and you

255
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:25,990
know that customer where we saw the EKG

256
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:28,480
machine on an unsecure Network I mean

257
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:30,430
when they saw that they fixed it they

258
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,640
got that device sort of off that network

259
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:35,770
very quickly but you know they just had

260
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,439
no idea they just didn't even know right

261
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:41,620
and so I think that's clearly the first

262
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,690
step of all of this which is shining a

263
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:45,580
light on it and sort of exposing the

264
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,830
fact that there are these potential

265
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:49,360
policy violations part of this is in

266
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:52,030
certain industries there's also

267
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,500
compliance aspects to this as well right

268
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:56,410
like in healthcare is to kind of stick

269
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:59,050
in to that example there's if compliance

270
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:01,420
well you can't have patient data on an

271
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:03,430
unsecure network or whatever have you

272
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,689
and you know that that creates other

273
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:07,689
kinds of problems

274
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:09,880
um right and so you know so that's

275
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:12,620
that's I think that's probably the first

276
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:16,310
step just to shine a light on it and

277
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:19,310
have that got it so maybe shifting focus

278
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:21,709
from the the implementers of it to the

279
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:25,969
manufacturers of it you know a lot of

280
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:27,620
these things can't even really be

281
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:29,510
patched or they're running on really old

282
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,440
operating systems and if you upgrade the

283
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:32,630
operating system you might actually

284
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,280
break the device and you know how do we

285
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:36,350
maybe shift the mindset of the

286
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:40,880
manufacturers a little bit to get them

287
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:42,020
maybe a less little focus on features

288
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,450
and functionality a little bit more

289
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:46,610
focused on security or is that just kind

290
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:48,500
of a crazy thing to even ask for I think

291
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:51,410
that just like your pipe dream because

292
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:56,150
obviously you know the main the makers

293
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:58,459
of the Lovebox their use cases to sell

294
00:11:56,150 --> 00:12:00,079
you know Valentine's Day happiness I

295
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:04,640
guess right I was thinking more in lines

296
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:06,260
of the EKG manufacturers than love yes

297
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,569
so for the non-critical stuff yeah

298
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:10,970
exactly that's totally gonna be a pipe

299
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:14,420
dream for the EKG machines for the

300
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:17,600
infusion pumps for the barcode scanners

301
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:19,579
and so on I think even there it's tough

302
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,250
because that's not where they make their

303
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:25,250
money right you know like Honeywell

304
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:28,070
selling barcode scanners you know isn't

305
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:30,080
focused on security and networking or

306
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:32,360
anything like that they're focused on

307
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:35,270
okay well how do we be able to scan

308
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:38,120
these packages and get that data out as

309
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:39,949
fast as possible and you know how do we

310
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,250
sell as many of these things as possible

311
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:44,570
right as quickly as possible and you

312
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,520
know do we really need to hire security

313
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:48,980
engineers sort of that or networking

314
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:51,140
engineers probably not right do we want

315
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:53,660
to buy the most you know do we want to

316
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:55,580
buy a Cisco Networking chipset so that

317
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,560
the networking is all secure do we want

318
00:12:55,580 --> 00:13:00,710
to buy a super secure chipset which

319
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,569
costs you know 20x the amount of let's

320
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:04,820
say like the the cheapest possible cheap

321
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:06,590
chip said probably not right I mean

322
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:09,050
let's just buy the cheapest thing and

323
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:12,260
make as much profit on what we're trying

324
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:14,229
to sell as possible so I think you know

325
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:17,750
what we've seen in general which is

326
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:19,730
actually we see things both from a

327
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,920
security standpoint and a performance

328
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:24,020
standpoint and what's being super

329
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,000
interesting is it's not as though these

330
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,370
devices perform very well either on the

331
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,860
network

332
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:31,620
right these devices have the most quirky

333
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:33,509
behavior they drop off the network right

334
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,329
they do sort of random things which

335
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:38,309
affects like other devices as well but

336
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:40,649
it all stems back to the same problem

337
00:13:38,309 --> 00:13:42,870
which is this that the manufacturers of

338
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:45,029
these devices they make money by selling

339
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:46,740
the device to the line of business and

340
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:49,589
they're trying to solve a very specific

341
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,970
line of business problem they're not you

342
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:52,920
know selling it because it's the most

343
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:55,319
secure device and the most net worth the

344
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:58,229
you know the best networking you know

345
00:13:55,319 --> 00:14:00,870
device right and so it's this sort of

346
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:03,120
gets us to you know that aspect of with

347
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:05,730
IOT security it's hard to rely on the

348
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,399
vendors and for that matter it's even

349
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:10,860
hard to rely on the consumers spending

350
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,600
more money buying products that have

351
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,300
better networking or security chipsets

352
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,649
or software stacks right because even as

353
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:19,109
a consumer I want to just buy the

354
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:21,449
cheapest thing right because I you know

355
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:23,699
that's that's what I need to solve so

356
00:14:21,449 --> 00:14:26,040
you know that that's kind of what flips

357
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:27,569
IOT security a little on its head which

358
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,879
is that you almost have an expectation

359
00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:31,979
that the security and the networking is

360
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:33,600
gonna be really bad and so you have to

361
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,610
sort of work around that and kind of

362
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,589
mitigate that a little bit after the

363
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:39,689
fact by looking at what these things are

364
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:41,040
actually doing on the network and trying

365
00:14:39,689 --> 00:14:43,529
to sort of adjust to what they're doing

366
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:48,809
as opposed to sort of being able to rely

367
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:50,490
on the source no pun intended so it

368
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:53,699
sounds like we're kind of stuck at that

369
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:56,160
point where as the enterprise consumers

370
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:57,748
of this year we're probably better off

371
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,540
just making the assumption that it's

372
00:14:57,749 --> 00:15:02,399
flawed and then building walls around it

373
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,410
I think kind of segmenting it off so

374
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,100
that it can't affect anything else when

375
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:10,019
it yells not if it's I think so I mean

376
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:13,499
here's another example of something that

377
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:15,990
we found recently we found you know what

378
00:15:13,499 --> 00:15:18,629
looks to be lazy Road a vulnerability

379
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:21,899
with with a certain device in a critical

380
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:23,610
environment and it's probably what's

381
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:25,679
probably happening is it's not the

382
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:26,279
device manufacturer that's necessarily

383
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:28,170
at fault

384
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:31,410
it's the supply-chain down the road

385
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:33,089
right so it's not like they manufacture

386
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:34,829
everything in their headquarters or

387
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:37,170
anything like that they have to get

388
00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:39,839
parts from you know wherever you have to

389
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,259
get parts from and those people you get

390
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,489
parts

391
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:44,279
from they have to get parts from other

392
00:15:41,489 --> 00:15:46,709
places as well and software and drivers

393
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:48,839
and whatever else and in that supply

394
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:51,809
chain somewhere there could be a problem

395
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:54,749
so even if you trust implicitly the

396
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:56,309
manufacturer maybe down the road in the

397
00:15:54,749 --> 00:15:59,879
supply chain there's some something

398
00:15:56,309 --> 00:16:02,879
going on and so I think it's probably a

399
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:05,279
safe bet to just always assume that

400
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:07,350
these things are you know could could be

401
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:12,359
problematic and sir I'd go over them

402
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:14,039
yeah yeah sounds like good stuff so all

403
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:16,489
right well like definitely looking

404
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:19,109
forward to hearing about your talk and

405
00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:20,579
the talk is the wild wild west of IOT

406
00:16:19,109 --> 00:16:22,589
security the enterprise and it's going

407
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:26,039
to be next week and you're speaking on

408
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:28,109
looks like Thursday so looking looking

409
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:29,699
forward to it man all right cool so

410
00:16:28,109 --> 00:16:30,899
we'll see you there and for those that

411
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:32,368
want to continue the conversation on our

412
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:36,479
T with an on definitely stop by the

413
00:16:32,369 --> 00:16:39,589
conference and we'll there thanks Rob

414
00:16:36,479 --> 00:16:39,589
all right thanks a lot
