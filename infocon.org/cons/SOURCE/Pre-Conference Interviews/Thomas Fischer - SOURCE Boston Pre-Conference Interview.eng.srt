00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,760
hi this is Rob Sheen from the source

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,379
conference and I'm here with Thomas

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,660
Fisher who's a global security advocate

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,370
and an independent consultant so he's

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,460
gonna be speaking at source Boston on

7
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:21,920
May 9th and 10th of 2018 and his talk

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,290
title is gdpr why it matters now and

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,140
that could not be a more timely topic

10
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:28,640
given the timeliness of GDP our so we're

11
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,910
glad to have you at the conference and

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:35,390
can't wait to hear about it thanks Rob

13
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:37,910
um yeah it is timely especially so the

14
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:41,539
conference is two weeks before GDP

15
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:42,858
enforcement comes into play it's

16
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:46,820
actually quite it's actually really

17
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:50,649
really well time to so to speak yet so I

18
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:52,850
mean the talk you know I basically

19
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:55,659
submitted this talk and I've been doing

20
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:58,550
rounds of various versions of this talk

21
00:00:55,659 --> 00:01:00,319
for a good reason is that when you look

22
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:03,468
at what's going on in the iron in our

23
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:06,290
industry a lot of the GDP our discussion

24
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:09,020
has been focused around oh we need to

25
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:10,700
become use this product to be compliant

26
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,130
or use it we need to you need to do your

27
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,439
GDP our compliance and you know

28
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:17,750
typically when we think of that

29
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:20,750
especially for practitioners compliance

30
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:22,490
is a risk and compliance problem right

31
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:26,060
so you have a checklist you do a bunch

32
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:28,548
of things and you you might deploy a few

33
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:31,009
solutions if you have to but it's more

34
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:33,259
about really mitigating your risk in

35
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:36,020
that sense however if you actually look

36
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:37,939
at the look at the GDP or it's a lot

37
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,699
more complex and there's a lot more to

38
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:42,529
be done and long term activities that

39
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,200
need to be done it's and it's really

40
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:47,600
much more about accountability and that

41
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,990
you have enough process procedures and

42
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,030
even maybe the people around to be able

43
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:56,179
to do that accountability because it's

44
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:58,670
going to be a lot a lot harder to to

45
00:01:56,179 --> 00:02:02,840
basically explain to a Data Protection

46
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:07,369
Authority why the personal data was was

47
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:09,530
in the leak or was was breached right so

48
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:11,090
I noticed that in your abstract you'd

49
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,819
mention the difference between that it's

50
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,989
not just about compliance but about

51
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:17,119
changing processes of procedures which I

52
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:18,970
find interesting because most of the

53
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,590
other

54
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:22,270
rules regulations we've had over the

55
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:26,380
years have been pretty much about

56
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:28,510
compliance so why is this one different

57
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,579
why why are people gonna suddenly shift

58
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,220
to process of procedure just not find

59
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:36,940
the easiest way to check the box

60
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:39,580
um so I mean the classic one ayat of it

61
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:42,900
most people kind of highlight is the

62
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:44,950
72-hour breach notification right so

63
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,660
gdpr says that you have to basically

64
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,149
notify the personal date has been

65
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,890
breached within 72 hours now there's

66
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:53,020
various discussions on how that has to

67
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:56,890
be done who has to do it why you know

68
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:59,020
and various options but if you think

69
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,970
about that from a practitioners point of

70
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,709
view so what happens when something you

71
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,660
know you get breached right whether it's

72
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:06,700
an in you know somebody internal or

73
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,640
whether it's an external threat that's

74
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,200
bait you know something like it um like

75
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,910
what we've seen in the past year right

76
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,339
some of the major breaches that we've

77
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:17,500
seen in the past year the first thing

78
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,300
that you do is oh I've detected a breach

79
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,590
okay I'm going to bring in the incident

80
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,610
response team I'm going to look at how

81
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,110
it happened I'm going to try and

82
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,769
mitigate and stop it from beat from

83
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:27,760
happening again

84
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:30,910
and we never think about doing incident

85
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,470
response focused on the data right so if

86
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,480
you think about about your typical

87
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,370
incident response process it's always

88
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,200
focused on the means the mechanism is

89
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,180
end the threat act or maybe but you

90
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,859
never really focus it on what happened

91
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,510
to the data it's always an afterthought

92
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,090
you know it was an expert it was an

93
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,980
afterthought in in in the last few big

94
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,930
data breaches you know and and it keeps

95
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:56,530
getting you know keeps getting corrected

96
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:58,150
so if you need to essentially under what

97
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:01,600
the guidance or the GPR says right now

98
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:03,220
is if you need to tell or notify you

99
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,109
know people that their data has been

100
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,609
breached within 72 hours you're

101
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,140
fundamentally gonna have to change the

102
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,030
way that you do your incident response

103
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,730
process because you're going to have to

104
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:14,410
figure out what Thetas been touched

105
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:16,659
within those 72 hours and that's where

106
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:18,940
it that's where it's no longer a

107
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,950
checkbox activity right it's no longer

108
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:23,590
well I have these solutions in place I'm

109
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:25,630
compliant no you're not because the

110
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:29,080
whole aspects of the GPR is being able

111
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:30,370
to say well somebody's breached me I

112
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,960
need to report the DPA

113
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,520
so how do I do that

114
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,710
do I do that constructively with

115
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,620
personal data in that aspect there's

116
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:41,080
also the the reverse side which is the

117
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,270
gdpr brings back rights to the to the

118
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,479
data subject right to the end user so me

119
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:48,099
as a European citizen and despite the

120
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,109
fact I live in the UK I actually am

121
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:52,449
French so I will remain EU European

122
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:57,190
citizen for quite a few perfume in a few

123
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:59,620
more years the I have rights to come

124
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:01,810
back and ask you correct my data or

125
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,930
remove my data from your database you

126
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:07,360
know remove my information you have to

127
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,860
handle that right it's it's not you know

128
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,789
you don't have to have a checkbox to say

129
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:14,380
oh I'm doing data you know data ratio no

130
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:16,509
you have to have a procedure in place

131
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,940
but if somebody calls you and says I

132
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:21,400
want my data removed from your from your

133
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,509
from your company you have to be able to

134
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,250
do it and you have to be able to

135
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:25,720
demonstrate you've done it and that's

136
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,090
not a compliance checklist that's

137
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,099
procedure and process right it's

138
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:32,799
something that needs to be done it might

139
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:35,620
descend from your customer service desk

140
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,470
all the way to your IT you know your IT

141
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,630
department and that's that's that's

142
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,340
essentially what I've been trying to the

143
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:44,770
cover in this talk is that it just

144
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,210
really does go much further even when

145
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,639
all you know I've been just doing a

146
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:52,599
checklist and understanding the gdpr and

147
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,340
and then I mean that that's that's where

148
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:56,530
I've always had this problem with when

149
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:59,138
people talk about compliance for the

150
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:00,400
gdpr right yes you can be compliant in

151
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:02,650
the sense of oh I've prepared my

152
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,448
organization for it but the compliance

153
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:07,270
is the compliant being covered to comply

154
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:08,590
with the orders of the GDP are you're

155
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,840
going to have to demonstrate on a daily

156
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:17,859
basis but something nothing's happen to

157
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:19,690
that personal data right so ice what

158
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,009
size company does it apply to so cuz a

159
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,389
lot of like the bigger companies that

160
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:23,860
already have compliance teams you know

161
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:25,630
they'll have an easier time managing

162
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,060
this but the smaller and medium

163
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:29,860
businesses that you know maybe not be

164
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:33,969
doing anything and what are they

165
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:36,940
supposed to do uh that's a big problem

166
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:40,930
and you're not the first person to ask

167
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:44,080
me this question actually I might so I

168
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:47,159
have I have a concrete example really so

169
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,159
I I've been

170
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:53,370
this customer that's based in

171
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:56,729
Switzerland so then I'll even in the EU

172
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:59,340
right so but they deal with with EU

173
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:01,650
citizens because basically what they do

174
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,869
is they offer a service via large

175
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:06,090
organizations so a large organisation

176
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:09,330
might call them up and say okay we need

177
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:11,729
this we need the service for our this

178
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:13,409
employee so they need to collect things

179
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:16,050
like passport information they need to

180
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:18,900
collect names family family information

181
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,940
and things like that and I mean this

182
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,409
company is very small that's I think

183
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:26,400
they have about less than ten employees

184
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:28,680
all right but the larger organizations

185
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,989
are saying you need to demonstrate that

186
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,600
you can comply with the GDP are but

187
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:35,100
you're protecting personal data so the

188
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,600
size doesn't really matter anymore

189
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,550
because of the relationships would have

190
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,380
been set up in the GDP are between data

191
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,820
controller which is which is the company

192
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,280
that collects the data and data

193
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:46,290
processor which is any company but

194
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,479
basically offers a service to a data

195
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:50,700
controller so it can be a small company

196
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,670
like the like that one or it can be

197
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:56,990
Amazon with AWS or office with Microsoft

198
00:07:53,670 --> 00:08:00,690
Office 365 you own they all need to have

199
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:02,750
an aspect of being able to comply with

200
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,350
the gdpr mandate because the

201
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,270
responsibility is not you know

202
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:08,520
although the controller is ultimately

203
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:10,620
responsible for notifying they need to

204
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,330
be able to be told by the by the data

205
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,890
processor the third party that

206
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:17,580
something's happen to that personal data

207
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:19,590
and there is no mandate in the GPR it

208
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,630
says oh it's only applies to XYZ type

209
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:24,330
companies right it's just it's about

210
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:25,230
personal data and I think this is one of

211
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,510
the things that's very hard to

212
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:30,390
understand especially for people outside

213
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:33,270
of the EU is that that this whole thing

214
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:36,569
is about you know changing the rights of

215
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:39,539
the of who owns that personal data right

216
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:41,550
so it's defining that the data subject

217
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:44,670
owns the data and he has the right to do

218
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:46,260
and to query about that personal data so

219
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,459
you're just so a company of its

220
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,830
collecting personal data is just a

221
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:52,740
guarantee or you know just to put us a

222
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:55,020
provider of services around that their

223
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,649
personal data so they need to be able to

224
00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:01,060
said personal data a lot

225
00:08:56,649 --> 00:09:03,980
so he needs to be able to to essentially

226
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:06,050
respond to that data subject and to be

227
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,690
able to provide those services as they

228
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:11,620
are defined by the GD P R and that

229
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:13,730
doesn't define any size of organization

230
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:16,699
anybody but has personal data could

231
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:19,550
eventually be you know responsible to do

232
00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:20,719
that yeah that that brings up an

233
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:23,329
interesting point about the data subject

234
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,120
owning their data because that's kind of

235
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:27,979
not how it is in the u.s. if you give

236
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,120
your data away it's gone and it's theirs

237
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,040
and they can do whatever they want with

238
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,019
it they could sell it whatever there are

239
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,459
privacy concerns and there are issues if

240
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:37,790
certain types of private data do you get

241
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:39,920
out but fundamentally we don't have this

242
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,449
idea that like I own my data everywhere

243
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,069
and I can control it like if I go and

244
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:46,880
tell Facebook hey take all my data off

245
00:09:43,069 --> 00:09:48,560
Facebook they'll be like ya know so do

246
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,959
you see they like this maybe ever

247
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,459
catching on else outside Europe or do

248
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,579
you think it'll be isolated to Europe

249
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:57,500
and you know it's interesting especially

250
00:09:55,579 --> 00:10:01,219
with the penalties because the penalties

251
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:04,670
are huge four percent of revenue or ten

252
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:06,740
million euros is a massive yeah so yeah

253
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:10,189
it's to two percent or 10 million if you

254
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:12,170
if ya if its standard personal data the

255
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:14,870
four percent twenty million is if you

256
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:16,610
have multiple multiple issues and plus

257
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:19,040
it's focused on what we call sensitive

258
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:20,480
data because there's I mean that's a

259
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,250
whole different subject the GDP are

260
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,319
actually has different categorization of

261
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:27,290
personal data but to come back to your

262
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:32,149
point about will it catch on elsewhere

263
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:34,339
um I think you know I when I you have a

264
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:35,449
lot of talk you know I I know a lot of

265
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:37,639
people in the US have a lot of friends

266
00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:40,099
in the u.s. when we talk about this it

267
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:42,170
falls back down to history right so if

268
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,990
you think about Europe and historically

269
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,819
how Europe has had its issues you know

270
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,829
in the back in you know with with

271
00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:51,079
different types of that things that have

272
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:52,849
affected people when in very physical

273
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:54,829
manners right very intense physical

274
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:57,439
manners so there's there's a history of

275
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:58,910
people being being weary of anybody's

276
00:10:57,439 --> 00:11:01,699
collecting you in collecting your

277
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:05,380
information or or trying to to catalog

278
00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:07,609
you and from the personal aspect so

279
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,829
fundamentally yes in Europe there is an

280
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:10,270
attitude towards that it's my personal

281
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:12,449
data

282
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:15,490
I keep it to myself I mean you know

283
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:19,510
something like somewhat like the us you

284
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:20,800
know the UK doesn't have an ID card for

285
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,380
many different reasons right they've

286
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,770
never legally been able to to put

287
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:28,450
through a ID card for UK citizens right

288
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,470
well other European countries have done

289
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,510
it because they've done it in certain

290
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:34,060
ways that are controlled and the data

291
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:38,319
was segregated and only their official

292
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:42,640
organizations can issue IDs um will they

293
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:44,410
catch on elsewhere yes I think um it was

294
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,260
it South Korea six months ago they

295
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:50,310
started working on a new data protection

296
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:53,140
law of it's got similarities with the EU

297
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:55,689
the the one vote I laughs like the one

298
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:58,270
that makes me makes me grimace actually

299
00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:00,990
is and because you know we think awful

300
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:03,910
percent twenty million lot Turkey has

301
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:05,890
literally almost a word-for-word data

302
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:08,020
protection law because they actually

303
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:09,910
want to be in the you the fine is a lot

304
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:13,240
worse than the fine can be years in the

305
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:15,250
Turkish prison could you imagine having

306
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,810
to seven years in Turkish prison because

307
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:25,990
you failed to protect the person a

308
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:28,089
person's data so will it catch on in the

309
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:30,370
same way no but I think we will see

310
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:31,930
fundamental and because of what's been

311
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,580
happening with with you know with the

312
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:37,540
big data breaches what we saw over over

313
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:38,770
the past year of two years I don't want

314
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,569
to mention names of companies because

315
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:42,520
and she brings out the base over which

316
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:45,010
company did what or who's responsible

317
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:47,910
but um when you look at what's been

318
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:50,350
going on it's true ver with seeing a

319
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:52,719
fundamental shift in attitude even by

320
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:54,430
legislation or by lawmakers but saying

321
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,440
but something has to be done right it

322
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:58,660
can't carry on like this wherever it's a

323
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,990
shift in mentality like the GD P R

324
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:03,490
portrays or wherever it's just

325
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:05,530
reinforcing laws and building new laws

326
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:09,400
that all will bring a level protection

327
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:11,380
of the data and that's why it's another

328
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:14,020
reason why I try to avoid the the

329
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:16,120
subject of privacy in in the in the

330
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,410
discussions because privacy has a much

331
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:21,460
deeper meaning than data protection

332
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:22,839
right privacy can be also you can't you

333
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,680
know if you've collected data you can

334
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,230
you can't ever

335
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,120
to anybody else well that's not really

336
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:30,550
the point in the GDP are the GDP are is

337
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,110
about ensuring that the data is used is

338
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:34,899
collected properly and used properly

339
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:37,330
right it's not if you've given that if

340
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:38,920
you're given the subject his rights back

341
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:41,290
and he's owner of the data

342
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,910
he's willingly giving it to you based on

343
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:44,219
the on the fact that you've told him

344
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:46,149
exactly what you're gonna do with it

345
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,070
from that point on

346
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:50,140
there's no longer privacy there's no

347
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:52,750
there's no real fundamental privacy

348
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:54,279
issue because there's a there's kind of

349
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,870
an agreement between you and the company

350
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:57,910
or between the data subjects and the

351
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:00,040
company that that data is being used for

352
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:02,680
that purpose right so there is something

353
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:05,110
to be done well is if you think about

354
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:07,149
you know for me prior if for me privacy

355
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,680
is about saying well I've closed all my

356
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:11,709
curtains and I don't want you to see

357
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:14,319
anything in my house well if I you know

358
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:16,300
if you know I'm if I'm giving you a part

359
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,649
of what it's in if I show you a part of

360
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,089
what's in my house I've given you the

361
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:21,910
right to look at that point of my house

362
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:23,680
right so that's that's where I finally

363
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:27,189
really kind of break down on the privacy

364
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:31,329
versus data protection which which is

365
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:32,470
which unfortunately a lot of times you

366
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:35,890
know when I when I hear the debates

367
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:38,440
about data protection laws in in outside

368
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:40,150
of the EU it's it always falls down back

369
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,220
down to that privacy thing right it's

370
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:45,459
like you said it at the beginning of the

371
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:46,930
question right in the US we don't have

372
00:14:45,459 --> 00:14:48,699
that come here you know you don't have

373
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:50,589
really that that sense of privacy in

374
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,300
that sense of want of privacy or at

375
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:54,970
least your data is not private in that

376
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,140
in when it's collected right or you

377
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,520
don't even know the companies are

378
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,760
collecting your that your personal data

379
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:04,689
right in some cases

380
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:06,880
so yeah I know there is there I think

381
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:09,250
there will see shifts in legislation it

382
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,350
just I don't I don't see it being as

383
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:14,020
strong as as what we've done in Europe

384
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:17,190
in terms of the data subject rights but

385
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:20,980
we're gonna see a shift in legislation

386
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:21,850
well that's for sure all right well we

387
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,829
look forward to continuing the

388
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:25,690
