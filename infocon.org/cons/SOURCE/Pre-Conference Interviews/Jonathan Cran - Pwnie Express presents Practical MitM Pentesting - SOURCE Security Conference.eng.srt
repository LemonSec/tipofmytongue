1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:06,000
there are different Andals you can keep

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:08,250
that near you in case you order I keep

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,570
it over there I think and this is the

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,929
receiver so best thing keep it on your

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,940
left

6
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:15,179
great left side cool can you guys hear

7
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:19,920
me okay good in the back thumbs up

8
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:27,480
alright awesome thanks hey so I'm going

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:37,590
to turn this down great all right we'll

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:41,250
talk softly yes there we go okay so this

11
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:47,309
is a practical old man in the middle and

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:50,550
still testing the mic all right awesome

13
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:52,320
okay cool so you hopefully are in the

14
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,500
right talk here my name is Jonathan cran

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,480
I'm an advisor for the source conference

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:59,250
also CTO Pony Express also like sales

17
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:03,140
guy Pony Express also like marketing

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:07,320
guide Pony Express also whatever yeah

19
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:08,970
yes small company it's cool so before

20
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,369
that our QA director at Metasploit and

21
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,810
then before that penetration tester

22
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:22,080
Robert 7 so what are we gonna talk about

23
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:24,960
today good to see this well anyway man

24
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,369
in the middle is a huge topic it's

25
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,020
actually one of those things where I

26
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:30,020
very quickly got overwhelmed with the

27
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,640
amount of stuff that we can talk about

28
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,490
in this talk and what I wanted to do is

29
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,270
focus this a little bit and talk about

30
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:40,789
you know men in the middle very

31
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:42,960
specifically on certain types of attacks

32
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,860
you know one of those one of the one of

33
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,729
the things obviously the Pony Express

34
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:49,950
influence here is you know local man in

35
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:52,740
the middle on a targeted network and on

36
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:56,340
a local network as opposed to SSL or or

37
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:58,199
to like BGP attacks right you know

38
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,200
that's just not that practical for a pen

39
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,700
tester so let's talk about that and then

40
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,320
we'll talk about sort of why why this

41
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,479
stuff matters this year and why this

42
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,770
stuff matters in general and then we'll

43
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,910
get into some practical attacks and some

44
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,609
automation

45
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:14,850
and then we'll talk about some takeaways

46
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:16,470
so you know very quickly I also you know

47
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,910
thought well maybe I'll spend some time

48
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,850
doing some automation for this talk and

49
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,990
work on you know making things super

50
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,370
easy to use but it turns out there's

51
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,620
tons and tons of automation out there

52
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,840
there's people in this room Ryan Linden

53
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,180
over here who's put together like some

54
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,890
really awesome automation and and I

55
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,910
didn't want to sort of duplicate some of

56
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,649
the efforts that were already being made

57
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:38,940
with ettercap and with beef and things

58
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:40,500
like that so our focus today is going to

59
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,900
be very specifically on the local

60
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,760
network in the wireless network and then

61
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,380
you know more specific than that getting

62
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,760
in the middle and then from there

63
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,890
viewing manipulating traffic and then

64
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,510
automating some of the easy wins what

65
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,750
we're not going to focus on is you know

66
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:56,579
SSL men in the middle BGP so the more

67
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:00,720
complex attacks spanning tree protocol

68
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,440
hot hot walk routing protocol or the the

69
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,960
man-in-the-browser

70
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:10,320
type type man-in-the-middle stuff so we

71
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:12,060
got it all right cool so you know I've

72
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,640
always been enamored with this idea of

73
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,200
you know how do we attack folks you know

74
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,029
directly around us how we target these

75
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,619
things I was walking past a bank in New

76
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:23,940
York one time and I was looking in I saw

77
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,230
a machine that was sitting there and

78
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,420
it's running Windows XP and I'm like I

79
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:29,340
know I can own this machine but how do I

80
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,290
get to that how do I actually access

81
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:35,010
that box from standing out here or even

82
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:37,470
you know that specific box you know and

83
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,870
it also you know planes trains and

84
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:43,260
automobiles how do you how do you sort

85
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:47,190
of determine what's around you in these

86
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,720
these environments so the question is

87
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,829
you know what why do you care about

88
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,570
local man-in-the-middle has an ARP

89
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,670
spoofing been around for 15 years

90
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,870
you know DNS spoofing these sorts of

91
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:58,380
things these things aren't really that

92
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:02,190
new so so why do we really care that

93
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:05,459
much you know and we go back to this

94
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:11,120
this sort of idea of how do we you know

95
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:11,120
sort of utilize what's around us to to

96
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:19,930
I guess really how what why do we care

97
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:25,299
about our spoofing why is that a big

98
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:26,919
deal there's a couple reasons you know

99
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,540
that the trend is sort of toward

100
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:30,010
Wireless everywhere every devices that

101
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,130
has a smartphone everybody has a

102
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:34,900
smartphone everybody is wireless every

103
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:38,590
smartphone on AT&T will automatically

104
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:40,780
connect to the ATT Wi-Fi network you

105
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:43,210
know networks are getting more

106
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,289
accessible in a lot of ways you know

107
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,169
think about retail think about

108
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:49,570
point-of-sale you know just being

109
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:55,630
available you know that you can access

110
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:58,020
their network sometimes it is hard to

111
00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:00,070
take control of a particular system

112
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,250
sometimes the network is the easier

113
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,250
target

114
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:08,190
there's a couple things here how many

115
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,240
people are familiar with our spoofing

116
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:13,169
pretty much everybody how many people

117
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,630
are familiar with slack the slack attack

118
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:17,830
get one a couple others okay cool all

119
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,630
right just trying to judge basically how

120
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:22,419
I spend my time I started talking about

121
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:25,240
this stuff our our cache poisoning is

122
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:27,130
still a valid attack you know there's

123
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,289
there are a lot of mitigations in my

124
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:32,409
testing I've seen you know some networks

125
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:35,159
more enterprise actually be vulnerable

126
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:37,930
to it versus you know your sort of

127
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,139
airplanes hotels things like that

128
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:44,289
there's often mitigations deployed there

129
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:48,580
slack is stateless Auto configuration

130
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:50,440
for ipv6 and it was released two years

131
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,260
ago by a by a gentleman at the InfoSec

132
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:56,260
Institute it's very it operates in a

133
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:58,180
very similar way but for ipv6 and allows

134
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:01,120
you to turn a lot over ipv4 so we'll

135
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:03,760
talk about that here in a second as far

136
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,680
as you know again why you should care

137
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,729
would your users really notice if they

138
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,360
got an invalid sir

139
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:13,810
probably not and an evil twin attacks

140
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,789
are sort of still pervasive so you know

141
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:17,560
all of these reasons are sort of

142
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:20,580
bringing man-in-the-middle back to a

143
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,580
point where it's really relevant

144
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:26,720
Android I just wanted to talk a little

145
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:28,550
bit about this there was a study done at

146
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,650
the Leibnitz university of hannover

147
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:32,150
where the guys analyzed thirteen hundred

148
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,599
thirteen thousand five hundred Android

149
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,969
apps

150
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:39,350
found about a thousand of those

151
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:41,810
vulnerable to no verification on the ssl

152
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:45,020
certificate it's a pretty common

153
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:47,600
developer bug to basically just specify

154
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:50,419
ssl no verify i'm sure you've all run

155
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,760
into this at some point where yeah it's

156
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:57,350
using ssl but the certificate can

157
00:06:52,760 --> 00:07:01,490
actually be swapped out and so you know

158
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:05,180
realistically it's not not verifying the

159
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:06,800
communication between the points and you

160
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:10,720
know it's about the same as not having

161
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:15,890
ssl okay great

162
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:17,000
another reason to care arm devices are

163
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,400
getting smaller and smaller you know

164
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,870
kind of started out with the palm plug

165
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,380
gum sticks have been very small the

166
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:28,940
Odroid devices the SS 808 this is a

167
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:32,210
little 1.7 gigahertz quad core it's

168
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:34,370
about the size of you know half dollars

169
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:37,940
so i'm sorry a half a dollar not a half

170
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:39,920
dollar and it's ultimately fast enough

171
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,960
to run most most relevant most current

172
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:46,250
attacks you know similar similar board

173
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:48,620
here this is a an MK sorry an SS 808 by

174
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,780
saying smart it's 50 bucks on amazon you

175
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:52,790
can literally go buy this board drop

176
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:55,070
cali on it and have a full attack

177
00:07:52,790 --> 00:08:01,100
platform for 50 bucks

178
00:07:55,070 --> 00:08:05,050
pretty crazy this so so basically you

179
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:05,050
know just kind of building building more

180
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:11,000
credibility for why you should care

181
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:15,680
about this intel's projecting ubiquitous

182
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,350
computing by 2020 we'll see about that

183
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,320
but but i mean obviously the trend is

184
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:22,730
toward smaller and smaller devices how

185
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,480
many of you have seen them ipad in a

186
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:29,120
store recently few of you everybody okay

187
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,530
cool yeah how about this many iPads in

188
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:35,060
the store

189
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:37,130
or you know this sort of thing so so I

190
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:38,959
mean retail and point-of-sale is

191
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,460
interesting just because you can sort of

192
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,960
get access to the network there whether

193
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,880
it's you know wired network or whether

194
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,170
it's a wireless network now I don't know

195
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,490
if these things are securely configured

196
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,750
if there's a VPN connection back to

197
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,970
headquarters with these but somehow I

198
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,290
doubt it in many cases I mean it's

199
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,000
almost easier than doing this anymore

200
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:58,459
like why steal the cash register if you

201
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,590
could just plug in a device also you

202
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:03,260
know 4G speeds getting faster how many

203
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:05,900
people have seen the freedom stick one

204
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:08,030
person two people three people basically

205
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,980
freedom six a rebranding of clear

206
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:12,949
Wireless for two bucks a month you can

207
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:15,320
get 500 Meg's of upload speed on 4G

208
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:19,730
speeds pretty cool stuff if you get a

209
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,930
chance to check it out so okay that's

210
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,670
all good and well you know the trend is

211
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:27,140
toward mobile trend is toward network

212
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:29,839
everywhere but securing layer two is

213
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:33,680
hard how many folks are actually getting

214
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:38,200
owned by man-in-the-middle and really

215
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:40,400
you know is it is it that practical and

216
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,130
you know this talk is meant to be a

217
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:47,150
practical talk so it's kind of let's go

218
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:48,710
through some of those attacks so I sort

219
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,300
of picked out a number of different

220
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:52,130
things that I thought were really really

221
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:58,189
easy to automate and really really easy

222
00:09:52,130 --> 00:10:02,870
to you know attack and this is the list

223
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:07,270
that I came up with so we'll go through

224
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:10,010
each one of these piece by piece you

225
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:11,329
know the first thing to say sort of

226
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,560
about man-in-the-middle is the easiest

227
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:14,089
way to prevent this thing is to have a

228
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,680
strong VPN connection if you're not

229
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:18,380
actually encrypting your traffic from

230
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,719
end to end you know there's there's lots

231
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:24,980
of ways to sort of get around it even if

232
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:30,110
you're using SSL how many people have

233
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:31,580
used a throwing start at one - how many

234
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:34,360
people have invented a throwing start

235
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:36,279
tap I see one

236
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,640
these things are they're awesome they're

237
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:40,630
like 50 15 $20 you can buy them in a

238
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,630
number of different places

239
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:47,680
Michael Osmond here has created an easy

240
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:48,640
way to get in line on the network you

241
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,199
know if you want to buy the the

242
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,459
professional kit they're about $40 it's

243
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,079
already built for you you don't have to

244
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:55,689
actually solder if you can't solder like

245
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:58,029
myself sometimes it's better to just go

246
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:01,720
with the pre-built these things are

247
00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:02,860
great what you see on the right if you

248
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,360
can see it in the back is basically

249
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:09,310
throwing starts half what you see on the

250
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:10,779
left is a dual comm port spanning device

251
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:12,579
and so this is a great way to just get

252
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:14,649
in the middle of a connection if you

253
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:17,279
have a Dropbox you can basically put it

254
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:19,089
on the network plug this guy in and

255
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,649
connect to it and so you'll basically

256
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:22,180
connect your network through the device

257
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:23,740
and then connect one of your devices off

258
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,420
of it now it's not good if you want to

259
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,649
manipulate traffic but if you just want

260
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:29,560
to see what's actually going on on the

261
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:31,620
network it's a great way to do it

262
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:35,649
now you can do a similar thing with just

263
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:37,329
the firewall right or sorry just a just

264
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:39,130
a device if you've got two interfaces

265
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:42,609
you can set up a bridge with bridge

266
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:44,170
bridge utils how many folks have used a

267
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:47,290
Linux bridge before familiar with it

268
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:49,149
pretty decent number this is basically

269
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:53,410
all you have to do in order to set up a

270
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:55,449
bridge on Linux use bridge control type

271
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:58,110
add bridge and then add the interfaces

272
00:11:55,449 --> 00:12:00,430
you want to it and then at that point

273
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:03,010
you can basically route traffic through

274
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:05,739
the device you know a great way to

275
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:09,130
either manipulate it traffic or just to

276
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:11,680
get visibility into it you know how you

277
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:12,910
prevent Hardware attacks you know good

278
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:19,300
physical security is what it comes down

279
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:20,769
to ARP cache poisoning so let's talk a

280
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,269
little bit about this sorry for like

281
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:24,070
bringing up like really old stuff but

282
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:25,089
it's so relevant that you know it's hard

283
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:27,550
to avoid when you're talking about

284
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:31,570
man-in-the-middle basically what's going

285
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:33,699
on is that you're sending ARP traffic to

286
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:36,910
the broadcast address and and/or to your

287
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:38,740
targets and telling them that you are at

288
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,240
a particular IP address they will

289
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,880
forward those traffic to you all send a

290
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,220
lot of timeline you know it's literally

291
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,680
this easy to do there's lots of ways to

292
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,620
do this

293
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,760
so we won't spend a lot of time on it

294
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,110
what I did want to talk about a little

295
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,630
bit though is you know how do you

296
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:56,790
prevent our cache poisoning it seems you

297
00:12:54,630 --> 00:13:01,950
know a lot of people talk about how to

298
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:03,209
how to you know exploit it but not a lot

299
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:06,690
of people talk about sort of how to

300
00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:08,760
prevent it and so I've noticed again in

301
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:12,720
my testing that did you know in most

302
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:14,490
hotels most impo wood places I'm not

303
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,950
actually able to ARP spoof and why is

304
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:20,550
that obviously it's not because of

305
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:22,080
static art tables right oftentimes I

306
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,670
think what it is actually I think what's

307
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,720
going on is the big disabled gratuitous

308
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:28,770
ARP if you're sending a lot of our

309
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:31,290
packets they're not allowing you to to

310
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:34,339
basically send our packets anymore like

311
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:37,410
they basically cut you off at that point

312
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:39,810
interestingly Hawaii has a patented

313
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:41,910
technique on this that they're not they

314
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:43,290
published and you can find it it's in

315
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,750
the notes for this slide if you're

316
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:47,459
interested in it you know typically the

317
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:50,399
guidance is to just monitor ARP and make

318
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:54,930
sure that you're not you know you're not

319
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:57,380
seeing tons of ARB traffic how many

320
00:13:54,930 --> 00:14:01,709
people familiar with DNS cache poisoning

321
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:03,480
cool I was - I guess I was confused sort

322
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:05,969
of on DNS cache poisoning about you know

323
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,930
how do you actually exploit this you

324
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,820
know there was there's talk of the

325
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,949
birthday attack which is basically where

326
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:15,660
you sort of guess the transmit ID from

327
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:17,730
the DNS server yeah I'll actually give

328
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,410
you a quick diagram I'm sorry for the

329
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:21,540
the slide here but basically what's

330
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:24,120
happening is you've got a DNS server

331
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,709
here your authoritative servers here

332
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,579
your users actually making your request

333
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:32,250
here and this is you know your malicious

334
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:33,930
user he's going and actually observing

335
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:37,079
traffic coming from the resolver and

336
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:39,630
then you know guessing the transmit ID

337
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:41,550
and that transfer IDs relatively a small

338
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:44,040
it's a small number so it's relatively

339
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:45,630
easy to guess and what that allows them

340
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,969
to do is spoof a response back to the

341
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:52,220
user the user gets either for their

342
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:55,140
single domain a an a record or they get

343
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:59,030
you know forth for the domain

344
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:59,030
an authoritative record allows you to

345
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:08,370
basically set whatever the NS ever you

346
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:10,140
want it turns out birthday attack really

347
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:11,490
isn't that relevant anymore DNS servers

348
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,319
been patched

349
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:16,620
you know the Kaminski attack has really

350
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,270
been patched in practice and so really

351
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,730
the only way to do DNS cache poisoning

352
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:22,410
as far as I'm aware is to actually be in

353
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:26,730
the middle already oh and so you have to

354
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:28,439
be observing traffic and you know at

355
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:30,930
that point you can actually see what the

356
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:36,480
transmit ID is and be able to return the

357
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:40,069
response back to the host preventing DNS

358
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,070
spoofing DNS SEC is really the way to go

359
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:44,460
okay so the slack attack this one is

360
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,850
actually you look really really

361
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:49,830
interesting so provided by the InfoSec

362
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:54,900
Institute about two years ago I think in

363
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:59,190
2011 maybe 2012 what they observed was

364
00:15:54,900 --> 00:16:03,590
that most the hosts on network are

365
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:06,990
already dual stacked so you can actually

366
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:08,760
provide an ipv6 address to hosts using

367
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:12,570
router advertisements and they'll pick

368
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:15,330
it up so this was a typical ipv4

369
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:17,790
internet typical set up right so you get

370
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:21,060
your router here you've got hosts with

371
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:23,000
ipv4 addresses what the slack attack is

372
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:26,849
going to do is introduce a new router

373
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:31,710
and give out ipv6 addresses to these

374
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:33,420
devices XP sp3 will actually pick up an

375
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:35,930
ipv6 address and anything above that

376
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,930
will pick it up

377
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:44,699
so let's skip ahead to this slide and

378
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:48,829
basically I'll walk you through the

379
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:51,469
steps here so you know this device here

380
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:54,479
is actually going to get an ipv6 address

381
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:56,100
the evil routers going to do Matt PT

382
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,169
translation on the device and so you're

383
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,029
gonna have this requesting an ipv4

384
00:16:58,169 --> 00:17:02,160
address this is going to translate it to

385
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:06,589
an ipv6 address send it out to the

386
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:09,569
server I'm sorry I go back i pp6 address

387
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:13,369
comes to this server this translates it

388
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:19,199
to ipv4 and it sends the response back

389
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:23,099
the nice thing about this is that your

390
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:27,019
ipv4 network is still intact and you're

391
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:27,019
using ipv6 to get out to the Internet

392
00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:32,659
basically it introduces a new path to

393
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:35,010
the Internet

394
00:17:32,659 --> 00:17:37,919
there's no compromise of the ipv4

395
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:42,929
network and there's really not a lot of

396
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:44,309
ways to detect this today so you know in

397
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:45,299
terms of packets what this looks like

398
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:46,470
and I know you can't see this in the

399
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:48,330
back so I'll just translate it for you

400
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:51,600
on the inside of the network what you're

401
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:54,389
seeing is ipv6 packets sent to that evil

402
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,709
router and then the evil router then

403
00:17:54,389 --> 00:18:00,269
translating those and sending those out

404
00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:05,000
to the Internet as ipv4 the guidance to

405
00:18:00,269 --> 00:18:08,940
prevent this is simply to disable ipv6

406
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,200
so that's kind of interesting right how

407
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:14,279
many enterprise networks have ipv6

408
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,570
enabled probably most of them is there

409
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:20,760
anybody here that's actually disabled

410
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:22,970
ipv6 inside one network interesting okay

411
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,970
cool

412
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:30,929
let's skip ahead so Wireless evil twin

413
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:33,000
this is another man in the middle

414
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:37,470
technique first one Wireless that we'll

415
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:40,799
talk about and really what this is is

416
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:43,799
you know setting up a road network so

417
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,720
they you know devices which can't

418
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:48,210
discern between which wireless networks

419
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:51,750
are available to them are automatically

420
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:55,289
connecting in so let's talk a little bit

421
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:57,210
about how you might do this this is the

422
00:18:55,289 --> 00:19:00,919
palm pad how many people have heard of

423
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:05,070
the pump at most people awesome cool

424
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:06,960
let's do a demo with it so if you

425
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:10,230
haven't heard of the pump basically what

426
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,299
it is is a nexus 7 with an Android

427
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:15,809
interface but then also I've been to

428
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:18,899
Jeru and what it allows you to do is run

429
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:21,120
security tools on the device from the

430
00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:24,258
Android interface so let me see if I can

431
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,258
get us connected here

432
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:16,170
so bear with me for just a second while

433
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:16,170
I get disconnected

434
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:40,060
you know

435
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,560
okay

436
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:47,850
all right live demo let's try this

437
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:12,629
all right you guys see that okay cool so

438
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:14,309
basically what this is is the palm pad

439
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:16,140
again this image is freely available

440
00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:20,428
from our website if you have a Nexus 7

441
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:21,720
you can go download it really let's do

442
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:23,460
this

443
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,860
so there's evil twin attacks what I'm

444
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:29,039
gonna do is hit this evil ap right here

445
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:32,280
it's a little bit slow but we'll go

446
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:34,230
ahead and give this a shot there we go

447
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:39,149
oh it's going to ask you which interface

448
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:42,360
you want to connect on so we'll say the

449
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:45,030
internal network then it's going to ask

450
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,979
us for an SSID I'm going to allow us to

451
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,990
spoof an SSID if we want it's using air

452
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:52,860
base on the back end so basically you

453
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:55,760
can respond to probe requests give it a

454
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,760
second to catch up yeah

455
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,080
come on

456
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,020
back-up plan

457
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,600
so I'm gonna switch it over to a

458
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,890
different wireless network just to make

459
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,889
it a little bit faster sorry about this

460
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:28,600
there we go

461
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:28,600
and what

462
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:43,299
okay

463
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,220
quite

464
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,940
perfect

465
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,570
okay

466
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:53,350
sorry for this give it a second half

467
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,350
we'll get it connected

468
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,230
122

469
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:15,320
seven

470
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:28,430
there we go all right let's try this

471
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,430
again

472
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:48,419
okay

473
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,399
okay

474
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:09,678
so people ap

475
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:17,010
there we go use the wireless connection

476
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:28,570
give it an SSID I'm going to turn off

477
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:28,570
automatic probe request connections

478
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:36,980
there we go I'm gonna start to get pro

479
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:40,669
requests everybody has a wireless off

480
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:43,080
yes all right cool

481
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:44,580
there we go all right sorry for the

482
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:50,300
delay on that just want to get this up

483
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:54,649
and going live demos are always fun so

484
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:54,649
let's connect with a client

485
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:08,299
so what you're seeing right now is probe

486
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:10,760
requests from clients and this thing

487
00:28:08,299 --> 00:28:11,600
listening on ATT Wi-Fi which by default

488
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,669
again

489
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:20,480
AT&T clients will automatically try and

490
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:21,860
connect on we've had folks run this

491
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,830
during live demos and actually had

492
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:28,209
connections from lots of different folks

493
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:30,500
okay there we go are already connected

494
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:31,549
and what I'm going to do at this point

495
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,900
is now that I've got the actual

496
00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:37,730
connection listening I'm gonna go ahead

497
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:43,390
and run strings watch just to see if we

498
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:43,390
can see anything come across so select

499
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,280
and we don't want to see the log

500
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:54,870
get met that run and you'll see almost

501
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:57,530
immediately we start getting traffic

502
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:57,530
across

503
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,190
they were going actually have a Kindle

504
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:11,360
this is a Kindle connecting answers most

505
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:15,590
of the trap it's actually encrypted

506
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:21,350
which is nice let's go ahead and go to a

507
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:23,709
web page there you go and you can start

508
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:26,030
to see some of the certificate strings

509
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:28,640
again this is I mean you can do a full

510
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:30,940
TCP dump with this but this is an easy

511
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,940
way to

512
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,830
grab traffic

513
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:56,270
there we go

514
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:56,270
and let's do an SSL strip on top of this

515
00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:02,460
is everybody familiar with this is all

516
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:04,559
strip it's anybody's know so SSL strip

517
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:07,590
is released by Moxie Marlinspike I think

518
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:11,399
was 2009 it's interesting I didn't fully

519
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:17,669
understand it until recently basically

520
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:22,380
what it's doing is stripping out HTTPS

521
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:23,640
links in traffic that comes across and

522
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:28,679
so if you make an initial connection

523
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:30,660
over HTTP it's gonna it's going to strip

524
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:33,120
out any HTTP links and it won't it won't

525
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:36,330
redirect you to HTTPS and so you're

526
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:39,530
basically stuck on HTTP even when you

527
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:39,530
enter credentials and things like that

528
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,080
it's two five years

529
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:07,129
there we go so that's up and running and

530
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:07,130
we can actually do a

531
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:27,370
and actually a biblical law or SSL

532
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:27,370
strips see we can impose nice thank you

533
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,210
so

534
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:10,630
[Music]

535
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:10,630
yeah

536
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:23,419
hangin to bear with me for a second

537
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:34,310
there we go and right

538
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:03,180
at work

539
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,480
okay see

540
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,869
[Music]

541
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:16,679
let me go back here and show you this

542
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:27,899
okay so we're still getting traffic

543
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:30,590
coming in let me try to get a facebook

544
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,590
on here

545
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:36,030
[Music]

546
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:56,470
awesome

547
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:56,470
yeah let down

548
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:05,390
[Music]

549
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,890
like a

550
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:18,790
and one more time

551
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:55,969
when I call it here in a second if we

552
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:55,970
can actually get it going

553
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:17,750
okay so I'm restarting EVP

554
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:23,940
I'm running my SSL strip

555
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,270
yeah

556
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:36,140
it's already running

557
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:52,790
collect your hand

558
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:12,250
okay well I'm having trouble connecting

559
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,779
the Kindle into this device so I'm gonna

560
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:15,490
go ahead and move on if anybody wants a

561
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:17,580
demo later I'll give them too great

562
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:20,919
thank you

563
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:23,470
basically evil twin attack pretty simple

564
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,930
to pull off the PO pad itself uses air

565
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:27,129
base you can do this on any laptop and

566
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:29,230
really the benefit of doing something

567
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:31,330
like this is that mobile phones and

568
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:36,190
devices with with Wireless are pretty

569
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:37,990
easy to fool into connecting to you how

570
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:39,580
do you prevent it you know basically

571
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:43,020
it's user education there's not a lot of

572
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:43,020
good ways to prevent this today

573
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:58,020
there we go again there's not a lot of

574
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,990
ways you can use radius but there's also

575
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:02,759
ways to to attack radius you can use

576
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:06,598
easy creds it's probably the easiest way

577
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:08,040
that I know in order to attack radio

578
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:10,830
service again if they're using stronger

579
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:14,970
authentication it's not such an issue

580
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:17,190
but it's definitely an issue if using

581
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:21,029
radius with leap does mobile device

582
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:22,410
management help not really depending on

583
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,910
how you set it up right you can actually

584
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:25,520
specify that all your devices will

585
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:28,910
automatically connect to a particular

586
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:31,619
SSID but again if you don't set up

587
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:35,940
authentication with that pretty easy to

588
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:38,310
spoof force to http

589
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:39,180
is really just SSL strip and so this is

590
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:40,950
kind of what I was talking about earlier

591
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:44,779
basic basically it rewrites links as

592
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:48,210
HTTP and then you know provides you with

593
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:49,740
what looks like a secure site it's

594
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:51,270
pretty easy to pull off I mean this is

595
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,950
you know this is the long and short of

596
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:54,480
running SSL strip you forward traffic

597
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:57,839
through your device you run the daemon

598
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:00,030
on the actual system that's gonna strip

599
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,619
traffic and then you forward traffic to

600
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:04,500
it

601
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:06,990
how do you prevent SSL strip attacks

602
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,430
really the server itself has to the

603
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:14,910
server and the browser have to agree

604
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:16,560
that they're not going to accept you

605
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:18,450
know traffic over HTTP in the way they

606
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,820
do that is we're gonna H to get HSTs

607
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:22,080
header Google's rolled this out on all

608
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:25,380
that all their properties in the last

609
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:28,470
year you know another way to prevent

610
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:33,720
this is just you know always browsing to

611
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:34,859
HTTPS dot whatever you know there's a

612
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,240
series of other attacks we're not gonna

613
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:38,250
spend any time on these just because

614
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,020
we're short on time as it goes but these

615
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:41,730
are all sort of semi practical attacks

616
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:44,400
with the exception of certificate abuse

617
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:49,530
and BGP attacks so I'll go ahead and

618
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:52,680
skip three of these you know there's a

619
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:55,290
lot of tools out there to automate

620
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:57,180
attacks like this some things you want

621
00:38:55,290 --> 00:39:01,730
to take a look at if you haven't already

622
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:04,859
it's decent if ettercap beef easy creds

623
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:08,630
subterfuge is a relatively new one

624
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:10,890
put an automated easy attack platform

625
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:11,970
you know I think the takeaways here that

626
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:15,450
men in the middle is really an

627
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:16,830
underrated attack vector in general you

628
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:21,359
know it's it's easier it's a target

629
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:23,670
people local to you POS systems are

630
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:25,800
specifically more vulnerable drop boxes

631
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:29,430
are providing a credible way to actually

632
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:31,890
get in the middle of networks and the

633
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:34,399
phones specifically are very vulnerable

634
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:41,370
there any questions

635
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:49,740
yep okay after this yeah yeah for sure

636
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:52,160
any other questions evil twin evil APR

637
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,160
evil twin

638
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:59,930
right right right basically what we were

639
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:04,430
demoing here right the automatic

640
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:07,220
connection into an access point yeah

641
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:08,600
yeah so you're basically creating a twin

642
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,890
of an access point so if there's you

643
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,210
know what does it here courtyard guest

644
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:12,890
so you can set it up it's either a

645
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:15,170
static courtyard guest and run it on a

646
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:17,690
different channel or you can set it so

647
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:19,250
that it responds to probe requests and

648
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:21,430
and when you get a probe request for

649
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,730
whatever your home network is you know

650
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:27,410
colleague Abe's

651
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:29,840
g-man puppies network address then you

652
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:31,520
know this will respond and say you know

653
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:34,180
this is you know I'm a valid access

654
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:40,100
point for you

655
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:41,569
any other questions okay cool thanks

656
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:46,600
please fill out feedback forms they're

657
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:46,600
available in the back well thanks guys
