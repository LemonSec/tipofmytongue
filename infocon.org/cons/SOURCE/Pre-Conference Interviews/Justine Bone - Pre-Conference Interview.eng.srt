in so awesome cool so so you've kind of

12
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,189
worked in both small startups as well as

13
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:33,740
big companies yeah and I think you

14
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:33,740
started your career and Morgan's

15
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:41,310
for example you know right right so a

16
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,140
lot of people though when they're kind

17
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,000
of in still in that job and they've not

18
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:48,450
broken free and you know taking that

19
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,520
step to do that next thing you know

20
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,049
there's this like I I call it the leap

21
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:59,570
of faith it's kind of like Indiana Jones

22
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:59,570
you step off the cliff for you and you

23
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,480
[Music]

24
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,899
actually run into lock people they're

25
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,459
like oh I would start a company but I

26
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,720
have kids I'm like are you kidding I

27
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,120
know all kinds of startup founders that

28
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,739
have kids like yeah like that might be a

29
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,750
reason for you but it doesn't have to be

30
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:53,310
right you just used to make it a reason

31
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,040
or a chance not to make it a reason and

32
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,600
do it anyway so what kind of advice

33
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,859
would you give to other people that are

34
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,030
interested in starting a company but

35
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,360
maybe haven't made that leap of faith

36
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,360
yet

37
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:13,900
and consciously invested time and

38
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:54,910
resources into maintaining and extending

39
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:59,020
my over the years technology have you

40
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:26,919
found that the risk anymore after a

41
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:30,039
while fix more on the spreadsheet

42
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:31,570
already so it continues to grow that's

43
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:33,010
what's rewarding and one of the things

44
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:35,889
that I really know about this is

45
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:38,349
building out my team fostering the

46
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:40,960
culture being able to create a culture

47
00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:42,760
that I believe works folks that are on

48
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,770
my team might get a lot of personal

49
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:48,039
satisfaction from that everything from

50
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:50,020
my you know seasons exist through to the

51
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:52,360
interns that we're bringing in and I get

52
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,250
really excited and motivated by that as

53
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:59,680
well

54
00:05:53,250 --> 00:06:18,000
bringing in outsiders as advisors really

55
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:20,469
paid off in the first two months anyway

56
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,040
right right yeah there's there's a

57
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:21,940
certain

58
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,800
you can do on your own but there's

59
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,030
definitely an element of team that comes

60
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:56,440
into play that if you don't have a good

61
00:06:25,030 --> 00:07:00,280
team challenge usually in most

62
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,390
collaborating right yeah I know some

63
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,770
people are kind of it's kind of like the

64
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,849
same people like don't want to buy a

65
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:07,060
house because they don't want to be a

66
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:08,380
landlord you know or buy a multi-family

67
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,580
cuz I don't wanna be a landlord you know

68
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:11,350
in the same way like people like oh I

69
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,130
don't know start a company because you

70
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,540
know I don't know anything about

71
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:16,000
marketing around I think about sales

72
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:26,460
it's like well hey you can learn in B

73
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:29,260
you can hire people and you write I

74
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,659
think I lost your audio a bit can you

75
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:43,330
hit me up now again okay look you cut

76
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:44,500
out for just a second here exactly so so

77
00:07:43,330 --> 00:08:12,120
what's the most challenging thing about

78
00:07:44,500 --> 00:08:15,910
starting a company ability strategy and

79
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:19,420
when you grow someone organically one of

80
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:20,950
your key to DS is feedback that you get

81
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:23,290
from your customers and as you get this

82
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:25,810
feedback you can find yourself opening

83
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:27,610
in terms of your say your product about

84
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,980
them roadmap and your strategy around

85
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,690
that or even the service

86
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:33,539
that you might be offering but at the

87
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:53,880
same time if you've got others involved

88
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:56,280
when you've laid out a proposal right

89
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,630
yeah I would agree I mean you can only

90
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,770
at any given time you make the best

91
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:01,950
decision you can with the information

92
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:03,360
you have at the time but then there has

93
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,550
to be an evaluation loop where you're

94
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,050
like did this actually work because some

95
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:26,069
people is like nope I made the decision

96
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:27,959
I'm doing it and then you just gotta you

97
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,490
gotta do it you know you know being

98
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:33,720
flexible I think is definitely an

99
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:37,400
attribute of success for sure the most

100
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,400
rewarding thing about starting companies

101
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:44,169
[Music]

102
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:28,800
yeah yeah I definitely same thing like

103
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:30,540
when I can mentor somebody and help them

104
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,680
out and then suddenly they're doing you

105
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,939
know amazing new things it's like wow

106
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,920
that's really cool it's awesome that I

107
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,020
could play some small part in that and

108
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,400
anything that kind of helps encourage

109
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,900
more people to be entrepreneurs I'm a

110
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,160
huge fan of that's why I like doing

111
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,790
things like this at stores even though

112
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,500
it's a little bit

113
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,640
different than the kinds of things you

114
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:53,530
