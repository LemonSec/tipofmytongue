1
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:09,559
hi this is rob machine with the source

2
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:11,690
conference and i'm here with paul acid

3
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:13,100
orion who's the founder and CEO of

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,559
security weekly and he's going to be

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:18,830
speaking at source boston in on may

6
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:20,990
ninth and tenth 2018 and his talk is on

7
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:25,009
how i learned not to suck at docker

8
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:26,330
security but you don't have to why don't

9
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:27,650
you start just by for those that don't

10
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,209
know what docker is if you could just

11
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,799
give us like the twenty five thousand

12
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,029
foot view of what docker is to start

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,700
sure

14
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:37,630
so Dockers a container service which

15
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,860
allows you to abstract your application

16
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:42,380
above the kernel level to run them on

17
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,480
top of the operating system permanently

18
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:46,220
I think in support of DevOps it's kind

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,319
of interesting is I go back and read

20
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,879
books like the Phoenix project and they

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,470
talk about DevOps I was like wow that

22
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,470
was before containers became really

23
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:56,660
popular as a way to basically put your

24
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:59,690
infrastructure and your code and

25
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:01,760
applications in a neat container and be

26
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,949
able to deploy those out to the network

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,200
so cool

28
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:08,799
so what's the overall talk gonna be

29
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,390
about yeah so it's really about my

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,950
journey or experience it's kind of funny

31
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,689
rub before we started recording we're

32
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:18,590
talking about you know taking content

33
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:20,898
and making podcasts several years ago we

34
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:22,429
were producing less content than today

35
00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:24,710
but still enough where I wanted some

36
00:01:22,429 --> 00:01:27,259
type of system or tool that basically

37
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:29,449
takes our high-definition video file and

38
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:31,579
we give it to an application and the

39
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:33,979
application automates all of those steps

40
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:36,048
that myself and others working here it's

41
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:37,819
treating weekly we're doing manually so

42
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:40,880
we were you know pushing it up to a

43
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:43,939
podcast service we were manually copying

44
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,530
pasting descriptions and metadata we

45
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:47,568
were then posting it to different

46
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,670
services like YouTube and uploading to

47
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:52,100
social media like Facebook and it was

48
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:54,499
just taking too long and I said well my

49
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,839
vision to grow the security weekly until

50
00:01:54,499 --> 00:01:59,030
the 7 shows we have today we're gonna

51
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,889
have seven times the amount of content

52
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:03,469
that we have which means we're going to

53
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:05,929
have to automate and so I asked a

54
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:09,019
developer to start the beginnings of

55
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:11,420
that application and then last year as

56
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,430
the software developed I said um we

57
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,869
really I'm like we kind of now are

58
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:18,110
basically running a software business

59
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:19,490
inside of a podcast company and I needed

60
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,740
to understand the

61
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:23,450
DevOps process better how software

62
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,130
development is done today so that I

63
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,049
could understand it and relay that

64
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:29,090
information to the security community

65
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:30,440
but more importantly understand how

66
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,380
docker works I was having conversations

67
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,109
with people and abstractly I'm like yeah

68
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:38,299
I get it but I haven't worked hands-on

69
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:40,370
with it in a or presented an opportunity

70
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,230
for myself to take our internal

71
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,570
application and put it inside of docker

72
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:47,660
and work with it and the talk is really

73
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:49,310
about all of my experiences and kind of

74
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,079
footnotes inside notes about what I

75
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:53,390
learned and what I can caution other

76
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,980
people about and encourage other people

77
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:57,079
do the things that I think we did right

78
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,399
and caution them on all the things that

79
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,960
I was like while that's wrong I got to

80
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,270
go rebuild that and read you to get and

81
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:05,600
so that's where the talk came from got

82
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:07,670
it so how does you know kind of docker

83
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,700
rising podcasts how can then apply to

84
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:13,459
security yeah it's interesting it really

85
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,799
taught me a lot about the struggles that

86
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:18,890
security professionals are going to have

87
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:21,440
today and do have very much so when

88
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:24,529
you're tasked with looking at any type

89
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,540
of applications security today likely

90
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:29,420
they're using docker or some other

91
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:33,260
equivalent of a containerized service to

92
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:34,820
deploy that application and so by me

93
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,109
understanding how all this worked and

94
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,489
looking at it with my security

95
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,590
background going well that could be

96
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:41,450
problematic to figure out in terms of

97
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,710
security and taking those lessons and

98
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:45,920
I'm sharing them the security community

99
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:48,260
to say if you're responsible in any way

100
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,190
shape form or fashion for helping your

101
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:54,200
developers and IT department understand

102
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,790
DevOps with this container service that

103
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,130
they're likely using to support that

104
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:00,440
process then you're gonna want to

105
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:02,600
basically listen to my talk and get my

106
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:05,300
perspective as the all those different

107
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,160
things that I encounter that could be

108
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,690
potential issues I'd like to say that I

109
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,760
have an answer for everything but I

110
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:13,490
don't so it's very much a conversational

111
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,079
you know I observed this I think this is

112
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,850
how we could solve this problem but if

113
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,140
anyone has done that you know share it

114
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:21,410
with the group's it'll be very much an

115
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:23,450
interactive presentation as well oh cool

116
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:25,970
so what was probably your biggest

117
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:27,760
challenge with with docker as you went

118
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:32,360
through what was your biggest headache

119
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:35,240
for me it was really under

120
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:39,620
ending how different the development

121
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:42,229
process is today from my experiences

122
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,509
when I was the systems administrator and

123
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:46,580
development would take all of the code

124
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:48,889
they would deliver it to me I would

125
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,840
rebuild all of the environment based on

126
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:53,060
their notes and scripts and what little

127
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,609
documentation I was provided and then

128
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,250
hand that off to QA QA would do their

129
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:59,840
thing for a while and then go back to

130
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,449
development and go back and forth until

131
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,388
we push into production when I started

132
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:07,460
setting up docker I was like wow that's

133
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:09,139
completely different now and that was

134
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,870
the biggest challenge for me was to

135
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:14,389
retrain my old archaic way of thinking

136
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:18,050
into I developed inside this container

137
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:20,719
and then once it's done I just I push it

138
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,939
to the next piece and I can leave out a

139
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:25,340
lot of that intrical e all of that

140
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:27,139
infrastructure work and now it's in QA

141
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:30,888
and now I can test it and if it passes

142
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:32,740
those tests I can push it along it's

143
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:35,900
very much the way Jean Kim and others

144
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:39,169
describe even the book the goal from

145
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:41,479
1984 that Jean references a lot it was

146
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:43,310
very much the foundation for the Phoenix

147
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:45,139
project and how you just want to push

148
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,229
forward you don't want to ever go back

149
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:49,729
you just want to keep pushing forward

150
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:52,400
grasping that concept was probably one

151
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:53,568
of my biggest challenges see so what's

152
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,960
your favorite thing about docker what do

153
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:58,490
you love about it I like the ability to

154
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,489
basically spin up environments

155
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:03,650
everywhere and I think that was one of

156
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:05,240
the things that I wanted to put inside

157
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:07,758
of the talk to encourage people to use

158
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,680
docker I talk to my pen tester friends

159
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,870
and they'd be like well you know every

160
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,580
time we do an engagement we spit up a

161
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,199
bunch of tools we create this temporary

162
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:18,349
environment and then we tear it all down

163
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,969
and at least last year I'd ask all of

164
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:21,529
them are using docker for that because

165
00:06:19,969 --> 00:06:24,740
that's one's like a good job for docker

166
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:26,960
and they're like no not yet we haven't

167
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,479
like taken the plunge to go learn it and

168
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,250
so that's one of the other things that

169
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:33,229
encouraged me to go learn it was so that

170
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,300
I could share my experiences and have a

171
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:37,339
game some more adoption because the

172
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,930
coolest thing about docker is you build

173
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:40,580
it once inside of a container and then

174
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,440
you can push it around and replicate it

175
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:45,950
all over the place which i think is

176
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:48,650
pretty cool well awesome so

177
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:50,450
also run the security weekly podcast and

178
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,340
you've recently added some new podcasts

179
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,420
to the lineup why don't you tell us a

180
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,570
little bit about the new ones

181
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:58,610
sure so enterprise security weekly is

182
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:01,040
hosted by John strand and myself and we

183
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:02,690
talk about the security industry we say

184
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,250
we're you know about the security

185
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,219
industry and we're not afraid to name

186
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,870
names so we talk about all the vendors

187
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,730
for me there wasn't a lot of people that

188
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:12,770
were talking about what security vendors

189
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:15,130
were doing also that was born out of

190
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:17,330
frustration of me visiting websites

191
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:18,830
talking to the vendor reading their

192
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,479
white papers and still not knowing what

193
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,950
they did so it created a whole podcast

194
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,530
around it and that's been going really

195
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:26,180
well there's business security weekly

196
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:28,400
which is geared more towards senior

197
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,690
executives in security that talks about

198
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,190
the security of business and the

199
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:33,950
business of security so we talk about

200
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:35,840
startups we talk about how you sell

201
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,580
security whether you're selling a

202
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,979
security product or whether you're

203
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,630
selling something to your other internal

204
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:44,120
teams or management that you want to get

205
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:46,580
done a project in security how to sell

206
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,440
that how to communicate and so the theme

207
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,780
really became communication leadership

208
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,340
and innovation and Michael says

209
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,739
Arcangelo is the primary host for that

210
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:57,049
show and he just as a fantastic job as

211
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,030
background in communications as it's

212
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,950
applied to security is really the heart

213
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:03,140
and soul of the show so that shows

214
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:04,760
really been taking off especially since

215
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:07,219
we changed from start up security weekly

216
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,170
to business security weekly we put a

217
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,480
slightly different spin change around a

218
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:13,670
little bit of our content and it's just

219
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:16,040
so much fun ah let's see

220
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:17,540
secure digital life is for those that

221
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,550
are just getting started in the field

222
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,800
that's hosted by Doug white from Roger

223
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:24,140
Williams University does a fantastic job

224
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,790
of breaking things down and then the

225
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:29,510
latest one that I started with Keith

226
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:31,640
hood late' who works for bugcrowd is on

227
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:34,360
application security weekly talking

228
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:37,819
about much of the topic of my talk and

229
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:40,750
the security as it relates to DevOps and

230
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:43,880
as the security teams have to relate to

231
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:46,790
development in IP as it's done today is

232
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,200
really the subject of that show got it

233
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:51,140
so lots of cool stuff going on

234
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,780
absolutely cool man

235
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:55,069
so you're kind of known for asking

236
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,439
people funny questions on things I

237
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:59,970
figured I'd yeah kind of reverse your

238
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,639
hacker trivia on you so

239
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:04,049
okay Supra I didn't want to go into like

240
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,059
you know nitpicky details because I

241
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:08,159
figured you'd probably crush me in any

242
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:09,779
of those so just high-level what's the

243
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:13,619
best hacker movie and what's the worst

244
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:15,929
hacker movie and why wow that's a

245
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:18,779
difficult question I'd say probably the

246
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:21,959
best one would be sneakers and a lot of

247
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:24,299
that is the cast that was you know in

248
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:26,429
that movie was just so epic I mean I had

249
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:29,759
Robert Redford yet Sydney pops yeah you

250
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:31,589
had been Kingsley and just the acting

251
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,079
and the script it was very very well

252
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:35,399
done and I think still very relevant

253
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:39,209
many of the lessons that we learned from

254
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:41,849
that movie today the worst ones man

255
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:44,699
there there's a tie and a whole bunch of

256
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:46,859
hacker movies that are really bad you

257
00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:48,689
know the net was pretty bad in really

258
00:09:46,859 --> 00:09:52,919
most scenes in Hollywood movies didn't

259
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:56,189
involve hacking are really bad I would

260
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:58,589
say swordfish could possibly be at the

261
00:09:56,189 --> 00:09:59,879
top of the list for the scene that many

262
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:02,399
of us know that I won't go into any

263
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:05,220
details but it is so utterly ridiculous

264
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,159
that it may earn the top spot is the

265
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,709
worst hacking portrayed in the film

266
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:14,369
right swordfish absolutely is my number

267
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:15,988
one worst hacking yeah yeah and I think

268
00:10:14,369 --> 00:10:17,369
for me the best one would be wargames

269
00:10:15,989 --> 00:10:19,829
still because that was kind of the one

270
00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:21,779
that kind of immersed me in that initial

271
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:24,419
hacker culture and there's elements of

272
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:26,549
it that were somewhat realistic a lot of

273
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:28,079
things that were not but definitely some

274
00:10:26,549 --> 00:10:29,189
elements that were you know related to

275
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,098
things that were really going on at the

276
00:10:29,189 --> 00:10:33,569
time so absolutely yeah I probably war

277
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:35,489
games and sneakers could be pretty much

278
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:37,228
a tie or flip-flop depending on the hood

279
00:10:35,489 --> 00:10:38,429
but now you've pretty much made me want

280
00:10:37,229 --> 00:10:41,369
to go watch sneakers again it's been a

281
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:43,139
while yeah yeah very good ones very good

282
00:10:41,369 --> 00:10:45,689
one yeah so we've been doing a hacker

283
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:47,669
movie trivia at various conferences by

284
00:10:45,689 --> 00:10:49,559
the time we get the source I'll probably

285
00:10:47,669 --> 00:10:52,859
have some fresh questions and fresh

286
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:54,509
trivia that call from stuff all right

287
00:10:52,859 --> 00:10:56,609
cool well we're looking forward to

288
