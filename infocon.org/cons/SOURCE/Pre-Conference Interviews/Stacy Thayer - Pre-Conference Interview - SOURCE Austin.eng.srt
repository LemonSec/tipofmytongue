00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,809
hi this is rob machine with a source

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,419
conference and I'm here with dr. Staci

4
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:18,970
theatre who is uh has a background in

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:21,099
cyber psychology and behavior and she's

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,479
also coincidentally the original founder

7
00:00:21,099 --> 00:00:23,740
of the source conference so we've come

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,230
full-circle now we have her on the

9
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,729
podcast as a speaker now so she's going

10
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,580
to be speaking at source Austin on

11
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:32,409
December 5th and 6th and the title of

12
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,870
her talk is put your oxygen mask on

13
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:37,650
before assisting others self care and

14
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:40,900
security now that's a topic that's been

15
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:42,129
evolving over the years and I'm glad

16
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,629
that we've been doing it because there

17
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:46,870
are there has been a lot of incidences

18
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:50,799
of burnout and things like that so what

19
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:53,379
do you how do you define self-care so

20
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:55,510
first off thank you for the experience

21
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:57,849
of being able to have the opportunity to

22
00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:01,989
speak source it's really an honor and

23
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:04,059
and course very special to me to see how

24
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:05,710
you've grown it and then to have the

25
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:08,380
opportunity to be a speaker so I'm

26
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:10,720
really excited and honored to have the

27
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:14,259
chance to be have that and have that

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:18,940
speaker experience so when I when I look

29
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:21,100
at self-care in the way that I defined

30
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,050
in terms of put your oxygen mask on

31
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,750
first just like they say when you're on

32
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,920
the airplane is that when you're working

33
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,980
on anything especially when you're

34
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,980
working with people if you're not ok if

35
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:37,060
you're not at your best mentally if you

36
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:39,460
are challenged about yourself and find

37
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,350
yourself frustrated or upset or not

38
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:44,470
working at your best you need to take

39
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:46,300
that time and get yourself balanced and

40
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:49,510
what we're seeing especially in the

41
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:52,289
security industry is that actually in a

42
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:55,120
lot of industries that the notion of

43
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,710
taking vacation time you know a lot of

44
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,560
people don't actually take their

45
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:02,710
allotted vacation time despite it being

46
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:05,710
a policy they have budded a crew or they

47
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:07,419
just don't bother using it they would

48
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,818
rather go into work or work from home

49
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:12,569
and they're not taking that time to say

50
00:02:09,818 --> 00:02:14,738
what's good for my mental health and

51
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:16,810
people what happens is you're putting

52
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:18,880
too much of yourself into your job and

53
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,760
and why I think this is interesting to

54
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,500
the security industry is because many

55
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,859
people in the security and

56
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:30,520
specifically in roles where their job is

57
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:33,370
to protect and take care of security and

58
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:35,650
safety of an organization yet what

59
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:37,330
they're not doing a lot of times is

60
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:40,950
taking care of the safety and security

61
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:43,360
of themselves and this is and and I've

62
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,910
been on panels and hunt talks about

63
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,920
about burnout in security industry about

64
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:51,310
addiction in the secure the industry and

65
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,958
about how is it that in and basically

66
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,959
what's an industry that could be quite a

67
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,870
pressure cooker how are people coping

68
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:02,650
and so that's why when I when I talk

69
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:06,370
about self-care its to find a positive

70
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:08,320
way to release some of the tension that

71
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,959
you experience from the stress of the

72
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,120
job that's not burning out completely

73
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,640
that's not turning to drinking and drugs

74
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,470
and unfortunately there's been a high

75
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,679
rate of suicide in the industry as well

76
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:23,590
and I think as you were saying that's

77
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,180
why it's been a topic that's been kind

78
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:29,410
of a hot topic lately because we're

79
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:31,870
realizing that both as employees and as

80
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:34,269
managers we're not seeing people who

81
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:37,120
realize this is what I need to do to

82
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:39,970
acknowledge my own mental health right

83
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,230
right yeah I mean one of the things I've

84
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,570
been trying to add into source

85
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,399
specifically is this whole people track

86
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,500
specifically for these kinds of reasons

87
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,989
they'd be a way to you know have more

88
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,519
balance and not just always be focused

89
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:54,790
on you know got to get the job done

90
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,440
because I I have found for myself just

91
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:59,470
you know I've been an entrepreneur now

92
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:02,950
since 2007 and running my own stuff and

93
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:05,260
I totally hear you on the vacation thing

94
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:07,720
like sometimes I have to like make

95
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,149
myself take a break and I've learned

96
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,040
over the years how to manage that in a

97
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,900
way where I actually like alright if I'm

98
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,400
feeling stressed out it's more

99
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,810
productive for me to do nothing for a

100
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,690
little while and go away and do

101
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,519
something else then idea is to like

102
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,810
sometimes push like I'm the kind of

103
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,970
person that like it's like 3:00 in the

104
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,770
morning I'm like I could just pull off

105
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,080
this all-nighter and I'll be fine and

106
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,940
but you know then I'll be a wreck for

107
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,909
the next three days and that doesn't

108
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:36,520
help me so you know having that balance

109
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,180
it's definitely it's challenging

110
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,740
sometimes

111
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:42,710
and especially now I mean putting our

112
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,450
own so I'm the worst person like what

113
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,340
and I was working in an office invited

114
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,930
be like 9 o'clock and I'm like oh now's

115
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,539
a really good time just send out a

116
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:54,350
series of emails and my own supervisor

117
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:56,810
who was was really wonderful with me and

118
00:04:54,350 --> 00:05:00,110
she said at the end of the day put the

119
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:02,900
job down and go home and then pick it up

120
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:06,050
in the morning and not to get into the

121
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:08,900
habit of this 24 hour availability

122
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:11,240
because once you start with that once

123
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,099
and they know oh I can email at any time

124
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,890
you're setting the precedent for not

125
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,690
being able to take time for yourself

126
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:19,460
because we become a culture of well it's

127
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:21,140
taken more than an hour for somebody to

128
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:25,090
reply to my email what's that about I

129
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:27,770
know it got a bit yeah you're home

130
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:31,310
having a night just chilling out and not

131
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:33,380
checking your phone that's that's really

132
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:37,610
hard to G we don't just connect to numb

133
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:40,850
and I think what happens though also

134
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:43,370
when I've seen people just connect it's

135
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:45,320
done in a way that is I'm gonna

136
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:48,110
disconnect now and it becomes almost

137
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:50,030
very dramatic in a way of doing it as

138
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:52,010
opposed right in develop I'm gonna

139
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:54,469
disconnect right now and this is about

140
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:56,000
my mental health and I'm going to kind

141
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:58,760
of quietly take some time for myself

142
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,560
right it does have to be a big mic drop

143
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,150
every time it's just you know right

144
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,440
right right there's no that doesn't have

145
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,109
to be the big announcement I'm leaving

146
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,030
Facebook for a while right right you see

147
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:10,190
those from time to time from people like

148
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:12,219
clearly they've gotten to fry down the

149
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:14,390
rabbit hole now it's interesting I find

150
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:18,230
now especially with more people working

151
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:21,260
from home it's especially challenging to

152
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:23,390
balance that when there really is no

153
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:25,550
hard line between work and home anymore

154
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:27,200
you're just kind of you're on part of

155
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,280
the day you're off part of the day or on

156
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,130
part of the day and it just kind of

157
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:34,070
feels like all day every day becomes

158
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:35,840
work if you aren't careful how do you

159
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:39,020
kind of recommend that people manage

160
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,690
that yeah

161
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:43,640
again setting time setting times of

162
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:45,919
scheduling like you would in a day that

163
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,539
to say okay from from 6:00 to 8:00 this

164
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,430
is this is when I'm not going to be

165
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,780
working or this is how I'm going to have

166
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:52,580
a schedule and

167
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:55,969
it becomes easy to just let the day be

168
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:58,280
fluid but it really it takes disciplines

169
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:02,630
you have that time and and I think what

170
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,799
also happens is we hear kind of also

171
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:07,700
becomes a stereotypical

172
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:09,290
take the time breathe whatever and we

173
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:12,680
all say to do it but then we never end

174
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:16,250
up doing it and it sounds almost cliche

175
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,810
and it almost sounds like a self-help

176
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,370
guru and we I think I know a lot of

177
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:21,350
people just you know well I'm not gonna

178
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,310
I mean not gonna meditate if I had the

179
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:25,010
amount of people that came up to me said

180
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:26,390
have you tried meditation and I know it

181
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:28,360
works for a lot of people but I'd always

182
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:31,909
be like stop telling me to meditate

183
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,620
that's not what I mean like you know and

184
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,540
it's about giving things a chance that

185
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,150
not everything is going to be for

186
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:42,050
everybody but find out what works for

187
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:43,729
you in the course of a day even if it's

188
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:46,490
taking ten minutes to play that put your

189
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:49,039
video game or go for a walk or play with

190
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:50,750
your kids or do nothing just sit there

191
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,030
and just veg out for a little while

192
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,990
there's no rules because everybody's

193
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:59,750
self-care is going to be different yeah

194
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:01,130
yeah for me like my last company by the

195
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,750
time I was done with that I was so

196
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,880
burned out that I ended up taking a

197
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:07,400
couple years mostly off just kind of

198
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:10,250
hanging out and I got I swore to myself

199
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,810
when I started this one that I would you

200
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,430
know no matter what I was gonna clip my

201
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,440
bonsai trees and check out you know and

202
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,700
play around with those and like everyday

203
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,229
I'm gonna go out and check my bonsai

204
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,430
trees and you know that gives me

205
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:21,859
something I have a lot of them so I'm

206
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:24,500
just kind of that's just I've gone deep

207
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:27,410
down that rabbit hole and but it but it

208
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,820
I found I was in my last company I was

209
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,080
kind of neglecting them and ignoring

210
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,419
them and I could tell cuz they would

211
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,909
start to die and not look very nice and

212
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:36,919
you know so it it was just little things

213
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:38,539
like that just get like taking a time to

214
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:42,978
just do something that you care about

215
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:44,360
that's not work is useful and taking

216
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:48,020
five minutes out to play a video game or

217
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:50,150
something is a useful question what else

218
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,980
do I do like if you had to look at your

219
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,810
life and then kind of put it all on

220
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:56,360
paper and say where's the balance you

221
00:08:53,810 --> 00:09:01,369
say okay here's work what else do I do

222
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:02,420
besides work and a lot yeah I didn't

223
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,800
always have a great answer for that

224
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,719
question and then it became like

225
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,910
okay I read or I have to think about it

226
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,089
from the other part that's really

227
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:13,219
important though is also for managers

228
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:16,339
because as managers being able to

229
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:19,370
recognize an employee in distress mm-hmm

230
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:23,779
is an important skill because that's

231
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:25,310
something that I've seen really

232
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:26,750
wonderful managers I've been blessed to

233
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:28,609
have wonderful managers that cared a lot

234
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,920
about my mental health and about making

235
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:34,010
sure that I was in an okay place and

236
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,660
I've had ones that didn't and one of the

237
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,769
things that I had done some research

238
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,290
almost it was this concept of

239
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:41,720
organizational citizenship and a

240
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:43,849
basically employee engagement and how do

241
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,519
you keep your employees invested in

242
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:50,420
their job and good at what they're doing

243
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:51,890
and part of that largely has to do with

244
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:55,939
their mental health and job satisfaction

245
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:58,100
and so for a manager to be able to to

246
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:02,420
recognize hey you know what you have

247
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:04,940
been here working late for the past week

248
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:07,040
or so why don't you take a day off or

249
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:09,529
why don't you take some time this is and

250
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:13,520
in acknowledging you were doing a good

251
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:15,230
job or maybe this could be better but in

252
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,149
a more constructive way in a more

253
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:21,200
respectful way and taking just in

254
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:22,790
general a lot more care for yourself as

255
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,740
a manager so again making sure that if

256
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:28,219
you are a manager you're in a good place

257
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:31,089
to then be a better manager for your

258
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:33,950
people to help them help themselves too

259
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:35,660
right yeah I think we've all heard the

260
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:37,010
horror stories of the managers that you

261
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,319
know just don't respect people's time

262
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:41,209
off and call them at really

263
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,880
inappropriate times and expect things

264
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:46,819
right now and you know I I've always

265
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,949
been surprised by that because a it's

266
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:51,500
really hard to find good people and B

267
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:52,579
isn't it obvious that if you treat

268
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,980
people like that they're gonna

269
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:58,790
eventually leave like I never understood

270
00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:01,640
that mentality of just like just abusing

271
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:03,110
your people but yeah hopefully more and

272
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:06,230
more managers are starting to get that

273
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:08,269
you know people are part of your team

274
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,709
and you know need to have that balance

275
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:11,750
in their lives they're just you know

276
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:15,140
gonna go find someplace else that gives

277
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:17,420
it to them and people will reach out for

278
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:20,089
help somewhere in there there

279
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:22,550
in the security issue and I could I can

280
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:25,190
name a couple that are just absolutely

281
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:28,219
wonderful at how they care for other

282
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:29,930
people and they have a list of people

283
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:33,110
that they reach out to and call just to

284
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:34,670
say hey how is it going you know and and

285
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,440
that is because they have recognized

286
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:38,990
they've reached that level of who I know

287
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:43,160
when I'm not okay I know what it means

288
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:44,660
to have that need for self care and you

289
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,990
know even if it's just to say now I know

290
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,790
I

291
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,410
not everybody says I need a hug I know

292
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,449
hugging the thing for some people but

293
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:52,640
you know just to be able to say I need

294
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:55,279
somebody to reach out who is somebody

295
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:59,290
that I can I can call or who is somebody

296
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:01,939
that I can talk to or send a message to

297
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:03,319
say you know what and whatever it is

298
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,750
doesn't have to be other people

299
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:08,269
but what is your safety net what is your

300
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:10,459
oxygen mask you're gonna put on to take

301
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:11,750
care of yourself and then of course the

302
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:13,310
next thing is you know you don't just

303
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,110
sit there with the oxygen mask and then

304
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:17,779
how do you how do you then pass that

305
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:20,180
along to other people to help them but

306
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:21,980
if you're not taking care of yourself it

307
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:24,769
is very hard to take care of anybody

308
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:27,260
else or be the best that you can be yep

309
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:29,209
definitely and just a plug for walks

310
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,560
walks are great like that nothing clears

311
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:32,479
your head quite like a lock in my

312
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:37,099
experience and and I will give you a

313
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,240
plus one plug for meditation as as

314
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,390
someone who likes to occasionally

315
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,649
meditate it is a useful thing and it's

316
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:44,839
one of those things if you've never done

317
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:46,459
it or been trained in it there's a

318
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:51,589
learning curve and the learning curves

319
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:53,599
not off well that part of the being good

320
00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:55,250
at it is just kind of stop trying to be

321
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,990
good at it you know it's just like you

322
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:59,060
know the whole point is just to sit

323
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:00,230
there and let things go and not worry

324
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:05,209
about it a lot of people getting so

325
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:09,800
fixated I can't stop thinking well why

326
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:12,819
you need to meditate but every I guess

327
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,899
you know everybody should have something

328
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:19,029
as long as you have something it doesn't

329
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:22,790
you know every what do I do to relax

330
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:24,100
yep you know and and that everybody

331
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:27,649
should have an answer to that question

332
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:29,300
and it's a fine line because for a lot

333
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:31,310
of people it's what do I do to relax oh

334
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:34,969
I have a beer you

335
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:37,640
or I smoke or I do you know and I like

336
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:40,250
to encourage and not not not with

337
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:42,170
judgment but encourage is it something

338
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,940
that you're doing that's also healthy

339
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:46,459
for you because it's it's there's been

340
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,839
numerous talks about addiction cycles

341
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:50,420
and the amount of drinking in the

342
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,880
security industry right for a lot of

343
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:55,339
different reasons and so what are the

344
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:59,570
alternatives that could be healthier

345
00:13:55,339 --> 00:14:02,270
behaviors and again as managers and as

346
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:03,920
either founders or company owners is how

347
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:06,740
are you basically creating what is a

348
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,020
healthy environment for you for your

349
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,570
people and for the company because it

350
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:14,420
there they are all tied systematically

351
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:17,570
together and again you care for one it's

352
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:19,339
gonna go into the others and you'll just

353
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:21,589
be better off and a more efficient

354
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:24,500
company with hopefully more efficient

355
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:25,910
results - yeah and there's nothing wrong

356
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,320
with having a beer to relax it but if

357
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:31,219
it's if that's the only way you can

358
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:32,570
relax then you probably look like you've

359
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:36,170
crossed some kind of a line somewhere

360
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:37,790
along the way so right like I mean I

361
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:40,099
love having a very relaxed but I also

362
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:43,250
have 16 other things I can do to relax

363
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,900
that don't involve alcohol so yeah it's

364
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,180
it's good to have those things built up

365
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,470
but and I've built that up over time

366
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:50,660
intentionally that's not like an

367
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:53,530
accident it's definitely not something

368
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:56,300
that they teach you really in school and

369
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:58,130
you know and when you go out with

370
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:00,290
friends you have a beer you have a glass

371
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:04,550
of wine or right I mean I get that as

372
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:05,959
now as a mom I mean the amount of all

373
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:08,780
right moms were going out for a glass of

374
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:11,330
wine you know and and no I don't I don't

375
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:13,189
drink but I enjoy going out with them

376
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:16,640
and I have my sparkling water and it's

377
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:18,980
fine and I focus on the fact that well

378
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,300
one I I live in California so despite

379
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:26,089
when it's not on fire the weather's

380
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:27,949
quite and and it's just I try and be

381
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:29,630
mindfulness is actually for me it's not

382
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:35,000
meditation but mindfulness and awareness

383
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:36,320
of where I'm holding the tension you

384
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,839
know in just in my body you can just

385
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,089
body awareness or kind of symptoms I'll

386
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:43,280
scan through my head and go okay where

387
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:44,750
am I stress this this you know that's

388
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,430
you know almost a list of different

389
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,560
things that

390
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:52,000
I had and when I hit what's bothering me

391
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:53,199
I feel the tension and it's I also find

392
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,290
it interesting there's a big stigma

393
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:58,779
against mental health yet if you were to

394
00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:00,310
say oh I'm going to the gym and I have a

395
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:02,649
I'm getting a trainer and I'm going to

396
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:03,790
the gym it runs like hey that that's

397
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:06,010
great you're gonna have somebody who's

398
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:09,520
going to teach you how to do your

399
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:11,790
exercises correctly and and really

400
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:15,279
seeking therapy or or seeking mental

401
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:17,469
facility health resources it's the same

402
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,570
thing it's just for your mind right and

403
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:22,720
whether that is through religion or

404
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:24,760
through meditation or whatever I mean

405
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,550
here your mind needs as much exercise as

406
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:30,310
your body does and there can be that

407
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:32,709
balance too for self-care - mind body

408
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:36,250
and spirit can all be related to

409
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:37,899
self-care right yeah absolutely and what

410
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,709
you just said about you know we feel

411
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:42,760
feeling we can have this conversation

412
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:44,589
for hours now but um so there's gonna be

413
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:47,500
a fun conversation at the conference but

414
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:49,060
you know just a point on what you said

415
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,400
about as you're scanning your mind

416
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:53,260
looking for you know points of tension

417
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,150
things that you're stressed about like I

418
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:57,220
do something some very similar types of

419
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:59,470
things and that absolutely works and

420
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:03,160
what one thing I can tell you is when

421
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:05,890
you notice those things they tend to be

422
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,899
little triggers that get you to go right

423
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:09,550
now here's the cool thing like those

424
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,110
triggers are basically just chemical

425
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,639
reactions within your body like your

426
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:14,319
organs are just giving you a little

427
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,720
squirts of chemicals that makes you feel

428
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:19,178
a certain way it there's actually been

429
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,370
studies like any given feeling that

430
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:23,319
comes up if you just breathe through it

431
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:25,629
like it dissipates within a few minutes

432
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:29,139
like if you let it but it's only if you

433
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:31,059
fixate on it it'll reach or itself over

434
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:34,600
and over and over again so you can make

435
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:38,379
yourself that space or you can just kind

436
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,699
of even kind of try to release it once

437
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,710
you get practiced at that you can let

438
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,660
that stuff go really fast and you end up

439
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:46,179
not even if you're in a very stressful

440
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:50,190
situation you don't have to own that

441
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:50,190
stress and kind of hold on to it as much

442
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:57,960
in relation to the talk my my takeaways

443
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:59,559
that I hope people will walk away with

444
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,480
it's

445
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:03,158
my goal is not I think for not to get up

446
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,320
there and say okay just do this just do

447
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:06,789
that and do this because I know I've

448
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,529
been at the receiving end of that and

449
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:11,139
I'm like whatever whatever that's not

450
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:15,309
gonna work what I want people to walk

451
00:18:11,139 --> 00:18:18,070
away with is is realizing that self-care

452
00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:21,070
is a thing and it's a question to ask

453
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:23,620
yourself you know what am i doing when

454
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:25,389
am i stressed and how do I know because

455
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,219
everybody should have that scale of at

456
00:18:25,389 --> 00:18:29,049
least being able to know what am i

457
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:32,139
hitting the red zone what is my green

458
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:34,929
yellow and red zone look like and where

459
00:18:32,139 --> 00:18:40,090
am i falling on that and so to be able

460
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:44,139
to recognize that and then to be able to

461
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:47,139
understand how being able to take care

462
00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:49,779
of that and address that and come at a

463
00:18:47,139 --> 00:18:51,939
place where you're in the green or maybe

464
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:55,360
in the yellow zone how that really can

465
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:57,940
result in happier environment both at

466
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,428
home both in the workplace and both and

467
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:02,409
for the people around you so it's not

468
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:04,960
only two people who are in the security

469
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:08,649
industries for managers - and how they

470
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,999
manage people and again I tie it to the

471
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:11,830
security industry because it does

472
00:19:09,999 --> 00:19:15,039
fascinate me that it is an industry that

473
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:19,570
does focus a lot on or it bears the

474
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:21,549
weight of protecting and caring for an

475
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:24,100
organization and keeping it safe and

476
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:25,960
keeping it secure and so how can we take

477
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,689
the skills that these people are using

478
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:31,090
for their job and then almost turn that

479
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:33,279
around and treat them with the same care

480
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:34,649
and protection as they do their the job

481
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:37,869
in the company that they're protecting

482
00:19:34,649 --> 00:19:39,039
right that's great all right well I I

483
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:41,350
definitely look forward to seeing the

484
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:45,519
talk and again stace is going to be at

485
