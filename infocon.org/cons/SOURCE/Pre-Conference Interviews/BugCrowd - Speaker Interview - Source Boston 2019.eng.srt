[Music]

2
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:12,230
hi this is Rob Sheen from the source

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:15,049
conference and I'm here with Chloe miss

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:16,970
daaé Jason Haddix and JP Villanueva and

5
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:19,849
they're going to be doing a panel next

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:22,400
week at source source Boston on May 1st

7
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:24,739
to 3rd and there's a specifically on the

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,439
second and they're gonna be speaking on

9
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:30,259
bounty craft bounty craft the panel

10
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,299
she's an epic sounding title so you guys

11
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:34,670
all been very involved in in bug

12
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:36,260
bounties so that's obviously what the

13
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,300
panel is gonna be about what are your

14
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,870
one of you jump in and tell me a little

15
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:44,449
about what the panel is gonna be on

16
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:46,910
gonna be funny about the best tools the

17
00:00:44,449 --> 00:00:50,030
best resources but also the journeys of

18
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:52,459
the people on the panel so hikes and GP

19
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,589
and Vanya as well about their stories

20
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:57,440
and how they got to where they are what

21
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:59,239
was their background beforehand and how

22
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,149
did they get to bug bang how did they

23
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:04,009
find out about bug Valley and that's

24
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:06,800
pretty much what we'll be covering and

25
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:09,680
then also we'll touch base on other

26
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,210
different factors as well but I think

27
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:18,829
like the best parts always the Q&A

28
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:19,908
session at the very end so so it sounds

29
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:22,398
like so since you're talking about kind

30
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:24,259
of the journey of you know the bug

31
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:26,049
finders what what kind of at a high

32
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:28,189
level is the journey of a bug finder

33
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:30,710
like how does one get started in this

34
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:32,539
who wants to go super super crazy

35
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,669
because everyone is a little bit

36
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,409
different right there's been a lot of

37
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:38,840
polarizing discussions especially over

38
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:40,969
the last week about the journey of how

39
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,180
people get into information security

40
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:46,520
especially security testing and so every

41
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:48,950
everyone we do of these of the Dynacraft

42
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,229
panel we bring on a new researcher and

43
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,969
so we get a different perspective of you

44
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:54,619
know I think that you know we've had

45
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:56,149
students we've had people who come in

46
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:58,189
from sysadmin backgrounds we've had

47
00:01:56,149 --> 00:02:00,259
people who come in who just learned how

48
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:01,609
to test and you know didn't really have

49
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:05,929
much of a tech background who got into

50
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:07,880
it without really much beforehand we've

51
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:10,190
had people who have had you know less

52
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,570
than great decisions made earlier in

53
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:15,230
their career and then turns it around

54
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:17,720
and been able to make great careers so

55
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,380
the panel usually gives us a pretty

56
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,300
variable

57
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,740
background and diverse people to kind of

58
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,080
talk to you about how they got into it

59
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,600
so and then how they succeeded right so

60
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,340
the normal normal journey for for most

61
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,930
of us those at some point we go through

62
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,680
our career and realize that downy is a

63
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:36,420
way as a secondary income and and we

64
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,800
start with a platform usually the

65
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,140
platform bounties they're much more

66
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,970
approachable so bugcrowd is one of those

67
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,429
platforms and you'll register on

68
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,830
bugcrowd you'll have access and then you

69
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,540
have you have basically this path that

70
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,640
you walk of trying to prove that you're

71
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,140
skilled and get the platform metrics

72
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,350
built up on the bug on the bugcrowd

73
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,790
platform and then and then finding you

74
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,859
know your niche what you're good at like

75
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,290
crypto or you know like sequel injection

76
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,670
or you know other apps like type

77
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,470
vulnerabilities most of the most of the

78
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:07,019
bounties are apps like those focused but

79
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,160
you find your niche and you you go after

80
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,200
it and then you start getting more

81
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,690
invites and then you start making

82
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,790
significant contributions to the

83
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,230
platform and so talking about those

84
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,160
things and what's worked for you you

85
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,130
know some people are really good at

86
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:22,560
recon and finding sites that people

87
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,790
other people couldn't find some people

88
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,560
are really good at reverse engineering

89
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,410
some people are good at you know testing

90
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,760
for injection vulnerabilities and the

91
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,680
conversations we have in the panel are

92
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,170
just about you know like what have been

93
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,390
your successful tips and you know also

94
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:38,309
some of the non spoken things about

95
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:40,709
bounty is how hard it is and how

96
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,970
intimidating it is to get into it you

97
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,530
know like bounty hunters have

98
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,420
competition when you're a pen tester

99
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,010
you're not really competing against

100
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,390
anyone you're doing your best work but

101
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,820
you're not competing against someone

102
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:53,279
else and so you know a lot of times

103
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,769
people will leave give up or before they

104
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,900
even really get some success going and

105
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,550
so we talk a lot about you know how to

106
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,140
keep your drive going you know how to

107
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:07,380
stay efficient and things like that in

108
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:08,880
the panel also anything to that yeah and

109
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,769
I think it's important to really point

110
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,410
out kind of what what Jason was talking

111
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:15,570
about earlier is that we kind of the

112
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:17,430
people who get involved in bounties

113
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:20,159
there's different there's different

114
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,900
things that you know get them there for

115
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,250
example some people some people get

116
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:26,039
there because they have no other means

117
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:28,590
to make a living from security they live

118
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,410
in countries where you know being a pen

119
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,719
tester isn't necessarily a job right I

120
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:35,820
mean we forget that

121
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,530
you know we forget oh you know

122
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,330
privileged we are sometimes of you know

123
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,429
even having this kind of job where now

124
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:43,440
we can now we can you know be anywhere

125
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:45,449
in the world and do the same pretty much

126
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,830
the same exact thing some others you

127
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:49,740
know come from a traditional background

128
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:51,599
such as myself I had a you know sysadmin

129
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,130
background and a computer science

130
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,020
background and I naturally liked

131
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,909
security so I kind of led myself there

132
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:00,180
or some people we're just curious right

133
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,889
so it's really a mix of all different

134
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,630
types of people it's not

135
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:05,580
I wouldn't say just kind of one path

136
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:09,360
it's it's various paths but we all end

137
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:11,520
up in the same place so if somebody

138
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,840
wanted to get started it doing bug

139
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,780
bounties is a way to kind of get into

140
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,859
security what would just pile up

141
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,599
obviously you're having to give away the

142
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,830
whole talk but just you know at a high

143
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:22,050
level what would be some of the things

144
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:23,580
they could do to dive in because as you

145
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,660
said it's probably a little bit

146
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,620
intimidating for people thinking oh I

147
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,050
got to compete against all these

148
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:31,650
professionals you know how do I even

149
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:34,680
begin to start here there's there's more

150
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:37,349
resources than ever before which makes

151
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,090
me super happy honestly there's you know

152
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:42,810
when I started there was not a ton of

153
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:45,060
resources you know like even GPS were

154
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:46,710
relatively still a new thing for people

155
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:50,039
too as a stepping stone into learning

156
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,659
security testing and but now there's you

157
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:53,159
know there's a ton of broken web apps

158
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:54,570
there's a ton of training courses that

159
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:56,969
are free you can go to things like

160
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:58,770
library we have one called bugcrowd

161
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,120
university that we recommend all of our

162
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:02,070
researchers go through it's a whole

163
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,349
elearning course on how to do

164
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:07,050
application testing there are just

165
00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:09,690
hundreds of resources and then also

166
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,659
targets that you can hack to learn

167
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:13,860
application testing or you know even

168
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:15,840
reverse engineering and stuff like that

169
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,039
that are absolutely free you can set up

170
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,320
in your own lab and you don't have to

171
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:22,169
expose yourself to any risk by doing the

172
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,580
kind of stuff so so usually when a bug

173
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:25,500
hunter you know starts that journey we

174
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,940
recommend them first to try out bug bug

175
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,370
proud University we talk about like

176
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:31,440
first about what bounty is and like get

177
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,060
into it and then what common

178
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,800
vulnerabilities people are finding and

179
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,050
we'll talk a little bit about that in

180
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,669
the talk and like what are the top ten

181
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,310
vulnerabilities people find on websites

182
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:43,529
based upon our platform data which is

183
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:46,170
you know probably more applications than

184
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:48,630
any pen test firm has ever seen honestly

185
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:50,580
so so we talked a little bit about that

186
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:52,680
and how to get exposed to those and what

187
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,020
the best free resources are to try them

188
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,940
out like things like pentester lab and

189
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,430
on all these training courses are just

190
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,480
excellent resources to get started so we

191
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:03,270
have those built out in bugcrowd

192
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,400
university we we curate the topic and

193
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,349
then we guide them to where they can

194
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,299
actually test it in real life and set up

195
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,590
a lab and then that's that's kind of

196
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,890
their journey to get started and that

197
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:16,109
that gives you some confidence but there

198
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:17,969
is a small leap of faith I would say

199
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:21,330
there the leap of faith is oh hey I've

200
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:23,040
done it in a lab environment but do I

201
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:25,710
think I can do it against a real

202
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,570
enterprise level site and that that is

203
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,099
less about competition and more just

204
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,540
about like believing in yourself and

205
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,190
thinking that you can you have some

206
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,410
skill testing and identifying these

207
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:36,000
things and so we try to focus on that a

208
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,100
little bit too about how to get that

209
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,360
confidence to move into your actually

210
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:50,310
professionally working I guess uh JP any

211
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:52,860
further thoughts on that yeah I was just

212
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:56,520
gonna say yeah it's it's it's the belief

213
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:58,320
of faith is is true of anybody in the

214
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,020
industry even for myself I was you know

215
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,330
a former pen tester and you know I

216
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:05,520
wasn't bad at it but then I started

217
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:08,039
doing bounty I was a lot harder than I

218
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,049
initially thought because you know if

219
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,070
there's so many people going at this and

220
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,680
you know I have these applications

221
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:15,450
seemingly would be picked dry but you

222
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,090
know people still managed to find a lot

223
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:20,130
of things right so that leap of faith is

224
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:21,750
is is pretty important and you just

225
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:23,370
gotta it's it's it's like everything

226
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,960
else you gotta you got to stick to it

227
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,970
and you got it you got to believe in in

228
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,890
in the journey and believe in what you

229
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:37,560
can do and then you'll eventually hit

230
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:39,659
right facing the other good resource is

231
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:42,270
a web hacking when I want by peterovsky

232
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:44,550
it's a very good book if you're just

233
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:46,829
you're already trying to learn yeah we

234
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:49,380
usually say for for web hackers there's

235
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:50,880
several resources there's a start out

236
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:54,740
with write though one is what we call

237
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,970
the web hackers Bible which is which is

238
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,540
written by a fat stuttered it's a web

239
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,190
application hacker's handbook

240
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:03,730
and it's been the resource for quite a

241
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:06,580
while and then there's also a wasp who

242
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:08,710
does they do their a wash testing guide

243
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,600
every year for web applications so

244
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:12,700
you're looking for print resources those

245
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,620
are probably the two best print

246
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:17,170
resources and then peeps book is a new

247
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:19,300
edition from last couple years where he

248
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:21,790
approaches the same type of training a

249
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,400
knapsack but does it by case study so

250
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:26,500
you can see in a real life site you can

251
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,910
read his narrative about where the

252
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,350
vulnerability actually was which

253
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,300
actually I think is an interesting

254
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,860
tangent we take sometimes in the panel

255
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:36,219
it depends on how technical the panel is

256
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:39,160
but there's a difference between being

257
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:41,080
able to do like a CTF or a lab and

258
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,089
knowing that the vulnerability is in a

259
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,410
certain place and then going on to an

260
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,820
enterprise site and knowing that the

261
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,050
vulnerability is probably there too but

262
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,460
you have to find it right it's like an

263
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,469
Easter egg hunt right like where would

264
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:54,160
that vulnerability manifest itself in

265
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:57,040
this site and so when I when I focus on

266
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,050
talking about like talking about

267
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,400
abstract testing wherever I am sometimes

268
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:03,640
the panel sometimes in training or

269
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,920
whatever I tend to now focus on that

270
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,930
because it seems to be for people the

271
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,729
hardest thing to identify as like yeah I

272
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:11,680
understand the technical vulnerability I

273
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:14,410
could exploit it if I had a verbatim

274
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,810
place that you told me where it was but

275
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:20,110
you know apps are so complex nowadays

276
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:22,479
there's so much dynamic input to any

277
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:23,860
application even the source site right

278
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,960
like if you look at the source of the

279
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,610
source you know security conference and

280
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,890
training site right it's probably hosted

281
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:31,930
on some type of CMS and like infinitely

282
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:34,720
complex lots of functions lots of

283
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:36,939
dynamic parameters into knowing where to

284
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:46,150
your attack is almost just as important

285
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:48,240
that's how to attack oh yeah yeah it's

286
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:52,120
interesting hearing about the journey

287
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,970
because in a leap of faith especially as

288
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:58,210
I can tell you just having embarked on a

289
00:10:54,970 --> 00:11:00,280
number of you know journeys in my life

290
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:01,870
entrepreneurship and you know just

291
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,189
things like that like there's always

292
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,330
this leap of faith that has to occur

293
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:06,940
where you're just like all right I'm

294
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,560
doing this and you just you just go for

295
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,820
it so it's kind of cool to hear that

296
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,349
with the Bounty's it's kind of similar

297
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,660
you just jump right in and

298
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:16,520
no just trust that you'll be able to

299
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:21,050
figure it out and you don't get there so

300
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:22,790
that's cool so in recent years I have

301
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:24,319
not really done any penetration testing

302
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:26,240
so I'm kind of curious I know I

303
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,970
mentioned I noticed you mentioned in the

304
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,040
abstract that if that the web attack

305
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:33,170
landscape is changed so I'm curious to

306
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,780
get some thoughts on how things have

307
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:39,170
changed over time you know in recent

308
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:42,290
years compared to say 15 years ago 20

309
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:48,349
years ago 10 years ago we could defend

310
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:52,130
ours we can I don't wanna waste it off

311
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:53,660
of the panel but I think um I think

312
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:56,660
there's there's few things that come to

313
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:58,370
my mind one is one is the the old

314
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:00,650
nomenclature of like having like an

315
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:02,240
external do or having a DMZ and an

316
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,410
external site and then connected to an

317
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,760
internal network that's gone it's all

318
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:07,280
replaced by cloud everybody's

319
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,590
everybody's in the cloud and everybody

320
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:12,230
is rapidly with dead SpecOps rapidly

321
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:14,990
bringing up and spinning down all kinds

322
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:17,690
of different infrastructure weather for

323
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:20,150
their core service or for development

324
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:21,980
and testing or C ICD you know

325
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,209
tools or whatever right there's a lot of

326
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,310
stuff that is just going up and going

327
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:27,050
down in the cloud so you see a lot of

328
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,969
bounty hunters focusing on finding

329
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:31,010
obscure targets that are not the main

330
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:32,740
website which is one way that you can go

331
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:35,569
about this the other way is to focus

332
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:37,730
hardcore on the main asset we would call

333
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:39,410
it the main core asset I man instead of

334
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:41,720
finding exhilarate argit's that are

335
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:43,969
related to get in in this type of

336
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,520
testing and in that that world I would

337
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:50,660
say that we're just as an industry

338
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:52,430
struggling with dealing with input when

339
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,020
it relates to like libraries and parsers

340
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:56,150
and stuff like that anytime you parse a

341
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:59,960
link anytime you parse a PDF document

342
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:01,790
anytime you parse an image if you look

343
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,610
at the history of big vulnerabilities in

344
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:07,250
the last year we've had major libraries

345
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:10,100
that 90% of the industry used like image

346
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:11,740
magic to resize images have RCE

347
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,840
vulnerabilities remote code execution

348
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:16,610
vulnerabilities found against them and

349
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,980
so these are you know if you look at a

350
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:22,100
subsection of our what we call p ones on

351
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,930
the platform there's a lot of attacks

352
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,590
against things that parse urls are

353
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:28,469
things that parse images and able to

354
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:30,330
do things like you know remotely control

355
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:32,580
the Linux machine under by appending a

356
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:35,310
command in an image binary like that's

357
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:38,130
crazy sauce it's crazy like to explain

358
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:39,300
over a 20-second blur but these are the

359
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,560
kind of things people are finding or

360
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,660
when you pass a link to a website

361
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,459
somewhere you know whether you're

362
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,959
putting it in your bio on a website or

363
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:48,210
you're passing a link to know somehow

364
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,260
that website might call out to that link

365
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:51,630
and there are a number of attacks

366
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:54,420
associated to passing a link to a Linux

367
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:56,130
server that it's going to parsing so so

368
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,949
just any place that takes input that's

369
00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:00,960
non non tax based is been just an issue

370
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:02,700
over like the last year especially in

371
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:05,250
common libraries at least it's been my

372
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:07,080
observation yeah and then kind of

373
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:09,180
historically kind of building on that is

374
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,070
like I knew 10 years ago like I would

375
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:13,380
just put in you know the same magic

376
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:15,750
string and I would pop XSS every time

377
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,950
nowadays you know you have to really you

378
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,390
have to really work at it there's like

379
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:20,220
so many other you know controlling

380
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:22,710
factors there's you know libraries that

381
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:24,870
protect against XSS now there's laughs

382
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:26,880
that that hopefully protect against you

383
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:29,040
know XSS so there's so many more layers

384
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,300
now that you have to get through verses

385
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,630
10 years ago when you get just like

386
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:35,670
pointing spray at any like have a list

387
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:37,740
of parameters and just just spray at in

388
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:39,300
and you'll get something like I used to

389
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,800
I remember I used to get sequel

390
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,290
injection pretty much every single day

391
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,209
and nowadays sequel injection is pretty

392
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:47,640
rare I mean when it does happen it's

393
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:50,070
pretty major but then you know kind of

394
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,080
looking for it is you know unless it's

395
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:53,520
kind of some kind of legacy site like

396
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,720
the newer sites that are built on the

397
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,520
newer libraries and stuff like that

398
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,040
protect against it so the attack

399
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:01,770
landscape has gotten a lot more complex

400
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,319
and thus kind of the the attacks that

401
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:06,060
I'm seeing now like what Jason was

402
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,730
talking about is like newer types of

403
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,989
attacks subdomain takeover x XE e Isis

404
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:13,320
RF things are the things of that nature

405
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:15,930
are now more prevalent now that things

406
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,540
like cross-site scripting you know

407
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:21,030
cross-site request forgery URL

408
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,760
redirection are no longer kind of the

409
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:25,470
big bigger threats right yeah platforms

410
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,600
engineer themselves out of those bugs

411
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:29,430
pretty quick the other one that we never

412
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,320
see a decline of and this is just based

413
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:33,750
on platform data that I just pulled up

414
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,550
right now is is access control bugs or

415
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,170
indirect objects references people call

416
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:39,240
them right there is no library that

417
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:41,910
fixes that that basically gives you

418
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,350
standardized access matrix right for all

419
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:45,839
your user types and stuff like that so

420
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:48,000
if user a can access the admin dashboard

421
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,589
cuz they're not their admin and user B

422
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,510
is not in that bin but can still access

423
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:54,959
that admin dashboard if they go to the

424
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:56,970
URL and that's a you know a tragic flaw

425
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,489
and there's no library really to fix

426
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:01,709
that available in most languages their

427
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:04,020
libraries that try but don't do like a

428
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:06,989
super great job and so mapping out

429
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:08,550
access controls really is is a tough

430
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:09,990
problem in a lot of people I don't think

431
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:13,109
I've ever seen a bounty here at bugcrowd

432
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:15,300
that has not had an access control base

433
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:17,190
bug on it ever I don't I don't think I

434
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,589
remember one so yeah that's always a

435
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:21,180
constant also often of the

436
00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:24,899
authentication authorization is

437
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:26,520
notoriously hard to do right so you know

438
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:28,980
that's another thing that just hasn't

439
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,630
really changed meanwhile all of the

440
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:33,600
other bug classes like cross-site

441
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:36,029
scripting the sequel injection and like

442
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:43,440
cross-site request forgery kind of at

443
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:46,320
the at the backseat now right yes it's

444
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,490
definitely interesting to hear that you

445
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,740
know some of those things as they're

446
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:50,910
declining it sounds like though a lot of

447
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,520
the things that you're seeing that are

448
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:55,140
core are definitely things that we did

449
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,699
use to see like access control has been

450
00:16:55,140 --> 00:17:01,290
an issue as long as I've been in

451
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:02,579
security and input and output has been

452
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:04,230
an issue as long as I've been in

453
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:06,209
security it just seems to morph and

454
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,860
change shape as far as what exactly

455
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:09,990
you're talking about but it's

456
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:15,780
fundamentally in my mind security has

457
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:19,559
always been an input and output all

458
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:21,869
right any final thoughts guys want to

459
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:24,410
throw out there before I yeah make sure

460
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:27,030
you counts the panel yeah make sure you

461
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,319
yeah it's a really cool panel I would

462
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:30,570
highly suggest it anyone who just wants

463
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,159
to get their head in in about like what

464
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:34,889
bounties are in the journey of the

465
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,809
testers and obviously we do a QA at the

466
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:39,900
end if we have some time so it's it's

467
00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:41,428
really nice and the other thing too is

468
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:46,280
that we've seen this talk morph into

469
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:49,020
like a really technical talk for a

470
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:51,600
non-technical inspirational talk to like

471
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,740
get people like into the idea of

472
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,539
bounties

473
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,130
we really kind of try to take it

474
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:57,960
wherever the audience wants it to go

475
00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:00,149
whatever their questions are and stuff

476
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,669
like that so if the cool panel to be on

477
00:18:00,149 --> 00:18:03,959
I look forward to joining and and thanks

478
00:18:02,669 --> 00:18:04,799
for giving us the opportunity Rob I

479
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,830
really appreciate it

480
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:09,330
there were yeah the the conference

481
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,620
itself tends to attract kind of an

482
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,960
interesting mix of people between

483
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:15,090
business and securities so often even

484
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,169
when I'd run sessions at source I don't

485
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,889
know exactly where it's going to go we

486
00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:19,320
just kind of danced with the

487
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:20,340
conversation and play with it so it

488
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,750
sounds like this is going to be one of

489
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,158
those so that's going to be awesome and

490
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,169
we're gonna have a good time so you guys

491
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:27,990
are scheduled for the morning of May 2nd

492
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:29,580
and anybody that wants to come and learn

493
