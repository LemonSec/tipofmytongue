1
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,620
hi this is rob machine with a source

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,809
conference and I'm here with Masha

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:13,790
Sedova who is the co-founder of elevate

4
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:15,500
and she's gonna be speaking at source

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,330
Boston on May 9th and 10th and she's

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,789
actually keynoting and her talk is

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,680
titled using behavioral science to

8
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:23,000
secure your organization which is a

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,550
little bit of a mouthful but it sounds

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,769
like a good topic and Masha tell us a

11
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,449
little bit about your talk so first of

12
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:31,848
all I'm really excited to participate in

13
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:34,579
this conference I've spoken at a couple

14
00:00:31,849 --> 00:00:36,140
of source conferences and I've had a

15
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:37,820
chance to participate in a few more and

16
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,380
they've all been such a great experience

17
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,020
and I'm really excited and looking

18
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,900
forward to this one as also once they

19
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,790
thanks so much for having me participate

20
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,050
the topic that I'm speaking about is one

21
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:51,710
that's very near and dear to my heart

22
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:53,360
and what it's a look at is a different

23
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,790
perspective a different framework at

24
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,990
addressing security awareness as we've

25
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:00,890
traditionally been calling it in

26
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:02,870
organizations and as any security

27
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,459
practitioner might know we haven't done

28
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,250
a great job at securing the human

29
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:08,658
element so what I'm talking about is

30
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,299
considering a new framework a new

31
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:15,619
approach using behavioral science that

32
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:17,090
can consider a different way for us to

33
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:19,630
secure our organizations and

34
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:22,159
specifically the human element of them

35
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:24,710
so in your description you kind of

36
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,630
mentioned that the way we've

37
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,949
traditionally done security awareness

38
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,810
and I'm familiar with myself because I

39
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:32,030
used to do security awareness programs

40
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,289
myself is you know we base it on the

41
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,240
assumption employees just don't know

42
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:37,039
what to do and then we just need to like

43
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:40,490
tell them what to do and then they'll be

44
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:42,139
good but clearly that's not worked or at

45
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,339
least not worked as well as we'd like it

46
00:01:42,139 --> 00:01:45,829
works with some people but it clearly

47
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,270
doesn't work with everybody so why is do

48
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:48,259
you think that's a bad assumption I know

49
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:51,530
that you do think that's a bad

50
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:53,600
assumption yeah so I mean the data shows

51
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:55,039
us that it's a bad assumption there's

52
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,380
some really other interesting use cases

53
00:01:55,039 --> 00:02:01,639
around exactly this thing like many

54
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:05,449
people know that security training tells

55
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:07,490
you to not install passwords sorry not

56
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:09,740
install not Gries passwords across

57
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:11,090
different sites and yet people do it all

58
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,760
the time people know how to secure

59
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,870
password and people know how to did they

60
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,019
shouldn't reuse it and yet they still

61
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:19,010
don't do it the gap here is ultimately

62
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:21,349
the fact that it

63
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:24,109
a hard thing to do to remember 40 unique

64
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:27,260
secure passwords so this way we need to

65
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:29,360
use the function of technology to make

66
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,399
it easier to do another example for

67
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,720
example is smoking a lot of people off

68
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,310
smoking is bad for them and might kill

69
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,069
them and yet they still do it right so

70
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:39,530
knowing and awareness isn't enough it's

71
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:43,458
an important step but it isn't the full

72
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:46,430
journey okay so I know you kind of lead

73
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:49,640
from there into the topic of motivation

74
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:51,680
so if really it's about motivating

75
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:55,268
people to do the right thing how do you

76
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,470
motivate people to do security yeah so

77
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:59,989
there's two parts to it's not just

78
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:03,530
motivation so habit change actually has

79
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:05,450
two functions to it it is increasing

80
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:07,430
motivation for people and making it

81
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,500
easier to do and interestingly enough

82
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:11,690
those two elements have an inverse

83
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,780
relationship to each other that's a

84
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:17,450
harder something is to do the higher the

85
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,680
motivation you need to do it easier

86
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,290
something is to do the lower the

87
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,569
motivation is so when we talk about okay

88
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:25,250
you need to increase motivation that is

89
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:28,849
only in the use case where you can't

90
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:30,590
make something easier to do so that set

91
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:32,750
aside if you want to take a look at

92
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:34,910
motivation there's a couple of ways you

93
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:37,310
can absolutely do this there is

94
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:39,260
leveraging organizational motivation so

95
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:41,870
things events that happen in

96
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:45,590
organizations and then as they unfold so

97
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:49,220
things like pen tests or recovering from

98
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:52,250
a breach or upcoming audits can all be

99
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:55,099
leveraged to drive motivation to do

100
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,510
large organizational overhauls but if

101
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:59,268
you take it a look at an individual

102
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:03,649
level on a personal level individuals

103
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:04,879
can be motivated to do security if you

104
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,250
can tie it to things that they already

105
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:11,599
care about so things like competition

106
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:14,389
for altruism status or recognition or a

107
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:19,209
sense of accomplishment so things like a

108
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:22,400
thank you email a badge a leaderboard

109
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:24,710
are all elements and ways where you can

110
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,900
leverage intrinsic motivation that we as

111
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:31,909
human already have and tie it to a

112
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:32,810
security outcome that's interesting on

113
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:34,250
the change

114
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,380
behaviors it's actually motivation plus

115
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:39,050
making it easier you know on that topic

116
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,669
and the password topic I've been

117
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:43,040
fascinated by passwords for a very long

118
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:46,159
time you know I worked on that whole

119
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,960
problem set before and I actually no

120
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,790
longer understand why anybody remembers

121
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,859
more than one or two passwords at all

122
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,870
because we have password managers now

123
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,510
and they're actually pretty good and I

124
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:58,310
now have one really long password that I

125
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:00,740
remember that unlocks all my other ones

126
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:02,600
and when people complain about oh it's

127
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,590
hard to after you know reset them it's

128
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,360
like no it isn't you go and your

129
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,650
password managers say give me a password

130
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,750
I don't even know my passwords are

131
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:12,590
anymore it's like nothing so easy it's

132
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:15,410
like in 2018 I I must have 50 or 60 or

133
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:17,330
70 passwords easily I have to count them

134
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,160
but it's it's at least in that range I

135
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,330
you know for all the different systems I

136
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,900
have access to I don't know how anybody

137
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:26,510
could manage that any more so and to

138
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,940
that point before password managers the

139
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:31,669
only people had this past those password

140
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:33,860
practices were people who were super

141
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:35,810
dedicated and motivated for other

142
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,220
security professionals were people who

143
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:39,020
had been hacked before and said I'm

144
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,729
never gonna do that again right so

145
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,650
that's so that you had high motivation

146
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:44,120
because it was really hard to do but now

147
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,590
you don't need to be that motivated

148
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,150
because you're just like install a tool

149
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,880
and run with it you have the same

150
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:51,560
outcome and now it's super easy so there

151
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,270
is a this really beautiful balance

152
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,710
between those two and we need to think

153
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:57,140
and think about sort of what is the

154
00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:00,229
behavioral outcome we want from our

155
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:01,909
employees and looking at that from an

156
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:03,469
outcome based perspective and saying

157
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,539
well how do we get there why are people

158
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:07,039
not doing it now do they not care do

159
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:08,960
they not have the ability to do it do

160
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:12,139
they not know are they not being given

161
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,549
feedback about their progress so being

162
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:16,010
able to apply more than just an

163
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,750
awareness like in training because

164
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:21,229
people might know they just might not do

165
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:23,360
it for many many other reasons right I

166
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:24,349
mean some type I can tell from recently

167
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,570
when I've done presentations and

168
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:28,460
trainings yeah you know and the password

169
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,360
problem specifically people bring it up

170
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,500
I'm like why aren't using a password

171
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,510
manager and sometimes they don't know

172
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,400
sometimes it's because I'll well at our

173
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:36,320
company we have a particular policy

174
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,409
about software and yada yada yada

175
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,729
so sometimes it's that the management's

176
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:43,789
not giving them the right tools to do

177
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:44,870
their job properly but it's there's a

178
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:45,890
fair number of people that still don't

179
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,400
know there are a lot of people that

180
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,080
never got on

181
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,909
security bus with us back in the early

182
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,859
night or the late 90s and early 2000s

183
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,990
and we're still gonna catch them up as

184
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,120
well so there's some elements of raising

185
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,860
that awareness and teaching people the

186
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,000
right things but I think you're right

187
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,520
that I think there's definitely that

188
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,840
balancing act between making it easy

189
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,609
enough so that you don't have to have

190
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,400
them be super motivated because the

191
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:09,250
average person is just not right there

192
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,810
they just they're like my job is

193
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:13,550
business analyst or my job is you know

194
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,889
sales or whatever they don't you know

195
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,180
care about security really except that

196
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:19,100
it's this annoying thing that people

197
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,139
make them do you know yeah but that's

198
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,900
actually not an unrealistic expectation

199
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:25,669
you know right we we can't ask the rest

200
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,810
of our organizations to be security

201
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:29,570
experts otherwise they would be on the

202
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:31,400
security team they don't ask us to be

203
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,560
sales or marketing or development

204
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,659
experts so it's unfair for us to ask

205
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,289
them to do their job in addition to

206
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:41,000
being a security expert right and then a

207
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:42,169
security expertise on top of it so we

208
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,820
need to figure out what is the bare

209
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:46,520
minimum that they do need to care about

210
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,320
and and give them those tools to do it

211
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,479
and and we really need to be thinking

212
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,039
about positive incentives and

213
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,219
recognition when people do to the

214
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:56,330
correct thing instead of just punishing

215
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,070
it when they do the wrong thing

216
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,940
recognizing that they are going above

217
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:03,560
and beyond their scope of job duties

218
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:05,870
when they do reach they report

219
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,550
suspicious activity thank you here's a

220
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:10,030
leaderboard you save the organization

221
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:11,810
there's many ways that we need to be

222
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:14,210
communicated with our employees that

223
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,590
have a positive spin on that and and as

224
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:19,489
an industry we aren't doing a good job

225
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:21,469
at it yet awesome so how do we know that

226
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,419
we're succeeding or not like what metric

227
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:25,789
should we be looking at and how do we

228
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:27,080
measure you know over time are we

229
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:30,139
getting any better at this or worse

230
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:32,360
orgeous not running on a treadmill yeah

231
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:34,669
so it depends on what you defined that

232
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,709
this is and that's totally different for

233
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:37,400
every organization when I go in and

234
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,900
start working with different

235
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,449
organizations I asked them if you had a

236
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:43,728
magic wand and you waived it what would

237
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:46,580
people do differently tomorrow than they

238
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:48,680
do today and and you can't answer they

239
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:51,650
would be smarter that's not that's not

240
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,180
measurable or they would be less dumb or

241
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:56,150
they would make less security mistakes

242
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:57,410
none of those are measurable behavioral

243
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,990
outcomes

244
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:01,160
well even not even say I won't

245
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,140
more people to take a training that's

246
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:06,770
not different right that's that's a

247
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:09,170
metric that doesn't actually show impact

248
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:12,050
in the direction you want to go what I

249
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:14,449
want people to have clarity on is when I

250
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:17,089
have this amazing outstanding program I

251
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:19,700
want my fishing to reduce to below 5%

252
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:22,610
click rate for every test regardless of

253
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:24,680
test I want every difficult fishing test

254
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:27,470
to have at least a 20% reporting rate

255
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:30,620
I want badge surfing to be reduced to no

256
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:34,180
more than three incidents a week and you

257
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:36,980
can start seeing that you have

258
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:38,449
measurable outcomes that you're trying

259
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,430
to drive towards and you can see whether

260
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:41,959
or not you've succeeded and you need to

261
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:43,430
break down what it means for your

262
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:46,040
organization to have a security mindset

263
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:48,199
which is absolutely an umbrella goal but

264
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:51,020
they're measurable know the observable

265
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:53,209
behaviors that fall into and that are

266
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:55,339
its work required by the security team

267
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:57,050
to figure out what does success look

268
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:58,670
like and you can absolutely measure it

269
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:01,819
as a function of what a user does on

270
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:06,740
their their laptops or on the network or

271
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:10,160
with their badges and tailgating but it

272
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:14,690
really depends on what you care about

273
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:18,170
for your organization right cool so a

274
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:19,670
lot of people I hear say you know why

275
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:22,399
bother with end-user training at all

276
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:24,770
because it only takes one person to

277
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,930
screw it up and you know I have my own

278
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:28,880
opinions on that I'm curious to hear you

279
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:31,010
know what your take is on that you know

280
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,930
should we even bother with that user

281
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:34,910
training you know what what are the real

282
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:37,729
goals behind it in order to justify

283
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:39,829
doing it mm-hmm so if you have a

284
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:41,870
technology control that fails once

285
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:43,729
should we even bother installing it in

286
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:46,430
the first place that spam filter if you

287
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:47,930
let one in oh that's whatever right no

288
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,310
we don't we don't we don't apply that

289
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:51,349
same logic to our technology and our

290
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,770
processes if it fails once we just give

291
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,680
it up

292
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:57,410
we don't so organizations that have

293
00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:00,290
security minded employees are fighting

294
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:02,569
with a whole toolset that organizations

295
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:04,849
without that are not and I'm not saying

296
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:06,800
that any one solution is perfect not not

297
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,459
your technology not your processes and

298
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,099
not your people

299
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:12,529
but if you choose to not invest in your

300
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,790
people you aren't fighting with a third

301
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:16,550
of your tools

302
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:19,640
against the ongoing landscape of

303
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:22,370
developing attacks and so organizations

304
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:24,020
that have security minded employees has

305
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:26,660
the benefit of being harder to hack

306
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:29,870
you're statistically going to be

307
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,280
trickier to get an employee to click on

308
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:33,170
a fishing link I'm not saying that's not

309
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,060
possible but it absolutely is going to

310
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:37,310
be harder and so if you look at the

311
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:40,310
economics of an attack I'm gonna go

312
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:42,739
after an easier target if if my my

313
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:46,189
custom malware has a less chance of

314
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:49,220
being identified and reported to a

315
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:52,010
security team at Company B that doesn't

316
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:54,350
invest in awareness versus company a

317
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:56,689
that has a whole set of paranoid

318
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:58,970
employees in the second point that I

319
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:01,310
want to point out here is if you invest

320
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:04,520
in reporting as your behavior it only

321
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:07,160
takes one employee to forward your

322
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:09,350
custom develop malware that you've just

323
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,750
spent months developing as an attacker

324
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:14,510
to the incident response team who can

325
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:16,700
then profile it quarantine it and now

326
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:19,670
your your stock right that's that's a

327
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,150
lot of R&D time that is now gone out the

328
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:24,620
window

329
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:26,900
so what you you're essentially doing is

330
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:29,000
you're levelling the odds you get one

331
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:32,060
person to report and it's just as

332
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,440
painful as one for the attacker as one

333
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,270
person in your organization clicking

334
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,830
that's a really interesting mindset

335
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:39,350
shift around that I like that

336
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:41,420
perspective a lot because I'd being able

337
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:44,810
to train the idea systems is pretty

338
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:46,339
useful and having your entire company BQ

339
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:48,410
no part of the sleuthing team for that

340
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:50,240
is actually a pretty good way to look at

341
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:51,680
it so that's actually probably one of

342
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,650
the best justifications I've heard so

343
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,000
far for doing it that's awesome so you

344
00:12:54,650 --> 00:13:01,610
actually have a pretty deep background

345
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,930
in awareness and awareness programs why

346
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,250
don't you tell us a little bit about

347
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:06,770
that so people know what your background

348
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,510
is yeah so I started a much more of a

349
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:10,040
traditional security background it's

350
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:13,910
what I ended up sitting in college I did

351
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:16,790
computer forensics along the way though

352
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:18,110
I became fascinated with the question of

353
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:20,439
what would it look like for people to

354
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:23,840
want to do security instead of have to

355
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:26,090
and I had the opportunity of starting a

356
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,440
team at Salesforce initially it started

357
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,810
with insider threat work

358
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,269
and I was like well I'll just

359
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:35,029
investigate people all right and that

360
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:36,560
doesn't work when your company has a has

361
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:38,839
a value of Ohana

362
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,300
which means family right and and it was

363
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:44,779
like in the concept of an insider threat

364
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,420
program was antithesis to the core

365
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:48,740
cultures and values of the organization

366
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,180
so I really need to figure out a

367
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:53,149
different approach and I said what if

368
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:54,500
people cared about so security so much

369
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:56,540
in their organization that they would go

370
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,360
out of their way to report things that

371
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,829
were abnormal which is where I started

372
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,420
becoming obsessed with this question and

373
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:04,819
I looked at all the tools that I had

374
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:07,550
available to me and it was compliance

375
00:14:04,819 --> 00:14:10,610
based animated powerpoints that were

376
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:12,349
people like they would check a quiz box

377
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,879
at the end I said well that's not going

378
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:16,040
to get me to the outcome I want where

379
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:18,620
people would can go above and beyond its

380
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,149
detect like insider threats like that's

381
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,220
not going to match the thing that I need

382
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:25,550
so I started doing tons of research

383
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:27,259
around other industries that have

384
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,758
totally figured out how to deal with

385
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:30,230
human beings and how to get them to

386
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:32,949
change their behaviors and get buy-in

387
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:36,170
and this has led me to the field of

388
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:40,130
behavioral science positive psychology

389
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:42,860
game theory and game design and those

390
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:44,540
three and there's several key books that

391
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,860
were very influential in my work and I

392
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,500
started partnering with a couple of

393
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:52,100
really awesome behavioral scientists to

394
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:54,079
create frameworks for these programs so

395
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,230
I started applying this and in rolling

396
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,699
out these programs at scale to the

397
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:01,009
25,000 employees at Salesforce at the

398
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:03,800
time plus some of our customers plus

399
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:06,019
developers and so I had this incredible

400
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,160
testbed to try out some of these

401
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:08,839
frameworks and I've learned a lot of

402
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:12,920
things that worked a couple of things

403
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:14,990
that don't and I've leveraged a lot of

404
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,779
my knowledge into what is now elevated

405
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:20,089
security my own company awesome that's a

406
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:21,980
great story so definitely looking

407
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:25,129
