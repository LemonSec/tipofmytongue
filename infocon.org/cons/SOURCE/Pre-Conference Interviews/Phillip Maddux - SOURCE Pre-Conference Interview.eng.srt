[Music]

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,620
hi this is Rob Sheen from the source

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,629
conference and I'm here with Phillip

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,060
Maddox who's a trusted app SEC advisor

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,400
and senior solutions engineer for signal

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,040
sciences and he's gonna be speaking at

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,830
source Boston coming up in may 9th and

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,110
10th and his talk is on honey pots

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,668
deception in Frankenstein which sounds

10
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,140
like an awesome title so we haven't

11
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:32,099
actually had a honey pot talk in a while

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,140
at stores so I'm actually looking

13
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:36,720
forward to yours he tell us a little bit

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:41,850
about your talk yeah absolutely so um

15
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:44,160
the talk originated from a few projects

16
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,750
that have been really a hobby of mine

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,449
over the last several years there's an

18
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:51,480
open source project and a website that

19
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:54,360
basically aggregates honeypot data so

20
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,089
that's where this talk stems from but it

21
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,310
starts out where I you know like to

22
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,320
explain the 101 of honey pots right

23
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:03,690
because not everybody and the audience

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,790
may understand the concepts and the

25
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,908
different types of honey pots and things

26
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:12,090
like that so I like to explain that and

27
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:14,970
then the part on deception this is an

28
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:18,780
area that I've been diving deeper in

29
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:21,539
into in the last year or so

30
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,409
you know deception is a new sector in

31
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,310
cybersecurity

32
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:28,500
in the industry and so trying to find

33
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,880
out what what that's all about so I've

34
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,760
had a lot of conversations with

35
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,429
colleagues across the industry just

36
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:39,000
talking about it how they think about it

37
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:41,549
what are they planning with it and so

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,310
it's been really interesting you know

39
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:47,100
hearing their feedback on that also the

40
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,510
challenges they see with that and so

41
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,830
it's really that part of the talk is

42
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:54,600
really me just sharing what I've learned

43
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:58,740
and hopefully just to get the dialogue

44
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:01,490
going in the community on deception and

45
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,229
then the last piece which is

46
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:07,020
Frankenstein this has to do with one of

47
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:11,519
the projects that I put together that

48
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,840
website I mentioned and so it's it's

49
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:16,319
been an interesting it's kind of the

50
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,520
story of this project and how I you know

51
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,899
how I started it out and trying to get

52
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,190
funding to support or figure out the

53
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,150
funding for supporting the

54
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,959
infrastructure for

55
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:31,260
and how I've led to leveraging multiple

56
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:33,930
cloud services to be able to support and

57
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,519
operate this project at scale and so

58
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,069
that's kind of this I call it my

59
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,810
Frankenstein architecture so I dive into

60
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:43,409
that in that story and talk about that

61
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:46,340
and then also share how that that

62
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:48,810
website getting that project can be used

63
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,870
to get started running honey pots

64
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,549
because I'd like to encourage people to

65
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,409
start running running honey pots and you

66
00:02:53,549 --> 00:03:00,629
know at least dabble in it and then give

67
00:02:55,409 --> 00:03:02,040
it a whirl well alright so you mentioned

68
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:03,629
the cyber detection space and a

69
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,940
deception space and how that's kind of

70
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:08,099
an upcoming thing what do you see as

71
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,440
some of the benefits of having some kind

72
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:13,280
of deception as part of your

73
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,599
cybersecurity program yeah totally so

74
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,269
that's definitely a non-traditional idea

75
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,760
right right absolutely and I do talk a

76
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:22,950
little bit about you know again what

77
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,649
I've learned in conversations of how

78
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:29,518
that's kind of evolved but um I mean the

79
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:32,250
benefits are really you know identifying

80
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,720
being able to trip up and identify an

81
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,099
actor that's already you know that's

82
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,720
compromised your network and is trying

83
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:39,569
to traverse across across your network

84
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,329
right so that that's that that's the

85
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:43,470
core core benefit of it but it is you

86
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:46,079
know an additional complementing

87
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:48,900
complementary control to you to your

88
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:51,510
defense and depth strategy on defending

89
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,340
your network so so that's really where

90
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:56,328
the benefit is and I think it's you know

91
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:59,760
it's it's upping your game and also

92
00:03:56,329 --> 00:04:03,000
increasing risk to the the attacker

93
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:06,358
right you're making your network more

94
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,340
risky more dangerous for them and so

95
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:10,260
with the end goal is you know you're

96
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,260
you're not going to be able to stop all

97
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:15,090
compromises but if if they you know

98
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,298
realize hey you know even if they

99
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,320
discover that you are running honey pots

100
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:21,659
they're gonna they're gonna probably

101
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,889
look leave and look for a softer target

102
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,639
right like they might get your

103
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:28,380
competitor instead of focusing on you

104
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:30,990
because they don't want to burn you know

105
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:33,419
their presence or their you know kits or

106
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,130
whatever it may be okay

107
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:36,889
that's interesting so are there any

108
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,389
particular challenges

109
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:41,419
with implementing deception as part of

110
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:43,699
your cyber program yeah and I cover this

111
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:46,219
in the talk and and there's a few of

112
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:49,099
them oh it's kind of like the top one

113
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:52,279
I'm just kind of high level so I think

114
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:55,340
the main challenge has been really its

115
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:57,469
its organizational maturity right so a

116
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:00,409
lot of organizations are are thinking

117
00:04:57,469 --> 00:05:01,759
about this and they're starting to think

118
00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:03,289
about it because they've kind of gotten

119
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,840
a handle on the basics right like

120
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:08,509
they've got patch management down gulnur

121
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,650
ability assessment down and so and so

122
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:12,289
now they're starting to think about this

123
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:14,688
but it's they don't really understand

124
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:16,400
what a deception program looks like

125
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,840
right like what are the goals what's

126
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,568
what's the strategy what are the things

127
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,119
you need to look out for and things like

128
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:26,569
that so I think that's that's the high

129
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,069
level challenge today and and some

130
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:31,099
organizations are starting to address

131
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:32,719
that and figure it out hmm but you know

132
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:34,759
it's gonna I think it's there's more you

133
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:36,379
know time ahead of us before we start

134
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:43,099
seeing you know deception programs

135
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:45,830
rolled out consistently got it so you

136
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:48,349
mentioned you know getting funding to be

137
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:51,469
able to scale it up do you find it's

138
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:52,580
difficult or expensive to do this yeah

139
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:55,099
this is something that other people can

140
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,810
kind of do on a shoestring yeah so I

141
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:59,659
certainly like you know running your own

142
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:03,379
honeypot at home or something like that

143
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:06,379
or even on one node in the cloud you can

144
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:09,649
do really really cheaply with my project

145
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:13,430
what I'm trying to do is aggregate data

146
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:14,930
from you know multiples numerous sensors

147
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:18,399
that are out on the internet so

148
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:23,149
collecting all that data and storing it

149
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:25,189
and making it accessible the the in

150
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:27,169
doing this in the cloud the the the most

151
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:28,969
significant cost is going to be storage

152
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:31,188
right that just ends up in a cloud you

153
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:32,330
know computes relatively cheap but it

154
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:33,919
really comes down to when you have to

155
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:36,050
store data that's that's where the

156
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,628
charges kind of build up pretty quick

157
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:41,629
right and so so that that's been

158
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:44,360
interesting I I've you know currently

159
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:47,319
and you know funding it kind of you know

160
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,759
it's a hobby out of pocket but as more

161
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:50,660
sensors get rolled out because with this

162
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,930
project anybody can

163
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,370
a lot of sensor and contribute data

164
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:57,860
that's going to be more storage that I

165
00:06:55,370 --> 00:07:00,280
have to handle so you know and I go

166
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:02,420
through that in the talk and how am I

167
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:06,289
you know attempts and trying to address

168
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:07,370
that and then also you know some some

169
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:12,860
things that have happened to help with

170
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:14,480
that so cool so you know it sounds like

171
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,410
it's because it's open source it sounds

172
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,270
like you actually want people to

173
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:19,010
contribute to the project you know in

174
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,930
tribute sensors and whatnot but what

175
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:22,280
kinds of organizations do you think

176
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,110
would be good to either implement a

177
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:28,669
honeypot or maybe to contribute to the

178
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:32,780
project yeah so I think first I think

179
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:35,380
about just individuals in in the in the

180
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:37,580
security community right like just

181
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:39,469
experimenting with it you know learning

182
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,180
from it seeing what data you know and

183
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:44,150
kind of analyzing that as the data comes

184
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:47,630
in and and just benefiting from the

185
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:51,370
experience of actually doing it I think

186
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:54,830
there as far as you know organization so

187
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:56,720
you know it would be organizations that

188
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:59,900
are interested in identifying potential

189
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,910
threats that might be you know hitting

190
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,200
their internet-facing properties if you

191
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:05,330
put a sensor on the internet you're

192
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:09,680
gonna get a ton of noise or it may not

193
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:11,960
be interesting to to you know a lot of

194
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,660
organizations or some organizations but

195
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,400
there may be some use cases for it so

196
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,050
but yeah they would benefit from also

197
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,450
just the data that gets collected right

198
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:22,460
from as you kind of think about your

199
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:24,130
threat information program and how

200
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,349
you're feeding that data into your other

201
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:28,000
defenses like your IDs or firewalls or

202
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:33,349
what have you

203
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,000
cool awesome well it sounds really cool

204
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:35,840
so you mentioned the one last thing I

205
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,940
wanna ask you about you mentioned the

206
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,700
honey DB project is that the name of the

207
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,940
project itself yeah so honey DB is the

208
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,910
website the name of the website

209
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:51,320
aggregates all the data from sensors and

210
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:53,180
also there's an API that you can get

211
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,880
access to to download some of the data

212
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:57,140
and then also you know provide some

213
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,140
high-level graphs and things like that

214
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:02,210
so you can browse the data as well got

215
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,470
it all right cool well I really look

216
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,610
forward to seeing this talk it sounds

217
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,620
really interesting and I

218
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,430
I'd love to see any kind of latest and

219
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,410
greatest of what people are playing

220
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:12,079
around with honey nutz that's I tried

221
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:14,269
and shrewd way to mess with attackers

222
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:15,949
it's been played with over the years and

223
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:18,500
used for some pretty interesting things

224
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:20,420
so so definitely looking forward to see

225
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,910
