[Music]

2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,940
hi this is Rob Sheen with a source

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,560
conference and I'm here with Megan Roddy

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:17,410
who is a senior security analyst at

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,420
recon InfoSec and she's gonna be

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,420
speaking at source Austin coming up

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:24,730
pretty quick on December 5th and 6th and

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,680
her talk is on strengthen your secure

9
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,840
SEC ops team by leveraging

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,130
neurodiversity now Megan's actually done

11
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,750
this talk at source a couple times

12
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,390
already and she took on the extra

13
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:37,720
challenge for this time of doing it in

14
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:39,760
our 18 minute snap talk format so thanks

15
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,199
for taking the extra challenge there

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,550
that's gonna be cool to see it in the

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,649
condensed mainstage version yeah I'm

18
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,328
looking forward to it a lot of times I

19
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:52,149
actually have the bad habit my tops

20
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:54,010
running short and so I'm hoping it won't

21
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:56,649
be too difficult to fit in that time and

22
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,480
I actually appreciate the shorter talks

23
00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:01,179
a lot of people by the end of an

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,428
hour-long talk or are living at their

25
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:05,440
watch is looking to get out so that 18

26
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:08,560
minutes is a good time to get get the

27
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:11,830
seeds planted in people's heads without

28
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,330
them losing by the end exactly I mean

29
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:16,119
there's a reason why TED talks are

30
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:18,189
18-minute formats as well so that format

31
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:20,170
definitely works so it's a the shorter

32
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:22,240
formats actually can be challenging

33
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,890
because you got to you know get

34
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,310
everything you need to say in there and

35
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:28,869
make sure it's done by the timeframe so

36
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,909
but uh but it's fun I'm looking forward

37
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:32,259
to seeing it in that format for those

38
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:33,250
that haven't seen your talk yet can you

39
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:37,320
tell us a little about what your talks

40
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:42,000
about yeah um so my talk is kind of a

41
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:46,179
personal experience meet they meet some

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,700
kind of scientific analysis of employing

43
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:51,189
individuals with autism specifically in

44
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:53,020
the InfoSec industry both with my

45
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:55,419
personal experience with Asperger's and

46
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,310
working in the industry and find out

47
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,990
what challenges I face and what

48
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:02,619
solutions work for me

49
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:04,539
along with I actually spend a lot of

50
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:08,740
time and learned a lot of things like

51
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:11,350
even about myself by researching other

52
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:13,600
other documents put out an order

53
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:17,680
Ripple's put out by either other people

54
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:19,660
with autism or psychologists that kind

55
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,200
of reinforce what I'm saying so I'm not

56
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:24,030
coming in as a single

57
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,010
piñon I try to make sure that I have

58
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,470
that supporting evidence I think I

59
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,429
called what in my presentation to to

60
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:34,800
show it works and so it's all about the

61
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:37,050
pros and cons and then the benefits and

62
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:41,040
challenges associated with employing

63
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:42,930
security individuals with autism right

64
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,400
yeah I saw I saw your talk at one of the

65
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,569
previous incarnations of it and it

66
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,130
definitely was well researched

67
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:49,470
I appreciate the structure of it and

68
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:52,260
everything I also found it interesting

69
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,519
I've never been personally diagnosed

70
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,459
with any kind of Asperger's or autism

71
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,900
myself but I definitely recognized some

72
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,120
of the symptoms and behaviors that you

73
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,560
were describing as like huh that it was

74
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,769
so it was pretty eye-opening for me to

75
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,000
see the talk so I that's why I kind of I

76
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:08,340
want to put it on the main stage so more

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,200
people can experience that yeah and I

78
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,910
find a lot of times when I present it

79
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:16,500
like it becomes it helps move away from

80
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:18,989
stigmas not just because I'm like

81
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,670
showing that it's easy but also because

82
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:22,650
people begin to identify and they're

83
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:25,018
like well that makes sense like I can

84
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:27,359
see why that's the case like it's not

85
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,850
just trying it's making people realize

86
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:32,269
that it's sometimes just tuned up

87
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:35,220
versions of problems that everyone has

88
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:38,190
so that's that's what I like about it is

89
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,989
usually it's not I'm fighting to

90
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,810
convince people is people finally

91
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:46,680
realizing oh wait that's kind of normal

92
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:48,150
in a sense right right yeah it's funny

93
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,829
when we talk about normal versus

94
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,930
abnormal it's like what is that really I

95
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:54,630
mean people are just people and there's

96
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:57,329
just a different range of human behavior

97
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:58,769
along you know not to use the word

98
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:01,200
spectrum but you know what I mean like

99
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:02,340
like everybody you know even if they're

100
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,569
quote unquote normal they're all they're

101
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,060
all going to have their own stuff that

102
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:08,880
they deal with so it's just everyone's

103
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,349
got their own things yeah so you've

104
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,840
actually given this talk now not only

105
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:14,010
its source a few times but but at a wide

106
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,190
variety of Converse you've given at Def

107
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:19,380
Con twice for different b-sides and some

108
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,209
other things what have you learned and

109
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,190
over the time of doing the talk at so

110
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:25,940
many different locations as that as the

111
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,940
talk has evolved

112
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,740
I'm very judgmental of myself so I like

113
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:38,889
I usually hit the videos so I find it

114
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:41,169
to watch myself speak I definitely have

115
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:43,720
gotten a lot of feedback from other

116
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:45,698
autistic individuals and that kind of

117
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,870
gives me additional points of view so

118
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:51,849
that's helped to expand it having people

119
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:54,370
say like oh I can't identify with that

120
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:58,870
you should also mention this and then

121
00:04:54,370 --> 00:05:01,330
also be my favorite part that about

122
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,430
giving the talk over time and being able

123
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:06,039
to improve it is the questions I get

124
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:08,560
from the audience that is a lot of what

125
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:10,449
shapes how the next talk goes because if

126
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,639
I'm getting the same question 50 times

127
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:13,630
like clearly it's is something that

128
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,580
people want to know

129
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:17,889
so probably the biggest thing that

130
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:25,120
affects my future talks is the

131
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:28,509
audience's questions and feedback so a

132
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,759
lot of InfoSec people are been said you

133
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:32,139
know have varying degrees of

134
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:35,650
high-functioning autism or Asperger's

135
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:38,229
and I've you know definitely had run

136
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:41,590
into more than a few in my experience

137
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:42,849
over the years what would some advice

138
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,500
you would give to some folks that are

139
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:48,550
struggling with that that haven't kind

140
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:53,729
of figured out how to you know manage it

141
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:55,539
as well uh communication with your

142
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:59,680
managers and coworkers

143
00:05:55,539 --> 00:06:01,599
is a key thing a lot of times it's seen

144
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,180
as like a personal issue this is a

145
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:06,940
condition affecting me and so it's

146
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:10,270
something I have to deal with but it's

147
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:13,509
all about the communication with your

148
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:14,979
managers and your co-workers is an

149
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:17,050
important thing don't keep it to

150
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:19,719
yourself work on it with them because in

151
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:22,330
the long run that communication with

152
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:24,069
them will improve your work experience

153
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:26,289
that there's something you need change

154
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:29,710
and then you'll be a more effective and

155
00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:32,979
productive employee so recognizing that

156
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:36,099
often the solution will involve me to

157
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:38,139
involve communication with your work

158
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:40,210
colleagues as opposed to say as a

159
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:43,810
personal problem that only you can solve

160
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:47,349
all right great

161
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:49,000
so I think I remember from your one of

162
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:51,070
your talks

163
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,350
you know talking about not just how it's

164
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:55,210
affects you at the workplace but also

165
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:57,970
when you're applying for jobs and

166
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,979
interviewing there any specific

167
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,150
strategies that people could or issues

168
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,500
that people have when it when they're

169
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:07,989
interviewing they might be able to deal

170
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:12,220
with my ideal answer is the one that

171
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:13,930
isn't I not that I understand why but

172
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,610
the industry is not good do because

173
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:17,830
people don't want to change or at least

174
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:20,500
not for the time being really I think

175
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:25,210
it's the interviewers and the interview

176
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:28,750
process is what needs to change so it's

177
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:31,000
it's for us it's more accepting that

178
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:33,010
interview processes are the way they are

179
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,250
and they're not designed for us and

180
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:37,750
doing our best kind of mentally

181
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:43,919
preparing for what you're going to

182
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:46,570
experience going into interviews and I

183
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:50,770
think it's difficult to find a solution

184
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:53,080
on our end I think the solution will

185
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:55,930
come in on the interviewers end when

186
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,640
things are changed so what are some key

187
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:01,810
things there that they struggle with in

188
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:03,729
those situations uh so a lot of

189
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,450
individuals with autism the fact that

190
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:08,469
they go into

191
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:11,349
so interviews themselves are a social

192
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:13,990
process it's a social interaction with

193
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:18,460
an interviewer or an interview board

194
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:20,169
it's a bombardment of questions ranging

195
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:24,190
from things like what are your

196
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:27,700
weaknesses like subjective questions

197
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:31,840
like that then just a quiz of barrage

198
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:34,569
it's trivia questions and especially

199
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,400
when you're the kind of the part of the

200
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:39,820
thing that's wrong with the interview

201
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:43,809
process is individuals who are applying

202
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:46,960
for jobs where their intent is to work

203
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:48,430
in a environment where most their work

204
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,220
is done behind the computer screen

205
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:54,160
working on a computer as opposed to

206
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:56,080
heavy school interaction like that

207
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,620
you're not a customer service agent or

208
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,360
sales agent like the importance for the

209
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,740
job is the technical skills not the

210
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,160
social skills but you're me

211
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:08,680
put in an environment where your social

212
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,300
skills are gonna have a huge factor and

213
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,250
whether you get the job or not

214
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,649
just because naturally your behavior in

215
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:17,550
the room and those interactions are

216
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:21,010
gonna affect what people are thinking

217
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:23,829
right so what would you recommend if you

218
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:25,450
could kind of wave a magic wand and have

219
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,640
the interviewers change their process in

220
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:30,820
some fashion what's one thing you would

221
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:35,860
have them do dramatically differently so

222
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:39,490
a technical hands-on interview just give

223
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:41,529
them the work they would do if they got

224
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,240
the job because that's how I really got

225
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:46,480
proved to you they can do the job is

226
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:49,680
essentially by doing the job I've had

227
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,550
people who have moved towards that and I

228
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,160
knew someone who had the experience

229
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:55,899
where they hired a person they answered

230
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,790
all the trivia questions on the

231
00:09:55,899 --> 00:10:00,190
interview great then the second they

232
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:01,750
were put behind the keyboard it's like

233
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:03,910
it was a different person they had no

234
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:06,580
idea what they were doing and so they've

235
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:09,130
moved towards technical interviews where

236
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:11,290
and then this is like a network security

237
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:15,270
network architecture side of things so

238
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:18,370
it's like okay here's a test lab

239
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:22,529
firewall go configure it to allow this

240
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:25,870
to traffic or here's a whiteboard

241
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:29,140
diagram out what is considered a secure

242
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:31,300
deployment slip type thing so rather

243
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:36,160
than trivia questions which won't help

244
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:38,260
you any day in a hands-on or get them to

245
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,870
do the job watch from a distance like

246
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:42,189
don't though yeah a barrage of questions

247
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:44,410
is not what they're getting experience

248
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:46,360
in their jobs so barrage of trivia

249
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:50,110
questions is not going to prove their

250
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:52,930
capabilities in a role right that's

251
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:55,630
that's why I do this yeah technical

252
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:59,290
interviews as opposed to interview

253
00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:01,360
questions yeah that's an interesting way

254
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:02,709
of looking at it I could see that being

255
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,110
a little challenging in some cases

256
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:06,880
because you know not everybody that

257
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:08,860
comes in to interview necessarily knows

258
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,290
every last detail about what the job

259
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,370
that they're gonna be doing is yet they

260
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:14,410
might be really good at learning new

261
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,699
things but they might have some you know

262
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,569
getting up to speed time they have to do

263
00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:18,579
before they could

264
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,780
do that so I could see that maybe being

265
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,820
a little challenging is you have to

266
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,930
design it really well to accommodate for

267
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,210
that as well

268
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:26,650
that I think that's probably one of the

269
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,450
reasons why you get the trivia questions

270
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:30,910
is because that's easy and you know

271
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:36,550
recruiters are busy and they do what's

272
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:38,459
easy for sure and there's definitely not

273
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:41,140
probably not a perfect solution but

274
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:44,020
right now the interview process is

275
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:47,710
geared towards people who can spew out

276
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:49,900
trivia answers the and a lot of type

277
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:52,170
that does not reflect you know I mean I

278
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:55,959
went to university for seven years and

279
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:59,560
everything I've learned has been through

280
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:01,840
hands-on work with stuff I my ability to

281
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,209
memorize answers in school and turn in

282
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:07,930
assignments did nothing for me in the

283
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:09,850
long run if I can answer questions but

284
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,920
the first time I was put behind the

285
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:14,050
keyboard to do cybersecurity work I

286
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,229
didn't know what I was doing so right

287
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:19,329
yeah I just think there needs to be a

288
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:21,970
better method maybe it's a combination

289
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:23,980
interview technically in question base

290
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:26,860
but making sure that you're not

291
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:31,320
designing an interview that requires a

292
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:33,490
certain personality or mindset run I

293
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,260
could see maybe having it be something

294
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:37,500
like a lab that they walk through where

295
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:40,300
there's you know the answers are

296
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,070
findable in the lab and you can

297
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,479
basically observe how well they work

298
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:45,130
through it if someone blows through it

299
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,870
in ten minutes you know and somebody

300
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:48,130
else takes two hours that's going to

301
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:52,780
show a different level of technical

302
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:54,670
capability there's yeah like the core

303
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:56,620
skills like cyber security analysts

304
00:12:54,670 --> 00:13:00,219
maybe you're not testing their knowledge

305
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:02,560
of specific devices or controls but

306
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:05,590
you're testing their analytical skills

307
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,930
give them a set of laws get them to find

308
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:10,630
something that doesn't doesn't align

309
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:13,510
with everything else because those core

310
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:15,790
logic skills and investigation skills

311
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:18,790
are the types of things you should be

312
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:20,349
looking for yeah I've always when I

313
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:22,510
interview people I'm always you know

314
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,550
trying to find the people that can think

315
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:26,920
and logic their way through problems

316
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,060
like that's to me that's how you really

317
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,729
solve things and that's in the real

318
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,079
world how we you know

319
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:33,480
half the things I had to solve in my

320
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:35,519
life I wasn't trained on I just had to

321
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,810
figure it out and you know so I look for

322
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,630
people that have similar kinds of

323
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:41,609
capabilities and abilities to do an

324
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:44,579
interview board if there's a hard

325
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:48,449
question I'm way more likely to go with

326
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:50,310
you if you speak to your way we see you

327
00:13:48,449 --> 00:13:52,979
thinking you're saying okay will this

328
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:54,989
and this and this and you get there and

329
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:57,420
you don't get the right answer but I

330
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:59,490
could tell you had a thought process to

331
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:02,130

347
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,930

pretty much right there so all right

349
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:40,229
cool

350
00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:42,389
so what's um what's one thing you'd like

351
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:50,300
people to know that don't have autism to

352
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:53,970
know about autism like that it's not

353
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:56,130
something that needs to be so like I'm

354
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:58,230
also pulling from a lot of what I've

355
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:01,350
seen on Twitter that I agree with so

356
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:05,610
like it's not a disease that needs to be

357
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:08,370
cured it's a disability that can be

358
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:10,440
managed and that there are benefits

359
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:12,389
associated with just because it's called

360
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,569
the disability doesn't mean there are

361
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:17,370
positive side effects yeah I mean I

362
00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:20,189
actually don't even like that it's

363
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:21,930
called a disability because you know

364
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:24,240
some people I've known that are on

365
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:26,459
various levels of the spectrum they all

366
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,569
have their own superpowers so like you

367
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,768
know what are so what are some of the

368
00:15:27,569 --> 00:15:31,380
things that people should know that like

369
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:34,100
tend to be advantages I tended like

370
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:38,100
focus on the advantages or disadvantages

371
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:40,860
yeah and I I've been to some local

372
