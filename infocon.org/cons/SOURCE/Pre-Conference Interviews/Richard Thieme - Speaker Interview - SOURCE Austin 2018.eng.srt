00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,580
hi this is Rob Shane from the source

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,980
conference and I'm here with Richard

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:17,198
theme from theme works and he's gonna be

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:19,630
discussing strategies for playing

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,250
through the pain the impact impact of

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:24,220
dark knowledge on security professionals

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,929
in the road to resilience and Richard

9
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,310
actually did an earlier version of this

10
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:30,400
talk and one of the first times he did

11
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:33,220
the talk at source Boston back in 2016

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,960
and he's gonna be giving the latest

13
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:38,440
version of the talk at source Austin on

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,309
December 5th and 6th coming up soon so

15
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,680
Richard why don't you tell us a little

16
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:43,209
bit about you're talkin how its evolved

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,660
what you started giving it the talk

18
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:50,770
keeps evolving the basis for it was

19
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:52,358
listening closely for 25 years which is

20
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:55,059
as long as I've been doing this speaking

21
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:58,109
and writing for 25 years to colleagues

22
00:00:55,059 --> 00:01:02,678
and friends who have grown over the time

23
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:05,110
over that time I into quite an assembly

24
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:07,810
of extraordinary people and I've

25
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,759
listened to their stories not just about

26
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,920
the technical work which is where I sit

27
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:14,259
like a child at their feet try to pay

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,849
attention but to the impact the work has

29
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:18,880
had on them and different situations

30
00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:21,310
they find themselves in which have had a

31
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:25,479
lasting and sometimes negative dramatic

32
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:28,030
impact which compels a response when I

33
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:32,470
first did the talk the one we did for

34
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:34,209
source 2 years ago I wrote to colleagues

35
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:36,759
and said have you got any stories you

36
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:39,929
want to share and over 50 people from

37
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:44,229
CIA and NSA in corporate and military

38
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:47,920
venues responded with detailed and often

39
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:50,709
poignant very emotionally narratives of

40
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,700
what they had experienced and so many

41
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:56,830
people continued to respond to that talk

42
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,300
when I when I did to DEFCON somebody

43
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:01,450
asked her if I could hear people crying

44
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:03,878
in the audience now imagine I've spoken

45
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,979
to Def Con this year this 23rd year and

46
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:07,929
you don't usually look out at a room of

47
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:10,209
thousand people with standing room or on

48
00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:12,370
the edges and hear people sniffling

49
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:15,040
crying and in one case one guy said did

50
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:17,290
you hear me sobbing and back because it

51
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,849
struck such a chord because instead of a

52
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:23,440
technical talk aimed at the mr. robot

53
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:26,140
persona with so many hackers

54
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,760
security walks carry in their heads this

55
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:30,459
was aimed directly at the heart so it

56
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,880
kind of hacked the psyche to go past

57
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:35,970
that and talk to the human being and how

58
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:40,299
they were influenced so as this

59
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:42,220
continued a lot of people asked for

60
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:45,160
we need strategies for this and that was

61
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:47,050
my talk this year will be the talk for

62
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,420
source this year much more detailed on

63
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:51,640
what are the things we can do based on

64
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:54,970
what people have learned out of their

65
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:57,640
experience and once again about 20 more

66
00:02:54,970 --> 00:03:01,950
people responded with narratives to that

67
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:06,119
so this is quite a large collection of

68
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:08,260
real-life Frank upfront authentic

69
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,860
stories people have shared with me that

70
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:15,190
I integrate in into a singular narrative

71
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:18,610
of this is what can happen this is what

72
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:20,200
we can do about it and just just

73
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:25,330
recently Rob

74
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:28,750
ari Shapiro on NPR did a story on the

75
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:31,300
cleaners who are now charged in the

76
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,700
aftermath of all the hullabaloo about

77
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:37,390
social media with cleaning up accounts

78
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:40,720
at Facebook in Google and so on and some

79
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:44,019
of them once said he has seen so many

80
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,880
beheadings that when he sees one done

81
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:48,760
with a very sharp edge he thinks it's

82
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:51,940
kind of a blessing instead of some of

83
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,130
the worst they have seen so much awful

84
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,200
stuff but the result is that one set is

85
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,780
I can't go into public spaces anymore

86
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:02,320
because I've watched so much video of

87
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:04,060
terror acts you know that like seeing a

88
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,380
movie over and over again or watching

89
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:09,310
the news over and over again

90
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:11,340
it impacts all of us the mind of society

91
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:14,200
has been terrorized by the media

92
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:17,079
amplification of events which actually

93
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:20,070
might be quite rare but which because if

94
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:23,740
it bleeds it leads they drive home

95
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:27,400
starting with 9/11 when I said the media

96
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:30,040
was complicit 100% in terrorism because

97
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,380
it could have reported the acts without

98
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:35,100
showing them again and again and again

99
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:37,180
until the entire public was traumatized

100
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,860
it's hard not to believe the

101
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:42,460
some people behind the scenes really

102
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:43,780
relish that fact because the billions of

103
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,180
dollars that have grown into the

104
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:49,448
security industry in that regard since

105
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:52,710
then have shown that fear and and

106
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:55,090
terrorizing a population can pay off so

107
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:57,489
it's not just people who do this work

108
00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:00,039
professionally it's all of us but but

109
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:02,680
because of where security professionals

110
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:04,840
often find themselves it can hit home

111
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:08,020
particularly hard and particularly easy

112
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:11,770
and the question is are you discussing

113
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:14,799
it inside our organizations making

114
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:17,710
available a platform to talk seriously

115
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,509
about this because all that's required

116
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:22,030
in our humanity is that we acknowledge

117
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:24,009
what's real for us and then take the

118
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,469
measures or steps that are appropriate

119
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:29,650
to keeping ourselves as whole as we can

120
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:33,160
do now that we get rid of these scars to

121
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:34,900
be a scarred adult is to be an adult we

122
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:39,310
carry these wounds through life and

123
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:42,219
their marks of our often maturity but if

124
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:44,520
we don't attend to them and respond as I

125
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:47,169
say by traveling their own tours ilion's

126
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,539
they can have a very very negative

127
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:51,880
impact on other areas of our lives and

128
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:54,969
that's part of what I've listened to in

129
00:05:51,880 --> 00:06:00,099
the divorce is the alcoholism the

130
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:01,300
suicides one one colleague at CIA said

131
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:06,159
he carries in his head

132
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:07,840
23 suicides and when my friend at NSA

133
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:10,449
wrote that there were three suicides

134
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,219
that week and I saw a former deputy

135
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:14,110
director at a conference and asked him

136
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,389
about it he shook his head and he said

137
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:19,539
no there were six this week last week

138
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:21,970
and he looked at me knowing my

139
00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:24,250
background as the clergyman which I did

140
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:28,810
for 16 years and you said doing this

141
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:32,440
work I have lost my faith well it's to

142
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:36,610
that abyss that I'm trying to speak and

143
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:40,000
invite people not to join a tea group at

144
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:43,599
your conference but to look at seriously

145
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,409
and clearly what they do how it affects

146
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:46,750
them as people

147
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:50,529
and how that affects their relationships

148
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:54,959
and and their health and their lives and

149
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:57,129
I'd respond in a positive active way too

150
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:59,709
right yeah cuz what was interesting

151
00:06:57,129 --> 00:07:03,189
Armour from the original talk was that

152
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:05,829
you know just people doing regular

153
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:07,779
security work and and being exposed on a

154
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:10,809
regular basis to things they can't talk

155
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:12,819
about right or or like in your example

156
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:14,919
like you know people cleaning up things

157
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:17,049
and having to look at you know horrible

158
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:18,969
images but even just doing mundane

159
00:07:17,049 --> 00:07:20,318
things but that you can't talk about and

160
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:22,679
having to go home and keep that to

161
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,229
yourself like the idea that that

162
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:28,808
manifests in some of the similar ways is

163
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:30,519
PTSD was fascinating to me and something

164
00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:33,309
we should really be aware of that's

165
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:34,869
right and and crosses over I think I say

166
00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:37,059
that in the abstract the distinction

167
00:07:34,869 --> 00:07:40,029
between security work and intelligence

168
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:42,969
work is really hard to draw these days

169
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:46,119
because line is very very blurred in

170
00:07:42,969 --> 00:07:49,419
that you are working for a combination a

171
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:51,459
combine a complex of military and

172
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:53,409
government and corporate structures

173
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:55,389
which so intertwined that it's very

174
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:58,569
difficult to tell where one begins and

175
00:07:55,389 --> 00:08:01,539
the other ends and and habits of NDA's

176
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:04,929
that require secrecy often compel people

177
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:08,589
to take some of these hard truths and

178
00:08:04,929 --> 00:08:12,159
bury them and the results as they are in

179
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:13,449
the intelligence community the RC are

180
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:15,998
often that you don't know how to have a

181
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:19,119
normal a fennec relationship with

182
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:20,589
another human being and and yeah I have

183
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:22,769
plenty of stories about that what it

184
00:08:20,589 --> 00:08:26,469
does dear family

185
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:28,509
one friend mentioned that at NSA young

186
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:30,639
man finally got all his clearances and

187
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:32,889
he came to the agency for his first day

188
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,329
of work and that's when he discovered

189
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:37,419
for the first time that both of his

190
00:08:34,328 --> 00:08:39,698
parents worked there well family is

191
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:42,728
supposed to be a truth-telling kind of

192
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:45,849
trust trust organization right and you

193
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:47,740
find out in your 20s that your mother

194
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:51,309
and your father have been lying to you

195
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:55,389
your entire life block and proud of it

196
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:58,120
proud of it one guy told me when its

197
00:08:55,389 --> 00:09:01,660
daughter got clearances I think was

198
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,860
Naval Intelligence and she said it was

199
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,499
hard because she was in a conversation

200
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,539
about some geopolitical

201
00:09:04,499 --> 00:09:10,319
and she was gonna weigh in and she

202
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:12,629
realized she couldn't talk about it and

203
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:14,189
her mother who was there said well no or

204
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:16,319
you can talk to dad about it when you

205
00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:18,059
get home and she said no I can't he's

206
00:09:16,319 --> 00:09:20,878
not read into the program and he's not

207
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:23,429
cleared to know what I know and he said

208
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:25,889
he was so proud to hear her say that

209
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:28,919
well he's proud that his daughter is

210
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:31,139
keeping secrets the child I guess was

211
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:33,239
nonplussed but somewhat proud did his

212
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:35,039
parents had lied to him this whole life

213
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:37,499
long how do you have genuine

214
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:40,829
relationship based on forthrightness

215
00:09:37,499 --> 00:09:43,949
honesty integrity and trust when your

216
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:48,689
whole foundation is to deceive dissemble

217
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:51,779
cover and manipulate other people which

218
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:53,248
become so habitual that even a cocktail

219
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:56,099
parties someone starts a conversation

220
00:09:53,249 --> 00:09:59,249
you're immediately on guard you're

221
00:09:56,099 --> 00:10:01,199
worried sometimes you wonder are they

222
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:03,029
targeting me did they start a

223
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:05,848
conversation in order to elicit

224
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:08,429
information from me so a competitor can

225
00:10:05,849 --> 00:10:10,529
know what we're really up to I mean

226
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:13,559
every man and woman is a spy these days

227
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:16,679
for their corporation sometimes

228
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:20,579
wittingly sometimes not so so we've

229
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:22,559
created this world hammered literally

230
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:25,679
we're the nails and it's hammered by

231
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:28,618
secrecy and the consequences of secrecy

232
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:32,159
and deception and didn't used to be like

233
00:10:28,619 --> 00:10:34,649
that always there have been lies and

234
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:38,789
deception but we didn't have an entire

235
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:40,799
systemic commitment to not telling each

236
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:43,649
other the truth unless we give away

237
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:46,589
something of value and as I say the

238
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:49,439
consequences for us as human beings they

239
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:53,009
come home in our unfortunately in our

240
00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:55,319
relationships in our our habits and we

241
00:10:53,009 --> 00:11:00,449
often take the wrong way out to try to

242
00:10:55,319 --> 00:11:02,789
self-medicate we just need to tell the

243
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:05,039
truth to someone we can trust and that's

244
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:06,809
one of the themes that recurred when I

245
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,209
listen to people telling me again and

246
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:11,579
again what they did it started with

247
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:13,768
having one or two or three people they

248
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:16,079
could absolutely trust often people who

249
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:18,180
had clearances as well or they could

250
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,959
explore all of what they were

251
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:25,620
and without that the isolation made them

252
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:29,220
rigid intensified their fear and shut

253
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:31,320
them down even more so so we we need

254
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:36,390
colleagues we need friends we need

255
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:38,580
allies in truth and truth telling in

256
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:40,490
order to find our way into a community

257
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,839
that's really kind of countercultural

258
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:48,180
there's so much of what our corporations

259
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:51,089
demand from us right the self-medicating

260
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,260
thing is an is an ongoing theme Stacey

261
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:54,240
Theatre is actually going to be at the

262
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:59,100
conference in doing a talk on self-care

263
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:00,930
as well and you know so we were we

264
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,940
actually had the conversation out of

265
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:04,260
podcast last night

266
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,540
and we were talking about you know

267
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,189
having a drink to relax is fine as long

268
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,079
as that's not the only thing you have to

269
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:12,150
do to relax so like what do you say is

270
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,610
what do you see is somewhat like some

271
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:16,949
either maybe warning signs and people

272
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:18,720
should be kind of self aware of or maybe

273
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:20,880
things they can do to be more resilient

274
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,470
so that you know they can kind of deal

275
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,000
with these stresses that come up and

276
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,529
work sure good question

277
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,330
a warning signs are you know what are

278
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:29,720
what are you really hearing that you

279
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:33,390
don't shut out through denial or or

280
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:35,640
minimization or rationalizing it I just

281
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:37,580
found a diary my father wrote when he

282
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,650
went to Europe after World War two and

283
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:42,120
it included in the diary his statement

284
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:44,640
that the other people he traveled with

285
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,709
an important group of people allocating

286
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,810
scrap after the war to various allied

287
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:50,849
governments and he said people were

288
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:54,329
confronting him about how much he drank

289
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:56,310
and he laughed he said that was funny

290
00:12:54,330 --> 00:13:01,470
aces they just don't understand how we

291
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:03,900
drink in Chicago well no that's not true

292
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:05,700
dad I would have said that's how you

293
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:08,040
drink in Chicago but there are the

294
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:11,459
people who drink moderately and I won't

295
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:13,800
drink at all but he used that to

296
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:16,640
rationalize what obviously from the rest

297
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:19,890
of the pages of what I heard my family

298
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:22,050
was alcoholism so it's really hard

299
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:24,000
denial is a funny thing I mean a lot of

300
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:26,130
jokes about denials not just a river in

301
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,540
Europe and all that but when you're in

302
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:30,570
denial you don't know you're in denial

303
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,740
that's why we call it denial you don't

304
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:34,860
realize that

305
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,900
Saiki thinks it's protecting you in

306
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,600
order to protect your your ways out of

307
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:42,360
pain and you've chosen those and so it's

308
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,420
not letting it get through to you until

309
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,160
you have either in so much pain so much

310
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:50,189
disarray in your life that it overwhelms

311
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,709
your denial and you have what they call

312
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:55,080
an a a a moment of clarity in which

313
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:57,480
suddenly everything comes into focus and

314
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:00,960
you see clearly what you've done now the

315
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:03,600
truth is that's often a very bad moment

316
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:05,790
a very painful moment and that's why you

317
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,620
need other people to this way AAA is

318
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:12,180
based on mutuality community feedback

319
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:14,630
and support to bear the reality of who

320
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:17,969
we have let ourselves become sometimes

321
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:20,939
hard hard to face once we have that

322
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:23,130
moment of clarity though we find that

323
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:26,070
alcoholism in this case is what we're

324
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:28,650
talking about is a symptom called a

325
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:30,630
disease or whatever but it's a symptom

326
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:32,670
there requires you to look at all the

327
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:36,630
other ways you might do more healthy

328
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:39,420
things that enable you to cope with with

329
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:42,240
the challenges and painful aspects of

330
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,990
your life and you know they're often so

331
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,520
mundane

332
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:48,510
when I listen to the things people

333
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:51,710
advance Steve miles of bioethicists here

334
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:54,810
in Minneapolis where I live says

335
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:57,720
gardening he's become a master gardener

336
00:14:54,810 --> 00:15:01,709
I mean you take your obsessions into the

337
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:05,130
Cure as well as the illness and jazz

338
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:08,400
listening to jazz and he said he often

339
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:10,560
had a threat of a meltdown I like when

340
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:13,350
he came out of Thailand and it's been

341
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,380
days watching trucks loaded with bodies

342
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:19,440
stacked up past him hour after hour

343
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:21,360
taking out thousands of dead bodies he

344
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,010
said when you have a threat of a

345
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,380
meltdown like that the public grocery

346
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:27,510
stores he did first time that hit him he

347
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,370
said you learned you have to go to in

348
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,460
his case he went to a seaside village in

349
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:34,620
Italy it just been a few days

350
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:37,590
experiencing the normality of life in

351
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:40,950
the village going to the market lovely

352
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:43,740
this of people beauty of the day because

353
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:45,750
all these things still exist but you

354
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,640
need to consciously play

355
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:50,310
indignant and so I'll have a long list

356
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:53,189
of other things that people have said

357
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:55,589
that help ameliorate the difficulties

358
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:57,690
and there are things we all know but the

359
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:59,760
trick is not to know them in our heads

360
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:03,000
the trick is to implement them in our

361
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:05,150
lives and to get the support we need to

362
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,860
do that if we find this very difficult

363
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:10,319
we joked when we first start well my

364
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:14,130
workout isn't funny what it was once

365
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:16,230
well if you want it to be more

366
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:19,140
intentionality is to keep terram you and

367
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:21,450
I believe you want to be intentional

368
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:23,670
about that you you may need to build it

369
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:26,010
in a different way in your life and then

370
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:27,630
you may need to get support in building

371
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:30,330
it in a lot of people when they run I

372
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:32,400
have a running buddy and when they know

373
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:34,200
that 7 o'clock in the morning the door

374
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,380
goes get a ring and they better be ready

375
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:39,180
to go out and do 5 miles they have a

376
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:41,280
different attitude toward being ready to

377
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:43,859
do that then if they're relying on

378
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:47,130
themselves only they're in bed where

379
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:50,070
it's warm still 7 at the morning but

380
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,610
it's chilly out they just say oh the

381
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:54,780
hell with it

382
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:59,700
and then you roll over and forget it

383
00:16:54,780 --> 00:17:03,449
so building in truly supportive people

384
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:06,680
in your life and and building out those

385
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:08,850
who would try to undermine you I

386
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:11,250
remembered I mentioned the kind of

387
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:14,129
healthy eating I try to do people often

388
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:16,890
make disparaging and mocking hisses

389
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:19,380
about it is it being a beggar pondered

390
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:22,980
being 400 pounds and and having your

391
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:27,089
knees replaced way too soon is normal

392
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:29,430
and eating healthy food is not and and I

393
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:31,620
turned out to be defensive about it this

394
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:34,470
eat the veggies eat the fruits eat the

395
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:36,959
great mates don't eat too much of the

396
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:40,230
other stuff you know you know everybody

397
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,870
knows these things right but but it's

398
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:46,080
the doing of them that can become

399
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:48,350
difficult it's so easy and an America

400
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,889
you know America we live in American and

401
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:54,389
bombard us with 24/7 you know it's

402
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:57,270
impossible to walk through Applebee's

403
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:59,629
without vomiting quick it's just people

404
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:03,210
never water you know Megan

405
00:17:59,629 --> 00:18:05,129
with I don't know three four thousand

406
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:07,649
calories out of the people are eating

407
00:18:05,129 --> 00:18:08,879
that you know that when you're sitting

408
00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:10,768
on a plate and you see one of those

409
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:12,570
coming down the aisle you you get

410
00:18:10,769 --> 00:18:14,279
religion it's like a fox so you say

411
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:16,439
please Jesus let him sit in twenty eight

412
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:21,659
that have not stopped when he said not

413
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:24,659
the idle had take over half my seat it's

414
00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:27,360
not normal but there are lots of ways

415
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:31,259
you can make a decision and then act on

416
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,248
it because because you want to live you

417
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:34,649
want to live and you want to have a

418
00:18:32,249 --> 00:18:37,169
healthy of a body and a mind that

419
00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:39,209
supports your intention in life and

420
00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:41,519
simple truth of that is that most people

421
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:43,139
do it's just that when you look at their

422
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:48,600
bodies their intention may not be what

423
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:51,269
they think it is then your body comes

424
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:54,809
along got a story about that but I won't

425
00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:57,990
waste your time on a podcast the bottom

426
00:18:54,809 --> 00:19:00,360
line is I'll be talking frankly and

427
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:02,519
honestly and and with sincerity and out

428
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,820
of my own experience what it's done to

429
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:06,480
me

430
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:09,869
they're people about the alerts we

431
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,119
should pay attention to and the kinds of

432
00:19:09,869 --> 00:19:14,549
friends we need because the work has to

433
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:17,789
be done security is important

434
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:20,549
telogen work is important we want our

435
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:25,499
structure to continue more or less as it

436
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:26,879
is if we evaluate and so just doing

437
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:28,440
everything we can to enhance the

438
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:31,139
likelihood that's going to happen this

439
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:34,129
is incumbent upon all of us let's let's

440
00:19:31,139 --> 00:19:34,129
