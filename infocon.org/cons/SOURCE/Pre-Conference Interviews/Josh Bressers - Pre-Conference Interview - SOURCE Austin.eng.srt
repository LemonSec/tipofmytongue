00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,440
hi this is Rob Sheen from the source

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,480
conference and I'm here with Josh

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,700
pressors today who's the head of product

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,890
security at elastic and he's going to be

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,320
speaking at source Austin on December

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,189
5th and 6th and he's going to be

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,400
actually doing a really interesting

9
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:29,250
session it's called dungeons and data

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,689
and it's role-playing an incident so

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,460
I've actually wanted to have some kind

12
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,080
of a role playing tabletop thing at

13
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,030
source for a long time so I'm actually

14
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,710
really glad that I met you earlier in

15
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,390
the year and we talked about yeah that's

16
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,180
awesome no I'm super excited it's been

17
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:45,629
it's been so much fun it's so I've run

18
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,850
this a couple of times now and I just

19
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,710
sprung into my mind at some point that

20
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,659
would it be cool to do tabletop

21
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,570
exercises with like real dice and

22
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:58,019
character sheets and skills and kind of

23
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,089
the good old days I remember of you know

24
00:00:58,019 --> 00:01:02,549
Dungeons and Dragons and countless other

25
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:04,650
role-playing games and I don't know how

26
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:06,590
many tabletop events you've done in

27
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:10,560
terms of security but they're usually

28
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:12,150
terrible and they're boring yeah I'm

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,220
sorry to everyone right a girl playing

30
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,320
events but but they're quite boring

31
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,660
right did I thought what if we spiced it

32
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,869
up and made it fun and like I've never

33
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:23,460
done this before and so I go into my

34
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,890
first session I've ever done with with

35
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,869
like real humans right thinking I hope

36
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,970
this go like I might my goal is just to

37
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:32,520
not have people hate me when I'm done

38
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,530
and and we had we had a blast like it

39
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,479
was just like playing D&D with your

40
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,480
friends you know or everyone's silly and

41
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,370
and it's goofy and things don't always

42
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,260
make sense or work out the right way but

43
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:45,660
whatever it was it was so much fun and

44
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:48,870
the thing I love the most is I think I

45
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:51,630
had more fun than the people I was role

46
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,920
playing with which was surprising to be

47
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,270
honest with you because I was very

48
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,980
concerned it would be a lot of work and

49
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,770
not enjoyable at all but I loved it it

50
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:01,409
was great awesome and you ran this at

51
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,090
RSA right I did I ran it twice actually

52
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,320
which terrified me as well because I'd

53
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,510
never done it and they said we think

54
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,830
this is going to be really popular so we

55
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,209
want you to do it twice and I said oh

56
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:11,550
that sounds awesome you know two times

57
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,860
would be really fun and then you know

58
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,140
right before it came up I thought if the

59
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,230
first one of these goes bad maybe I

60
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,450
could pretend I got sick or something do

61
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,640
the second one

62
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:24,260
because it was kind of terrifying like

63
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,929
I'd never done this before it thought

64
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,579
I'm grateful they believe it will be

65
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,080
popular but at the same time than it was

66
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,250
like oh my goodness if it goes badly

67
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,110
what am I going to do

68
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,790
and it was and in part of the fun as

69
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:36,230
well is usually you give a talk twice

70
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,429
you know I've given lots of talks twice

71
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,018
at a conference you give it once you

72
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:41,209
give it twice it's basically the same

73
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:43,190
thing no big deal whatever and in this

74
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:45,080
instance obviously it's a role-playing

75
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:47,180
event and even what happens while we

76
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,310
play I've got tables that that I've

77
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,599
written out and I roll dice as well as

78
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,799
the you know I guess dungeon master

79
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:53,720
whatever you want to call me here

80
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:57,290
security master I like that I'm using

81
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,400
that one anyway but you know I rolled so

82
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,970
I don't know what's gonna happen either

83
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,680
and so both of these sessions were like

84
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:06,049
drastically different though the only

85
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,390
common thread that existed between the

86
00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:10,700
two of them is that at one point there

87
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:12,980
was ransom a ransom wanted to be paid by

88
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,540
the attacker in both groups tried really

89
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,670
hard to pay the ransom and I kept

90
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,679
telling them no matter what happens I'm

91
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,298
not going to let this work right like as

92
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,569
the guy in charge you are not paying

93
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:25,910
this ransom trying though like it was

94
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:28,160
it's funny it made me realize that

95
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:30,290
there's there's just like certain things

96
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,760
inherent to people I think that like

97
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,920
let's take the easy way out of this

98
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,569
situation you know even someone tells

99
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,069
you you can't take the easy way out like

100
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:41,660
it didn't matter they were still trying

101
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:45,619
to do it so what roles do you actually

102
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:47,239
have in the game so and I have 30

103
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,980
character sheets which is an insane

104
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:52,220
amount I will say and it's everything

105
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:55,100
from obviously CEO C so lawyers there's

106
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:57,139
engineers we've got PR people there's

107
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,239
kind of up and down the spectrum of

108
00:03:57,139 --> 00:04:02,600
typical roles you'd expect in a company

109
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:05,359
the one I didn't have that we really

110
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,608
need it turned out is like a CFO because

111
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:08,900
people kept asking like money again this

112
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:10,579
kind of comes back to the how to look at

113
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,049
the ransom you know or the CFO like

114
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:13,849
there is no CFO why the heck would we

115
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:16,910
have a CFO in this and it turns out

116
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:20,959
though that I'm going to add one prior

117
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:23,180
to the source and no it's it's funny too

118
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,889
because it made a lot of people step on

119
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,990
it they're kind of normal comfort zone

120
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:28,310
an example being the person who role

121
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:30,710
played the lawyer in the marketing

122
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,539
person at the end said you know this is

123
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,650
really hard you know trying to do these

124
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:36,440
particular town

125
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:38,179
for an incident and especially the

126
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,340
marketing people because obviously as

127
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,169
most of us being security practitioners

128
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,669
who do this we don't think about what

129
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:44,780
does it mean to communicate some of this

130
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:46,820
stuff what do we need to tell people

131
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,739
they should talk about and and my

132
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,449
favorite one was just how the game

133
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,520
worked people kept leaking information

134
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:54,560
to the press and at the very end of the

135
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,090
game the marketing guy says I probably

136
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,130
should have told no one to talk to the

137
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:00,979
press shouldn't I Thanks

138
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:03,290
yeah you probably shut up you know it's

139
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:05,389
just really crazy stuff like that it's

140
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:09,199
fantastic but yeah pretty much my goal

141
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:11,240
is to have basically every person in the

142
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,979
organization that would be involved in

143
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,699
some meaningful way in in a major

144
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:18,880
security event great so so essentially

145
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:21,530
you set up a scenario where there's

146
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,639
something just happened and then what do

147
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,789
people have to do they just have to kind

148
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,039
of act out how they would behave under

149
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:29,990
the circumstance essentially right then

150
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:32,389
that's exactly the idea so what I do is

151
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,220
I've got some background that I feel you

152
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:35,330
went on it was basically your I forget

153
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,410
the name of the company off the top of

154
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:39,469
my head now but you know your this

155
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:41,660
company and I think we sold synergy was

156
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:44,810
our product of course and and then

157
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:46,610
basically I said the CEO gets this email

158
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,200
and it's you know I have your customer

159
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:50,539
list unless you pay me you know a

160
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,280
million bitcoins I'm not going I'm going

161
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:54,680
to release it to the public what do you

162
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,869
do now and the person the CEO starts it

163
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,300
right and it was really cool too because

164
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,830
I know at first people like oh I want to

165
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:04,970
be the CEO by the end they're like this

166
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:06,440
is a terrible job which is really cool I

167
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,030
mean that was really really awesome

168
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,099
but then yeah it starts off like then

169
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:13,250
it's like okay CEO what do you do now

170
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:14,599
and and like at first they're like I

171
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:17,210
don't know what I should do I said maybe

172
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:18,889
you should call your seaso right and

173
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:22,099
then it kind of goes from there and then

174
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:23,360
the way I did it was I you know normally

175
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:25,490
when you kind of do a role-playing game

176
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,900
you have rounds and everyone gets a turn

177
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,310
and things like that with 30 people

178
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,010
that's ridiculous right you can't have

179
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,690
30 people each taking a turn because it

180
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:34,490
would take an hour just to get through

181
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:37,160
all 30 of them and so we did we had

182
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:39,320
five-minute rounds anyone could talk in

183
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,419
any time to anyone they want about

184
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,760
anything and then basically every time

185
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:45,260
the timer went off I would roll the dice

186
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,060
to see what happened

187
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:49,820
like there'd be some new finding or some

188
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:51,110
new thing would occur or and it did get

189
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,520
ridiculous and I warned them this could

190
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,830
happen because like at one point there

191
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,390
was two Western nations or I'm sorry

192
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,609
there was a Middle Eastern nation and a

193
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:00,680
Western nation like attacking the DNS

194
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,820
server like this is ridiculous I said

195
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,140
it's fine just keep going keep going

196
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,840
like let's see what let's see where it

197
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:07,340
goes and and that's one of the things

198
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,140
that was one of the bits of feedback I

199
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,210
got actually was like let's try not to

200
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:13,310
have too many completely ridiculous

201
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:17,299
events I mean that's fair right I

202
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:19,550
totally get that well so so how do you

203
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:22,910
see these kinds of events these kinds of

204
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:25,310
scenarios playing out in the future how

205
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:27,980
do you see this evolving over time so I

206
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:30,320
mean I think about this a lot it's one

207
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:32,090
of those things that I'm not heavily in

208
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,650
well I should say that I'm relatively

209
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,060
invested in it at this point just

210
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:37,130
because I've spent an insane amount of

211
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,300
time by the way it took me I figured

212
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:40,490
it'd be a couple hours to put this

213
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,900
together I bet I have more than 30 hours

214
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,160
of work into this thing at this prompt

215
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,729
surprise about a hundred and thirty

216
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,410
minutes they might be I feel like maybe

217
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,840
I'm blocking out part of it in my brain

218
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:52,430
but obviously and I updated as I come up

219
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,080
with ideas and obviously before source

220
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,180
I'm gonna put a bunch of extra work into

221
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,680
it to to make some changes I want to see

222
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,180
and things like that but I mean

223
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,040
fundamentally kind of the way I see this

224
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,930
and this is almost true of the entire

225
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:07,040
security industry for the most part is

226
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:09,050
we are bad at communicating important

227
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,450
things in a way that isn't super boring

228
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:13,310
right and and I'll never forget I had an

229
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,349
old mentor many many many years ago that

230
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,940
said that this stuff is too important to

231
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,980
try to spice it up right it has to be

232
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,690
boring and I'm thinking no it doesn't

233
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,800
because when you when people are bored

234
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,300
they don't listen they don't pay

235
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,410
attention and they don't engage right

236
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:28,490
and so the value I kind of see here is

237
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:31,040
there's a couple angles there's the

238
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:32,900
angle of just role-playing things I

239
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,909
think is beneficial for teams because it

240
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,770
helps build confidence it helps kind of

241
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:38,539
build camaraderie between the people and

242
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,740
what they're doing and it just makes you

243
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:41,329
understand you know what are some of our

244
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,770
weak spots what can we do well what

245
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,390
don't we do well what's happening here

246
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,949
so obviously I think we're all playing

247
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,750
events you know kind of tabletop I

248
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:51,770
should say is important then has a lot

249
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:53,600
of value but it also it's not exciting

250
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:55,010
right it's not something people look

251
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,940
forward to usually it's like oh crap

252
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,470
we're doing our tail

253
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,810
something this week you know let's see

254
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,280
what happens now and in the idea is like

255
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:03,079
let's make people excited about this

256
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,390
what if people wanted to do this right

257
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,740
in its oh come come you know come person

258
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,030
who's brand-new or come someone from

259
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,310
this department over here come join us

260
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:12,770
and see what this is and then the most

261
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:14,810
important aspect of it I think is people

262
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:16,520
understanding other perspectives and

263
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:18,349
this is where like I said having someone

264
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,569
played the CEO someone played a lawyer

265
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:22,880
someone played the marketing person it

266
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:25,610
really made them think about what does

267
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,920
this mean for these people that I have

268
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,240
to interact with when I do my job right

269
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,949
because and all of a sudden you're not

270
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,480
the person yelling at the lawyer you're

271
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:35,450
the lawyer yelling at the security guy

272
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,580
so to speak and and so I really that's

273
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:40,100
the thing I didn't expect then I think

274
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:42,020
people were most impressed by and

275
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,930
thought was the highest value that came

276
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:47,150
out of it was just now I understand what

277
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,859
these people are doing when I'm talking

278
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:51,380
to them and that's awesome right like

279
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,370
that's I think in most situations when

280
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,930
we're dealing with humans like that's

281
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,610
the dream right if you can get someone

282
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,199
to understand your perspective you

283
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,730
automatically have a brand new

284
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,280
connection that you can then leverage to

285
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:02,930
get more done yeah I know I love getting

286
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,550
doing exercises Reckitt to bring people

287
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,630
together they're maybe in different

288
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,280
roles or different things like that

289
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:09,020
where they can get better understand

290
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,069
each other I do a threat modeling thing

291
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,620
where I do that where I bring different

292
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:14,600
roles in nice understand what the each

293
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:17,960
other does so I definitely appreciate

294
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,880
that part what kind of a attendee would

295
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,710
get value out of this is this for

296
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,380
literally anybody or is this yeah a

297
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:26,300
definite role like just show up right I

298
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,730
had it so when I've done it in the past

299
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,319
I had it was obviously RSA so there were

300
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,870
some pretty heavy security people there

301
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,190
I've done some I I'm not officially done

302
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:36,410
it with other people but I've talked to

303
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:38,900
a bunch of people with varying levels of

304
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:39,980
security background and knowledge about

305
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,510
all this we've gone over a lot of

306
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:44,060
content and everything from you know

307
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:47,210
sales people on up to see so types and

308
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:49,819
so I think I obviously from my

309
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:52,130
perspective by my goal is to make this

310
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:54,830
thing literally anyone could come to

311
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:55,640
where if my 12 year old kid could sit

312
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:58,430
down and play with us

313
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,660
I think that is a success they don't

314
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:02,930
need to have prior security knowledge

315
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:04,490
zero knowledge right zero knowledge is

316
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,050
the is the goal I just want people to

317
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,720
show up and sit down

318
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:09,709
and in fact I'm even super flexible if

319
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,690
someone wants to like May

320
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,400
got their own character type of their

321
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:15,200
own job function great

322
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,030
I'm all for stuff like that in fact I

323
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,890
even encouraged people to modify their

324
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:20,569
character sheets where you know change

325
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:23,030
your skills change all this change all

326
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:24,470
