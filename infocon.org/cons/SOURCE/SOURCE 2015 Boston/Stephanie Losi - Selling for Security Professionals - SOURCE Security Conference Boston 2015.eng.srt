1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,390
okay hello welcome so this talk is on

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,460
selling for security professionals so

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,500
what is this about first of all a little

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,450
bit about me my name is Stephanie Losey

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,070
I spent the prior seven years as a bank

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,410
examiner in senior bank examiner at the

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,300
Federal Reserve Bank of New York looking

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,430
at IT risk and a lot of big financial

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,650
firms things like cyber security

10
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,150
business resilience but also high-speed

11
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,279
trading controls risk data aggregation

12
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,259
change management a lot of IT risk

13
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:30,390
topics and one of the things I noticed

14
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,669
is that there's this key component even

15
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,989
in auditing work but also in consulting

16
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:36,390
worker as an information security

17
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:39,059
manager that a lot of people don't use

18
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,070
and it's selling its sales it's actually

19
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,620
a key component of the job and you can

20
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,180
get much better outcomes by using it but

21
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,468
there's a problem so we'll talk about

22
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,450
what that problem isn't it's a language

23
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:49,800
problem and there's these two worlds

24
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,930
security and business so we'll talk

25
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,569
about how can security professionals

26
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,160
sell successfully right we'll look at

27
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,350
some sample proposals that take a risk

28
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,879
focus versus a business focus we'll talk

29
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,129
about questions you can ask yourself

30
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:04,949
before a pitch and really this can apply

31
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:06,810
to like to in in to internal security

32
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,640
manager as well as to an external

33
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,869
consultant right and then we'll take a

34
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,299
little bit of a different spin and we'll

35
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:14,400
talk about selling for auditors which

36
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:16,740
also can apply to a third party auditor

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,390
like up like a pen tester as well as to

38
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,830
an internal auditor although they have a

39
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,689
little bit of different set of

40
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:26,310
constraints and then we'll talk about

41
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:27,600
questions and follow up so what is the

42
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,640
problem well the problem is that

43
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,929
security professionals tend to focus on

44
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,540
risk right where are we thinking about

45
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,670
worst-case scenarios redundancy and

46
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,009
diversity of controls risk reduction

47
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,869
right business executives spend most of

48
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,570
their time focusing on growth they think

49
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:44,520
about return on investment ROI decision

50
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,589
modeling profit and loss and growing

51
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,970
their business increasing revenue right

52
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,290
they're not there they don't spend a lot

53
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,000
of their time thinking about oh do I

54
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,140
have sufficient redundancy and diversity

55
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,909
of controls right now no they're

56
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,890
thinking about I want to launch this new

57
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,780
business are my people spending their

58
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:01,469
time signing new business and serving

59
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,939
customers so the situation that you end

60
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:04,649
up with is the business line over here

61
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,148
thinking like you know ok growth ROI

62
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:07,530
profit and then you have the security

63
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:10,140
people over here thinking oh my god

64
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,790
controls threats risk and you have this

65
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,019
pretty small common ground where they

66
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,679
both want to protect the business

67
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,110
reputation

68
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,390
it's a great goal but it's not enough of

69
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,489
a base to really build anything except

70
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,170
this uncomfortable slightly adversarial

71
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:24,150
relationship where where security is

72
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,069
viewed as a cost center and the business

73
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,510
is thinking you know why do I have to do

74
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:29,689
this when I could make an investment in

75
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:33,179
something that produces a lot of revenue

76
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:34,500
but there's a better story here which is

77
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,140
that the reality there's is there is a

78
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,659
much more optimistic view the potential

79
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,548
common ground is actually pretty big and

80
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,929
it focuses on things like maximizing the

81
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:44,879
business's reputation not just

82
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,769
maintaining it making the business

83
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,870
resilient to inevitable errors and

84
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:50,909
incidents and helping the business lines

85
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,209
grow right I mean why do we have

86
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:56,489
security why do we have risk management

87
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:58,049
so how do we bridge that gap because the

88
00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:00,299
business executive is unlikely to say

89
00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:01,760
well it's time for me to study security

90
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:03,870
it's time for me to really understand

91
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,399
redundancy and diversity of controls and

92
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,470
worst case scenarios I want to spend my

93
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,299
time in this it's kind of on us as the

94
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,579
security professional to think about

95
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:13,530
business and understand how we can come

96
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:15,209
to them and say okay here's how we can

97
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,709
help your business grow here's how we

98
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:18,629
can maximize the business reputation

99
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:20,489
instead of just protecting and

100
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:23,040
maintaining you know status quo

101
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:25,290
so there's a significant language gap

102
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,629
the language of business is not the

103
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,519
language of risk management so there's a

104
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:31,679
result business may view risk management

105
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,540
as just requiring controls for the sake

106
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,310
of controls you know why do we keep

107
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,078
talking about this why why do we keep

108
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,359
thinking negatively and bringing this up

109
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:41,669
it can be difficult to quantify the

110
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:43,079
benefits right you know what what are

111
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:44,370
they really going to gain from this and

112
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:47,280
as a result it can really be difficult

113
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,470
to justify investment in security

114
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,569
measures versus a clear revenue

115
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,159
producing investment which they also are

116
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:53,879
considering at all times whether you

117
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:56,099
know it or not

118
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:58,280
so you're you're competing against all

119
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:00,298
of these other potential proposals

120
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,220
exceptions to this our businesses for

121
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:04,530
which security breaches are really could

122
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,909
be catastrophic and they know it things

123
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,379
like energy grants you know they're used

124
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:09,120
to thinking about the worst case

125
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:11,099
scenario and protect me against that or

126
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,540
a financial firm for which security

127
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:14,518
measures are mandated by law or

128
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,500
regulation they know they have to think

129
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:17,699
about it but still you're competing with

130
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,529
other things in their head you know and

131
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:21,060
even knowing that you have to do

132
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:21,478
something doesn't mean you're excited

133
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,700
about it

134
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:25,889
and so but it it does mean you can

135
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,820
change the story as the security

136
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:29,340
professional right

137
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,409
because the reality is despite these

138
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,989
different languages business and risk

139
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:36,120
management teams have similar goals risk

140
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:39,210
management exists to serve the business

141
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,800
and allow it to grow right as the only

142
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,989
reason risk management is there it's the

143
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,730
only reason security exists risk

144
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:48,090
management exists to serve the business

145
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:50,940
and allow it to grow and that's a

146
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:52,859
message that we need to sell to the

147
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,570
business because that's probably not how

148
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,690
they think about security when they

149
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:59,520
first sit down with you so as security

150
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,620
and risk professional seeking investment

151
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,580
from business executives because that's

152
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,280
what we're doing we're seeking

153
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:08,219
investment selling is a key component of

154
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,840
our job and partnership not just

155
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,490
Authority is vital I mean it's very

156
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,799
tempting to say you know I've studied

157
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,760
this for a long time you know I know why

158
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,390
you should do it

159
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:20,039
you must implement this control you know

160
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:21,780
like I have the authority and then you

161
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,280
know I feel like I'm bringing that

162
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,919
authority to you and it's just sort of a

163
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,570
gift and you know I think it I think I'm

164
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,460
telling you that this is what you need

165
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,659
to do well the business person is

166
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,430
thinking I'm in charge of this business

167
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:36,030
you know I'm in charge of this business

168
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:37,530
line and and here's this person it's

169
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:39,710
taking this authority position and

170
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:42,599
telling me you know I need to do this

171
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:44,099
and it sets up sort of an adversarial

172
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,170
relationship with the reality is

173
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,750
security exists to serve the business

174
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:50,940
and this is a partnership and if you if

175
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,410
we approach it like a partnership the

176
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,870
result can be a heck of a lot better

177
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:58,230
even if an investment is required by law

178
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:59,670
or regulation selling is beneficial why

179
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:01,140
it helps the business executive

180
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:03,720
understand why that investment is

181
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,729
required and if applicable why it might

182
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,770
be worthwhile even without a requirement

183
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:09,240
right it's unfortunate sometimes that's

184
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,890
not applicable sometimes it's really not

185
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,330
worthwhile and you know there's just a

186
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:14,610
requirement they have to do it but in a

187
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,169
lot of cases there is a case that can be

188
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,540
made for the investment even if it

189
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:20,430
weren't required it brings the business

190
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:24,000
executive into the process of deciding

191
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:25,650
which solution offers the best ROI and

192
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,200
it helps both the business executive and

193
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,609
the risk people to consider how could

194
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,500
this investment create a competitive

195
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,720
advantage sometimes that's the case

196
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,240
sometimes there is an opportunity to be

197
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,400
found there and always always one team

198
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,120
united behind an investment is so much

199
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,310
better then to part

200
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:47,320
grudgingly reaching an agreement to do

201
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:49,990
something so how do I sell the details

202
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,699
of how an exploit works or the details

203
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:54,040
of a technical specification those are

204
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:55,690
not business drivers or investment

205
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,669
justifications right you know that

206
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:59,530
that's it's something that without maybe

207
00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:01,599
maybe we find extremely interesting

208
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:03,039
right and want to share with the

209
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,229
business executive but that is not

210
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,750
what's going to get the investment done

211
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:09,099
when you propose propose an investment

212
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,190
executives need to know a few things

213
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:14,199
they need to know what do I need to do

214
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:16,270
why is it important especially why is it

215
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:18,910
important and what is the best solution

216
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:20,799
from an ROI perspective and how much

217
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,000
will that solution cost you know I

218
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,800
guarantee that they might be thinking

219
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,660
this fourth thing here I couldn't work

220
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,389
around our manual process accomplish the

221
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,770
goal right and in in in our head as a

222
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:31,539
security professional we're thinking

223
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,500
we'll no no a manual process is not that

224
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:34,300
good it doesn't give you a hundred

225
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,470
percent protection maybe they're

226
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,780
thinking well maybe I don't need a

227
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:39,910
hundred percent protection maybe I need

228
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:43,719
what the solution that is going to

229
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:46,090
maximize my ROI and maybe that's that

230
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,430
solution so it's more a process of

231
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:50,830
understanding that that question may be

232
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,599
there whether it's asked or not and kind

233
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:54,310
of having me in our head you know the

234
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:55,840
rationale for why we think there's a

235
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:57,849
better solution if we think there's a

236
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,950
better solution or maybe being open to

237
00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:03,700
accept that hey a workaround or a manual

238
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:05,680
process could accomplish the goal so it

239
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,289
gets back to focusing on the context and

240
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,639
not just the content of our proposal the

241
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:10,870
business person is thinking a lot of

242
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:13,090
different things when they're when

243
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:14,650
they're looking at a proposal and it

244
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:16,869
includes things like the size of the

245
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:18,909
business the state of the business cycle

246
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:21,370
is in a recession right now you know is

247
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,930
the economy booming and other expenses

248
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,580
that are facing the company right now is

249
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:26,560
the company and major litigation right

250
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,270
now it has the company just announced a

251
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,650
terrific quarter you know or is the

252
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:31,510
company about to have a tour at the

253
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:34,270
quarter are they in the middle of really

254
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:36,250
doing very well that's gonna really

255
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,718
control the person's response the

256
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,799
business person's responses controlled

257
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:41,409
by all of these things that have nothing

258
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,579
to do with the actual content of your

259
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:47,650
proposal or the thing that you're

260
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:49,930
suggesting so language is so key when

261
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:51,490
communicating your points use business

262
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,349
language you have we have to come to

263
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,769
them because the likelihood that they're

264
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,319
gonna come

265
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:58,989
to us on the risk language footing is is

266
00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:00,779
really low so let's talk let's think

267
00:08:58,989 --> 00:09:04,209
about talking about return on investment

268
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:06,970
decision modeling profit and loss growth

269
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:08,050
strategy and duty of care right I mean

270
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:09,819
these are things that are all going to

271
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:11,079
resonate with the business executives

272
00:09:09,819 --> 00:09:12,849
they learn these things in business

273
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:15,488
school they apply them in real life

274
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:16,629
every day and these are the things that

275
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:18,069
they really care about and that's how

276
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:19,989
they serve their shareholders if it's a

277
00:09:18,069 --> 00:09:22,389
public company you know or their

278
00:09:19,989 --> 00:09:25,480
employees it's a private company so um

279
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:27,339
or you know in cases hopefully but the

280
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,399
core messages information security can

281
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:32,139
be a long-term positive investment

282
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,790
opportunity right so how do we frame in

283
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:37,299
for an information security investment

284
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:38,829
in these terms now let's take a look at

285
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:40,959
some sample proposals right here is a

286
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:42,609
risk focused proposal that someone might

287
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,138
hypothetically dream up they might say

288
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:45,519
well this intrusion prevention system

289
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:48,519
it's the most advanced offering on the

290
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:51,069
market it analyzes network traffic using

291
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:52,720
anomaly based detection so it can

292
00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:54,699
attempt to detect and prevent even

293
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,589
zero-day attacks we could significantly

294
00:09:54,699 --> 00:09:58,929
decrease our chances of a network

295
00:09:56,589 --> 00:10:00,369
compromised well the business person is

296
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:02,170
sitting there saying well what does that

297
00:10:00,369 --> 00:10:04,209
really mean for me to decrease my

298
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,439
chances of a network compromised as

299
00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:06,969
opposed to these other revenue

300
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:09,040
generating proposals that are sitting in

301
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:11,199
my head where I can see you know hey I

302
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,748
could I could start a new business line

303
00:10:11,199 --> 00:10:14,889
I could open a new desk or I could

304
00:10:13,749 --> 00:10:16,839
invest in this intrusion prevention

305
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:18,279
system you know which uses something

306
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,480
called anomaly based detection to

307
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:23,799
prevent something called the zero day

308
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:25,420
attack if we prevent it if we present it

309
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:27,579
as a business focused perspective we

310
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:29,079
could say something like this this

311
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:31,118
intrusion prevention system would have

312
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:32,649
been our only chance to prevent an

313
00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:35,110
attack like the recent incident we

314
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:37,449
experienced and it doesn't rely on known

315
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:39,100
information so we can attempt to detect

316
00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:41,979
and prevent even previously unknown

317
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,600
attacks if we avoid even one incident

318
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,639
we'll have saved five million dollars

319
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,799
and protected one of our most valuable

320
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:49,179
assets which is our reputation and then

321
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:51,279
with the time we save in avoiding an

322
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:53,079
incident we can focus on what we do best

323
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,850
finding new business and serving

324
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:58,449
customers you know that's a lot more

325
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:59,949
likely to reach the business manager as

326
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,748
a pitch because they're thinking well

327
00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:03,699
yeah I want to spend all my time signing

328
00:11:01,749 --> 00:11:04,899
new business and serving customers they

329
00:11:03,699 --> 00:11:07,118
don't really want to be thinking about

330
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:07,510
the details of this security stuff you

331
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:09,040
know that

332
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:12,339
that's our job as the security

333
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,069
professional so kind of going there with

334
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:17,139
what could we save we can save time we

335
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,630
could save money how can we get our

336
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:21,550
focus back on growth

337
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:23,350
here's another proposal this access

338
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,790
management system will help us address

339
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,220
the auditors findings and meet the

340
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:28,750
requirements of new regulations it works

341
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,490
with all of our major platforms and we

342
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,230
can build in functionality to extend it

343
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,320
to the rest it will allow us to keep

344
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:37,779
track of employee entitlements etc etc

345
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,880
on and on here's here's what it does for

346
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:42,339
us but it doesn't tell us why that's

347
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:46,380
good how does it get big business back

348
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:49,209
to being effective in its core business

349
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,769
the business focus perspective says hey

350
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:52,839
this access management system will help

351
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:54,760
us address these auditor findings and

352
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:57,490
new regulations absolutely but it also

353
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,439
will save time on our annual entitlement

354
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:02,079
review process and whose time will it

355
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,610
save it will save the time of business

356
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,709
managers who should already be doing

357
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:07,269
something else right in the business

358
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:09,279
executives head their business manager

359
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:10,660
spending time on the annual entitlement

360
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,939
review process this time they are not

361
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,980
spending building new systems or

362
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,930
algorithms or you know they're like

363
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:21,100
managing the actual business calling

364
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:24,489
customers doing revenue generating work

365
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:26,199
so so this proposal says we estimate

366
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,060
business managers will spend 50 percent

367
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:29,709
less time manually reviewing their

368
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,510
subordinates entitlements all right

369
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:33,189
business executives gonna hear that and

370
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:35,370
say yeah maybe this is an investment

371
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:37,089
I want to make despite an upfront cost

372
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:38,620
because the business think of the

373
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,990
business managers are gonna get back to

374
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:43,060
what they do best and hey I can minimize

375
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:45,850
the risk of insider incidents and that's

376
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:47,949
something I'd like to do so it's a much

377
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:49,360
more effective proposal to think about

378
00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:52,479
what the business wants and try to build

379
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,970
that into our proposal so questions to

380
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,680
ask yourself before a pitch how does

381
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,930
what I'm proposing help the business

382
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,719
grow and the answer may be indirect it's

383
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:03,310
probably going to be indirect examples

384
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,399
are this will make the business more

385
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:07,810
resilient by reducing errors but how

386
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,880
much do those cost affects right say

387
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:11,319
that and-and-and-and bring up that the

388
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,449
earth could have potential for a legal

389
00:13:11,319 --> 00:13:14,860
liability so the person can see well why

390
00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:16,209
do I want to reduce those errors in the

391
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,040
first place right

392
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:19,839
fewer incidents will make us faster to

393
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,959
market and first among our

394
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:25,000
that's a good argument think about how

395
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,190
your proposal will probably be way

396
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,840
against other competing proposals that

397
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,460
may help increase revenue directly you

398
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,950
you you probably don't know what those

399
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,870
proposals are but but they're there you

400
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:36,430
know there's always a trade-off and a

401
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:38,440
cost-benefit analysis going on in

402
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:40,630
someone's head make sure that your

403
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,630
proposal falls on the right side of the

404
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:45,610
cost-benefit analysis does my proposal

405
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:47,680
offer significant benefit in maximizing

406
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,900
and not just protecting the business's

407
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,719
reputation or helping the business grow

408
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:54,699
and am i focusing on maintenance which

409
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,350
is not a strong selling proposition

410
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,839
maintenance is like keep the lights on

411
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:01,150
let's minimize the amount of this type

412
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:03,520
of investment that we do let's focus on

413
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:05,709
growth so am i focusing on growth which

414
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,770
is a strong base for partnership with

415
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:11,380
the business right maintenance loses out

416
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:15,000
to growth a lot of the time so can you

417
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:19,029
get your proposal into the growth bucket

418
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,620
all right so one thing I want to talk

419
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:22,960
about before I move on to this I'm going

420
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:25,210
to go back one second is another thing

421
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,589
called so there are sales tactics you

422
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:28,750
can use in doing this right there's

423
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:31,870
something called Aida which means

424
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:34,750
attention interest desire in action

425
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:36,970
right have I got the attention of the

426
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,380
business with my proposal have I got

427
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:42,070
them interested and do what do they want

428
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:44,380
to know more do they have the desire to

429
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:46,570
do what I'm asking them to do and then

430
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,250
action have I given them an opportunity

431
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:50,710
to take action have I told them what the

432
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:52,570
next step will be right so all of the

433
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:54,760
first three attention interest in desire

434
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:56,740
they come down through this for this one

435
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,120
question whether the business person is

436
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:00,250
going to have which is what's in it for

437
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,960
me right so what's in it for the

438
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,790
business executives I mean if you can

439
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,650
answer that core question you've just

440
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:07,420
increased your your likelihood of

441
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:10,689
getting approval for whatever you're

442
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:12,160
asking for yep by a lot and you've

443
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:13,780
increased the likelihood that they will

444
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,000
take action well how do you how do you

445
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:18,610
communicate that what's in it for me

446
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,260
will you use their language right you

447
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:22,750
don't use the language of risk you don't

448
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:25,029
use our language controls and you know

449
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,350
locking things down what's the worst

450
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:28,270
thing that could happen let's say this

451
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:31,540
this will help us you know mitigate the

452
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:33,199
risk of that now we use their language

453
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:36,380
we say how can this

454
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,910
maximize the business you know how can

455
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,350
this help the business grow how can this

456
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,939
help the executives independent

457
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:45,140
management focus on generating more

458
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:46,490
revenue okay also and this is kind of

459
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,470
this is the common sense things that you

460
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:50,270
thought you were here but in the meeting

461
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:54,980
with with business management eye

462
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:57,829
contact right act as if you have nothing

463
00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:00,260
else on your mind and nowhere else to be

464
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:01,850
okay it doesn't matter if you're an

465
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,370
external consultant and you've been in

466
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:05,750
five different firms that day in five

467
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,860
different meetings talking about five

468
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,350
different things and you don't even know

469
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:12,650
where you are they don't know that and

470
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:15,050
for this hour you are with them and

471
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:17,569
you're telling them how you can help

472
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:19,699
their business grow and you're in your

473
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:23,090
ear you're making an ask for an

474
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:25,070
investment so just to be present there

475
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:28,280
be polite respectful friendly obviously

476
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:32,290
you know not really kind of to move away

477
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:34,579
from you must right now immediately to

478
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:36,709
let's talk about why this is a risk

479
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:40,280
let's talk about how this can help the

480
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:41,420
business be honest if you don't know

481
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,880
something if they ask something and you

482
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:47,449
don't know best responses I don't know

483
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:50,090
but we can find out right and then

484
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:52,940
follow-up right even even in sales in

485
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:55,310
sales sales a lot of sales people never

486
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:57,020
follow up you know like they they make a

487
00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:00,560
call they they talk to the customer or

488
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:03,410
they move on right so the likelihood

489
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,359
that someone will agree in a sales

490
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:08,780
conversation the first time is actually

491
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:11,810
sort of low the longer that conversation

492
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:14,030
continues via follow-up you know via

493
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:16,159
additional interaction the greater their

494
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:18,260
likelihood that they'll eventually say

495
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,240
yes right assuming that you're managing

496
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:22,339
the conversation you're using their

497
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,579
language you're creating I need a right

498
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:27,230
attention interest desire action if you

499
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:29,870
can maintain that conversation and

500
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:31,670
maintain a partnership right as opposed

501
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:33,709
to coming down as an authority and

502
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:35,540
demanding things from them the

503
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:39,980
likelihood that they'll say yes it goes

504
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:41,389
up and up and up so follow up and create

505
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,310
the expert the expectation and the

506
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:44,360
opportunity for follow-up right you know

507
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,139
so that so they don't feel like

508
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,820
constantly

509
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:49,100
you know pinged by you from a tip from

510
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,649
out of the blue sky you know just sort

511
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,030
of say hey you know thank you for the

512
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,320
meeting you know we'll follow up in a

513
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,850
couple of weeks if you have any other

514
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,530
questions please feel free to reach out

515
00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:01,189
to me you know I'll do the same with you

516
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:03,379
and really make it a conversation so so

517
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:05,120
that's sort of some some sales tactics

518
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:07,250
for all of this whatever you whether

519
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,350
you're an internal information security

520
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:12,860
manager or an external consultant trying

521
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:14,230
to make recommendations to a firm so now

522
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,909
we'll talk about selling for auditors

523
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:18,380
which is a critical differentiator for

524
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:21,050
auditors even though the role is a

525
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:25,460
little a little weird it's it's a little

526
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:26,960
different because auditors they may not

527
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,700
know they're selling for one thing you

528
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,440
know they're in this position where you

529
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,810
know that they're there they've they've

530
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:36,020
been given authority over what the

531
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:38,419
business is supposed to do and the

532
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:40,910
business if it's an internal auditor or

533
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:43,130
a regulator management may be required

534
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:45,410
to address your findings they may have

535
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:48,530
to do what you say so it's easy to take

536
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:50,330
this viewpoint hey I've already won all

537
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:51,980
I have to do is say what they need to do

538
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:54,590
and then I can just move on and and

539
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:57,130
it'll happen they'll do it

540
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:59,419
the Esper investment is also indirect

541
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:00,950
because information security managers

542
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,210
are going to be the ones who actually

543
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:04,190
make the Esk

544
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:06,830
to business executives in response to

545
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:08,780
your findings you may be presenting to

546
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:10,909
the information security manager and

547
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,889
then they may be may need to present to

548
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:16,790
the business executive depending on the

549
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:18,320
situation so whether you're a pen tester

550
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:20,000
or a third party audit firm or an

551
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,429
internal auditor there's a lot of

552
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,680
different things as opposed to just kind

553
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:28,340
of being a manager asking for investment

554
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,990
in your firm even if management is

555
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:32,750
required to address your findings if

556
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:34,340
you're an internal auditor there's still

557
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:38,900
your sales ability is still gonna

558
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:40,189
determine how valuable your input is for

559
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,440
the business as a whole and what the

560
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,700
outcome is right are your findings gonna

561
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,620
be addressed as a limited check-the-box

562
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,180
workaround or a strategic business

563
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:49,669
investment right because usually an

564
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:52,040
auditor doesn't on it the whole firm an

565
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:56,210
auditor audits a piece of the firm write

566
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:57,379
a business unit a desk a particular risk

567
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,910
stripe

568
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:02,450
and you see a limited set of things

569
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:04,700
right but the best case scenario is for

570
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:06,260
someone to say wow I've had this great

571
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,360
conversation you know I understand what

572
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:11,090
the risk is I think I'm gonna take a

573
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,409
look myself and be proactive about this

574
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:14,360
and maybe apply this across the entire

575
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:15,830
firm or across the whole world you know

576
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,899
all of the offices around the globe you

577
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:19,970
couldn't have gotten that done by

578
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,559
mandating it cuz you can't want it the

579
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:25,100
entire firm auditing means you sampled

580
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:26,418
some stuff right so think about when you

581
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,070
make a pitch as an auditor did you

582
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:30,320
explain what the risk is why it's

583
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:31,730
important and if applicable how can the

584
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,100
business benefit from addressing that

585
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:39,890
using business language did you sell the

586
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:41,178
findings even if you didn't have to one

587
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:43,159
possible outcome if you sell your

588
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:45,260
finding well is the business proactively

589
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:46,669
like we said extend your finding from

590
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,080
one business unit across the enterprise

591
00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:50,380
that's something you could not have

592
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,539
mandated if you only audit in one area

593
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,950
if you saw you're finding poorly you can

594
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:55,908
kind of have an opposite outcome and

595
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:58,580
it's written it's really

596
00:20:55,909 --> 00:21:01,400
counterproductive because it affects you

597
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:02,960
in the future if you return if you're an

598
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,419
internal auditor and you only work with

599
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,250
this one firm or you're an external

600
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:09,530
consultant and you repeatedly come to

601
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:11,840
this firm right you know if you're doing

602
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:13,490
pen testing at a firm and you give

603
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,158
multiple engagements if you sell your

604
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:18,080
findings poorly what happens maybe the

605
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,270
business does not volunteer extra

606
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,250
information in future audits your job

607
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:24,260
gets harder you have less productive

608
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:26,059
conversations and the response to your

609
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:28,700
findings becomes more tactical and more

610
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:29,750
limited over time that's that's sort of

611
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,230
that sort of a worst-case scenario

612
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:35,150
that's a risk right there so adversarial

613
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:38,000
relationships can lead to stonewalling

614
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:39,289
and less than optimal outcomes whereas

615
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,120
on the other hand a respectful

616
00:21:39,289 --> 00:21:43,220
independent relationship can acknowledge

617
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,320
the business goals while also

618
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:47,120
emphasizing the importance of risk which

619
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,939
is in which is internal audits job right

620
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,918
into your audit is there to sort of be

621
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:55,010
the risk voice right but that doesn't

622
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,390
mean think only risk and don't

623
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:58,340
understand where the business is coming

624
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:59,450
from right it means understand where the

625
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,010
business is coming from but then

626
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:03,770
emphasize the importance of risk and

627
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:06,020
have that conversation so maintaining a

628
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:08,570
productive yet independent relationship

629
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:10,610
between auditors and business leaders is

630
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:12,919
a delicate balance

631
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:16,760
but has great potential benefits because

632
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:18,860
it gets you to that that really big that

633
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,780
really big potential common ground this

634
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,889
is where we want to get like kind of

635
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:24,889
there's always gonna be different

636
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:27,740
interests and that's good but the bigger

637
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:30,799
this is the bigger the common ground the

638
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:32,570
more effective you are going to be as a

639
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,700
security professional whether you're an

640
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:36,980
information security manager inside a

641
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:39,320
company or an internal auditor inside a

642
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,850
company or an external consultant with a

643
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,379
consulting firm kind of making so many

644
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:45,350
some independent recommendations or

645
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:49,429
pentester it doesn't matter like your

646
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:51,020
job is to so what you're suggesting in

647
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:52,970
such a way that the business can

648
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:55,490
understand it in their language and to

649
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:58,730
use sales tools to get that done so the

650
00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:02,600
key is sales right it's the missing

651
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:07,010
piece between kind of just doing your

652
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:09,770
job and really being effective with the

653
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:12,230
business because the business operates

654
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:14,389
in a different world and sales allows

655
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:17,240
you to say I'm gonna come to your world

656
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:19,010
I'm not gonna stay in my world and kind

657
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,220
of shout across a gap at you from my

658
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:24,620
world now I'm gonna come to you and I'm

659
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:27,890
gonna use your language to explain to

660
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:30,080
you my world in a way that you don't

661
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:31,940
have to think too hard about it and you

662
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,970
can understand why we want to do this

663
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:37,220
and we're gonna be partners in making

664
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:44,660

665
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:46,880
done so thank you for listening to this

this read up on Aida you can just google

675
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:11,030
it there is a Wikipedia article about it

676
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,040
it'll point you to a lot of other

677
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:14,840
resources about this if you want to

678
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:17,299
learn about sales and you don't want to

679
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:19,040
make it your life calling but you know

680
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:21,440
it's important there's a book called the

681

tips to help yourself do this and then

685
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:33,129
there's another resource if you want to

686
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:35,960
understand the business language more

687
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:38,300
without getting an MBA this book is

688
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,820
called the personal MBA master the guard

689
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:42,290
of business by Josh Kaufman and it just

690
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,730
click you know by reading that you'll

691
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:45,560
get a sense of some of these terms that

692
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:48,260
business executives have learned in

693
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:50,270
school and and start thinking as you

694
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:52,010
read that about well okay how can I use

695
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:54,530
this information to talk more

696
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:56,030
effectively to them to bring my world to

697
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:59,120
them in a way that's easy for them to

698
00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:11,950
understand and agree with and that's

699
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:16,580
that so thank you okay question anyone

700
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:20,030
yeah can we get your slides absolutely

701
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:24,070
yeah so um are they available through a

702
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:24,070
website or you can just email me if not

703
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:34,030
okay yeah just stop by and I'll just

704
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:34,030
email them to you how about that okay

705
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:38,710
yeah

706
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:47,260
what happened

707
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:49,770
value where someone executes

708
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,770
professional

709
00:25:57,299 --> 00:26:14,989
I can hear you right absolutely right

710
00:26:18,169 --> 00:26:23,070
okay so so the question is sometimes

711
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:25,499
there's a there's a there's a response

712
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:27,059
that I couldn't breached before and I'm

713
00:26:25,499 --> 00:26:28,200
still here right I'd like it wasn't that

714
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:30,059
big of a deal I didn't go out of

715
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:33,389
business you know why should I do this

716
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:36,418
I'm not gonna do it and I think then it

717
00:26:33,389 --> 00:26:37,918
gets down to kind of reframing it right

718
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:40,169
like so it's always that if that pitch

719
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,629
is not working is there a way to say you

720
00:26:40,169 --> 00:26:44,519
know what what what will they prevent

721
00:26:42,629 --> 00:26:46,259
right like are there current events you

722
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,759
could point to that they could avoid

723
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:50,009
with this so you know could they avoid

724
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:51,570
something like the Sony hack you know

725
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:54,299
which which did a lot of damage to the

726
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:56,549
firm you know maybe appeal to protecting

727
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:58,139
the business's reputation or protecting

728
00:26:56,549 --> 00:27:00,119
the executives reputation which kind of

729
00:26:58,139 --> 00:27:05,609
it you know that's more of a something

730
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:07,519
that they may care about but also kind

731
00:27:05,609 --> 00:27:10,168
of pointing pointing at is their way

732
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:12,869
that investing in this could get their

733
00:27:10,169 --> 00:27:14,850
business managers doing something else

734
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:16,590
rather than it like so so if there was a

735
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:18,748
prior incident did the business itself

736
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:20,939
not the security people but did the

737
00:27:18,749 --> 00:27:22,559
business have to scramble around at all

738
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,749
or do things that took them away from

739
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,789
their primary tasks and maybe maybe

740
00:27:24,749 --> 00:27:29,340
trying to frame it in that way so you

741
00:27:26,789 --> 00:27:31,230
know to say well you know this will save

742
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,820
time for on the business side on the

743
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:35,429
revenue side so they can focus on

744
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:38,389
revenue because I think if they can just

745
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:40,799
say yeah the admin always deals with it

746
00:27:38,389 --> 00:27:41,908
maybe that's a point you know maybe

747
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,519
there's a maybe there's a manual

748
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:47,399
workaround or a manual process that that

749
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:49,049
they should consider instead right so so

750
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:53,070
if it really isn't delivering ROI to

751
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:56,070
them then maybe maybe it maybe they're

752
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:58,980
right maybe it doesn't but there's

753
00:27:56,070 --> 00:28:01,559
probably a way that it could deliver ROI

754
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,909
if you think of it if you pitch it in

755
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:06,170
the right way if you think about you

756
00:28:02,909 --> 00:28:11,820
know whose time that couldn't save yeah

757
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:14,340
first ingredient this man was a security

758
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,600
product include excelling in sheriff I

759
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:18,240
mean physically we in the business

760
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,860
efficiency I said it is coming between

761
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,460
security professionals and business

762
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:25,530
professionals but most of the time the

763
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:29,250
person in charge of managing risk is

764
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:31,040
therefore essential the CFO is to top

765
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:34,350
the response I mean he does care about

766
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:37,530
producing exports but you can add a body

767
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:40,379
shell or for the reason we cannot be

768
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:42,600
sure it is to buy products such as my

769
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:46,980
only thing is that we have to motivate

770
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:50,070
that you know I then invited the risk of

771
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:52,380
the organization and then reducing the

772
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:54,770
risk for the quantification is really

773
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,770
garden

774
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:27,149
okay so the question is about ROI and

775
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:28,470
what's uh what's it what's a good way to

776
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:29,970
calculate it because it's very difficult

777
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:34,320
there's not there don't seem to be a lot

778
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:36,150
of good models for doing that I agree

779
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,040
with you it's a that's it's a really

780
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:40,200
hard problem because a lot of security

781
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:43,879
is unquantifiable at saying yeah we had

782
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,880
nothing happen and that's great

783
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:52,980
III did a podcast you know yeah along a

784
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:54,930
while ago with wit sir about the ROI of

785
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:56,400
security and so yeah but it's mainly

786
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:58,500
just about you know using a net present

787
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,150
value you know equation and kind of

788
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,790
coming up with a risk estimate so the

789
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:04,200
five million in this slide was basically

790
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:05,639
meant to convey like that's what they

791
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,900
lost in the less incident right if you

792
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,980
have something you could point to where

793
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,050
you could say like this happened in the

794
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,940
past and it cost X you could say well

795
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:13,379
that's a decent baseline or you could

796
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,790
say well okay this happened to some

797
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:17,130
other company and they lost you know

798
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:18,659
let's say they look like 450 million

799
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,860
dollars right you know so you could say

800
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:22,530
you could say well that's like a decent

801
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:24,169
proxy for a worst-case scenario and then

802
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:26,160
you but then you're looking at like

803
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:28,830
chance of it happening right what's the

804
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:30,360
likelihood probably pretty low so when

805
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:34,439
you actually multiply out your ROI

806
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:35,790
calculation it may not work out for the

807
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,930
business because they may say well you

808
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,639
know I could have this catastrophic

809
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:42,120
outcome but you know the the likelihood

810
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,440
is pretty low and so security is weird

811
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,239
cuz it may look like you shouldn't make

812
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,000
the investment but if the worst-case

813
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:50,370
scenario happens you're out of business

814
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,540
maybe you should so it's it's it's

815
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:53,850
almost like there's that there's a

816
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:56,310
factor that I think that doesn't get

817
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:57,899
included in most ROI equations which is

818
00:30:56,310 --> 00:31:00,659
sort of like the disaster factor right

819
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:03,570
so what is it lightly it's sort of like

820
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:05,100
what is the expected loss what's the

821
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:11,470
likelihood of it happening

822
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:12,790
but what's the existence risk if it

823
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:14,740
happens right you know it's almost like

824
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:16,840
there's this other thing going on like

825
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:19,030
if there is a risk to the existence of

826
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,470
the business how would you calculate

827
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:21,910
that and should it be an additional

828
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:23,380
factor that you take into account I

829
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:40,059
don't know of a lot of good models for

830
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:42,670
it right I agree so especially the CFO I

831
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:44,080
think probably doesn't know IQ risk that

832
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:46,480
well either way I think it's another

833
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,520
challenge if there's a chief risk

834
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,710
officer that's probably a better bet

835
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,750
they they may report to the CFO or they

836
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:56,740
or they may report to it to someone else

837
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:58,420
in the organization but the CFO I think

838
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:01,720
tends to focus a lot on financial risk

839
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:06,090
so it's it's hard to distill security

840
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:06,090
down to that yeah

841
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:24,760
do you mean cyber cyber risk insurance

842
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:27,690
or any insurance okay yeah yeah I all I

843
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:29,620
could say to you is it's a tough problem

844
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:31,450
as far as I guess help without any

845
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:33,219
answer so far in terms of how you

846
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:36,430
calculate ROI I would say look at past

847
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:39,550
incidents look at can you find a proxy

848
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:41,800
for a worst-case scenario and then try

849
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:44,020
to talk about gain and not loss right

850
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:46,300
just like what could they gain from

851
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:48,910
doing this right because I I think it's

852
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:51,190
a better selves and then trying to say

853
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:54,280
okay you know we're gonna lose like you

854
00:32:51,190 --> 00:33:01,950
know this much less but what what will

855
00:32:54,280 --> 00:33:01,950
we also gain by doing it yeah

856
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:48,809
they expect the cars not gonna catch on

857
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:48,809
fire in the middle of the road

858
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:19,849
yeah III agree and I also think beyond

859
00:34:17,329 --> 00:34:20,960
Fear Factor you could say time save you

860
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:23,119
could say you know if someone's gonna

861
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,800
save a hundred hours that they that

862
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,139
they're not spending dealing with this

863
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,200
problem a hundred hours of their time is

864
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:31,819
worth X so so so that's a game you know

865
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:33,888
you can sort of point to us as sort of a

866
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:41,659
concrete gain that goes into your ROI as

867
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:43,490
well absolutely right I mean security is

868
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:46,339
traditionally um I mean it's always

869
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:47,868
viewed as a cost center so any I think

870
00:34:46,339 --> 00:34:50,690
anything we can do to move it off of

871
00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:52,550
that platform and just and try to try to

872
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:54,109
talk more about you know the gains could

873
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:57,730
balance helped to balance that out but

874
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:57,730
but you're right it has costs of course

875
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:10,950
sometimes you don't get the investment

876
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,950
till after something happen
