1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:04,450
hold onto your hats this is a little

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:07,299
about me it's everything that gentleman

3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:09,070
just said awesome so who cares if I can

4
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:11,200
hack your toaster I mean this is really

5
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,639
the crux of the issue with this talk and

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,070
we've talked about this for a long time

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,960
why it's always a toaster I'll never

8
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,550
truly know I mean I think it was a

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,080
toaster in the internet of things like

10
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,510
I'm usually standing near my toaster

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,400
when it's making toast I really don't

12
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,860
need my smartphone to connect to the

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,590
cloud to talk to my toaster although I

14
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:32,320
probably still buy one but who cares

15
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:35,109
right what's the risk to all of us this

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,120
is the typical Michel Sant arcane yellow

17
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:40,659
question he asks on the show now who

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,699
cares why do we care I this is like my

19
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:44,530
stick figure diagram of the Internet of

20
00:00:42,699 --> 00:00:46,358
Things I borrowed a little bit from the

21
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,159
very code research that was released in

22
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:50,409
the past couple of months that talks

23
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,760
about the Internet of Things and if you

24
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:54,219
look at the architecture for the

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,809
Internet of Things we have that big box

26
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:57,489
up there that's supposed to be a cloud

27
00:00:55,809 --> 00:00:59,799
but it really just came out to be a box

28
00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:03,788
and we've got all kinds of applications

29
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:06,340
inside of the cloud and the device

30
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:08,740
things are talking to one API sometimes

31
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,780
over wireless there's your mobile phone

32
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,970
thing which is talking to a mobile API

33
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,890
which has an app that you're using on

34
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:17,200
the phone and then you have this browser

35
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:19,120
thing that you can access the the cloud

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,040
as well so we've got this merger of

37
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:26,620
cloud of Internet of Things devices

38
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,180
wireless mobile applications so all of

39
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,740
this technology coming together that

40
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,570
makes up the Internet of Things

41
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,399
now everyone who's seeing this room

42
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,289
knows penetration testing vulnerability

43
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,970
assessments is like wow look at all the

44
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:39,160
different attack points right this is

45
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:41,050
wireless over here this API is over here

46
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,570
there's mobile applications tons and

47
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:45,910
tons of attack points this talk will

48
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,589
focus on the device thing I hate to kind

49
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:50,080
of disappoint you right the very code

50
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:52,120
research touches on that but this will

51
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,920
focus sheerly on the device thing that's

52
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,360
been my area of research and we've got a

53
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,740
new open source project which I'll give

54
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,440
you a sneak preview which isn't quite

55
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:02,470
published yet Nick raise your hand

56
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,270
Nick yeah there's Nick Nick was the wall

57
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:07,630
talked about our roles in the project

58
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:09,160
which will come up towards the end ok so

59
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,508
since we're going to focus on the device

60
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,629
thing why

61
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:15,279
is an embedded device I've searched high

62
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:17,530
and low for years and years to find the

63
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,110
right definition for what is an embedded

64
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:22,360
device that is an embedded system that

65
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:25,180
is a special-purpose system which the

66
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,099
computer is completely encapsulated by

67
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,690
the device it controls when you walk up

68
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:30,849
to your washer and dryer right you're

69
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,650
not breaking out your flip up monitor

70
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:34,268
your mouse and keyboard and going on the

71
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:37,420
command prompt well I mean some of us

72
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:40,000
probably are but typically you want to

73
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:42,309
wash your clothes ok well some of us

74
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,290
maybe we'll wash our clothes but that's

75
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,299
the function of the device is to wash

76
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,739
clothes it's asking you questions like

77
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:50,620
what do you want your water temperature

78
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:52,599
to be do you want steam yeah I got I got

79
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,340
a washer and dryer with steam and I had

80
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:56,349
to do like the plumbing for it so every

81
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,909
time I use I'm like yes I want steam it

82
00:02:56,349 --> 00:03:00,040
was a pain in the ass to set up I want

83
00:02:57,909 --> 00:03:02,560
steam that's the function of the device

84
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,569
not to be a computer but to allow you to

85
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,579
wash clothes and therefore that is the

86
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:10,599
premise for this talk in the research

87
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:13,659
that we've done ok so does anyone know

88
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:15,399
what the relationship is between all

89
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:18,790
these devices what do all of these

90
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:21,099
devices have in common and he will shout

91
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:23,168
it out like he here they're all

92
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:27,698
vulnerable they're all wireless probably

93
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:32,379
both true other than that no they're all

94
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:34,449
my house so yeah I've got to nest the

95
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:38,739
Sonos in my new thing does anyone know

96
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:40,269
what sky drop is oh so from my phone you

97
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:42,879
have to come simulator and I can show

98
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:45,489
you my app for controlling my sprinkler

99
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,530
system because everybody's right you

100
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:49,959
need this you need to know how much

101
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:52,120
water is being pers owned you got to be

102
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:55,120
able to control the water temperature

103
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,919
and how much it sprays according to

104
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,730
slope and connect to the internet a

105
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:02,889
partner right I think it's cool ok but

106
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,409
these are consumer embedded mobile cloud

107
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:07,449
things so there's a mobile application

108
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:10,030
there's a cloud application and there's

109
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:11,739
an embedded device and slowly these

110
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,720
things are creeping into your homes now

111
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:15,819
my home may be more than some of you

112
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:20,620
maybe not maybe you've got more devices

113
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:22,029
at home but as things die my sprinkler

114
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,860
system

115
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:27,799
controller system died I needed a new

116
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,930
one I replaced it with this consumer

117
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,850
embedded mobile cloud thing that

118
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:35,480
obviously could potentially have

119
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:37,310
vulnerabilities when I look at so these

120
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:41,360
devices will slowly creep into your home

121
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:43,700
smart things nest smoke detectors Sonos

122
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,190
and these things linked together so I

123
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:49,010
can link my smart things to my Sonos so

124
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,780
there can be audible alerts in fact I

125
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,789
should I really want to tie it to like

126
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,619
your sprinkler systems are running like

127
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:58,940
that'd be awesome so cool

128
00:04:54,620 --> 00:05:01,490
anyway so these are consumer embedded

129
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,740
things so these don't have a mobile or

130
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,600
cloud application component component to

131
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,760
them these are just an embedded

132
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,190
typically Linux system that sits on your

133
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,210
network in your home and there's a

134
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:14,719
difference

135
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:16,159
security vise we we talk about cameras

136
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,810
inside the house and we'll talk about

137
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,430
that we're gonna play a game it's going

138
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:23,120
to be a lot of fun does anyone watch CSI

139
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:26,780
cyber anyone anyone want to admit to

140
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,640
watching CSI cyber no I'm the only one

141
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,630
come on all right well if you do and you

142
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,870
just don't want to admit it you'll have

143
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:34,460
an advantage of the game so these are

144
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:38,150
consumer embedded things right they run

145
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:40,820
Linux this is the 2013 gift to my wife

146
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:42,320
for Christmas this is the 2014 gift to

147
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,090
my wife for Christmas which is a scale

148
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,030
because it goes with the church she

149
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:49,940
asked for it I'm still happily married

150
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:51,679
but anyway now what's interesting the

151
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,360
takeaway from this slide you've got all

152
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,220
these devices right potentially

153
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,960
vulnerable and in the middle they all

154
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,600
connect through your wireless router and

155
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,409
wireless routers are like the epitome of

156
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,610
a vulnerable embedded system and so I

157
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,700
don't have a d-link

158
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:09,590
at my house only for testing purposes

159
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,180
right it doesn't run my house but

160
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,219
everything connects through it and

161
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,070
that's typically in your house your most

162
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:17,750
vulnerable device of every single one of

163
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,969
our home so I thought that was kind of

164
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:22,840
scary okay now consumer things I want

165
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:25,430
you need a mattress that let you control

166
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,710
temperature on his and her side of the

167
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:29,420
bed and monitors your sleep habits

168
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:31,549
because you have to know if you're

169
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,650
getting a restless night's sleep and the

170
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:36,800
alarm clock and it waits until you're at

171
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:38,870
the optimum sleep pattern mode to wake

172
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,640
you up so you don't wake up groggy oh my

173
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:42,800
guy how did what how do I live without

174
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:45,050
one right now I don't know how you can

175
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,090
pre-order them which I'm totally going

176
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,220
to do you know door locks your crock-pot

177
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:51,770
your toilet I really want the Wi-Fi

178
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,990
toilet so I can connect it to Twitter so

179
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:57,469
that everyone knows what's happening in

180
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:59,060
my life it turns out those toilets are

181
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:02,780
really expensive although their air

182
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:05,360
dryer warm water it's wonderful I want

183
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:07,219
one okay so now I think this is really

184
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,130
cool this is a nest thermostat that

185
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:12,470
someone has ripped apart and attached

186
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:14,060
all things to in hacked it I don't want

187
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,380
to take away from the person's research

188
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,990
or this type of research I think it's

189
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:20,480
awesome but if someone is going to break

190
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:22,010
into your home along the lines of how

191
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,900
much do you care if someone's going to

192
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:25,760
break into your home and they're going

193
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,169
to connect stuff to your thermostat to

194
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,060
change the temperature and hack your

195
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:30,140
thermostat more than likely you're just

196
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:33,770
going to snuff you out with your own

197
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:35,479
pillow so on the scale of risk like we

198
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:38,299
heard from the previous talk not a big

199
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:40,580
deal to me okay why should you tacky

200
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:47,150
then attack embedded systems why are

201
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:49,750
these the targets of attackers so when

202
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:52,669
did people start caring about security

203
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:54,620
anyone all right let me all right let me

204
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:57,080
ask you a question first how many of you

205
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,960
in this audience are tech support for

206
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:02,060
your friends and family I can see the

207
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,380
cursing under your breath I saw it on

208
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,530
all of you

209
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:08,719
so when did they start calling you about

210
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:12,409
security problems what was the trigger

211
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:17,090
what happened they haven't yet wow

212
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:20,800
that's really okay so your family's part

213
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,799
of a big botnet that's cool

214
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:27,909
what's that yeah they got hacked but

215
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,780
what couldn't they do what did it

216
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:31,240
present yeah

217
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:33,490
I can't browse porn anymore this is

218
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,349
important this is why the internet

219
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:38,019
existed now I can't because I've got

220
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:41,440
this virus and I need security right

221
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:43,599
it was pop-ups that that allowed you to

222
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,709
oh there was a transition on that side

223
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,500
did you see that that was really cool

224
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:49,209
look at that so there was pop-ups right

225
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,670
the whole screen is full of pop-ups I

226
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:53,229
have to call my friend the computer guy

227
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,029
my family or the computer guys to get

228
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:56,860
rid of these I care about security now

229
00:08:55,029 --> 00:08:59,680
because I can't use the device that's

230
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:02,170
impeding on my ability to watch to use

231
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,939
the device and that's what I think

232
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:06,370
people will start caring about security

233
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,750
the reason that no one cares about their

234
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,209
wireless router there's are a lot of

235
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:12,040
reasons is you can't see it there's no

236
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:13,000
interface to it there's no monitor mouse

237
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,279
or keyboard on it

238
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,200
when ads though start coming up on your

239
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,480
Smart TV does anyone know what movie

240
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,950
that's from I know it's hard to see

241
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,570
idiocracy thank you the last time I gave

242
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,079
this presentation no one had seen that

243
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,870
movie

244
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:27,819
so you gotta go see that movie and the

245
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:31,300
most popular show in the movie idiocracy

246
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:33,100
is can you read it oh my balls right and

247
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,469
the hell's all the ads around if your TV

248
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,779
look like that you would start to care

249
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,760
about the security of your devices and

250
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:42,420
go well when I buy that new Samsung TV

251
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,430
how do I keep the firmware up-to-date

252
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,660
privacy a lot of these devices the one

253
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:49,149
I'd like to use the refrigerator right

254
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:51,459
has a camera on the inside so that when

255
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:54,040
you're at the supermarket you can go on

256
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:56,170
your smartphone and see what's in your

257
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,930
refrigerator so that you know what to

258
00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:01,479
buy again how do we live with all these

259
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:04,180
devices I don't know somehow we get

260
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,339
through and make it through the day but

261
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,540
it has privacy concerns when do you go

262
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,010
to your frigerator open the door

263
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,689
whatever someone hacks your refrigerator

264
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:12,010
now they can see you in your underwear

265
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:14,320
3:00 in the morning

266
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:17,140
reaching for the ice cream that's a

267
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,730
privacy violation but even more so some

268
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:21,160
have speculated that with these new

269
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:23,320
smart refrigerators some people can

270
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,640
extrapolate the information based on

271
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,470
what ingredients are in your

272
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,470
refrigerator health problems you may

273
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:31,029
have and it's a health privacy violation

274
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,890
so I think there are privacy concerns

275
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:35,980
that people are going to have start

276
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:37,390
the baby monitor scenario is a privacy

277
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,730
concern as well people hacking into

278
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:41,590
while hacking I think it's just a weak

279
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:43,000
or default password on those routers and

280
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:45,970
we are on those cameras and we just call

281
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,390
it hacking attackers care they're

282
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:50,950
building huge botnets based on embedded

283
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:52,870
systems this is happening more and more

284
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,970
I used to talk about this theoretically

285
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:58,240
this happens in practice the lizard

286
00:10:54,970 --> 00:11:01,510
squad BOTS botnet took down Krebs on

287
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,520
security the moon worm compromised

288
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:05,140
hundreds and hundreds of thousands of

289
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:09,310
Linksys routers or some ridiculous

290
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:11,199
number of Linksys routers and while the

291
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:12,880
press will say well they're using it to

292
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,670
mine bitcoins and how stupid is that

293
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,500
again go back to there's no monitor

294
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:19,689
mouse or keyboard on your embedded

295
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,520
systems at home so when I put malware on

296
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:23,440
it which by the way there is no

297
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,930
antivirus software in these systems and

298
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,060
malware that's developed for MIPS isn't

299
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:29,680
going to have a signature so there's

300
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,750
really no way to detect it I think it's

301
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,219
super smart to put a botnet on these

302
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:35,350
systems because you can fly under the

303
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:37,930
radar and it lasts for a much longer

304
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:39,760
period of time that was the lizard squad

305
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:42,040
boss that sorry I'm going fast to get to

306
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,990
the devil part industrial control

307
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,939
systems also have these vulnerabilities

308
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,690
and what you're going to see as I go

309
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,030
through some of these different

310
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:51,840
categories the vulnerabilities that

311
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:54,459
exist on all of these systems are

312
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,860
persist throughout the different use

313
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:59,290
cases whether it's industrial control

314
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:01,270
systems and why do we care about SCADA

315
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,860
well then someone could blow up a

316
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,720
nuclear power station someone can take

317
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,540
down the power there are a lot of

318
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,240
reasons why it's really bad okay but the

319
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:13,449
same systems that power the building

320
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,520
entry HVAC lighting for your

321
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:17,410
organization's have the same caliber of

322
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,569
vulnerabilities default passwords weak

323
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:22,209
passwords buffer overflows web

324
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:24,640
application vulnerabilities all of those

325
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:27,340
systems have a similar set of

326
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:30,220
vulnerabilities medical devices my good

327
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:32,200
friend Billy Rios gave a talk of years

328
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:35,290
ago and still talks about it this day

329
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:37,630
where he analyzed the security and they

330
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:39,910
says rate in the article hard-coded

331
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:41,650
password vulnerabilities in medical

332
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:44,150
devices these are the same devices we've

333
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:46,400
joked about on dealing systems for years

334
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:48,560
Billy reels get sick last year ends up

335
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,390
in a hospital looks up he's connected to

336
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,130
the same device he did the research on

337
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:54,110
that had a pat hard-coded password

338
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:55,970
vulnerability the vendor still hasn't

339
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:58,490
fixed the issue was Billy's choice

340
00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:00,290
disconnect and die or stay plugged into

341
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:03,920
the vulnerable system how's that for a

342
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:06,110
risk decision okay so who wants to play

343
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,569
really no one wants to admit to watching

344
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:12,140
CSI cyber I think that's hilarious

345
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:15,620
come on it's it's gotten it's gotten

346
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,880
better No okay all right maybe not okay

347
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:19,040
but here's we're gonna play a game I'm

348
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,410
gonna put up a scenario from the show

349
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,870
that has to do with embedded device

350
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:27,980
security you're gonna tell me if that

351
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:30,140
cyber or reality okay now that there's

352
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:32,660
no there's no prizes for the K it's just

353
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:35,480
a fun game oh well maybe I never Munt

354
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:37,520
there's no prizes okay now I did I did

355
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,020
caption some of these images so now some

356
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,569
of you remember earlier on in the season

357
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,680
there was the roller-coaster hack does

358
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:45,680
that anyone know what happened with the

359
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:47,739
roller-coaster hack no no another so

360
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:52,579
someone broken in the control room

361
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:54,920
installed a custom SCADA device that

362
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:56,570
they custom-made with Bluetooth on it so

363
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,430
that they could disable all the safety

364
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:01,670
mechanisms so that the roller-coaster

365
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:08,089
would crash now does anyone think that

366
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:11,000
is cyber or reality probably kind of

367
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:12,830
split okay so I'm saying cyber because

368
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,420
the attack is way easier than that

369
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:16,250
and this is my reasoning why instance is

370
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,319
my presentation I get to decide whether

371
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:20,029
it's cyber reality and I'm saying it's

372
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,589
cyber because you don't need to

373
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:23,360
fabricate a board and put a Bluetooth

374
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:25,640
chip on it you just need to take a USB

375
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,839
thumb drive and put malware on it okay

376
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,060
if you need connectivity you're probably

377
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:31,820
going to put a 3G or 4G modem on the

378
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:34,339
system to do that way easier than going

379
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:36,560
to someone having them fabricate a board

380
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:37,850
which leaves evidence which gets traced

381
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,199
back which makes for great television

382
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:45,709
but not reality okay this is my favorite

383
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:48,650
one the printers were hacked and set

384
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:51,229
fire to remotely because custom firmware

385
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:52,390
was uploaded to the printer which

386
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:57,930
allowed the heat

387
00:14:52,390 --> 00:15:01,740
to overheat and catch fire reality

388
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:04,540
you're all wrong a cyber physical

389
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:06,040
mechanisms exist inside a printer see

390
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:09,370
now you're all well I don't know watch

391
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,990
the inside fiber physical mechanisms

392
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:12,730
exist inside the printer to prevent that

393
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:14,590
from happening I'm sure there are you

394
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:16,240
could find a model or two where that's

395
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:18,550
possible certainly not on a widespread

396
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,040
basis also printer firmware is

397
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:23,500
extraordinarily horrible so horrible

398
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,880
it's even difficult to like modify and

399
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:29,410
upload your own it's absolutely

400
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:32,980
atrocious to work with also when they

401
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:36,610
were on the show he the guy on the show

402
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,840
that was in Dawson's Creek that I just I

403
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:40,150
can't think of a matter than the guy

404
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:42,970
from Dawson's Creek and he goes in and

405
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:46,030
he's an FBI agent now and he goes in and

406
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:48,340
he opens up the melted printer right and

407
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:50,500
he pulls out the board and then he takes

408
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:52,750
his tweezers and he pulls the chip off

409
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,340
and then he's like this is the firmware

410
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,440
chip because he just knew that because

411
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:58,780
he was on Dawson's Creek and then he

412
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,640
puts it in his reader and sends the

413
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:02,020
firmware off now what there's a lot of

414
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,300
things wrong with that one of the most

415
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:05,829
glaring things in the printer was on

416
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,439
fire

417
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:10,180
the second thing is there's a thing

418
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,709
called solder and that's usually what we

419
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:15,430
do to firmware tips when we put them on

420
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:18,670
the board anyway okay

421
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:21,519
Wi-Fi das at 30,000 feet okay

422
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:23,380
juice jacking was used to install mobile

423
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,079
malware on cell phones that when they

424
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:32,800
got on certain flights it took the Wi-Fi

425
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:34,420
out cyber or reality you can only pick

426
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,680
one I think I hear people saying both

427
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,750
that's not fair yeah it's the big one

428
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:43,089
and then you have to stick with it cyber

429
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:44,470
or reality okay that's reality right I

430
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:46,300
think that's totally plausible

431
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,800
I could put devices juice jacks systems

432
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,199
I could put something on the phones that

433
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,810
would send a denial of service attack to

434
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,910
the Wi-Fi disassociate people I think

435
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:57,130
that's plausible

436
00:16:54,910 --> 00:17:02,279
so hacking the grid and causing a

437
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:05,349
large-scale power outage cyber or

438
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:07,959
reality yeah

439
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:09,909
reality right I mean the outage of 2003

440
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:11,679
is interesting it wasn't necessarily a

441
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:13,360
half but it was caused by a software bug

442
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,429
I think if that can occur we certainly

443
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,319
have seen other examples of another

444
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:22,480
thing that made for good television was

445
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:24,579
it was a targeted power outage where

446
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,050
they allowed them to break into a safe

447
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:27,790
they had millions and millions of

448
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:29,379
dollars of jewelry but in the middle

449
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:31,659
there was a laptop with a USB thumb

450
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:34,030
drive that had the code to get to their

451
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,559
Bitcoin account and that that's all they

452
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:37,030
stole laughs that was really what

453
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:37,210
happened on the show I'm not making that

454
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:42,399
up

455
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:44,169
okay so hacking baby monitors so does

456
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,270
anyone know that the young gentleman

457
00:17:44,169 --> 00:17:48,850
here that's always dressed nicely he

458
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:51,340
he's asking how did Dave Kennedy win for

459
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:53,230
Best Dressed hacker and not me and then

460
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:56,800
the girl here saying maybe because you

461
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:58,600
have no idea how to hack so but yeah

462
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:02,309
someone is watching the baby monitors

463
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:04,270
and then stealing children cyber reality

464
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:07,570
reality yeah we've all seen the news

465
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:09,250
article right I mean hack again probably

466
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:13,240
weak or default username and password

467
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:16,540
but certainly that one is reality okay

468
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:19,510
so why are embedded systems so

469
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:21,790
vulnerable how did we get to this place

470
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:23,830
whereas mike Mari and I think he said

471
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:25,210
something else - Mike's not here I stole

472
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:27,460
this from Mike who stole it from someone

473
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:29,980
else I give my credit for it though but

474
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:32,170
I think it best describes why embedded

475
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:34,420
devices are so vulnerable let's design

476
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:37,480
something okay if we were designed

477
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:38,980
something let's say a hammer there's two

478
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,600
things we'd want to take into

479
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,880
consideration when designing a hammer

480
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,830
does it work for its intended use pounds

481
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,850
nails in removes nails

482
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:50,230
does it work reliably right the head

483
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:52,389
doesn't fly off when I bring the hammer

484
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:54,730
back what are we not taking into

485
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:58,920
consideration when we're designing our

486
00:18:54,730 --> 00:19:02,650
source conference Boston branded hammer

487
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:06,250
not well we'll get there but what are we

488
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:08,280
not designing for misuse what are some

489
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:10,900
examples of misuse with a hammer

490
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:13,030
yes hitting someone else on the head we

491
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,440
don't design our hammer to prevent you

492
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:16,870
from hitting someone else over the head

493
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,910
with it it's the same thing when we

494
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:21,010
design invented systems we designed them

495
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:23,410
to be to be able to control my sprinkler

496
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:25,270
system from my phone but we don't design

497
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:27,010
them to prevent the third party

498
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:29,710
malicious actor from taking over my

499
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:32,500
sprinkler system which I mean the worst

500
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:34,540
they could do is over water my grass I

501
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,570
guess so maybe that was a bad example

502
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:39,670
anyway but the point is that our hammers

503
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,530
now are interconnected they have things

504
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:44,170
like Wi-Fi Bluetooth we have to take

505
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:45,550
into account the malicious third party

506
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:47,290
attacker there's a whole separate

507
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:50,020
discussion on the economics of embedded

508
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:54,240
systems that impact the security as well

509
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:57,820
but the hammer story is way more fun so

510
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:01,060
ok very quickly I want to look at how

511
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:03,639
some of these vulnerabilities exist in

512
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,419
some of these systems ok I'm going to

513
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,610
tell a story

514
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:10,030
this is called inside Joel's back door

515
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:12,610
and that why are you laughing that's not

516
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:15,039
that's not supposed to be funny yet

517
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:17,799
it's called that for a perfectly good

518
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,090
reason okay first the person that found

519
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:21,908
the vulnerability is one of my heroes

520
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:24,789
Craig Hafner outstanding invented device

521
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:27,159
affirmative reverse engineer also

522
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:28,990
zachary cutlip their colleagues at

523
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,370
tactical network solutions very

524
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:32,799
brilliant people doing research in the

525
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:33,969
field craig wrote didn't walk anyone use

526
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,200
been walked for reverse engineering

527
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:38,230
firmware yeah

528
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,240
Craig's the offer so this story is going

529
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:41,860
to exemplify some of the problems that

530
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,120
we've seen in summer firmware that we've

531
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,500
already established and I hope you're

532
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,809
all on board with the fact that these

533
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,549
problems exist in all kinds of embedded

534
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:50,918
systems right default passwords web

535
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:53,379
application vulnerabilities buffer

536
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:55,659
overflows protocol weaknesses so the

537
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,100
this story kind of exemplify some of

538
00:20:55,659 --> 00:20:59,260
them now these vulnerabilities are old

539
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:01,269
they're not as old as my good friend

540
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,519
Jack that's I have to make fun of Jack

541
00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:05,919
at least once in every presentation

542
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:07,779
check okay October 2013

543
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,090
Craig Hefner releases details about a

544
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:12,940
backdoor affecting d-link there are 100

545
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:14,918
routers revision n that's important the

546
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:17,440
reason I spend time explaining all of

547
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:20,440
that is because if you try to go by a

548
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,950
d-link 100 revision a can't find it you

549
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:25,299
can only find the later revisions it's

550
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,789
extremely difficult to find that

551
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:30,279
original router so keep that in the back

552
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:33,460
of your head reverse engineering the

553
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:36,130
authentication it turns out that when he

554
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,870
looked at how it was being authenticated

555
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:39,610
to the webserver he's at all it goes

556
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:42,459
over this branch and it checks this

557
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:44,490
string and if that string is in the user

558
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:47,919
agent then authentication is successful

559
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:51,190
it's wait a minute all I have to do is

560
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:53,080
set my user agent string to that really

561
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:55,090
long gobbledygook string well what is

562
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:58,090
that gobbledygook string well it turns

563
00:21:55,090 --> 00:22:01,299
out if you turn it around it says edit

564
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:03,519
by 0 480 tool Joel backdoor hence now

565
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:06,279
you can laugh hence the name of the

566
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:07,899
story inside Joel backdoor no personal

567
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:10,570
password required we never really found

568
00:22:07,899 --> 00:22:13,239
out who Joel was I think he was a

569
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:14,678
Taiwanese researcher working for alpha

570
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,409
networks and I'll explain a little about

571
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:20,200
why that is so why did you'll do this

572
00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:21,820
why did you all have this need to be

573
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,920
authenticated to the web server well

574
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:25,840
there are other processes on the router

575
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,220
that need to access the configuration

576
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,290
and change configuration of the router

577
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,090
the webserver is the perfect mechanism

578
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:32,590
to change configuration on the router

579
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:34,600
it's got all the necessary components

580
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:37,570
the problem is it is a username and a

581
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:40,929
password which the user can change so by

582
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:43,870
introducing this nice handy feature that

583
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:45,910
I'm sure a Joel called it they were he

584
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:47,169
was able to write programs to access and

585
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:49,030
change the configuration of the router

586
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:52,270
without knowing what the user said to

587
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:55,240
username and password - bad idea Joel

588
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:57,190
dad Joel but the his story gets deeper

589
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,050
the Russians found it first this

590
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:00,850
particular firmware distribution was

591
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:02,950
used on several different model routers

592
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:05,590
including ones used in Russia that were

593
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:08,590
given up to ISPs and the Russians being

594
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:10,510
in Russian had vodka and caviar and

595
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:12,310
decided to reverse engineer firmware and

596
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:14,590
when they did that that's a really bad

597
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:17,950
stereotype when they did that they came

598
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:19,570
across that string and said tried to use

599
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:21,760
it as the town that password after that

600
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:23,020
the forum stops we don't know if they

601
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,290
used it to go try and take over the

602
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:27,610
world or if they use it and then stop

603
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:30,370
talking about it we don't know but we do

604
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:31,870
know the Russians found it first we also

605
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:33,760
know it's very easy to exploit write

606
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:35,830
this w get command center user agent

607
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:41,950
string allows for essentially

608
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:43,750
authentication bypass but no one exposes

609
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:46,900
their web management interface to the

610
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:48,670
internet right all but showed it you

611
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,860
know what I think show Dan can tell us

612
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:53,290
that and look yes I haven't checked very

613
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:55,330
recently but there are still instances

614
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:58,810
of this firmware because the I know

615
00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:03,040
because the string is from alpha

616
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:05,139
networks is in the string the T HTTP

617
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:10,180
alpha networks which was a fork spin-off

618
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:12,940
of D link and that's that's what they

619
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:15,010
use to build the firmware for so there

620
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:19,360
are buffer overflows in this firmware as

621
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:20,920
well now inside of the the buffer

622
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,270
overflows now Craig kind of like just

623
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,650
put a link to paste pin it was like oh

624
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,730
yeah I understand this vulnerability in

625
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:25,930
the user agent by the way there's a

626
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,940
buffer overflow here's the link to my

627
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:30,010
paste bin it was like one line in the

628
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,630
bottom of thing so you're limited to 200

629
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:34,360
bytes of shelf shellcode

630
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:35,500
Zachery cutlip built some shell code

631
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,750
that fits in one hundred eighty four

632
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:41,740
bytes 284 carry that

633
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:44,490
I think that fits one of the t-mobile

634
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:46,870
routers had both private and public

635
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:48,580
certificates in the firmware if it's in

636
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:50,260
the firmware its installed in every

637
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:53,530
router which means if a router has the

638
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:55,240
same key okay that's bad but these

639
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:58,960
conditions again can exist on all these

640
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:01,630
other systems but they do okay so what

641
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:06,640
do we do about it I'll let that image

642
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:08,980
sink in yeah that's that's not what we

643
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,740
want to do about it okay no one wants to

644
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:15,040
see that so I came up with the ten most

645
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:17,740
wanted list of this is really

646
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:19,810
recommendations for us to hold our

647
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,520
vendors to and recommendations for

648
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:23,710
vendors to hold their own software to

649
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,990
because really where the problem starts

650
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:27,430
is when you get that firmware and you

651
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:29,050
realize all these vulnerabilities well

652
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:31,840
the problem starts with the people who

653
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:34,870
develop that firmware so firmware should

654
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,250
not create contain backdoors because

655
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:37,719
that's a known password that everyone

656
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:41,440
knows built into every instance

657
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:43,600
of the embedded system like rugged com

658
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,040
that builds a backdoor into every system

659
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,020
so we're going to randomize it it's

660
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:49,540
going to be based on the MAC address of

661
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:53,440
the system and that's how we're going to

662
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:54,909
derive the password okay that does can I

663
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,930
see the MAC address if I'm on the same

664
00:25:54,910 --> 00:26:00,520
network home network what yes okay that

665
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:01,810
default well that we credentials and

666
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,620
default credentials are two separate

667
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:07,750
things right we credentials are

668
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:10,209
backdoors are built in default

669
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:12,730
credentials are user facing put the same

670
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:15,070
on every system right admin admin to log

671
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:17,730
into any links just router earlier than

672
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:20,260
a certain firmware version that's bad

673
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:23,110
insecure remote management protocols a

674
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:25,690
lot of devices today are being

675
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:31,479
developing delivered with the management

676
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:32,830
protocol being HTTP or telnet which is

677
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,970
really bad usually people are laughing

678
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:35,770
when it says in this line let's be

679
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:37,210
really hard to read in the back yeah

680
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:39,820
it's really funny though you should look

681
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:41,500
at the slides online it's kind of

682
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:46,780
inappropriate you okay next slide so

683
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:48,850
open source drivers a lot of embedded

684
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:49,940
devices use the cheapest chips available

685
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:52,219
to

686
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:56,360
Wi-Fi for example and they will deliver

687
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:58,279
you a binary blob which is the not the

688
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,189
source code but an actual binary we in

689
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:03,200
order for you to move forward and

690
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:05,419
operate the device you have to bring

691
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:10,009
that driver along with you this is why

692
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:11,299
when like shellshock came out that you

693
00:27:10,009 --> 00:27:12,350
would say well some of these devices are

694
00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:14,000
going to be stuck on this version

695
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:17,178
forever that's one of the reasons why

696
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,259
binary bombs bad okay I'm going to try

697
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:20,360
and get to the demo really quick

698
00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:22,820
functions prone to overflow are really

699
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:25,070
bad these are some motivational posters

700
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:27,379
for your developers I respect myself

701
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:29,960
that's why I refuse to use a sprint app

702
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:31,309
all my friends are using stir coffee but

703
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,320
I'm not because I understand how

704
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:37,330
dangerous it is you feel free to use

705
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:39,678
those so encryption firmware encryption

706
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:41,750
should be there it should be make it

707
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,169
harder for people to reverse engineer we

708
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:48,169
should also sign firmware updates right

709
00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:50,720
this could potentially be prevented if

710
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:53,360
you could update your treadmill in a

711
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,029
nice easy to use fashion user-friendly

712
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,258
firmware updates number seven secure web

713
00:27:56,029 --> 00:28:00,320
frameworks will look at some web

714
00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:02,299
vulnerabilities in a second maintain

715
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,799
assert when people find vulnerabilities

716
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:07,129
and these systems don't tell them to go

717
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:10,129
away and secure protocols the moon worm

718
00:28:07,129 --> 00:28:15,740
run Linksys took advantage of a weakness

719
00:28:10,129 --> 00:28:17,750
in h l NP or the the home protocol that

720
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:21,529
allows you to share information really

721
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:24,610
really bad hn LP i think it is so secure

722
00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:28,340
protocols ok but this is the juicy part

723
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:30,139
it went fast over those i demanded more

724
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,759
i you know i had given that set of

725
00:28:30,139 --> 00:28:34,809
recommendations and things are still bad

726
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:38,509
so what I decided to do with Nick's help

727
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:39,769
is create a new version of open wrt s

728
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:40,940
the first time we've talked about this

729
00:28:39,769 --> 00:28:42,980
publicly

730
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,720
it's called intentionally vulnerable

731
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:47,029
wireless router I wanted to be very

732
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,299
clear that this is not something you run

733
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:52,580
in production we purposely removed the

734
00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:54,529
security controls from open wrt to

735
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:56,178
create a vulnerable firmware which

736
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:57,169
embodies all of those problems that I

737
00:28:56,179 --> 00:29:01,460
talked about before

738
00:28:57,169 --> 00:29:03,980
I was the chief insecurity architect and

739
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:07,399
Nik was the chief insecurity engineer so

740
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:11,390
it we had a lot of fun as you know open

741
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:14,779
wrt has a code name for each release in

742
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:16,789
that it's a mixed cocktail this is

743
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:19,130
called Bloody Mary because it's really

744
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:21,350
vulnerable and has to do with IV yeah

745
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:23,210
get it okay at the end they'll give you

746
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:25,580
my Bloody Mary recipe which has never

747
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:28,130
been released before either so why did

748
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,658
we do this right raise awareness in the

749
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:31,399
community we've got all these other web

750
00:29:29,659 --> 00:29:33,740
applications intentionally vulnerable on

751
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:35,989
purpose we've got Metasploit able we've

752
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:37,730
got the Metasploit framework we've got

753
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:39,169
all these great tools to tell you about

754
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:40,940
things that are vulnerable but nothing

755
00:29:39,169 --> 00:29:42,799
that exists specifically for firmware

756
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:46,520
and it goes back to that problem where I

757
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:47,899
can't find a d-link rev a I can't create

758
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,639
those vulnerabilities easily I'm either

759
00:29:47,899 --> 00:29:51,260
the platform to be able to do that and

760
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,299
that's what Nick created and what I

761
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,970
helped design is this platform where you

762
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:56,720
can start building in your own

763
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:59,539
vulnerabilities and using the ones that

764
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,190
we've built in to learn to show people

765
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:03,408
to demonstrate and raise awareness in

766
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:04,820
the community I'm going to show you

767
00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:08,000
three I'm going to try and show you

768
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:09,770
three vulnerabilities I just realized I

769
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,600
don't have the command injection string

770
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:13,220
handy because I'll have an internet

771
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,070
connection which is really gonna put a

772
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:19,610
damper on my demo but I'm going to show

773
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:21,289
you those in just a second so

774
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:25,699
authentication bypass command injection

775
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:27,620
and cross-site request forgery now tying

776
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:31,700
them together is kind of interesting we

777
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:34,010
talked about how well my router port

778
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,600
needs to be open to the world if I can

779
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:37,730
if you have cross-site request forgery

780
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,860
vulnerable on your router and I know the

781
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:42,649
static IP address of your router I can

782
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:44,178
open that for you if I have cross-site

783
00:30:42,649 --> 00:30:46,010
request forgery if I have authentication

784
00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:47,539
bypass then I can own your router and

785
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,679
put malware on it because from there I

786
00:30:47,539 --> 00:30:50,360
can take advantage of a command

787
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:51,740
injection and malware and this is just

788
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:55,760
the first round of vulnerabilities we've

789
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:57,350
built into this firmware okay

790
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,059
now I'll put that up after that's my

791
00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:01,000
bloody rip Mary recipe which is really

792
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:04,100
good now I really want one

793
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,380
does anyone have tomato juice and worse

794
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:10,219
this year pickle juice no okay

795
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:12,440
okay so this is if we haven't even

796
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:14,760
rebranded this part of it yet but this

797
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:17,880
is ivw or

798
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:20,399
I'm logged in through the land port

799
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,169
right now okay so we have a virtual

800
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,939
image that runs the qmu it actually

801
00:31:22,169 --> 00:31:26,429
gives you a win in a land port that's

802
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:28,559
accessible inside of your VM so I'm

803
00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:29,850
going to log in as admin all except I

804
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:33,360
wanted to show you something there first

805
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:36,480
so a lot of routers a lot of devices

806
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:39,449
will have the username and the passwords

807
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:42,210
like on the front page and so we've

808
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:44,279
replicated that so whatever you change

809
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:45,480
your root password to is on the front

810
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:48,210
page without requiring authentication

811
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,740
you may think that's silly I'll save you

812
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:51,059
a Google search there's been a string of

813
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,760
devices that had this exact same

814
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:55,289
vulnerability okay so now we've got that

815
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,480
other way I showed one vulnerability

816
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:59,100
where we are at this project I'm really

817
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,370
proud of ourselves right now because we

818
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:07,549
had one that was awesome okay whew okay

819
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:13,350
so I'm gonna log in as admin and then

820
00:32:07,549 --> 00:32:15,840
I'm gonna go to so right now if I this

821
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:17,730
is the way the LAN interface okay so

822
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,010
this IP address represents the external

823
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:21,929
win now you can see I can't get there

824
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:25,169
right I can't get to the LAN interface

825
00:32:21,929 --> 00:32:28,679
so we have an exploit that changes that

826
00:32:25,169 --> 00:32:30,990
so if I go to this CSRF now that I'm

827
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:33,389
logged in now I visited a page maybe

828
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:35,760
it's a forum on people asking questions

829
00:32:33,389 --> 00:32:39,389
about this particular device right is a

830
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:41,070
pause cam camera and I'm on their forum

831
00:32:39,389 --> 00:32:43,979
and I come across the sea surface ring

832
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:46,860
and when I click on it should add a

833
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:49,710
firewall rule save the page then when I

834
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:54,519
go back here now I can access from the

835
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:58,730
way yeah everyone clap by demo work yeah

836
00:32:54,519 --> 00:33:00,859
okay the nice part is we control these

837
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:02,690
exploits so we can make sure that they

838
00:33:00,859 --> 00:33:04,789
work in certain scenarios we can tweak

839
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:06,980
them we can extend them rather than

840
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:09,529
being stuck on whatever vulnerabilities

841
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:12,200
existed in some random firmware from

842
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:15,649
some random provider we can now control

843
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:18,049
these to be able to do testing okay I

844
00:33:15,649 --> 00:33:20,238
don't think I can do the authentication

845
00:33:18,049 --> 00:33:23,359
bypass because I forgot to bring the

846
00:33:20,239 --> 00:33:27,889
string but there is authentication

847
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:31,939
bypass on the Diagnostics page which

848
00:33:27,889 --> 00:33:34,820
also you can access without credentials

849
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:36,230
so we've kind of added that realm we the

850
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:38,389
developers of this firmware had

851
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:40,009
forgotten to put credentials around this

852
00:33:38,389 --> 00:33:42,889
particular page so you can hit the

853
00:33:40,009 --> 00:33:45,710
Diagnostics page without any passwords

854
00:33:42,889 --> 00:33:47,059
now it's also just a Diagnostics page

855
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,739
and they might do this on purpose right

856
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:52,629
why should I ask for username password

857
00:33:48,739 --> 00:33:56,509
if I can access the Diagnostics page

858
00:33:52,629 --> 00:34:00,709
this right here is vulnerable to command

859
00:33:56,509 --> 00:34:02,529
injection which I can't get to because I

860
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:05,419
forgot the string but anyway it is

861
00:34:02,529 --> 00:34:07,220
vulnerable to command injection and one

862
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:09,530
of the commands we have since it runs

863
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:11,780
netcat is a callback listener to a net

864
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:13,760
cat show so you can get shell on it so I

865
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:16,549
the important thing here is I wanted to

866
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,929
show two different scenarios yeah a lot

867
00:34:16,549 --> 00:34:19,759
of these vulnerabilities coming out I

868
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:21,230
can control the web interface and I can

869
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,450
change things in the web interface that

870
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:24,918
doesn't let me put malware on it when I

871
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:27,138
want to put malware on it I need some

872
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:28,759
kind of command injection or file upload

873
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:30,230
vulnerability to be able to go to the

874
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:34,250
next level I wanted to make sure both

875
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:37,730
were in here so that we could show

876
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:40,520
people the dangers of doing that okay

877
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:43,250
this all runs inside of QM you virtually

878
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:45,020
so this whole open work distribution the

879
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:47,809
description runs inside of

880
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:51,409
virtualization of QM you and sets up the

881
00:34:47,809 --> 00:34:52,849
interfaces for you there is the Python

882
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:55,159
web server that we have to serve the

883
00:34:52,849 --> 00:34:56,450
exploits and you just use a net cat

884
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,400
listener to get that shell back

885
00:34:56,449 --> 00:35:00,919
eventually I do want to implement

886
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,540
protocols like hm LP some of the other

887
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:06,240
protocols today those protocols don't

888
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:07,770
exist on open wrt so we're going to

889
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,529
be looking for help from the community

890
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:12,600
to help us do those kinds of things I

891
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:15,660
think that's it we'll be releasing the

892
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:17,819
full release of IV wrt with you know

893
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:19,500
working exploits full documentation and

894
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:22,290
as much support as we can have hopefully

895
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:24,060
at besides Las Vegas if my talk gets

896
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:27,509
approved because I just submitted it the

897
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:32,100
other day so with that does anyone have

898
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:33,750
any questions for me so again it's not

899
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:36,420
publicly available yet it'll be

900
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:42,710
available this summer like a movie

901
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:45,150
coming this summer IV wrt no questions

902
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:57,720
you agree with everything I said I don't

903
00:35:45,150 --> 00:36:10,020
believe you okay challenge yes yes is

904
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:12,000
they break things yeah

905
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:14,460
so the gentleman's question is well if

906
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,260
we do automatic updates anyone could be

907
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:19,619
able to update my firmware if we're not

908
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:21,180
doing signing of firmware updates was

909
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:23,160
was your point and identical kind of

910
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:25,080
glossed over that so there's two things

911
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,670
with firmware you have to sign the

912
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:28,560
updates microsoft's module is for a

913
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:30,930
really long time embedded devices

914
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,380
typically don't do this which means they

915
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:36,240
accept any firmware that I give it if I

916
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:38,700
can if your router is compatible with

917
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,009
open-work conceivably I could put my

918
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,330
vulnerable on purpose distribution on

919
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:44,369
your router you would not want that

920
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:46,830
you'd be owned six ways to Sunday all

921
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:48,840
day long you want to saw have signed

922
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:51,690
firmware updates so it is checking that

923
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:53,220
the firmware is valid before it installs

924
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:55,950
it on the router that's different from

925
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:57,480
encrypting the firmware where basically

926
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:59,189
the firmware before it's loaded up on

927
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,260
the router is encrypted so you can't

928
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:03,540
reverse engineer it some people have

929
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:06,750
tried encrypting the firmware and it

930
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:08,220
really comes down to X or links this has

931
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,960
done a couple of different iterations

932
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:13,459
where essentially that's X or you can do

933
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,460
that twice that works twice as good

934
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:21,259
anyone else questions was a good

935
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:23,520
question I'm glad I'm glad you said that

936
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:26,930
okay I hope when it becomes available

937
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,930
you check out yes Dan

938
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,280
what

939
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:58,120
with a particular yeah yeah as long as

940
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,010
it was signed yeah dance point was there

941
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:02,770
was firmware that used GPG to do the

942
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:04,540
checking and gbg is two functions like

943
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:06,040
check to see if it's signed and check to

944
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:07,870
see if it's signed by a particular

945
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,250
person's key and they were just doing

946
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:10,750
check to see if it's signed which means

947
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:12,520
anyone could sign it in with pass

948
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:14,100
validation so yeah they tend to do

949
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:17,850
things like that

950
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:22,089
and there are questions one minute left

951
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:23,470
yes so yeah good point

952
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:25,630
I'll leave that up there while we're in

953
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:27,700
transition very important Bloody Mary

954
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:31,270
recipe the last 30 seconds okay

955
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:38,859
you'll notice four ounces v8 4 ounces

956
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:40,270
vodka to horseradish Chipotle flavor and

957
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:42,780
hot sauce that's one of the secrets

958
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:45,970
Tabasco sauce celery bitters

959
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:48,160
Worcestershire sauce pickle juice very

960
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:49,629
important forget lime juice thrown out

961
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,520
the window garnished with the line don't

962
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:54,070
put lime in it use pickle juice celery

963
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:57,610
salt regular salt I like to medium mix

964
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:59,920
pour back and forth and then take a lime

965
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:02,770
wedge and two green olives stuffed with

966
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,660
cheese of your liking skewer finished

967
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:06,130
with a celery stalk would be the best

968
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:12,040
Bloody Mary ever I my mouth was watering

969
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:15,450
I really want one now I do the dill

970
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:18,690
pickle juice not sweet yeah

971
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:18,689
thanks everyone

972
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:30,459
[Applause]
