1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,899
Institute and I hope that you see this

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,910
today there's a theme and tomorrow with

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,319
all the keynotes that we really want to

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,540
take our best and brightest and put them

5
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:12,179
where they're needed most and I love the

6
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,829
vibe and the attitude and without

7
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,599
further ado I'll let you hear from the

8
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,940
man himself we're really honored to have

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,310
Jim Ralph come and he's gonna get on a

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,810
plane immediately after but we're really

11
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,038
pleased gonna set the right tone for

12
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,019
putting our best and brightest were

13
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,580
needed most Thank You Josh thank you

14
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:33,599
very much and good morning everybody

15
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:38,519
thank you so I was having a conversation

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,230
with a VP of development and that went

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,059
something like this I was saying look

18
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,339
this mobile app that you want to release

19
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:45,899
next week you haven't done a threat

20
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,940
model you have a done static analysis

21
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,520
you haven't done dynamic scanning and

22
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,709
the authentication is all screwy and

23
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,690
you're passing creds in the clear so the

24
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,489
absolutely under no circumstances this

25
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,349
is going to be released that you just

26
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:01,910
can't do it well one thing led to

27
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,260
another and it got kind of heated and

28
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,990
there was a bit of a scuffle and this

29
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,049
was the result

30
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:12,810
so that's Story number one story number

31
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:14,909
two for you two gentlemen here the

32
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,549
younger guys in the crowd so Story

33
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:21,180
number two is it was a little warm on

34
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:23,759
Memorial Day and in my house it got up

35
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,310
to about 85 degrees and I have this

36
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,340
attic fan so I turned on the attic fan

37
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:32,250
but in order to get an optimal airflow I

38
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,840
had to pull down the door to the addict

39
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,030
which came out from the ceiling and

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,430
pulled it down about two feet you know

41
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,509
down and then I went downstairs and

42
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,729
forgot all about it

43
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:44,579
and I was coming upstairs later on maybe

44
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:46,049
an hour later and I was hit I was

45
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:48,779
carrying a pair of shoes because I was

46
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:51,450
packing to come to Boston and I walked

47
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:55,229
right into the door BAM that's what

48
00:01:51,450 --> 00:02:00,630
happened so Story number one or Story

49
00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:02,610
number two which one is true - - what do

50
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,380
you think this is a table you got to

51
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,880
decide here what do you think - you

52
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,649
going with - yeah you're absolutely

53
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,378
right story number one was totally

54
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,410
prefab Story number two was showing what

55
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:13,899
a bumbling idiot

56
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:15,609
and in fact Story number two is true so

57
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,620
I'm gonna try to ask you a few questions

58
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,180
a little later on where the degree of

59
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,680
difficulty in answering and will get a

60
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,540
little bit higher than that

61
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:26,200
all right so but that was just kind of

62
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:29,290
the warm-up so what I'm gonna suggest to

63
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:32,500
you is something that's a little bit

64
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:34,030
controversial and I do that by by intent

65
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,150
so my intent is to make it a little

66
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:39,040
controversial so if you wanna ask a

67
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,870
question or comment feel free to

68
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,850
interrupt me I'm I could care less if we

69
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,680
cover all this material so I'm happy to

70
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:47,109
talk about anything that you like to

71
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,260
talk about but I'm suggesting to you

72
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:52,480
that in order to deal with the evolving

73
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,310
threat landscape today you've actually

74
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,810
got to take some risks and in fact you

75
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,120
got to take a little bit more risk than

76
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:00,160
maybe you're comfortable with and so

77
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,530
that's my my proposition and that may

78
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,049
sound a little strange being a risk

79
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:07,090
practitioner I'm actually encouraging

80
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,350
you to take more risk but what I'm going

81
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,750
to share with you is exactly what I do

82
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,370
today which is to take more risk in

83
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,820
order to manage risk and I'll show you

84
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:18,310
how we do that so the typical seesaw

85
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:21,579
role according to the source here

86
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:25,170
Wikipedia basically uses one primary

87
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:27,610
verb which is our job is to reduce

88
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,230
information technology risk this is a

89
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:31,750
you know a definition for what could

90
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,820
pedia now what I'm gonna suggest to you

91
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:36,370
is that applies to about 90% of all the

92
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,600
people that are in a position of chief

93
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,880
security officer chief information

94
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,739
security officer what I'm also going to

95
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,269
suggest to you is I'm in the ten percent

96
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:45,850
category so I don't fundamentally

97
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:47,650
believe in that verb I've actually

98
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,480
believed that we need to in order to

99
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,770
manage risk more effectively we actually

100
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,989
have to take some risks I'm gonna show

101
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:54,970
you how I take some risk so I'm in that

102
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:56,860
ten percent category I'm actually

103
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,660
encouraging all of you that are risk

104
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:02,200
practitioners and information security

105
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:04,780
that you actually slide more to the

106
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,970
right versus to the left so we'll well

107
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,760
that's the hypothesis so there's a lot

108
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,590
of breaches that we can talk about now

109
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,470
because they're in the public domain

110
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:17,260
there's a there they're on primetime TV

111
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:19,029
there as a matter of fact one of the

112
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,620
things I'm gonna suggest that you may

113
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:22,388
want to consider as an information

114
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:25,030
security practitioner

115
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:27,250
10 years ago 12 years ago when I started

116
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,489
in information security I spent a lot of

117
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,840
time and effort on security awareness

118
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,240
spent a lot of time resources on

119
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,849
security awareness today what I've done

120
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,880
is I've outsourced security awareness to

121
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:41,770
CBS and CBS has done a very good job of

122
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,560
that so you've got choices of the you

123
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:46,299
know four different episodes of 60

124
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,040
minutes you know and you get a through

125
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,960
product placement in 60 minutes while

126
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,220
you do that - so that's that's nice and

127
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,229
if you want a little bit more

128
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,510
entertainment value you got CSI cyber

129
00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:58,000
which is Wednesday nights 10 o'clock on

130
00:04:55,510 --> 00:05:00,310
the East Coast so now I mean I'm just

131
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,830
outsourcing security awareness to 60

132
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:05,020
minutes and and cyber security or CSI

133
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,580
cyber and I think it makes little anyway

134
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,020
there's an example of taking a little

135
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:11,229
bit of more risk so anyway we've got a

136
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,310
lot of breaches and what's happening is

137
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:14,080
that nation-states are getting a lot

138
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,970
more actively involved in attacking the

139
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,889
public the private sector in terms of

140
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:19,900
private enterprise so if you're in the

141
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:21,729
whether you're healthcare or financial

142
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,679
services or really any industry you're

143
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:24,900
potentially a subject to nation-state

144
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,700
attacks and that means that they're

145
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:30,190
nation-states are good they're they're

146
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:32,860
really talented and they have a lot of

147
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:35,469
resources so you kind of have to up your

148
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:39,400
game by default simply because of what's

149
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:42,490
shifted and if we look at you know if I

150
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,260
told you five months ago that a

151
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,870
nation-state would try to prevent you

152
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,039
from going to the movie theater to see a

153
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,139
lousy movie what would you say

154
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:51,659
absolutely no way right but in fact

155
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:55,300
that's exactly what happened right so

156
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:57,550
the fundamental shift in our threat

157
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,470
landscape is causing us to have to react

158
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:02,590
and respond a lot more quickly than what

159
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:04,240
we have in the past in this case CSI

160
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:07,419
cyber is actually a good metaphor here

161
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,720
get the yellow crime-scene tape out

162
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:13,419
because attribution in most of these

163
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,130
breaches is really hard in this case you

164
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:18,909
know we're told by federal government

165
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:21,699
President Obama FBI others that the

166
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:25,639
nation states that initiated this attack

167
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:27,250
was North Korea and in fact

168
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:30,530
from the evidence that's available

169
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:32,659
that's true North Korea did initiate the

170
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,698
attack especially the destruction of

171
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:36,110
data but they weren't the only one they

172
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:37,159
hope they weren't the only threat actor

173
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,780
in there there was two other threat

174
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:40,219
actors that were involved this is Jim's

175
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,530
hypothesis based on the information

176
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:43,969
that's a publicly available and some of

177
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,698
the stuff that's not publicly available

178
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:48,319
and essentially they're two other that

179
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:50,180
did the X X filtration and the

180
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,650
penetration of the HR system those

181
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,360
actually two other threat actors so

182
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:55,580
there's actually three threat actors and

183
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,939
for Sony there were nine different

184
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:00,979
breaches over a period of since 2011 to

185
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:02,659
now nine different security breaches

186
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:04,068
that took place so it's kind of hard

187
00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:06,830
it's like a crime scene where people

188
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:08,930
walk across the crime scene and in

189
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,310
infect the evidence essentially it's

190
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,419
it's really hard to figure out

191
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,580
attribution in many of these cases

192
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:14,779
that's true with anthem as well it's

193
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,849
certainly a nation state-sponsored

194
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:19,669
threat actor here but they had six

195
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:23,710
breaches over a three-year period of

196
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:25,758
time and the initial fishing

197
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:28,878
infrastructure was actually put up in

198
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,319
December of 2013 so it wasn't

199
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,199
necessarily a month before they

200
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,000
announced that breach and so again

201
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,759
difficult in terms of attribution but

202
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,889
the is somewhat of a pattern here in

203
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,199
terms of us a pattern of breaches and a

204
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:44,060
number of different breaches that occur

205
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:46,580
and that's certainly true with premier

206
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,560
and CareFirst has happened in health

207
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:52,190
care and so what I'm suggesting to you

208
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:55,969
is that this notion of waiting for

209
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:57,050
regulation to drive advanced practice

210
00:07:55,969 --> 00:07:59,689
and information security is

211
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:01,370
fundamentally obsolete and it's it's not

212
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:03,830
tenable and there's a number of reasons

213
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,659
of that here's one reason is that when

214
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,188
you have an event major breach what

215
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:10,188
happens well there's awareness of the

216
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:12,319
need to improve practices and that

217
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:13,819
actually manifests itself in terms of

218
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,909
legislative process either through

219
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:18,259
executive order which we saw recently or

220
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:20,810
it goes to a committee in the committee

221
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:23,240
decides when that bill has some legs

222
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:25,520
that will ultimately be brought through

223
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,560
the legislative agenda and that's

224
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,758
process very much like making sausage

225
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,110
you really don't want them to see what

226
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,450
goes into it you're not

227
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:34,010
too bad about the end product and then

228
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,500
ultimate that results in law and that

229
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:39,080
has little to do with the practitioners

230
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:42,350
at the enterprise level because until

231
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,510
the law until a regulatory agencies

232
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:46,880
figure out how to apply the rules and

233
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:48,890
enforce the law it doesn't really have

234
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,720
teeth or have impact in terms of the

235
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:52,400
private enterprise so if we look at this

236
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,790
cycle and by the way I'm very proud of

237
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,560
the fact that we have a democratic

238
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:59,510
government in the United States but

239
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,489
let's face it has anybody ever called

240
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:03,020
that efficient no I don't think so this

241
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,600
doesn't happen efficiently in the case

242
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:08,180
of HIPAA and healthcare this took 17

243
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,690
years right so glba took about six seven

244
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:13,969
years so this is a long cycle even when

245
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:17,000
there's urgency around specific events

246
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:19,340
and so we shouldn't look for answers to

247
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,940
the cybersecurity challenge that we face

248
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:25,100
today based on regulatory mandate and in

249
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:28,220
fact what you'll see and what we have

250
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:30,290
seen is the knee-jerk reaction is to do

251
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,820
something like this well let me

252
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,959
translate that to you that means in

253
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,940
crypt data at rest

254
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,860
right so with that with essentially

255
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,270
legislators are saying is encrypt all

256
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,640
the data and that solves all the problem

257
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:43,250
there's reason why they're saying that

258
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,500
the primary reason is encryption is

259
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,870
pretty sexy word you know it's it's one

260
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:50,030
word it's a little bit off we don't use

261
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:53,270
it in everyday you know common

262
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:54,890
vocabulary and it's it seems like it's

263
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:56,150
very explicit in other words you say

264
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,560
well encryption that'll solve that

265
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,660
problem and every since yeah yeah that

266
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,770
makes sense I guess yeah right I mean it

267
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,240
just sounds like it flows so the

268
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:03,800
legislators are going to constantly

269
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,790
throw this around because they're not

270
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,560
practitioners they don't really

271
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:09,290
understand the implications of this and

272
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,060
frankly what's happening today is threat

273
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12,650
actors are stealing credentials and

274
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,329
they're using those credentials to

275
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:16,400
penetrate an organization and they're

276
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,210
getting privileged user credentials and

277
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,640
that's what they're after

278
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:21,080
so let me ask you if you encrypt all

279
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,240
your data somebody has to hold the keys

280
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,560
right so if you're privileged users are

281
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,660
the ones that are getting attacked and

282
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,760
they hold the keys this doesn't really

283
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,469
solve the problem right so aside from

284
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,670
the actor that of large enterprise it's

285
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:34,880
really hard to do this really expensive

286
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:36,050
and really difficult to do so the degree

287
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,400
of difficulty goes up so that's not

288
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,500
necessarily a good answer the other

289
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,050
answer that you typically hear again in

290
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,270
legislative circles is it's a framework

291
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,189
problem if

292
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:47,740
everyone would just adopt a framework

293
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:49,570
this problem would go away right so take

294
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:51,220
your pick of frameworks there's plenty

295
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:53,710
of frameworks out well I'll just say

296
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:55,960
from my perspective as a practitioner I

297
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:58,540
choose frameworks based on business

298
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:01,690
drivers so I've chosen NIST

299
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:03,579
cybersecurity framework and 853 Y 38

300
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:07,960
percent of my business is with the

301
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:09,970
federal government so I'm not gonna you

302
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,440
know choose a different framework I'm

303
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,390
gonna choose a framework that works for

304
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,610
my constituents but that's a fundamental

305
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:17,170
business decision if I was in a farmer

306
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:19,060
school it the pharmaceutical industry

307
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:21,490
and most of my R&D was done in Europe

308
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:24,609
you think I picked NIST no of course not

309
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:26,350
I pick ISO 27001 so I'm gonna choose

310
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,880
this from a business perspective so

311
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:30,810
there is no one answer from a framework

312
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,920
and the reality is frameworks are good

313
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:34,930
frameworks everybody should adopt a

314
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,390
framework does that solve the problem

315
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:39,040
here in terms of the cybersecurity risk

316
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:41,560
associated with a threat landscape

317
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,709
absolutely no don't don't mix those two

318
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,540
things up absolutely not so what have we

319
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:48,520
learned well I'll tell you what

320
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:52,270
nation-states have learned nation-states

321
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:55,810
have learned where the rich data is

322
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:57,939
about us and they've decided that

323
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:59,709
they're going to harvest that the same

324
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:03,600
way the private sector is harvesting

325
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:05,680
that today so a question to all of you

326
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,750
and this is where their questions get a

327
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,209
little bit more challenging so who is

328
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:12,430
Google's customer you're familiar with

329
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:14,770
Google services right you know they have

330
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:16,870
search capability Gmail somebody may be

331
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:18,430
using Google Docs you know there lots of

332
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:22,210
different products and services that

333
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:24,640
they offer to you the consumer right so

334
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:28,960
the question I'm asking is who is

335
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:31,930
Google's customer this is the part in

336
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:36,220
the presentation where you answer

337
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:40,359
sorry advertisers absolutely right it's

338
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:41,920
not you right so you're consuming all of

339
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,410
the services the services are designed

340
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,599
to make it easy for you to transact to

341
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:49,180
do things in in in the virtual world

342
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:52,149
right but you're not the customer and

343
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,770
make no mistake about it because you're

344
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:59,130
something far more important what do you

345
00:12:53,770 --> 00:13:03,579
think that is yeah you're the product

346
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:05,290
we're the product right Google spat or

347
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:08,290
Google dispensed a ton of money in this

348
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:10,959
case 24 petabytes of data that they

349
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:14,529
collect each day right do they ever ask

350
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:17,469
you to pay for that no you are not the

351
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:19,300
customer you're the product and

352
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:22,570
nation-states that fundamentally learned

353
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:25,089
this as well and I'll give you one other

354
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:28,720
example that's kind of interesting is

355
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:32,050
the intersection of cloud and mobile so

356
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,899
this device here let's recognize this

357
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:38,140
device for what it is this device is the

358
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:40,510
most effective spying machine ever

359
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:43,180
invented in the course of human history

360
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:48,490
that's what this device is and the

361
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:54,040
beauty of it is it's all legal so let me

362
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:55,870
explain so 90% of 18 to 29 year olds

363
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,420
sleep with their device within 5 feet of

364
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:01,440
their head okay if you go in a higher

365
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:04,209
age group it only drops down to 65% so

366
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,600
most of us this cell phone is an

367
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:09,130
appendage it's part of who we are we

368
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,920
lose our wallet

369
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:14,230
it stays lost for days we lose our cell

370
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,319
phone we know about it in hours right so

371
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:19,720
it's part of our our being and it

372
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,940
collects a ton of data we have this

373
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,200
notion 65% of parents think they're a

374
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:26,079
better parent just because they have a

375
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,360
smartphone right go figure this is

376
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,770
interesting 75% of people say that they

377
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,180
bring their phone to the bathroom I'll

378
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:35,500
let you draw your own conclusions from

379
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:37,479
that so how many people use Apple iPhone

380
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,970
how many people use yeah you ever use

381
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,010
Siri right it's kind of cool right when

382
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:43,459
you use Siri do you know that everything

383
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:45,139
you say to Siri is cat

384
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:47,569
and attribute it to you for six months

385
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:49,160
right and it's aggregated and stored for

386
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:50,779
18 months now I don't know whether

387
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,759
that's good or bad I'm just telling you

388
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:54,619
that is and I'm not sure you are aware

389
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:57,319
of that but you know Cirie gets

390
00:14:54,619 --> 00:14:58,699
propositioned for marriage about 30

391
00:14:57,319 --> 00:15:00,829
percent of the time I don't know if

392
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:02,149
you're aware of that yeah so I mean you

393
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:04,399
know not that that's it that's kind of a

394
00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:06,740
useless fact but here's one other

395
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,209
example Facebook and Google they've kind

396
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,670
of figured this out big-time

397
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:16,309
so do you know that Facebook and Google

398
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:21,170
have the ability begin recording audio

399
00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:24,618
on your phone anytime they want okay

400
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:26,229
anytime they want and what they're doing

401
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:29,119
with that audio is they're actually

402
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:30,860
analyzing the ambient sound in the

403
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:33,949
background and they're trying to

404
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:36,050
determine what they can deduce from that

405
00:15:33,949 --> 00:15:39,199
information to be able to commercialize

406
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:42,529
that information to advertisers all

407
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:44,990
right and Facebook in this case has 54

408
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:46,730
million cell phone users rights our

409
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:50,689
smartphone users that they've downloaded

410
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:55,549
it so what's the most common app on a

411
00:15:50,689 --> 00:15:57,439
mobile device the answer is up here

412
00:15:55,549 --> 00:15:58,819
that's the deets answers again you know

413
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:00,860
the questions are getting easier this

414
00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:02,569
way yeah it's a it's Facebook right

415
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,220
Facebook in North America social network

416
00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:06,349
around the world is the most common app

417
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:09,379
so you've got social networks and mobile

418
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:11,559
device mobile device captures a ton of

419
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:13,939
information about your behavior and

420
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:15,889
social networks capture a ton of

421
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:17,389
information about your behavior you put

422
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:18,379
the two together and it's a very

423
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:22,040
powerful combination

424
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:23,749
so essentially who authorized this

425
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,839
invasion of privacy that I've just

426
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:29,179
suggested here you got it and that's

427
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:32,149
exactly right you did and here's how

428
00:16:29,179 --> 00:16:34,999
some of the Terms of Service and we come

429
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:37,819
across this all the time as Americans we

430
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:40,059
average almost 1,500 times that we

431
00:16:37,819 --> 00:16:44,679
actually have to face term of service

432
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:47,209
when we choose a cloud service or

433
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:50,269
software that we're using an assassin

434
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:53,569
and the average length is about 2500

435
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:55,850
words in top hanging out Pay Pal if you

436
00:16:53,569 --> 00:16:57,199
looked at their Terms of Service it

437
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:01,520
would be a whopping 30

438
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:03,830
6,000 275 words which is larger than

439
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,990
Shakespeare's Hamlet so those of you

440
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:08,089
that struggle with that in high school

441
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:11,959
you know try PayPal's Terms of Service

442
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:12,980
on for size here's here's the LinkedIn I

443
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:14,780
don't know if you're aware how many

444
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,190
people use LinkedIn how many people want

445
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,619
to admit it now that I've just brought

446
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:20,170
this slide up right well I usually but

447
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:22,579
here's something to recognize by

448
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:24,650
LinkedIn and and this is really

449
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:28,669
interesting they there are more verbs in

450
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:30,530
this little compact paragraph that that

451
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:34,160
I never knew would apply to information

452
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:36,530
but essentially LinkedIn has the ability

453
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,600
to improve distribute publish remove

454
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:41,420
retain add process analyze use

455
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:43,550
commercialize in any way now known in

456
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:46,310
the future or in the future discovered

457
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:49,669
any information you provide directly or

458
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:51,500
indirectly to LinkedIn right I mean I

459
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,850
don't know the lawyer that that wrote

460
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,130
that but I'd like to hire that lawyer

461
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:56,899
right I mean that can anybody think of

462
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:58,430
an example that doesn't cover I mean you

463
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,320
know maybe firstborn son or something

464
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:03,620
but Jesus I mean that's pretty pervasive

465
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,929
right so here's one more Google Docs and

466
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,949
this has gotten kind of fascinating

467
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:10,970
those of us that want to share

468
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:12,800
information and make that sharing much

469
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:14,360
more convenient for others and what

470
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,850
might want to choose Google Docs let's

471
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:19,399
say I had this presentation that I'm

472
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:20,899
giving you and I put it on a Google Docs

473
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:25,130
document that you could all have access

474
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:30,350
to who owns that who owns the right to

475
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:32,420
the content yeah exactly not me right so

476
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:33,740
as you choose that platform Google owns

477
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,930
the right to that content

478
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:37,610
so they'd manipulate this and they make

479
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:39,080
sure they take this paragraph out you

480
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:40,520
know hippy wouldn't want you to see that

481
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,350
paragraph so they'd manipulate it in

482
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,810
other ways but the point is they own it

483
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:46,879
and and that's what we have to deal with

484
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:49,100
and the interesting thing about this is

485
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,630
that not only of nation-states kind of

486
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,969
figure this out you know how with

487
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:56,030
nation-states and this is true of all

488
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:59,240
threat actors the legal system we have

489
00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:02,000
internationally has pockets of enclaves

490
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:05,960
that allow pretty much immunity from

491
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,070
prosecution for cybercrime we're all

492
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,990
well aware of that and that's kind of

493
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:10,389
the challenge that we face what you may

494
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:13,240
not have been aware of is that

495
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:15,970
the legal posture in the u.s. is

496
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:18,160
actually quite favorable to private

497
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:21,130
enterprise capturing your information

498
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,860
and therefore nation states are starting

499
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:27,310
to realize that that's value to them as

500
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:30,429
well and so an example is social

501
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:32,290
networks you can expect the same privacy

502
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:34,750
in a social network as you can walking

503
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:37,030
in the park what that means is it's a

504
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:39,730
public domain so social networks are

505
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:41,530
public domain legally which means that

506
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:44,290
any content that you introduce in that

507
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:46,740
public domain you should have no let me

508
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:49,480
repeat that no expectation of privacy

509
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:51,100
right so just think about the content

510
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,140
that you're putting into Facebook if

511
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,840
your that's your social network of

512
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:57,460
choice you have no rights to that at all

513
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,409
as a matter of fact Facebook has more

514
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,570
rights than you do according to legal

515
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:03,490
system and divorce attorneys have kind

516
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:05,530
of figured this out 81% of divorce

517
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:08,110
attorneys say they're searching social

518
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:09,879
media just to gather evidence 70

519
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:11,320
percents of 8 HR professionals have

520
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,020
rejected a candidate based on

521
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,850
information that they have and 86

522
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:18,610
percent of police departments are now

523
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:20,199
rude to routinely searching social media

524
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:23,919
for investigations on the way for

525
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:27,370
criminal so we actually have created a

526
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:31,030
legal framework to harvest any

527
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:33,820
information that you provide either in a

528
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:37,389
mobile device or using a social network

529
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:40,000
and so the threat actor in this case

530
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:43,380
sponsored by nation-states has figured

531
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,770
out that the way to get to employers is

532
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:50,680
through employees and that's you so

533
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:53,889
that's why we're seeing so many public

534
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,210
breaches of millions of credentials

535
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:57,310
specifically social security numbers

536
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:59,170
that are being stolen certainly true in

537
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:00,639
health care certainly true in financial

538
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:03,130
services and I would argue that's it's

539
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,010
crossing its crossing industry so what's

540
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:09,040
the most popular technique that's used

541
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:11,270
to harvest people information or

542
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,879
information about people

543
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:16,190
social engineering exactly or fishing

544
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,830
yeah that's the number technique that's

545
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:22,090
in use today and it's actually becoming

546
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:25,159
easier to social engineer not not harder

547
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:28,820
according to the BBI information this

548
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:30,559
year so 23 percent of respondents likely

549
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,928
to open a fishing message that numbers

550
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,899
going up not down as a matter of fact if

551
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:38,450
you're thinking about a fishing campaign

552
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:42,110
these are some that really make it quite

553
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:44,270
economical it's going to take about one

554
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:47,270
minute and 22 seconds for you to get

555
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:49,639
your first fish from a fishing campaign

556
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:51,770
on average and the chances of you

557
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:54,740
getting caught doing this is pretty low

558
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:56,510
as right so as well so essentially it's

559
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:58,640
attractive so the question is alright

560
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:02,480
what do we do about it well according to

561
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,700
sands in this case Lance says that we

562
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,970
should improve education that that will

563
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:13,160
solve that problem and what is Lance do

564
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:15,020
by the way Oh director since securing

565
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,390
the human oat so he sells training

566
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:20,450
services oh okay well I I can see why

567
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:21,620
that can be worthwhile so this is my

568
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:24,890
answer

569
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:27,800
yes improve education all you want

570
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:31,400
there's no no way that you're gonna

571
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:33,169
solve this problem by education alone

572
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,330
okay so that's not going to cut it maybe

573
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:38,330
at some day that you know 10 years ago

574
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:40,309
that made sense not today so the reality

575
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:42,620
in cybersecurity today is there is no

576
00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:44,330
perimeter the bad guys are using our

577
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,949
credentials to get in and there's

578
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:47,809
implications that and for whatever

579
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,890
reason institutions and consumers still

580
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:51,350
have an expectation that we're going to

581
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:53,360
protect information okay so the

582
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:56,120
implications are don't spend money on

583
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,610
perimeter controls because there isn't

584
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,530
really no perimeter and think in terms

585
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:02,030
of inside out technology that's

586
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:03,710
technology that allows you to determine

587
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:06,230
what behaviors actually going on inside

588
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:07,910
your environment going out we find most

589
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:09,650
of our malware at the endpoint today

590
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:12,170
based on traffic that's going outbound

591
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:13,370
so that's this reality in cybersecurity

592
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:15,230
that's where you need to make your

593
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:16,610
investment not not in terms of

594
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:19,070
preventing people from getting in

595
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:22,300
because it's too easy to get in the the

596
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:23,870
other component is a behavioral based

597
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:28,909
authentication

598
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:30,979
is replacing binary authentication so

599
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:32,690
what's binary authentication well if I

600
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,820
wanted to turn the lights off in this

601
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:36,980
room I go to a light switch and I'd

602
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:38,480
eliminate the current so I turn the

603
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:41,180
switch off and eliminate the current

604
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,940
it's very control the lights are on

605
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:45,920
power is running or off powers not

606
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:48,800
running on/off it's one or the other

607
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:51,680
it's binary right 99% of our

608
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:55,520
authentication controls today are binary

609
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:58,460
meaning user password you're in no user

610
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:01,070
that's word you're not in or out right

611
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:04,610
do binary controls work when you have

612
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:06,530
the credentials well they do if you're a

613
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:09,050
legitimate but if you're not legitimate

614
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:11,360
not so much right so binary controls

615
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:13,129
which are the primary controls in any

616
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,399
enterprise today a fundamentally

617
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:18,380
obsolete if you stolen the credentials

618
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,679
and that's what we faced with today so

619
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:24,890
behavioral is a key so Pearl Bailey said

620
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:27,590
in nineteen or she published a song in

621
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:29,510
1952 it takes two to tango and it does

622
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:31,909
takes a bad guy in this case part of a

623
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:34,220
criminal element so assume it's one bad

624
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:37,610
guy and what the bad guy wants is our

625
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:39,170
assets electronic assets and so there's

626
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:41,809
lots of automation that the bad guys

627
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:43,790
going to throw to harvest information

628
00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:46,220
that will tell the bad guy where to

629
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:48,440
focus on getting to those assets and

630
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:51,020
once they apply that they have a route

631
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,280
and vulnerabilities to exploit then

632
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,620
there's some manual work that they're

633
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:57,110
going to do the sophisticated ones to

634
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:59,360
try to go east-west and essentially get

635
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:02,689
tools and so that's what the bad guys

636
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:05,990
doing on the good guys side which is all

637
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:07,370
of you I'm assuming is your enterprise

638
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:10,400
you're throwing a bunch of automation

639
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:12,320
and the front end to try to prevent you

640
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,570
know the opportunistic scanning that's

641
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,370
happening on the other side so you're

642
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:18,230
throwing technology at the problem just

643
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:20,899
like the bad guy is which makes sense

644
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:22,520
and then there's behavioral analysis of

645
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,340
figuring out what the bad guys doing

646
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:28,400
once they get through those primary

647
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:30,559
controls and are trying to go east-west

648
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,420
with credentials and essentially you're

649
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:35,420
analyzing what they're doing and trying

650
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:37,700
to be proactive in creating friction

651
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:39,380
ultimately making it harder for them to

652
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,540
do accomplish what they want that's

653
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:44,810
essentially what's happening today so

654
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:47,810
what do you do to prevent this type of

655
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:49,639
attack in your enterprise this is what I

656
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:52,040
do is it the right thing I don't know

657
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,050
it's the thing that I think is going to

658
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,909
reduce the probability of my wife being

659
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:57,590
upset when I get fired so that's that's

660
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:59,120
why I'm doing it's really quite simple

661
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:01,280
so the first thing I'm doing is I'm

662
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,739
protecting the consumer against phishing

663
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:06,500
attacks well how do I do that well I use

664
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:08,330
a standard called D mark what that means

665
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:11,090
essentially is I'm authenticating my

666
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:13,520
outbound email and that authentication

667
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:15,139
is publishing a record a Demark record

668
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:18,850
and I'm serving that record up to only

669
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:23,000
ISPs and the ISPs have agreed to enforce

670
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:25,280
policy that any email coming from an

671
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,340
authenticated email server will be

672
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:30,710
delivered to you the consumer and any

673
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:33,800
email purporting to be in this case from

674
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:36,080
Aetna that is not authenticated gets

675
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:39,740
dropped so what happens is the user

676
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:41,770
experience is you see email coming from

677
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:44,840
Aetna and it's legitimate and that

678
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:46,520
actually causes you over time to realize

679
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:49,159
that you're gonna respond more

680
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:51,230
frequently to email that you trust and

681
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:54,590
the email that you don't trust which

682
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:55,940
includes the spam and malware is not

683
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:58,070
being delivered to you so your

684
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:00,410
confidence level goes up as a consumer

685
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:02,570
so basically it's very easy technology

686
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,920
to implement from a technical standpoint

687
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,389
a little bit harder a little bit of

688
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,850
hurting cats to get your third-party

689
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:10,010
procurement folks on board and to get

690
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:12,230
the marketing people on board but the

691
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:14,150
reality is when as a security

692
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:16,160
professional this is what I call a

693
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:18,440
trifecta and it doesn't come around very

694
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,330
often and a trifecta any the horse

695
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,580
racers here you know what a trifecta is

696
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:24,379
right it's where you have to pick who

697
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:26,419
comes in first second and third in a

698
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:28,340
horse race and you know Kentucky Derby

699
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:30,500
or whatever you're you're betting on now

700
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:32,270
what's the probability of you choosing

701
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,700
who comes in first second and third is

702
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:36,650
it high I don't think so it's really low

703
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:39,230
isn't it right well the probability of

704
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:41,060
you having a trifecta in information

705
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:42,740
security is relatively low as well but

706
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:44,690
this is one this is actually an

707
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:46,520
opportunity for you to do three things

708
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:48,820
that don't normally come together the

709
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:52,639
first is reducing risk to the consumer

710
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:54,679
that's a good thing right the second is

711
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,480
your operating costs are go down they

712
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,500
don't go up you actually reduce your

713
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,850
operating costs because you're not

714
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,560
dealing with a count take over from

715
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:02,540
phishing attempts which cost money to do

716
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,679
that right so your operating costs are

717
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,450
drop you don't have to deal with the

718
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,650
calls coming into the call center so

719
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:09,140
depending on what that cost is like

720
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:10,310
forty seventy dollars a call so your

721
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,870
operating costs are going down this is

722
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:15,220
the third this is the thing that's

723
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:17,719
startling your net profit is going up

724
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:19,970
now how does your net profit go up well

725
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:22,610
remember I told you that you consumers

726
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:25,640
gain more trust in email so what I've

727
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:27,679
measured from implementing Demark

728
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,480
across the enterprise is the

729
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:32,510
click-through rate is actually

730
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,880
increasing so I'm getting a 10% lift and

731
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:38,270
click-through on all of the email that

732
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,610
we're sending out to our consumers which

733
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:42,410
means that I have a higher transaction

734
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:46,490
rate from whatever we're trying to sell

735
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:48,920
or provide and so that alone is driving

736
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:51,650
higher revenue which drives higher net

737
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:53,840
profit all right so you got a three-fer

738
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:56,390
here you reduce operating costs you

739
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,889
drive profit up and at the same time

740
00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:00,200
you're reducing risks of the consumer

741
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:02,240
these kinds of programs don't come along

742
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,560
very often if I were you I jump on it

743
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,080
because if you don't jump at it

744
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:08,870
here's what's happening the people that

745
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,720
are sending the spam and the fishing

746
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:14,419
messages are no longer targeting

747
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:17,390
campaigns for at not because of Demark

748
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:18,980
who are they targeting that would be

749
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:20,270
your organization's if you haven't

750
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,680
implemented this right it's kind of like

751
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:23,780
jello it's going to come out somewhere

752
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,880
so if you haven't done this you better

753
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:27,530
do this because if you don't do this

754
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,300
you're gonna be the only ones left and

755
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:32,330
then the spam and phishing is gonna

756
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:35,570
increase so second thing what I do is I

757
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:37,460
look at the inbound problem of phishing

758
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:40,669
and I try to come up with some controls

759
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:44,090
for inbound phishing protection now I'd

760
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:46,280
look at education but from my standpoint

761
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:49,699
that's a conventional control and it's

762
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:51,639
not sufficient it's not enough so what

763
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:54,530
I'm suggesting to you is we

764
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,270
unconventional controls that you have to

765
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:59,230
design that's what I'm doing I'm

766
00:29:56,270 --> 00:30:03,179
investing in two things I'm trying to

767
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:06,130
Demark for inbound enforcement of

768
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:08,919
messaging and see if there's a way of

769
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:11,740
deriving value from that number one to

770
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:13,809
isolate some of the bad phishing email

771
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:15,880
that's coming through and make it harder

772
00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:18,220
for that to come through as a filter now

773
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,690
that's what I call its R and D like I

774
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:22,090
think there'll be a product available

775
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:24,159
next year for this but right now I'm

776
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:26,379
trying to design that product with a

777
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:29,529
vendor to try to create that capability

778
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:30,730
so satisfy me and I'm not doing it for

779
00:30:29,529 --> 00:30:32,080
the good of the industry I know josh

780
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:33,880
says we should do things for the good of

781
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,260
the industry I'm doing it to keep my

782
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,090
wife happy that's the only reason I'm

783
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:38,679
doing it I'm just telling you the honest

784
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:40,360
truth there may be a residual effect

785
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:42,639
that may benefit other people I'm not

786
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:44,860
sure but it's the second thing I'm doing

787
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:46,709
is I'm actually looking at

788
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:50,279
infrastructure used for fishing

789
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:53,799
primarily that nation-states use and

790
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:57,340
using a agent that looks just like a

791
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:59,950
browser on in that infrastructure to try

792
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:03,370
to determine when the phishing campaigns

793
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:06,100
are being launched at the front end so

794
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:08,049
the theory is that a higher probability

795
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:10,330
of potentially blocking the phishing

796
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:11,769
attempts by knowing the intelligence of

797
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:14,230
when those phishing campaigns are

798
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:17,100
targeting my organization so that's the

799
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:19,990
third thing that I'm doing so I'm

800
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:22,689
essentially trying to design new

801
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:25,510
controls that don't exist today and I

802
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:28,330
fundamentally believe that this threat

803
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:30,399
vector is the number one threat vector

804
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:32,889
that we as enterprises have to deal with

805
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:35,139
and I'm not relying on conventional

806
00:31:32,889 --> 00:31:37,629
controls I'm investing in emerging

807
00:31:35,139 --> 00:31:40,360
controls and I'd welcome you to do the

808
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:42,700
same because one of us in the room could

809
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,439
come up with a model that we could adopt

810
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:46,090
across the enterprise and help all of us

811
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,909
and that would be a good thing I can

812
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:50,379
tell you this whatever I do come up with

813
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:53,200
in terms of results I will share with

814
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:56,019
everybody here that part of it is being

815
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:59,049
a good cyber professional and a good

816
00:31:56,019 --> 00:32:02,620
citizen so the third thing I would do is

817
00:31:59,049 --> 00:32:05,139
I'd recognize that binary authentication

818
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,340
is not a model that's sustainable so I

819
00:32:05,139 --> 00:32:08,830
didn't invest in

820
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:10,980
havior authentication but recognizing

821
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:13,059
that there's a convergence between

822
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:16,960
authentication controls behavioral

823
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:19,990
analysis and fraud management and across

824
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,669
any industry those things are converging

825
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:24,400
and so you have to have a data

826
00:32:21,669 --> 00:32:27,730
consistent data layer that you can use

827
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:30,429
the IT people the security people and

828
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:33,190
the fraud management people using the

829
00:32:30,429 --> 00:32:34,330
same data in some industries like

830
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:36,580
banking they're converging the

831
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:38,260
organization's units but I'm just saying

832
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,908
converge the data initially so

833
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:42,399
essentially you've got all sorts of

834
00:32:39,909 --> 00:32:44,409
behavioral attributes that you can get

835
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:46,719
based on the channel that your consumers

836
00:32:44,409 --> 00:32:48,250
are choosing to use harvest those

837
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,899
behavioral attributes many of which are

838
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:52,179
benign by the way they're not even you

839
00:32:49,899 --> 00:32:54,000
know privacy issues they're benign you

840
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:57,760
can harvest them and essentially build a

841
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,429
rules engine that determines the risk of

842
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:04,600
that user in that channel at that point

843
00:33:00,429 --> 00:33:06,399
in time and that score that risk engines

844
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,770
score can actually inform the

845
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:11,649
application of how to handle requests

846
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:14,139
based on that risk score so essentially

847
00:33:11,649 --> 00:33:16,000
if it's the risk scores high enough the

848
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:18,159
person's fully authenticated and has

849
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,120
functionality for the entire application

850
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:23,980
if the risk score is low or below the

851
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,629
threshold than some step-up

852
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:28,299
authentication a higher level

853
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:30,520
authentication is initiated to require

854
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:33,668
higher level of functionality in the

855
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:35,080
meantime the application is interpreting

856
00:33:33,669 --> 00:33:37,419
that risk score to determine how much

857
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,370
functionality to provide and the risk

858
00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:42,159
score is too low then it goes back and

859
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:44,289
becomes fraud becomes a fraud pattern

860
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,480
that gets investigated and interrupted

861
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:48,789
and fraud so essentially this is the the

862
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,679
cycle what I've described here is

863
00:33:48,789 --> 00:33:53,200
actually in place today so there's an

864
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:56,440
application in that my company has it's

865
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:59,340
called iTriage it's like the open table

866
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:02,260
for healthcare and it's actually today I

867
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:04,990
interpret information about your

868
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:07,240
behavior and create a risk score based

869
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:09,040
on that behavior using things that are

870
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,330
relatively benign you've heard of the

871
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,659
accelerometer you guys know what

872
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:17,840
accelerometer is I've seen a few heads

873
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:22,420
magis and some VSO if I'm if I'm texting

874
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:26,510
on my iPhone and if I text vertically

875
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:28,040
versus horizontally the the

876
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:29,900
accelerometer is changing the

877
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,730
orientation from portrait to landscape

878
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:34,070
right it actually makes a lot more sense

879
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:36,110
to text horizontally because you get the

880
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:38,390
full keyboard up but I don't know why I

881
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:40,640
text vertically always I don't text

882
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:42,049
horizontally it makes logical sense of

883
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,830
this but I don't do that well I can

884
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:48,380
determine for any user the last three

885
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:50,480
most commonly used applications and how

886
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:52,340
the device was held for those

887
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,350
applications that actually creates a

888
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,940
signature for you as a matter of fact if

889
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:58,040
I wanted to take the nth degree I can

890
00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:00,620
measure the accelerometer readings from

891
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,870
how you walk with the phone in your

892
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:04,549
pocket right so I can measure all of

893
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:07,279
that and create a fingerprint for you

894
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:09,320
which is you as a user not the device I

895
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,850
can also fingerprint the device but now

896
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,980
I can fingerprint the behavior of the

897
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:15,710
user as well using information that's

898
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:17,120
relatively benign now there's lots of

899
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:18,680
other information that's available to

900
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:21,500
you from a technology standpoint or

901
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:23,720
develop the mobile app developer can

902
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,910
choose to get your browser history would

903
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:28,640
that be a good thing not in Josh's case

904
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:31,040
so you know we don't we want out we want

905
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,410
to cross the line there of privacy and

906
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,150
we want to say look technology allows us

907
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:36,649
to do certain things but we're not going

908
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:38,270
to do that like for instance I shouldn't

909
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:40,190
be able to harvest your contact list

910
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:41,660
right that's that's a no but the

911
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:43,250
technology allows you to do that today

912
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:45,049
any mobile app on your device can

913
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:47,780
harvest the contact list if the

914
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:50,030
developer chooses to pull that

915
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:52,130
information right so we want to

916
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:54,650
determine what the right privacy line is

917
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:57,140
from not what technology will allow but

918
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:59,090
essentially create benign attribute

919
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:01,279
information to create a risk model that

920
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:02,840
essentially tells us this now this is

921
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,700
also being deployed today in another

922
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:07,070
industry how many people in the room

923
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:09,919
have ever been called by their credit

924
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:12,590
card company suspecting certain

925
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,140
transactions to be fraudulent all right

926
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:16,430
let the record show there's about 47% of

927
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:20,150
the people in the room just raise their

928
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:23,359
hand right now this is an example of the

929
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:24,440
most profitable part of a transaction

930
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:28,780
for a credit card company being

931
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:32,140
interrupted by behavioral data that

932
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:35,200
essentially reducing the potential fraud

933
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:36,700
and sacrifice in this case the revenue

934
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,770
generation opportunity for another

935
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:40,990
transaction that's what's happening here

936
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:43,330
this cannot happen without behavioral

937
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:45,220
analysis and without a lot of data that

938
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:48,069
applies that so I used to work for this

939
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:50,770
little company American Express yeah and

940
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:54,340
and I still write algorithms for

941
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:56,620
behavioral models that determine buying

942
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:58,720
and spending patterns and then that was

943
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:00,880
merged with the risk function and so I

944
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,980
did risk models and behavioral models

945
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,510
and we did a pretty good job protecting

946
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:06,190
your been predicting your behavior I

947
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:08,800
thought we could do a better job of that

948
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:10,270
than you could and and so that's that's

949
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,010
the world that actually is actually

950
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:14,110
well-established this technology is very

951
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:15,310
mature it's not it's not new or anything

952
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:17,320
else we just have to take it other

953
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:20,650
industries because ultimately this is

954
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:23,250
authentication of the future so the

955
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:27,790
evolving role of the seaso is one of

956
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:30,630
taking risks in order to manage risk in

957
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:33,520
designing unconventional controls and

958
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:36,370
not relying on conventional controls and

959
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:38,920
just this notion of reducing risk so I

960
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:41,109
have a few minutes for any questions on

961
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:44,680
anything I've shared today and I have

962
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:48,070
one from the IRS ATR is that NSA is that

963
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:49,660
NSA yeah that's true it's hard to

964
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:51,640
determine it looks very very similar

965
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:53,819
same the red color yeah go ahead what do

966
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,819
you got

967
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:06,740
or monkeys I thought everybody heard you

968
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:09,109
have business the corporate accountant

969
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:13,330
personal accounts because you've been on

970
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:15,380
a business trip 250 miles away and

971
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:17,960
you're at cellphone service

972
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:19,370
so I community define mean that's the

973
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,290
current state project and for your

974
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:22,720
return account what do you think is

975
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:25,119
going to work better

976
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,270
yeah so so everybody hear the question

977
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:30,910
so the question was more of a criticism

978
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:34,950
that said that's basically saying this

979
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:39,129
fraud detection doesn't work right yes

980
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:44,609
can you name a bank today that does not

981
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:47,099
use this technology so that would be no

982
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:49,720
[Music]

983
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:52,060
there is no statutory and regular

984
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:56,020
regulatory requirement that requires

985
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:57,490
behavioral analysis none so they're not

986
00:38:56,020 --> 00:39:01,270
doing it because a regulatory needs and

987
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:01,899
they're all doing it and the technology

988
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:04,780
does work

989
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:07,180
does it work 100% of the time no does it

990
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:08,890
work enough for them to interrupt the

991
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:12,279
revenue generation process of creating a

992
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:13,839
chart transaction yeah is it thank know

993
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,760
it's every bank that's doing this and

994
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:17,740
it's every credit card company and it

995
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,920
should be other industries that are

996
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:23,430
doing it I'm doing it in health care and

997
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,810
if you log into iTriage today I'm making

998
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:27,399
interpretation about your behavior to

999
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:30,339
determine that it's you versus someone

1000
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:33,369
else and it's totally invisible to you

1001
00:39:30,339 --> 00:39:37,240
and the technology is actually quite

1002
00:39:33,369 --> 00:39:40,380
mature and works so I'm sticking with it

1003
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:40,379
you have a question back here

1004
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:49,340
later

1005
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,500
you

1006
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:56,330
and somebody wanted

1007
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:16,890
right

1008
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:18,390
yeah pretty near time to real time was

1009
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:22,098
bunny a chance with the gas station in

1010
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:26,160
Florida okay the reason I say that is

1011
00:40:22,099 --> 00:40:28,800
gas stations in Florida have two times

1012
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,240
the probability of fraud then gas

1013
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,280
stations anywhere else in the country

1014
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,348
and for what a reason a lot of

1015
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,970
fraudsters in Florida and they check the

1016
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:37,560
validity of your card to see whether

1017
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:39,720
it's still active by going to a

1018
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:42,440
self-service pump and trying it out so

1019
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,439
yep question

1020
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:46,609
skill

1021
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:54,040
yeah so the D market sounds like a great

1022
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:56,410
standard but why isn't everybody using

1023
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:59,040
it and how did I get my organization to

1024
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:59,040
do it is that

1025
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,830
yeah so give me an example of some of

1026
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:07,830
the problems

1027
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:18,740
valid email yeah yeah yeah okay so for a

1028
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,089
large enterprise I did this at a little

1029
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:24,019
bank in New York what was the name of

1030
00:41:20,089 --> 00:41:26,240
that Bank JP Morgan Chase right and I

1031
00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:29,029
did it for Aetna another small kind of

1032
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:31,069
organization right and the challenge of

1033
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:32,930
the implementation of Demark is there

1034
00:41:31,069 --> 00:41:35,960
are so many people third parties largely

1035
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:38,509
that send email on behalf of the

1036
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,769
enterprise they it's like the herding

1037
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:42,109
cat problem where you have to run around

1038
00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:46,308
and let all of them know that if you

1039
00:41:42,109 --> 00:41:48,440
don't authenticate properly using the D

1040
00:41:46,309 --> 00:41:52,609
mark standard the email gets blocked

1041
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:54,440
once you enforce policy and if the email

1042
00:41:52,609 --> 00:41:56,598
gets block it could be legitimate email

1043
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:59,569
that's being blocked and that is

1044
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:02,119
absolutely the biggest challenge in

1045
00:41:59,569 --> 00:42:05,119
implementation the answer is actually

1046
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:07,420
intelligence because you don't have to

1047
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:11,359
publish your d mark record in

1048
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:13,700
enforcement initially you can collect

1049
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:15,828
all of the third-party information

1050
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:18,078
that's being sent any email that's being

1051
00:42:15,829 --> 00:42:20,150
sent on your behalf you can analyze and

1052
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,940
and determine that and get each one of

1053
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:25,190
those vendors so what I did is I've done

1054
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:28,279
this twice and they both been wildly

1055
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:29,750
successful both have taken three times

1056
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:32,809
the amount of time that I think is

1057
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:34,519
fundamentally necessary but what

1058
00:42:32,809 --> 00:42:36,170
typically would I do is I start with

1059
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:37,848
third party governance and I put in

1060
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:40,009
enforcement I put a policy in place that

1061
00:42:37,849 --> 00:42:42,289
says any third party that's going to be

1062
00:42:40,009 --> 00:42:46,220
in marketing or any kind of email

1063
00:42:42,289 --> 00:42:49,130
generation has to establish a domain a

1064
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:51,529
sub domain the right way with the D mark

1065
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:53,720
standard enforced and so I do it at the

1066
00:42:51,529 --> 00:42:56,329
front end and then I wait over a period

1067
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:58,009
of time and I analyze the data to see

1068
00:42:56,329 --> 00:43:00,319
who's sending email that's not

1069
00:42:58,009 --> 00:43:03,230
publishing a Demark record on behalf of

1070
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:04,250
Aetna and I go chase them down and find

1071
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:05,720
out and one of the biggest like

1072
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:07,849
Salesforce that comes one of the biggest

1073
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,709
senders of email for any kind of CRM and

1074
00:43:07,849 --> 00:43:11,990
you wouldn't necessarily think about it

1075
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:15,140
I had to get since Laura comm took me

1076
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:17,299
six months to get them to adhere to the

1077
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:19,250
Demark standard and it's in their best

1078
00:43:17,299 --> 00:43:20,090
interest to do that but nonetheless it's

1079
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:22,250
kind of the hurting

1080
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:23,990
from so yes there is a degree of

1081
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:25,670
difficulty in just getting

1082
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:28,220
organizational alignment

1083
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:30,110
it requires security people to talk to

1084
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:33,200
marketing people is that a problem

1085
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:35,090
anybody better believe it's a problem

1086
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:38,180
but I'll tell you I'll tell you this is

1087
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:40,190
honest guts truth there are two parts of

1088
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:41,810
the organization at Aetna today that

1089
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:44,360
absolutely love me and this doesn't

1090
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:46,700
happen in terms of a/c so that you don't

1091
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:48,710
experience this very often one is the

1092
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:51,290
marketing people because I'm driving

1093
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:52,790
revenue up right and the other is the

1094
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:54,320
salespeople because they're launched

1095
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:55,759
they're basically trotting me out to

1096
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:58,130
talk to all the prospective plan

1097
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,900
sponsors that tell that I'm supposed to

1098
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:02,180
tell them why what happened to anthem is

1099
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:05,360
not going to happen that right so they

1100
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:05,990
also in both of those cases so CISOs can

1101
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,110
be loved

1102
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:11,959
while pocket not usually that's not the

1103
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:14,630
norm but you got to work with mark Annie

1104
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:17,090
and Josh made a point you got to be able

1105
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:19,730
to communicate most of the security

1106
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:22,220
programs that I implement in both my

1107
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:24,830
former careers I've been at see so three

1108
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:27,169
other times and here I never say

1109
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:29,900
anything about risk all I say is it

1110
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:30,380
costs this today and it will cost this

1111
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,530
tomorrow

1112
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:34,970
are you interested and any and I'll take

1113
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:37,280
software security one of the hardest

1114
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:39,560
things have fun the program for security

1115
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,470
is software security I go to the CFO I

1116
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:44,150
go to the CEO and the CIO and I say in

1117
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:45,500
in the case of ette and we're spending a

1118
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:48,080
billion half dollars a year on

1119
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:50,630
maintaining developing software so I say

1120
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:52,460
to them would you like a 15% return of

1121
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:54,590
productivity on the Billy and a half

1122
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:57,320
dollars that you're spending and what

1123
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:58,880
CEO or CFO would say no right you can't

1124
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,980
say no to that I say nothing about

1125
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,030
security I basically say we're going to

1126
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:04,460
be more efficient in our development

1127
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:06,230
process and I'm gonna return 15% gain

1128
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:08,120
and the gain is higher than that

1129
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:11,210
I'm just saying 15% because it's a

1130
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:13,819
pretty easy bar to do you implement a

1131
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:15,530
good software security controls into a

1132
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:17,540
development process I'll guarantee you

1133
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:19,460
you're going to reduce the defects by

1134
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:21,470
preventing defects you can measure that

1135
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:22,820
and by fixing defects earlier in a

1136
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:24,439
lifecycle you can measure that and

1137
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:27,200
there's cost associated that it's pure

1138
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:29,570
dollars and cents and every board and

1139
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,770
every CEO and every CIO knows how to

1140
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:33,410
speak that language

1141
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:36,020
say anything about risk how we do know

1142
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:39,560
we Jim's flight is leaving so I hope

1143
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:41,330
this was helpful I hope I provoked some

1144
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:43,340
thinking in terms of taking some

1145
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:45,590
additional risks I'm a firm believer in

1146
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:47,660
order to manage risk effectively that we

1147
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:49,130
have to take some risks and hopefully

1148
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:51,350
I've showed you a couple ways of how to

1149
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:53,240
do that may influence how you do things

1150
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:55,150
it certainly keeps my wife happy thank

1151
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:57,808
you very much

1152
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:57,809
