1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,230
who here actually so show of hands to

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,730
start off who here actually keeps an eye

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,350
on social media for security purposes

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,460
checking Facebook at work doesn't count

5
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,428
all right that's a lot more than I

6
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,500
expected alright so by the end of this

7
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,030
talk the idea is that everyone should be

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,980
convinced that they should keep an eye

9
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,320
on social media and that's for multiple

10
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,279
reasons a because I'll go through sort

11
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,539
of some of the things that you can get

12
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,310
out of that and some of the reasons you

13
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:24,869
should keep an eye on it and B hopefully

14
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,090
I'll be introducing a new tool it's open

15
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:29,220
source that should make it really really

16
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,198
easy to do so so the costs are low at

17
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,089
the very minimum so I'm a junior at Olin

18
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,250
College that's the whole thing is about

19
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,899
300 of us now how many people have heard

20
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,190
of it so I always got a point out so I

21
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,079
hopefully get the word out a little bit

22
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,730
I'm also an intern at Black Hills

23
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,320
information and security so standard

24
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,910
disclaimer nothing I do is their fault

25
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:50,910
unless it's awesome which case it's all

26
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:52,110
them so all right so we're gonna talk

27
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,510
about a couple of people in this talk

28
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,190
the first guy is Mike Mike is a pen

29
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,108
tester you know like a lot of us here

30
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,059
and he's a physical pen tester a really

31
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,370
really good one and on the other side is

32
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,970
Sean his physical security I in charge

33
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,860
of this place which Mike has been you

34
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,539
know given the task of breaking into of

35
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,619
testing their security in case you know

36
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,299
recognize that this is Apple

37
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,950
headquarters I picked it as a case study

38
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,390
just because there's a lot of tweets

39
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,710
about Apple and it's really convenient

40
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,600
and also because it's a well-known

41
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,429
company so if anyone hears from Apple my

42
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,770
apologies I'm not picking on you just

43
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,180
you know your convenient so there's a

44
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,619
lot of things that Mike is gonna have to

45
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,030
worry about to get into this building

46
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,710
right and there's a lot of things that

47
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,600
sean has to worry about to keep Mike and

48
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,729
people like him out you've got things

49
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,110
like guards you've got things like sort

50
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:35,880
of the cover stories that might need to

51
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,380
get Mike that Mike will need to get in

52
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,000
and the things that Shawn needs to sort

53
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,920
of defend against to know what sort of

54
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
stories would be coming in there's the

55
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,290
layout that Mike will need to worry

56
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,030
about or you know on the other side

57
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,799
Shaun sort of making the layout sort of

58
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,270
difficult to get out so you know Mike is

59
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,829
really obvious when he's just wandering

60
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,229
around the building you're worried about

61
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:53,939
policy Mike is one reason of what sorts

62
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:55,380
of things will he will will he do that

63
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,548
when we can stand out or what sort of

64
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,869
things can he do that he can you know

65
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,939
fiddle around with a little bit and used

66
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:01,530
to get in there's the classic locks

67
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,570
right like Mike's gonna have to get past

68
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,950
these there's names if you can name drop

69
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,589
that's certainly a valuable thing on the

70
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,878
way in and also the classic badges how

71
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,410
important are they what do they look

72
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,910
like are there security features you

73
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,240
know all of these things are important

74
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,950
to Mike to get in so the

75
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,140
question comes up and where can you get

76
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,070
these kinds of things right you can do

77
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,929
it the old-fashioned way where you

78
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,250
actually go to Apple headquarters you go

79
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,600
to wherever it is you're going you know

80
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,300
you wander around you look for things

81
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,310
you maybe Google a bit but this is

82
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,690
really expensive it costs a lot to fly

83
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,040
out there it takes a lot of time and

84
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,210
it's sort of difficult to poke around

85
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,739
all this and it means that you're

86
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:36,260
actually on site it means you're at risk

87
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:38,120
right what if there's a better way to do

88
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,510
this and it turns out there is people

89
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,800
just tell you all of these things they

90
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,660
just tell you on the internet you don't

91
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,680
even have to leave your desk and this is

92
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:48,020
just a long way of saying of course

93
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,450
social media right people put all this

94
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,400
stuff up and it's available but it's

95
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:55,010
still a little difficult to get to and

96
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,110
that's sort of three main reasons here

97
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,700
the first one is variety right there's a

98
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,170
lot of different types of media and

99
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,730
there's a lot of really difficulty

100
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:03,350
instead of gathering it in any sort of a

101
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,940
reasonable way so you've got videos

102
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,410
where you don't have any text search at

103
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,180
all you've got pictures we're sort of

104
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,890
again difficult to find what the picture

105
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,450
is about you've got things like tweets

106
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,070
right where there's only 140 characters

107
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:15,010
so just doing a text search for like

108
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:17,239
Apple or Apple headquarters or apple HQ

109
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,410
might not necessarily net you what

110
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,450
you're looking for because people are

111
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,770
working with short character limits or

112
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,170
people are working with you know sort of

113
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:25,700
weird things like that it makes it very

114
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,709
difficult for you to get the right sort

115
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,089
of information you need this has made

116
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:31,010
even worse by the fact that there's just

117
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:33,590
so much of it I mean you guys have seen

118
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:35,690
social media right there's so much data

119
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:37,880
out there it's just impossible to deal

120
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:39,680
with all of it and and also there's a

121
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,420
third term that starts with a V that

122
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:46,100
means origin I couldn't come up with one

123
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:47,630
and the idea here the idea here is that

124
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,430
it's spread out right there's no one

125
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,019
place you can go and get all of this

126
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,520
data there's you know some of it's over

127
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,990
in Twitter some of it's in Flickr some

128
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,220
of it's in YouTube and it's kind of a

129
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:58,100
pain in the neck to go gather it into

130
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:00,050
one place so the thing that we found

131
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,060
actually ties most of this together is

132
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:03,170
location so it turns out if you're

133
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,370
trying to defend Apple headquarters

134
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,640
you're trying to break into Apple

135
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:09,590
headquarters tweets and Flickr photos

136
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,600
and everything like that this around

137
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,459
Apple headquarters is probably about

138
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,650
Apple headquarters big surprise there

139
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:17,149
and so it's really really useful to be

140
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,070
able to gather the stuff around the

141
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:20,779
headquarters the stuff that's geotag the

142
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,250
stuff that's actually someone has told

143
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:23,989
you it's there which means it's very

144
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,550
topical it's very informative it's very

145
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,770
relevant and that's the sort of stuff

146
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,970
you want to look at and so a tool

147
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,590
that have been working on to sort of

148
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,030
help with this sort of stuff is called

149
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,650
pushpin web we're gonna be talking a lot

150
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,000
about that today the basic idea of

151
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:37,310
pushpin web is that we gathered

152
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,990
geotagged social media data and then you

153
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,879
can sort of go through that you can view

154
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:42,800
it and you can use it for whatever sort

155
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:44,539
of things you're looking at using it for

156
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,979
which we'll get into in just a moment

157
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:47,509
whether you're on the Mike side or the

158
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:49,250
Shawn side this is a really powerful

159
00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:50,720
tool this that lets you gather this data

160
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,930
in a way that doesn't even require you

161
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,770
to leave your desk so brief overview of

162
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,690
the talk we're just gonna talk about

163
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:58,310
what pushpin web is real quick and most

164
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:00,169
importantly what it can do for you why

165
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,580
it's useful I will skim over how it

166
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:02,750
works and then we'll skim over how to

167
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,370
get started and then we'll go for

168
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,509
questions at the end one of the huge

169
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,800
things I actually want to get from you

170
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:08,389
guys at the end of this is I have a lot

171
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,280
of questions about what's most useful

172
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:11,840
for you or sort of features are useful

173
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,520
what sort of directions we can take this

174
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,440
that will be most useful for you guys

175
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,479
all right so we'll start with what it is

176
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,949
so the original pushpin was written by

177
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:20,719
Ethan Romish at Black Hills information

178
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:22,430
security and then rolled in to recon n G

179
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:24,080
by Tim tomes if you haven't used recon n

180
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:26,509
G I thoroughly recommend it it's great

181
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,280
but the basic idea of pushman web is

182
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:29,629
that you put in sort of latitude and

183
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,369
longitude in a radius you just give it

184
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:33,830
an area it wants to look at and outcomes

185
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:35,840
tweets Flickr photos Picasa photos

186
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,818
YouTube videos showed end results and

187
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,109
also whatever modules you guys add so

188
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:41,449
it's designed to be really really easy

189
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,009
to add modules there may be 50 to 100

190
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:44,900
lines of Python and you're ready to go

191
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,310
you're scraping a new new API a new data

192
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,840
source you got whatever information you

193
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,690
need and it rolls right into the rest of

194
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,429
the framework so I've been talking about

195
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,110
push pin but push pin web is

196
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,759
fundamentally the same thing it's these

197
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:58,099
same scripts is the same data sources

198
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,500
but slightly different it's different in

199
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:02,180
a few ways firstly it's more flexible to

200
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,409
deploy it's a web application it means

201
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,520
you can deploy it wherever you want you

202
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:05,750
deploy it you know out on a digital

203
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,068
ocean server you can deploy it within

204
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,810
your own infrastructure wherever you

205
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:10,219
want to put it and you can visit it in a

206
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,810
web browser you don't have to install an

207
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:13,430
agent on every machine you know just

208
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,919
whatever as long as you people have web

209
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:18,050
browsers they can access it as well it's

210
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,460
easier to use again recon energy is a

211
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,900
command-line tool and that means that

212
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,099
there's a certain group of people who

213
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,719
can use it you know probably most of us

214
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:25,069
in the room and there's also a certain

215
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:26,389
group of people who can and there's a

216
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:28,219
lot of people who can't use the command

217
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:29,719
line but still need to know these kinds

218
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:30,949
of things they still need to know the

219
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:32,990
kind of information that physical

220
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:35,029
security is really reliant on and having

221
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,560
to push that over to you know sort of

222
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:37,940
the people who are more likely to be in

223
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,250
this room to the security people to the

224
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,270
command line people makes it a difficult

225
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,500
proposition right

226
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,060
you have the physical security people

227
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,650
relying on the command line type of

228
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,710
people and that's not a great place to

229
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:50,210
be and probably lastly and most

230
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,620
importantly pushpin webs meant to be

231
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,969
sort of fundamentally friendly right

232
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,530
again it's not a command-line tool it's

233
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,930
something in the web and it should be a

234
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:58,010
very easy thing so that anyone at the

235
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,960
company who needs to know the sort of

236
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:02,510
information can just go find it it

237
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,560
shouldn't be difficult to get and of

238
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,520
course you know it can be in the cloud

239
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,710
if you wanted to be right so web

240
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,200
application so if cloud is in your

241
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:12,650
mandate there it is so the bottom line

242
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,420
is pushpin helps you see it helps you

243
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,859
see a lot of things helps you see not

244
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,300
only the physical things that you're

245
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,830
used to right pictures or where the

246
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,540
locks are where the guards are but

247
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:23,479
social things as well I think that this

248
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:25,070
is really really critical so there's the

249
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,870
classic physical stuff right sort of the

250
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,360
locks on the building the layout of the

251
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,530
building kind of things you need to know

252
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,720
but there's also sort of an overlap

253
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:34,640
between the two right guards badges

254
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,590
cover stories these things aren't purely

255
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,210
physical constructs you know sure badges

256
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:40,219
exist in physical form but they're

257
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:42,169
carried by people and a lot of how

258
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,970
badges work and a lot of what happens

259
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,830
around badges is determined by those

260
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,540
people and this is really really

261
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,820
important because pushman can give you a

262
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:51,590
lot of view into the people side of this

263
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,480
that you just can't get from just taking

264
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:55,190
pictures by itself or just going to the

265
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,570
place and looking around and then of

266
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,620
course there's the purely social things

267
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:59,030
as well right you're not going to get

268
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,410
very many names by just standing outside

269
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,969
a building and taking pictures from a

270
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,590
distance this is the sort of thing that

271
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,270
pushpin can give you really really good

272
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:07,669
recon about without ever having to leave

273
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:11,479
your desk and without you know going to

274
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:13,340
site so what can it do for you perhaps

275
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,680
most importantly what can it do for you

276
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,789
so let's say you're Mike right and

277
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,590
you're trying to do recon on Apple

278
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,240
headquarters before heading in here's

279
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,770
the main screen of pushpin as it exists

280
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,730
right now you've got a sort of Apple

281
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,010
headquarters right there in the center

282
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:28,010
with a whole bunch of social media sort

283
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:30,020
of poked around it right and this is

284
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:31,280
just Google Maps on the top so you can

285
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,480
also go to satellite view which is

286
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,949
interesting I don't know if that's

287
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,020
readable up there but there's a sort of

288
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,130
a view of what one piece of social media

289
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,179
looks like right you've got the picture

290
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,460
there you've got the person who did it

291
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:43,789
and you've got sort of the actual

292
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:44,900
content and you can also see down here

293
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,520
in the corner that there's actually

294
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,959
multiple locations so as many things as

295
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,790
you need to keep track of you can the

296
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,230
push pin as well it's fun you can

297
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,339
actually go down to Street View so if

298
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,660
that's something you're interested in

299
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,080
you know you can go take a look actually

300
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:58,620
what it's going to be like from ground

301
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,029
as well as well there's also a ListView

302
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,620
so again these aren't particularly

303
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:03,570
readable but the basic idea is that

304
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,220
there's just a list of all of the social

305
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:07,740
media data that's been pulled from sort

306
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,990
of this location around Apple it's got

307
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,700
you know sort of big-ish data that's you

308
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,170
know 8,000 entries over the past little

309
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,579
while which is really really exciting

310
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:16,349
because it means that there's a lot of

311
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:18,989
historical data there you can comb

312
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,670
through and look at and then also so I

313
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,620
was writing this talk in in late March

314
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,910
and actually new data was coming in as I

315
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,640
was writing the talk it's not quite

316
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:28,110
real-time it's about hourly but you know

317
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,550
new stuff will be coming in pretty

318
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,290
regularly it's really exciting to

319
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,779
actually see things come in as you're

320
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:35,459
working on it so there's a lot of useful

321
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:37,880
information in this getting back to sort

322
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:40,290
of how this can be useful you guys is

323
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,880
this you know these pictures aren't

324
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,140
particularly visible but everything from

325
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,390
here on out has been pulled out a

326
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,430
pushpin in about half an hour of work

327
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,660
just fired up pushpin told us look at

328
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,069
Apple waited a couple minutes for to

329
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,540
gather data and then for about a half an

330
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:54,510
hour just poked through and see what to

331
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,589
see what I could find so first off

332
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,850
there's you know the locks on the door

333
00:09:55,589 --> 00:09:58,230
if you zoom in a little bit you can see

334
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,459
it's a proxy card reader you could

335
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,950
perhaps find the model if you kept

336
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:03,569
looking as well as there's a security

337
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,950
guard standing right behind the window

338
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,880
there it's really hard to see in this

339
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,560
there's some of the reflection off the

340
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,700
window but there's a guard standing back

341
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,349
there you can see the badge hanging off

342
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,579
his belt so it's kind of interesting to

343
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,260
know where the guards are and that's not

344
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:14,790
necessarily something you would get from

345
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,560
from normal reconnaissance at least not

346
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,699
off Google images right it's also

347
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,199
interesting to note there's a guy just

348
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,670
sort of loitering outside the door and

349
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,959
the guard is standing in there with his

350
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,849
arms crossed behind its back like it

351
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:25,500
doesn't seem to be moving or reacting in

352
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,180
any way just got interesting if you want

353
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,980
to go loiter outside Apple apparently

354
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,750
that's acceptable right this is sort of

355
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,459
insights you can glean out of this sort

356
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,680
of data without really doing much like

357
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:36,750
work there's also a sign about restrooms

358
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,550
outside sort of interesting like maybe

359
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:41,100
you can ask them about the restrooms

360
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,329
maybe that's the way to get in and then

361
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,070
of course you know there's the the

362
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:46,410
classic everyone has to wear their badge

363
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:48,839
sign right so so on the topic of badges

364
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:52,230
like badges are difficult right where

365
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:54,120
would you get a badge so there's I you

366
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,470
just type in badge and there's a whole

367
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,120
bunch of tweets there with people who

368
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,949
are talking about their badges we'll

369
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,890
just go right down the line so here's

370
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:03,569
the first guy right there's your badge

371
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:05,520
you know it's literally the first thing

372
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:07,410
that after you put in badge more

373
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,640
interesting than that right you can see

374
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,969
actually where he works again it's a

375
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,579
little

376
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,170
got to read but he works at the Arden

377
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:15,060
Fair Mall at the retail location so

378
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,979
that's good to know and perhaps more

379
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,839
interestingly is another Apple employee

380
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,730
saying you know I still need to do that

381
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:22,439
apparently apples badging policies

382
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,389
aren't particularly strict and they sell

383
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:26,670
you know fairly easy to not rebadge on

384
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:28,439
the rig so that's interesting to know

385
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,060
and as well there's all these names here

386
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:32,849
right all of these are links to people's

387
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:34,410
you know Instagram people's Instagram

388
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,910
accounts his Twitter account up there on

389
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,740
the top like all of this is information

390
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,329
that you can be pulling then in addition

391
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,089
to this sort of initial information

392
00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:44,128
source so next one down the line here's

393
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:45,689
two badges right and also interestingly

394
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:48,180
you can see they change color over the

395
00:11:45,689 --> 00:11:50,310
years so the one on the left looks like

396
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,660
you know badge photo for the new year so

397
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:54,719
that must have been the last year and

398
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:57,180
then this one as of January 6 2015 is

399
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,509
the new Apple badge so you know that's

400
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:02,459
interesting as well and if you know full

401
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:05,160
actual nice badges aren't your speed

402
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:06,719
here's also a temporary badge this guy

403
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,939
said you know my friend printed me this

404
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,160
badge so apparently you can actually

405
00:12:08,939 --> 00:12:12,810
just go in and print badges and here's a

406
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,009
picture of one and if that one isn't

407
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,839
good enough here's the second one right

408
00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:18,629
and so you can do things as well like

409
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,459
you know since June 27 and June 27th

410
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:22,410
down there as well so it's interesting

411
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:23,550
to cross correlate things it looks like

412
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:25,740
if you want to create yourself an Apple

413
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:29,069
badge here's probably how you would do

414
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:30,959
it so going back to the things that sort

415
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:33,149
of both Mike and Sean are worried about

416
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,649
you can see we've hit on almost

417
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:36,170
everything here haven't hit layout very

418
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:38,879
much but just about everything else

419
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:40,170
we've seen already in you know roughly

420
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:41,910
half an hour of work sitting at your

421
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:45,689
desk you know nothing particularly

422
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:46,829
strenuous in any way so you can get

423
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:48,599
cover stories we've got the bathroom

424
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:49,949
thing you can find where the guards are

425
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,569
you can find what the guards are worried

426
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:53,250
about you can find sort of policy things

427
00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:55,050
you got to wear your badge put loitering

428
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,879
near the entrances all right you can

429
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:58,589
find things like locks you can find tons

430
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,480
of pictures of badges all sorts of

431
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:01,649
people's names social media accounts I'm

432
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,779
sure if you dug deeper you find the

433
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:05,550
phone numbers everything else right so

434
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:07,939
all this data is just out there and

435
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:10,680
pushpin is a great way to aggregate it

436
00:13:07,939 --> 00:13:12,870
so let's just cover real quick how it

437
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,878
works if you guys heard of docker it's

438
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:16,709
horrendously insecure but also really

439
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,959
easy so for an F we're going with it

440
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:19,910
and it makes it really really easy to

441
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,050
deploy anywhere

442
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,699
one thing that's you know really worth

443
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,319
emphasizing

444
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,090
right now this is in pretty heavy alpha

445
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,310
it's not very secure I wouldn't deploy

446
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:29,390
it in any kind of critical location but

447
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:31,040
right now I'm just tossing it up on

448
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,680
digitalocean servers and it's real great

449
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,459
and it will be much better in roughly a

450
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,630
month through the next cycle so here's

451
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,040
just a quick diagram of how it works

452
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,660
essentially all it is is just a web

453
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,430
server on the front with a task queue in

454
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,770
the back and then going out and pulling

455
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:47,660
from api's regularly as tasks come in

456
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:51,050
throwing in a database and it's ready

457
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:52,819
and available for you as you go on so

458
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,959
it's designed to be incredibly easy to

459
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,520
get started so all you have to do is

460
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,800
just basically clone the repository it's

461
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,900
it's in take a look see what the scripts

462
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,099
are doing for a critical step umm and

463
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,449
then actually just run the start script

464
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,970
and all it'll do is pull down a docker

465
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:06,740
image and set it up and it'll open it up

466
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:09,590
on that port and you're ready to go

467
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,090
that's the whole process so it's

468
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,350
designed to be incredibly easy to use

469
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:14,240
again if you're gonna want to put this

470
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,680
into you know quote-unquote production I

471
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,080
wouldn't put it in any place incredibly

472
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,510
critical yet you can you know set things

473
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:23,750
like not using default password in the

474
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:25,189
start that Sh so again it's you know

475
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:27,380
once you've got to set up basically you

476
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:28,730
just run that you add some API keys you

477
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,870
add the locations that you're that

478
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,730
you're interested in looking at and

479
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,500
that's it you're ready to go it'll keep

480
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:36,440
the data up-to-date it pulls hourly and

481
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,580
takes a look and and just come back and

482
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,870
check whenever you want you know put

483
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,850
five minutes a week intuitive just

484
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:43,190
looking through this or see what what

485
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,570
has come in new this week and see if

486
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:48,500
there's any risks that you guys need to

487
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:49,940
worry about as physical security so the

488
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,650
whole point of this is that it's really

489
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,970
easy to be used by anyone right like

490
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,560
there's a lot more people than just

491
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,600
command-line people that are worried

492
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,040
about physical security and pushman web

493
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,780
is designed to make it so that anyone

494
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,890
can actually get this data anyone can

495
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:03,500
actually look at this can actually

496
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:05,360
mitigate these risks as part of their

497
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,370
job without having to resort to sort of

498
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,790
the more arcane tools the more difficult

499
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:12,230
command-line things so the next up

500
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,790
things are to actually spread this out

501
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,800
and make it more scalable and more

502
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:17,360
secure in multiple docker containers so

503
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,339
right now like the the web server the

504
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,710
static web server is just the Python web

505
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,090
server not very good that's already been

506
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:24,320
fixed it's using nginx in the new

507
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,670
version but there's still a few bugs

508
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,200
you'll still a few things being worked

509
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:29,569
out this should very soon be available

510
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,670
is sort of a ready to roll open source

511
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,750
tool it's available right now if you

512
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,010
just want to go poke around do some

513
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,930
testing with it I was going to do a demo

514
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:37,490
but the Wi-Fi doesn't work very well

515
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:40,040
so unfortunately couldn't get internet

516
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:41,660
access and show it off but it's really

517
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,240
easy to go use so I thoroughly encourage

518
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:45,770
you to go do it I'm gonna give some

519
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,690
special thanks to Tim Tom's for writing

520
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:49,160
great code again a lot of the actual API

521
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:52,430
pulling code is pulled directly from

522
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:54,529
Recon ng and then just rewrapped in in a

523
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:55,670
web shell and then even rubbish resort

524
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:56,930
of getting a thrill out of this and of

525
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:58,339
course John strand and Black Hills

526
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,329
Information Security for paying me

527
00:15:58,339 --> 00:16:02,750
through all this and keeping me off the

528
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:04,070
streets so that's me and I've actually a

529
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,360
few questions I'd like to ask you guys

530
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:07,640
as well as being open for questions

531
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,350
myself which is sort of what is most

532
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,970
useful about this for you guys you know

533
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:12,560
what sort of applications you see other

534
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:16,790
than your the one that I pointed out

535
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:18,709
already and then also what should I add

536
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:20,000
sort of where to go next with this of

537
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:21,649
course there's the obvious ones right

538
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,990
like it needs to be used in sort of a

539
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:25,490
production capability but also like

540
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:29,620
what's the most useful what should be

541
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:29,620
added thank you

542
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:41,950
[Applause]

543
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:45,420
oh I require some setup unfortunately

544
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:45,420
it'd be like five yeah so

545
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,650
yeah so right now it's just based on

546
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,210
geolocation which means that if you

547
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:05,609
don't geotag your tweets they want to

548
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:07,380
show up here so we don't actually go

549
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:10,909
scrape metadata right now all it is is

550
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:12,990
is off of the api's geolocation features

551
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:14,819
basically what it was was that going

552
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,470
through every picture in Flickr and sort

553
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:17,760
of scraping that metadata off of it was

554
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,350
was way too much work

555
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,300
theoretically that's definitely

556
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:22,530
something that could be done also I'd

557
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,688
assume that Flickr

558
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:26,760
I think Flickr does that scraping for us

559
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:28,290
actually I think any image uploaded with

560
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,600
that metadata automatically gets

561
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:32,760
processed by Flickr I could be wrong but

562
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,679
yeah so we're using the geo locate

563
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,300
basically you send an API query that

564
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,220
says give me all the photos within this

565
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:41,540
area and then it returns to the photos

566
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,540
so that's we're doing here

567
00:17:51,780 --> 00:18:05,010
okay so one of the things are actually a

568
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:07,590
couple points on that so one of the

569
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:09,060
things that was that was down that path

570
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,530
right was that there's already a lot of

571
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,120
tools that do that in fact there's a lot

572
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:13,620
of already really specialized tools that

573
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,139
haven't worked on for years to do that

574
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:17,459
so it's just sort of like shrug oh I

575
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,050
really want to work on that that hard

576
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,180
and so then today ting security instead

577
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:23,010
which is a really underserved area for

578
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:25,680
this sort of thing and then the second

579
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:27,240
reason being that it looks to me like

580
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,680
the geolocation was a little less useful

581
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,450
for that because all of the tweets are

582
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,550
on Apple headquarters aren't necessarily

583
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:34,500
about Apple as a company a lot of

584
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:36,629
there's sort of you know Here I am at

585
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,190
Apple this is cool or Here I am at their

586
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,360
front gates which is useful in one

587
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,980
respect certainly that people are

588
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,969
willing to go there but if people aren't

589
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,040
willing to go there you know if you're

590
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:45,570
not Apple if you're you know some

591
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,820
database company that isn't you know

592
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,990
quite as sexy to the public then I think

593
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,520
it'd be a lot less useful to sort of

594
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:52,440
look at tweets in a certain location and

595
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,690
much more useful to look at tweets more

596
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,010
to sort of about your company by keyword

597
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,660
or by some other search that I haven't

598
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:59,040
thought about yet rather than you know

599
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,630
people are necessarily going to your

600
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,080
headquarters to be like oh man databases

601
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,080
are great

602
00:19:19,229 --> 00:19:30,119
all right sort of event notifications

603
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:31,960
around a certain area automatically okay

604
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:35,279
nice all right

605
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,279
happy hour detector all right

606
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:10,309
absolutely so I actually looked at NSA

607
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:12,260
headquarters just sort of on that right

608
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:24,280
and there's nothing from within NSA

609
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:24,280
headquarters so sorry guys okay

610
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:28,809
sounds great we should talk yeah by the

611
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,820
way I'll be here for the rest of today

612
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:33,280
my contact information is up there just

613
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,510
come talking around I'm an intern so

614
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,139
like I don't have any of that

615
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:42,660
hi mighty stuff dude who's here yeah

616
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:42,660
anyway alright anything else

617
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:59,620
yeah so I thought about basically

618
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:01,360
looking at spikes in certain area so if

619
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,159
there's a lot more tweets than usual or

620
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,990
a lot more you know whatever than usual

621
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,980
in a certain area and a certain time and

622
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,030
that's certainly indicative of that

623
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,380
there's more people there there's

624
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,730
something interesting going on that

625
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,620
they're that they're you know posting

626
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:14,290
about one of the reasons I didn't do

627
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,939
that was just well a time but B because

628
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:17,530
right now there's no sort of external

629
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,550
processing it pulls down the data it

630
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,690
puts it in the database and then just

631
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:21,250
doesn't worry about it

632
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,300
there's certainly another level that I

633
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,100
think could be done where actually then

634
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,350
goes back and looks at it and does more

635
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:38,110
post-processing on the data not there

636
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:41,159
yet but certainly interesting I don't

637
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:41,159
think that there is

638
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:59,340
okay yeah okay I don't think that's in

639
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:00,830
the API but that certainly shouldn't be

640
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,360
too hard to add as sort of approached

641
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:05,220
post-processing feature on to this so

642
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:10,320
actually let me go back just a little

643
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:15,270
bit there's already a volume graph down

644
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:16,770
here going all the way back yeah yeah so

645
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:19,350
there's this guy down here in the bottom

646
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:20,250
that already does these volumes but that

647
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,570
certainly could be added as a

648
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,890
post-processing step where instead of

649
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:41,340
just displaying it it actually goes

650
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:43,549
through and flights it as well sons like

651
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,549
fun

652
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:13,379
got it okay so common place is to go out

653
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:14,460
to lunch or go to a play yeah so that's

654
00:23:13,379 --> 00:23:16,918
actually a really good question I

655
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,239
noticed when we were or when I was

656
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:20,729
digging through the Apple data that

657
00:23:18,239 --> 00:23:23,249
there was this place right here it's

658
00:23:20,729 --> 00:23:25,559
like some restaurants and pub right so I

659
00:23:23,249 --> 00:23:27,749
can only assume that this place has tons

660
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:28,918
of Apple employees at it all the time so

661
00:23:27,749 --> 00:23:30,200
it's wondering about that but I I

662
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:32,309
couldn't think of any way to actually

663
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,779
flag that those employees are going

664
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:35,489
there regularly without then going back

665
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:37,559
and pulling all of the data for a

666
00:23:35,489 --> 00:23:38,969
certain person which is actually another

667
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:40,830
thing that I'm thinking about doing is

668
00:23:38,969 --> 00:23:42,809
basically you just feed in like a

669
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:44,158
person's name or a person's media

670
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:45,570
account and it just goes out and spiders

671
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,719
as much as they can and pulls back sort

672
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:50,129
of a dossier which then yeah it's

673
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:51,779
actually a really good point that you

674
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:53,399
could then fine you know wow I've found

675
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:55,169
five Apple employees and a lot they go

676
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:56,609
to this place pretty frequently yeah

677
00:23:55,169 --> 00:23:58,379
that's a really good point that you

678
00:23:56,609 --> 00:23:59,549
could sort of cluster them outside of

679
00:23:58,379 --> 00:24:02,689
their headquarters where do you where do

680
00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:02,690
the employees here commonly go
