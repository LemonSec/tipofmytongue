1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:07,569
all right awesome um thanks for coming

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:09,519
to the session as we develop source and

3
00:00:07,569 --> 00:00:11,080
as we pick talks we always try to add

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,870
the career development stuff because we

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,429
like to you know find ways to share our

6
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:17,288
experiences for things we've actually

7
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:18,519
you know lessons we've learned and we

8
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:19,869
noticed as we're playing this one

9
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,759
there's actually a lot of us that have

10
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:24,279
gone through the path of starting up

11
00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:26,559
very technical and ending up somewhere

12
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:28,359
in the management realm that and in it

13
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,309
altima kind of internet being

14
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:33,280
non-technical to a large degree because

15
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:35,710
it's hard to do both sometimes so we put

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,870
together an excellent panel of folks

17
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,820
that have done that and in some case

18
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,419
have stopped doing that which is kind of

19
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,000
interesting

20
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,769
so I'll my name is Rob Sheen by the way

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,600
if those who don't know me I actually

22
00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:49,179
started out as a pretty hardcore

23
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,679
programmer and I've really held on to

24
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:51,899
that for a long time and doing systems

25
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:54,550
integration consulting but eventually

26
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,890
after many years of doing that I now you

27
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,059
know I've run this and I don't get to do

28
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,969
all that many really technical things

29
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:03,428
anymore so only these guys introduce

30
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:05,530
themselves but while you're doing that

31
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:07,240
just mention what was your role when you

32
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:12,009
started your career versus what it is

33
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:14,229
now as you introduce yourself alright so

34
00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:15,640
my name is Jacob and Onis I am a senior

35
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:19,750
security architect for Brother

36
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:22,960
networking one of the sponsors I spent I

37
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:27,579
started my role fixing pcs for him on

38
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:29,949
the pop computer shop and since then

39
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:31,960
I've actually gone up the ranks Espenson

40
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:35,049
I spent and I'm the control subject

41
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:37,960
because I spent four or five years as a

42
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:40,119
manager in various at various levels and

43
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:43,149
decided that I would prefer to stay

44
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:44,320
technical and went back to a technical

45
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:45,880
rule

46
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:51,250
hence the reason that I'm a control

47
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:53,229
subject so that's the short version as

48
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,760
well so I'm like president chief

49
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:57,490
operating officer for Black Hills

50
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,590
information security about 20 folks it's

51
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:02,830
a South Dakota so we do research with

52
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:04,570
you pentesting because it's 20 books

53
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:06,970
that you wear a lot of hats so

54
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:23,380
definitely do some technical but also

55
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:24,760
have operations tasks Wow

56
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:29,160
depends on where you degree the fight

57
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:34,060
start my career meander through costumey

58
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:36,549
a wine steward buy my first technical

59
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,740
role in the computer industry was as an

60
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,070
information warfare engineer for the Air

61
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,520
Force

62
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:51,400
which is a really fancy way of saying my

63
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:53,200
program order routers so let's start

64
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,180
with motivation what what motivated you

65
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,690
to want to shift from technical to

66
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,950
non-technical in the first place so I

67
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,810
don't know they take a shift from

68
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,339
technical to non-technical from where

69
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,820
this shift to be an individual

70
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:09,450
contributor to eat I like to convince

71
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,829
myself I'm still technical I mean

72
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:17,320
computer science so it's not like I got

73
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:18,850
any less technical then imagine part of

74
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,739
it is I actually really don't like

75
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,980
working for other

76
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:24,840
people I really like to be able to say

77
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,390
hey this is the interesting thing I

78
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,820
wanted to do today and go do it and then

79
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:31,799
show off my work which always made it

80
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,780
hard when I had an aligned manager who

81
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,210
would say no no no these are the things

82
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,370
I want you to go do today but much

83
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:41,370
easier to be an obsession where I could

84
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,840
sort of drive my own work and then of

85
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,490
course I'm driving my other work I could

86
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,140
drive to work with the people around me

87
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:48,540
so that they could do the work I didn't

88
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,739
want to do it actually tweets out that

89
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,170
it's hard to motivate people when you

90
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,460
say that so instead I have to give them

91
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:55,589
the work that they want to do which

92
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:57,150
often means is the executive but I end

93
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,980
up doing the work that I did want to do

94
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,670
in the first place why are you getting

95
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:04,049
executive I standing like yeah for me

96
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:07,230
myself David mentioned another king

97
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:09,180
bossy but also I really like jumping

98
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:17,820
into class and taking as much

99
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:19,560
responsibility as folks will test their

100
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,329
patience so they give to everything to

101
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,410
me and let me run with it which is

102
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:27,870
awesome because that's how I love to

103
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:30,120
work it just like so I was looking for

104
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,850
the next challenge the role that I was

105
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,280
in my last technical role I had done

106
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,870
everything I could so I was saying I

107
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,419
thought that my only next move I could

108
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:42,440
make was to go into management and I

109
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:45,690
looked at that as my next challenge and

110
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,969
that didn't necessarily I didn't I

111
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:50,430
unfortunately I didn't find there

112
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,919
filling up and the difference being is

113
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:55,919
that I'm like what

114
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:57,719
and esau when my lion management told me

115
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,460
to do something and I didn't want to do

116
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:03,449
it or I had my own ideas I would just do

117
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:05,250
it myself anyway which is one of the

118
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:08,190
things I enjoy about being technical as

119
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,330
I can to go rogue but that's the whole

120
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,770
reason I went the management's look for

121
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,659
that next challenge I felt as though I

122
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,909
had capped out where I was at and the

123
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:18,300
only path I could see was going in to

124
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:19,349
some level of management so oh yeah

125
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,030
that's interesting I actually relate to

126
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:22,979
everything that you guys said cuz I

127
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:25,650
definitely have seen you know the people

128
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:27,539
that generally make that ship you know

129
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:29,280
it's because they're either bossy you're

130
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:30,870
like doing their own thing or don't like

131
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,979
working for other people and all of

132
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,879
those things definitely apply to me

133
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:37,500
that's why I started my own company

134
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:39,479
right so for you guys what challenges

135
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,599
that you faced making that transition

136
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:44,280
from technical to alright from basically

137
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:46,190
individual contributor to exactly that's

138
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:50,520
a better way of putting it

139
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:51,870
so if the biggest one is actually put it

140
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,990
there is it something you like to go

141
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:56,699
rogue as a technical contributor and so

142
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,159
that this whole model is easier to beg

143
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:01,139
forgiveness than ask permission stops

144
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:05,009
working quite so well as an executive

145
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:06,900
people sort of expect you to behave and

146
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:08,520
that's actually a good thing right it's

147
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,370
good set of skills to learn is it you're

148
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,770
part of a larger team and so it's easy

149
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,110
when you're an individual contributor

150
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:17,120
say look this is what my job is and I'm

151
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:19,069
greeted with what I think is best and

152
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,330
it's the top of your management to make

153
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:22,729
sure that that's a line with what the

154
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,740
business is do it when you become the

155
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:26,599
management now it's your job to figure

156
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,909
out how can you manage that alignment

157
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:31,849
well keep it exciting to be aging these

158
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:33,050
people who otherwise will don't Road and

159
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,250
that's something's perfect you want to

160
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,870
give them that room you say oh I'm

161
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,759
trying something new that easy to get

162
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:40,360
sponsored they look little hard radix

163
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:44,000
it's their idea always a great dynamic

164
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,680
but having to really learn that you have

165
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,050
partners in the business who might not

166
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,460
have known who you were before but now

167
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,590
they really not only know who you are

168
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,659
but they expect a certain standard of

169
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:58,130
behavior out of you that is not the same

170
00:06:53,659 --> 00:07:00,560
standard expected as a technician I do

171
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:03,639
all the technical aspects still so it's

172
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,169
really fun to dive into a problem

173
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,000
sometimes pen testing can get somewhat

174
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:09,710
theoretical in terms of what you'll

175
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,840
report back to a customer so there's

176
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:13,580
always that reality check up finding

177
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,919
whether or not that really affects a

178
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,300
customer or their business or what's

179
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,948
important to them so I really like

180
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,889
sitting down and having discussions with

181
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:23,300
folks as to you know what we're doing

182
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:24,590
whether or not makes sense and when you

183
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,240
do that then you tend to look at the

184
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:29,339
bigger picture which a

185
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,339
[Music]

186
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:34,040
what challenge isn't worth I'm sorry uh

187
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,140
I was just cycling back through I think

188
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,490
I faced to two specific challenges one

189
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,500
of the first things somebody said to me

190
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,840
once that once you become management

191
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:46,810
you're part of management and you're no

192
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:51,109
longer part of the employee base so in

193
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:54,680
changing my mindset to not sit at the

194
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,970
coffee machine and complain to my other

195
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,950
co-workers about the way I don't like

196
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,600
the way the company's run I'm now part

197
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:01,760
of the comfort I'm part of the thing and

198
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,010
trying to wrap my mind around the idea

199
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,930
of no this is the business direction

200
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:08,810
this is the direction I need to pass

201
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:14,120
along to my employees and figure out a

202
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:17,900
way to have them not just swallow it but

203
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,220
accept it and move forward with it that

204
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,799
was probably the biggest challenge that

205
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:25,040
I faced personally the other thing which

206
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:28,390
I found very odd is the team that I've

207
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:32,000
been working with for years half of them

208
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:33,319
understood that I was just as technical

209
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,450
as I was last week

210
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:39,380
the other ones assumed as soon as I had

211
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:42,800
manager in my title I knew nothing and

212
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:44,870
it was a completely polar split so that

213
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:47,180
was kind of an odd thing where I was

214
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:50,810
providing technical advice to my team

215
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:53,030
and half the people accepted it because

216
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:56,479
that was what I was doing last week and

217
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:58,130
the other half just assumed that because

218
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,290
I was the manager they knew more than me

219
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:01,550
from a technical perspective so sorry I

220
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,140
was just gonna add that definitely

221
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,699
happens with me well I'll go on

222
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:06,380
engagements

223
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:09,890
the chief operating officer what are you

224
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:11,990
doing here yeah I've done similar things

225
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,340
as the CEO going to deliver work there

226
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:17,300
like what you must not be technical it's

227
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:19,220
like well maybe that's right yeah that's

228
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,540
the answer it's really actually business

229
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,700
parts out what I went through these

230
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,410
evolution were for a while my business

231
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,120
card didn't even have my title on it so

232
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:28,969
so worried about that so just then right

233
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,500
can you pls InfoSec until something twin

234
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:33,170
doubt that the team was larger than one

235
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,770
person now quite sound the right way

236
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,110
anymore

237
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:37,910
but back to your first point the comment

238
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:39,740
about you have your part of management

239
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,420
the other challenge it took me a while

240
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,340
to realize it is it when people complain

241
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:45,050
and you're just part of the employee

242
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,880
base right you can gripe along with them

243
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,439
and then you can move on right you've

244
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,900
all dented steam it's great actually

245
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,360
really helping but when you're executive

246
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:55,990
and people complain near you you feel

247
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,820
the responsibility to do something

248
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:00,620
there's nothing you can do and probably

249
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,690
the single biggest stressor that I get

250
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,730
is when I see people who are in distress

251
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:06,410
and I kind of mentally know that they're

252
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,820
venting steam they're not really upset

253
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:14,689
about this thing they don't expect

254
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:16,700
change but I want to be good right in my

255
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:19,070
last company we built it up to about 20

256
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,350
people and suddenly I found that you

257
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:23,420
know if they were all pissed off they

258
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,560
were usually pissed up at me and that

259
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,790
was that was interesting ship cuz they

260
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,130
usually you get to be part of that

261
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:29,900
instead of like pretty much the buck

262
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:32,960
stops with you when you're you know the

263
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,250
one running the company so how did you

264
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,750
guys go about making the move because

265
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,130
that's actually a challenge for a lot of

266
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,210
folks is how do you act like it's one

267
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,530
thing to have the vision but one day

268
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:41,060
I'll be a manager one day I'll be an

269
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,470
executive well how do you actually go

270
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:46,969
about doing that how do you guys like

271
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:48,620
that I just did it it's the size to do

272
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,360
it I saw an opportunity I signed up for

273
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,180
my company there was some change I saw

274
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,350
an opportunity I said I called the

275
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,500
hiring manager who is that the time my

276
00:10:54,350 --> 00:11:00,490
boss's boss and said hey I want this job

277
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:02,410
I didn't wait for him to offer it I just

278
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:06,070
said hey I want this opportunity and he

279
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:08,469
said what well actually this is what

280
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:10,510
oxygens there's on board a new challenge

281
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:12,790
and I think I can do this job do you

282
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:17,830
think I give this child me so I get a

283
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:20,500
try but I just did prior to that I've

284
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:22,300
been kind of stepping myself up to be in

285
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,560
that role as a team leader and doing

286
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,900
those kind of opportunities that try to

287
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,979
show it is through project management

288
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:32,140
and general management stuff like that

289
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:34,360
but a lot of it is I asked like I

290
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:37,180
definitely go into stealth mode where I

291
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,920
just start doing work and start taking

292
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,479
on other responsibilities until

293
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,370
someone's like it you're pretty much

294
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,000
chief operating officer so when we just

295
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,000
call you that

296
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,610
just as I tried that a couple times and

297
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:55,170
somebody else got the job because they

298
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:55,170
screamed I was too busy thinking boy

299
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:11,620
yeah my initial my first management gig

300
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:13,240
was actually I was a part of team six

301
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,470
people one of whom had been hired to

302
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,760
then be the manager

303
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,440
that would have been told when he was

304
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,300
hired look he'll come in and feel

305
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,830
contributor you'll be the manager about

306
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,469
six months after we come in our

307
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:26,110
collective loss to the security team

308
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,930
didn't have its own manager oh god no

309
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,820
this guy's never

310
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:30,349
manager other than he decided to leave

311
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,450
she said he handed me the manager

312
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,700
I said sure that sounds great he walked

313
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:36,260
out the door and then I stained my new

314
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,850
boss came in and said oh by the way you

315
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:42,800
know we're doing the layoffs in 30 days

316
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:43,790
you'd laugh at 14 right yeah warning one

317
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,079
of the first things that you will ever

318
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:48,290
have to do as a manager is fire

319
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,670
something either lay out before there's

320
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:51,529
a poor contributor that nobody else

321
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,640
wanted to deal with and now you're the

322
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:54,529
one who's gonna have to deal with it so

323
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,420
fair warning one of the first things you

324
00:12:54,529 --> 00:13:00,980
generally have to do it it's not fun

325
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:03,380
worst yes yeah that's not spikes not fun

326
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:05,330
yeah because either you're laying off

327
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:07,220
somebody that you really like and that's

328
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,990
really hard to do or you have to go

329
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,870
through the hassle of dealing with HR to

330
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:13,310
fire somebody correctly but then to grow

331
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:15,380
that Java member I just a manager

332
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:17,930
security I grew that job didn't see

333
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:20,510
level position by just doing the go grab

334
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:22,010
more work every time until it awoke my

335
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,420
myself my sales reps are introducing

336
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,130
these two chief security officer of the

337
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:27,140
company and I said no no that's not

338
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,790
actually my title until finally the

339
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,230
company sort of caught up and says what

340
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:39,050
against remove your title since it is

341
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:41,060
your Twitter handle so just just to kind

342
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:43,219
of counter add a little bit to this

343
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:45,589
because you guys have kind of been more

344
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:47,330
on the path of working at companies so I

345
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:49,010
was I was on that same path for a while

346
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:50,950
and then I got to apply I was like well

347
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:54,110
I could spend the next 10 to 15 years

348
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:56,360
doing what Andy did and working my way

349
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:57,709
up the food chain or I could just exit

350
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,240
the food chain and just start my own

351
00:13:57,709 --> 00:14:00,469
thing so that is a tried-and-true model

352
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,790
that doesn't work once you been doing it

353
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:03,500
for a while suddenly because my first

354
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:05,000
when I first was the CEO it kind of

355
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,250
scared the crap out I was like I'm a CEO

356
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,540
I don't know what that means but after

357
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,190
after seven years of doing it then

358
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,480
suddenly everybody's like it doesn't

359
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:14,660
they don't think about anyone remember

360
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,950
the first year all my friends are giving

361
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,180
me all kinds of interesting advice about

362
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,070
how I should be running my um

363
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:21,760
you know I don't get that kind of advice

364
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:26,570
anymore so it's kind of interesting that

365
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,890
you yeah actually - one thought I had on

366
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:29,840
that so when I change jobs I got

367
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:33,110
promoted within the same company true

368
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:34,580
manager and I had obviously the

369
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:37,760
challenges of I was part of management

370
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:39,820
my second management job after getting

371
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:44,000
the experience my first one was

372
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:45,950
amazingly because I no longer had this

373
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,360
this the stigma of well these are the

374
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:51,590
people that I used to work with now I'm

375
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:55,220
the boss that's their existing company

376
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:57,830
like when you come in as a manager or as

377
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:59,480
a as a director or you're trying to go

378
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,770
from manager to senior manager manager

379
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,680
to director director tunes

380
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:05,180
you know c-level executive and it's

381
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,780
easier when you change companies because

382
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:11,390
when you start there is an assumption

383
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:12,800
that you know what you're doing you're

384
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:16,250
granted the authority that you're doing

385
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,479
and you have at least from my

386
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,620
perspective a little bit of runway you

387
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,580
get a month or two months to kind of

388
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,070
figure out how the company's going to

389
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:24,380
work that second job and the third job

390
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:25,250
were bar easier than my first even

391
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:29,960
though there were more challenging

392
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:32,190
environments just something to kind of

393
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,649
perspectives

394
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:36,930
so one of the things that we were

395
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:38,699
talking about before was a lot of

396
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:41,459
technical folks kind of very much

397
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:44,279
attached their personality or who they

398
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:46,500
are their identity to being technical so

399
00:15:44,279 --> 00:16:18,269
as you guys transition to more

400
00:15:46,500 --> 00:16:19,589
individual roles did you find so in that

401
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:21,000
said there are still plenty of

402
00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:23,430
opportunities to be technical

403
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,350
you know when her clue came out I was in

404
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:26,699
the guts of the OpenSSL codebase trying

405
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:29,160
to understand what the hell they had

406
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:31,620
done with memory management it's really

407
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:34,649
hard to get more technical than grokking

408
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:36,389
OpenSSL memory management so I get to

409
00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:38,490
look at that so yeah I'm still technical

410
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:40,769
and then I have the skill set to take

411
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:42,750
that knowledge and translate it and

412
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:45,600
share it in a way that other executives

413
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:48,000
can understand like how did this impact

414
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,310
why what were they thinking what were we

415
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,939
thinking that we had this code like walk

416
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:55,619
through that chain and so yeah I still

417
00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:57,449
get to be technical I don't think I've

418
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,939
lost all of my chops but certainly

419
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:01,529
babies get rusty if you ask me to look

420
00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:03,959
at PHP code I'll probably more likely

421
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:04,689
run in fear than correct it now maybe

422
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:08,168
that's a

423
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:11,740
they got it guess the way that affected

424
00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:15,490
me was that help some old needs to

425
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:18,519
remember that a lot of responsibility

426
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:22,509
and I need to be more pathetic to folks

427
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:25,029
in general so thank you aren't black and

428
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:25,959
white sometimes is a lot of gray and so

429
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:28,629
you have to put yourself in the other

430
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:32,289
person's shoes and would you deliver

431
00:17:28,629 --> 00:17:39,370
good or bad news pause before you

432
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:41,440
deliver that message right right I found

433
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:43,570
from a technical perspective it changed

434
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,929
slightly I wasn't necessarily fixing

435
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,789
things

436
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:48,159
my responsibility was looking at things

437
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:49,899
at a much higher level where I did not

438
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:51,070
just look at my part of the business I

439
00:17:49,899 --> 00:17:52,928
had to see how my part of business

440
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,129
interacted with another part of business

441
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:59,950
which interact over the part of the

442
00:17:54,129 --> 00:18:04,509
business and it gave me a better grasp

443
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:08,100
of how the entire business I wasn't

444
00:18:04,509 --> 00:18:08,100
technical I was differently technical

445
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,950
this is my belief in how the system

446
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:38,080
operates and as a result I'm thinking we

447
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:39,309
should do this and when they come back

448
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,309
with the different recommendations say

449
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:44,230
okay well how was I wrong hmm what about

450
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:46,059
what the fact that I have because the

451
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,580
challenge that I have is right a little

452
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:49,100
bit

453
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:51,168
many other executives have is I'm the

454
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:54,019
chief security executive in a company

455
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:56,360
who's running technology I've built and

456
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:57,590
so the things that I remember building

457
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,418
aren't true anymore

458
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:01,279
but I don't know that these ways they're

459
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:02,750
not true and that's the thing that

460
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:05,360
worries me the most is where I'll say

461
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:07,370
well it's safe to do this because we

462
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,389
build all these security subsystems 15

463
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:12,949
years ago and somebody says yeah the

464
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:15,769
years don't have told you we got rid of

465
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:18,169
that this isn't safe

466
00:19:15,769 --> 00:19:20,029
so to basically Jews for that Bayesian

467
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:21,980
analysis I said well I have a set of

468
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:24,260
priors and suggests we can do this and

469
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:26,510
if you give behind evidence that says

470
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:28,490
that's not the right thing learn how my

471
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:30,350
privates were wrong and that's a way to

472
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:32,630
keep technical is at least keep your

473
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,908
knowledge fresh by proving out the

474
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:38,059
crappy stuff so you said something

475
00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:40,220
earlier that triggers I thought there's

476
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:42,320
often a big communication gap between

477
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,519
business folks and technical folks and I

478
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,689
find there's actually another one that

479
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:46,159
we don't have to talk about between

480
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,990
technical folks and security folks

481
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:50,480
you're specifically in the epicenter of

482
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:52,940
all of that but for all of you how did

483
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,950
how if you have but how have you managed

484
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,510
that transition between being the

485
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:58,010
technical person on the one side of the

486
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:59,809
fence and now having to be on the

487
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:01,549
business side of the fence and and be

488
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:12,860
able to bridge that gap specifically for

489
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:14,450
your peers but if you take a technical

490
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,399
concept that you just explained into

491
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:18,350
something so that's the starter is go

492
00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:18,949
learn something and then explain it to

493
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,540
somebody

494
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:22,880
doesn't know anything about that field

495
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:25,040
even the Technic or not you have to use

496
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,610
different language and then practice

497
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:32,840
okay now how can I explain why do we

498
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:35,090
care about ephemeral Disney helmet to

499
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:38,060
somebody who is my security product

500
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:39,679
manager who's here what what language

501
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,810
try to use that they will understand and

502
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,520
after a while you sort of get to this

503
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:46,250
point that you recognize how to switch

504
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,410
languages back and forth and you get

505
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:49,970
that by listening to their language but

506
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,800
if you don't sit and listen to your

507
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:54,560
product people then you'll never learn

508
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,060
about language moves down because

509
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,770
they're not going to translate from your

510
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:00,409
language they'll just put in place the

511
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:04,100
processor if he says ok the security

512
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:06,050
person is lecturing me again if I hear

513
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:08,780
you okay good we'll work on that in the

514
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:10,909
next release and that's sort of a basic

515
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,620
model you can fall into so you have to

516
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:15,500
listen to them to be able to speak that

517
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:17,090
language you like because I work for

518
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,520
penetration testing firm we're usually

519
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:21,679
getting folks bad news so I have to read

520
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,710
the report sometimes in kind of um break

521
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,990
out the source instead of saying things

522
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:29,140
like you know security around excess

523
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:31,550
tape limited security around X

524
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:33,080
yeah I'm fine I find speaking in

525
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:36,500
absolutes as usually I think their

526
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:38,270
capacity and so it's picking up at the

527
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,040
source and sometimes it's a business

528
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:41,600
thesaurus and trying to figure out

529
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,620
what's important to them right what do

530
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,899
you want to hear and how you can help

531
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:47,510
them help themselves as opposed to just

532
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,040
a combination well I just thought that

533
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:52,070
one of the most important things there

534
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:54,050
which is you have to be a partner right

535
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:56,720
if I say to you you have no security

536
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:57,799
then I'm saying that in my world you're

537
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,029
a villain or evil

538
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:00,769
your bath right that's what they're

539
00:21:59,029 --> 00:22:02,779
gonna do about us and so they're gonna

540
00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:05,809
turn around and say well you're the bad

541
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:07,580
security person nobody is the villain in

542
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:08,600
their own story if you think my talk

543
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,519
doesn't wear anything already got to

544
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,730
hear that if you walk with one thing

545
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:14,899
from sorts please walk away with that

546
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:18,399
nobody is the villain in their own story

547
00:22:14,899 --> 00:22:23,238
and so if you use language that vilifies

548
00:22:18,399 --> 00:22:26,090
fail you have to play lose it says

549
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:28,399
despite the beauty great attempts at

550
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:30,199
this the evolution is such that now you

551
00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:32,658
have an exposure like this here's an

552
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:37,070
opportunity to improve them let's

553
00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:38,359
improve together no I think these guys

554
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,918
covered it cuz that's that's really high

555
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:41,658
and I think the key thing is really

556
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:46,039
talking to the business units and things

557
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:49,309
is just listen to them first and not

558
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:50,570
talking absolute is important so here's

559
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:55,249
a funny one that we talked about when we

560
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:57,799
prepped there is a different set of

561
00:22:55,249 --> 00:23:00,320
rules in many ways for technical folks

562
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:01,519
versus what you in management there's

563
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,689
just certain things you don't do anymore

564
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:04,850
certain things you do now that you

565
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:06,950
didn't use to do so what would be some

566
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:08,330
examples of some career limiting moves

567
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:10,580
that usually what that one should avoid

568
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:12,019
when making that transition I'm gonna

569
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,519
start with this one there is there's

570
00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:14,960
there's one word that you could say is

571
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:19,639
an individual contributor that you can

572
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:24,710
never see as a manager no I like saying

573
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:27,350
no my colleague colleagues will tell you

574
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:29,299
that I like saying oh I like the

575
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:31,519
strength of being the strength of my

576
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:34,220
position is individual contributor not

577
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:35,899
to say it was a bad manager but that is

578
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:39,049
absolutely something as a manager you

579
00:23:35,899 --> 00:23:43,090
can't say you can't say the word now you

580
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:43,090
have to find a way of working around

581
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:48,060
your chance to negate an opportunity

582
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:50,129
that somebody may be presenting in front

583
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,960
of you in a political manner so that

584
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:55,770
they don't feel like you just spent them

585
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:58,280
there shoo I think that's probably like

586
00:23:55,770 --> 00:24:00,530
if I were to give somebody any advice

587
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:03,649
learn to not say no

588
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:03,649
[Music]

589
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:15,070
[Music]

590
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:18,310
actually the word yeah you really as a

591
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:25,120
manager you can't you really can't say

592
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:28,770
just know I'd like to do this company

593
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,939
here with our CEO I'm a superior manager

594
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:32,980
technical representative right if you

595
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,780
want to do a thing it's going to take

596
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:37,060
Rob's blessing so it's gonna go before

597
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:39,430
Rob you can comment you can say no you

598
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:41,850
can't do that and you'll go work around

599
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:44,920
to manage things I don't get to say no

600
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:46,929
I'm not the decider I also don't get to

601
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:50,020
say yes like this is the team part of it

602
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:52,510
I don't say no or yes yes exactly

603
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:54,550
right because I'm not the decider if

604
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:56,560
it's something that I get to decide then

605
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:59,560
I can use those two words but if it's

606
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:02,110
somebody else's decision I am NOT going

607
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:04,210
to eat people what I am is it a divisor

608
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:05,500
to the business and the most career

609
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:08,770
limiting things you can do as an

610
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:10,840
executive is being perceived as somebody

611
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:12,910
who's not willing to listen let people

612
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,800
have the argument listen to them and to

613
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:16,780
contribute if I walk in and say there's

614
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,560
no way that I'm gonna let Rob make this

615
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,360
decision

616
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,220
Rob that's gonna read that I don't trust

617
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,120
him he's gonna make the bad decision I

618
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,910
think he's a

619
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:26,949
I just vilified in he reads that goes to

620
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:30,040
do the same thing back to me and well

621
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:31,420
one of us pays the other one and so at

622
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,220
the end of the day that's the one who is

623
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:35,680
likely to survive in this relationship

624
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:37,420
and also going back to what anywhere

625
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,670
saying earlier about partners in

626
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:42,760
business as soon as you say no do you

627
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:46,450
put up a wall that wall as a manager

628
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:49,480
your your job is social if you're trying

629
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:51,400
to be social to you none of us can order

630
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,230
any of our employees to do anything

631
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,450
we're not a military we're not so these

632
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:56,520
we have to convince people to do

633
00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:00,420
something

634
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:03,150
and as soon as you say no that stops the

635
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:08,280
ability for communication conversation

636
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:11,540
and negotiation that's key that's key to

637
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:14,760
building partnerships and having the job

638
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:18,870
if you have the authority yes is a great

639
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:28,980
thing but you know is like the biggest

640
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:33,120
word that you really do this is one kind

641
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:36,210
books an organization and you're moving

642
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:39,750
up the ladder that person that you are

643
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:42,360
unkind with towards might be some yeah

644
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:45,600
right over you and so you know they

645
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:47,969
remember you know back in 2001 when you

646
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,770
malign so it says just better to be

647
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:51,630
kinder and have to remind myself that of

648
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:53,370
all the time because you know in any

649
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:55,590
organization especially larger

650
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:57,419
organizations things happen all the time

651
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:59,129
and all of a sudden that person that you

652
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:02,040
do didn't get along with an accounting

653
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:06,690
is now you know where they might have a

654
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:07,920
mentor who will notice yeah I find

655
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:10,550
that's just a general good rule of

656
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,929
humanity actually yeah one of the

657
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:14,879
business both pilots have a lot to talk

658
00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:17,970
about is if you want to be helpful you

659
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:21,330
want to be kind and you want to be true

660
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:25,380
and that order is kind of important

661
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:28,699
right be brutally honest is much much

662
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:32,270
less helpful and be kind and helpful and

663
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:35,540
have you put a little bit

664
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:38,360
and we've all seen like we're ruthless

665
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:40,550
people have been have advanced

666
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:42,350
themselves very quickly I'm sure you

667
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:43,909
guys have seen this where people will

668
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:45,169
get ahead and that we'll get to it don't

669
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:48,380
get to a ceiling they don't realize

670
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:50,090
because they may be the the the CEO but

671
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:51,679
absolutely everybody underneath them

672
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:54,860
that they don't like them they don't

673
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:57,530
trust them they don't trust at that

674
00:27:54,860 --> 00:28:02,510
point yeah they have all the power they

675
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:04,820
think being kind and helpful it builds

676
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:06,500
longer term relationships definitely

677
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:09,409
so just to build up a little bit of what

678
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:12,200
you guys said Honda's not saying no I

679
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:15,530
think vocabulary matters a lot

680
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:17,179
and specifically somebody taught me this

681
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:19,190
a few years back and I've really

682
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:24,559
embraced it shifting from the mindset of

683
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:27,590
saying yes but - yes and that that one

684
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:29,450
change is hugely different because yes

685
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:31,760
but is like I'm about to tell you why

686
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:33,140
it's not gonna work versus yes and is

687
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,700
here's something I can contribute to

688
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,980
what you already said and maybe in that

689
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,840
mindset shift really opens people up to

690
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:40,340
having conversations that they're open

691
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:43,990
to possibilities instead of trying to

692
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,990
fight you on trying to get their way

693
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:52,840
and look at strategically as an

694
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:56,129
executive every time you open your mouth

695
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:59,830
you are spending political capital every

696
00:28:56,129 --> 00:29:01,600
single time you do anything you have

697
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:03,250
spent political capital just to get

698
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,590
those words out there so that's an

699
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:07,899
investment what are you trying to

700
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:10,779
achieve right it's an individual

701
00:29:07,899 --> 00:29:12,399
contributor you get to say whatever you

702
00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:14,980
want whenever you want if you really do

703
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:32,370
have this nice little base where I could

704
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:34,929
pop up my opinion to achieve my speaking

705
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:37,449
but you may say something true helpful

706
00:29:34,929 --> 00:29:39,309
kind but what was your goal how is that

707
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:41,950
going to return more political capital

708
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:45,070
to you then you spend in uttering those

709
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:47,019
words and doing that calculus all the

710
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:48,700
time it's why you'll often see many

711
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:50,919
executives will think for a moment

712
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:52,659
before saying something because they

713
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:54,700
know that words have consequences for

714
00:29:52,659 --> 00:29:56,710
them and they want to make sure to get

715
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,240
their words right how they say it is

716
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:02,320
important what they're trying to say is

717
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,879
important very cool so what advice would

718
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,439
you give for folks that are maybe

719
00:30:03,879 --> 00:30:06,340
looking to make the transition or maybe

720
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:11,950
wondering if they should make the

721
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:14,559
transition I know you have a struggling

722
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:15,580
on this so I like I said I was looking

723
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,500
for another challenge

724
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:22,830
it wasn't the challenge that I was

725
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:26,259
looking for I enjoy playing with toys

726
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:29,740
but that's that's my job I build

727
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:33,039
firewalls I do security work I I like

728
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:36,549
playing with the technology I will I

729
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:40,809
love it I enjoy it and I lost some of

730
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:42,129
that when I lost the joy in my job when

731
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:43,500
I became a manager because that wasn't

732
00:30:42,129 --> 00:30:46,469
really what I

733
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:50,280
we're doing and that's one of those big

734
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:54,300
things that if I could convey one

735
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:58,440
message to everybody the room listen to

736
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:59,790
me do what you enjoy if you want to try

737
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:04,020
being if you want to try out being

738
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:07,879
management then do it jump in get your

739
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:10,440
feet wet enjoy but do what you're doing

740
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,970
it makes you know from my perspective it

741
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:17,940
makes the 40 hours a week were working

742
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:20,460
40 50 60 I'll open up the questions it's

743
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:22,500
a second I've got another guy time so I

744
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,910
guess my advice would be and I hear this

745
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,560
a lot because I work for clintus we

746
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:28,080
company people always coming in and

747
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,610
asking how can I become a fan tester is

748
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,980
that don't wait for someone to assign

749
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:33,840
you this title or this world just jump

750
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,640
in and get involved with the conference

751
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,850
or contribute to an open source project

752
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:40,260
or just talk to folks and figure out

753
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:42,449
what the need is and then start filling

754
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:44,460
that need and then you become that

755
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:47,130
person that they go to because you've

756
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:50,010
done it and maybe you know you know

757
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:51,360
listens to share and you know just do

758
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:53,580
them just jump in and do the work don't

759
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:56,250
wait for somebody to say I I know what

760
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:57,340
you X Y or Z title or a role that you

761
00:31:56,250 --> 00:32:00,200
want

762
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:01,909
so understand what you want right

763
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,650
therefore the phrase of it there are a

764
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:05,120
lot of companies we're okay if you're

765
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:06,800
tectum individual contributor you only

766
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,169
go this high and then management is

767
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:11,030
everything above that if that's the case

768
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:13,760
you say oh I guess it's my next is a

769
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:18,680
half made manager optimized hiring we

770
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:20,090
have a booth find the place where you

771
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,400
can do that if that's what you want to

772
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:26,209
do don't need a manager because it's

773
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:28,610
expected it's a very different job but

774
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:30,230
due to learning this is the transition

775
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:31,909
from individual contributor to manager

776
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:34,310
is one that you should express interest

777
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:35,570
in well in advance go talk to your HR

778
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:38,120
department if you have a business

779
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:40,220
partner in HR say look I'd be interested

780
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,209
in importing this is a career government

781
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,880
we should be having a career

782
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:46,570
conversation with your manager at least

783
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,590
once a year if not weekly or monthly

784
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:50,689
we're saying these are the things I

785
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:52,310
might be interested in what are the

786
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:54,830
classes I could take right if your

787
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:57,320
company offer training pretty managers

788
00:32:54,830 --> 00:33:00,199
get that before you become a manager it

789
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:01,429
will make your life a lot easier to

790
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:10,040
learn how to deal with different ways

791
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:11,990
before you actually have them go get

792
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:14,180
practice added in places that are less

793
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,410
risky like go run a conference or enjoy

794
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:18,350
the conference they're always looking

795
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:20,090
for people to wrangle volunteers you

796
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:22,520
want talk about a hard management job

797
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:24,530
that's one but go learn that it is like

798
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,650
do I like dealing with people or not

799
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:28,870
because if you do that too

800
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:31,390
like this if you find a different job

801
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:33,070
but when you want it and many of you

802
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:35,130
will and for the people who didn't come

803
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:38,379
into this room they'll work for you

804
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:40,150
right go after that look passion and

805
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,980
recognize that the day that you start

806
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:44,980
that job you are starting with the

807
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:46,210
bottom even though you have the benefit

808
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:48,430
of having all of your technical

809
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:50,980
background and all of your expertise you

810
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:53,620
are now a manager manager is the bottom

811
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:54,430
of the management career path even

812
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:56,260
though when you were the technical

813
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:59,080
person you said oh that's the middle of

814
00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:01,600
the company new career field this is an

815
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,399
entry-level position that's what you two

816
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,399
guys will you give up to go be a manager

817
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:08,260
you're just give a little play again

818
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:09,790
negatory back up again and so drive at

819
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,800
it with the same figure that you did

820
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:13,330
when you were your entry-level technical

821
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,100
person trying to move up the ranks of

822
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:18,520
technician one thing I'll throw into

823
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:20,379
that is by doing that you are actually

824
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,699
putting yourself on a new path little

825
00:34:20,379 --> 00:34:23,110
growth and there's a lot of new energy

826
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:25,029
that comes in your life by doing that

827
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:26,919
and I can tell you in the last eight

828
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:29,500
years I've grown more than I have in the

829
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:30,908
previous 20 just by having to take on

830
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,350
completely new challenges and

831
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:33,879
responsibilities because the previous

832
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:35,770
one you know a bunch of the previous

833
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:37,210
years were doing similar things over and

834
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:38,770
over again versus taking on something

835
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:41,020
completely different so it stretches you

836
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:43,210
in a way that very few other thing as

837
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:45,310
well and nobody will make wave the magic

838
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:47,649
wand and anoint you manager you as you

839
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:49,540
guys said you have to start doing taking

840
00:34:47,649 --> 00:34:52,509
on those roles before somebody anoint

841
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:55,899
you in notices unless you

842
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:58,570
yeah one thing I can say even if you

843
00:34:55,899 --> 00:35:01,359
maybe this advice is awesome the idea of

844
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:03,580
taking classes getting involved the

845
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,960
classes that I took as a manager have

846
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:07,170
helped my career even though I'm not a

847
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,170
manager

848
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:11,670
help me be able to sit up here and have

849
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:13,710
this conversation with you so they they

850
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:15,900
do have practical value even if you

851
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:17,880
choose to not be a manager a lot of its

852
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,750
people skills they're good to have so

853
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,330
even if you say uh

854
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:22,500
you I don't want to be a manager you

855
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:25,259
didn't waste your time taking these

856
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,850
classes but I can guarantee you you're

857
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:28,980
always growing by taking on new things

858
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:31,310
we do have time for maybe one or two

859
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,310
quick questions

860
00:35:54,339 --> 00:35:58,790
so that's a really I've been very

861
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:01,550
blessed that almost all of the jobs I

862
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:04,640
think that offer seriousness more good

863
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:07,069
funds that said I can share experiences

864
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:10,848
from a lot of other folks and one

865
00:36:07,069 --> 00:36:13,099
question is why do they want you and why

866
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:14,690
do they want that position and if you

867
00:36:13,099 --> 00:36:18,230
don't know the answer to those two

868
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:20,030
questions be careful right

869
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:21,950
sometimes there exist positions that are

870
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:23,690
oh look we have to hire a director of

871
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:26,990
information security because the audit

872
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:28,460
team said we have to that's not a

873
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:31,669
position you're gonna want to because

874
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:32,960
nobody actually cares about it so look

875
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:34,700
for the water right somebody said

876
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,859
somebody got breached the air

877
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:38,689
Cowperthwaite was here yesterday right

878
00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:41,029
so his previous job before he worked for

879
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:43,490
for security was as the CEO for

880
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:46,099
Providence Health who was breached

881
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:47,990
and so the everybody cared by law they

882
00:36:46,099 --> 00:36:50,059
were then required to have a CSS the

883
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:51,950
consent decree with the FTC but the

884
00:36:50,059 --> 00:36:53,270
whole company was invested in the

885
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:55,910
success of that position

886
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:57,829
that's an awesome spot to be in now how

887
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:59,660
many lasted as long as he did even the

888
00:36:57,829 --> 00:37:01,460
normally that's a transition job first

889
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:03,649
person has two years in there gone then

890
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:06,260
you get somebody more stable and he was

891
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:08,299
there for quite a while but that's what

892
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:10,569
you want to look for why why that

893
00:37:08,299 --> 00:37:12,589
position and why me

894
00:37:10,569 --> 00:37:13,609
and I would say if you're in the

895
00:37:12,589 --> 00:37:16,299
position you're trying to deal with

896
00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:16,299
those challenges

897
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,230
there are human resources opportunities

898
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,750
for you but I found what helped me the

899
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:26,330
most in which specifically dealing with

900
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:29,990
that wonderful resource triangle is

901
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:32,569
basic project management books they help

902
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:34,970
deal with a lot of that resource the

903
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:37,190
cost of time options because when you're

904
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:40,669
dealing as a as a manager managing a

905
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:42,440
team of people and it's not much

906
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:45,290
different from project management where

907
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:47,660
you're saying alright I have these

908
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:49,130
quantity of projects to do and this X

909
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:51,529
quantity of resources to get them done

910
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:53,090
and here's where I need to do them what

911
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:55,130
am I going to be successful at what am I

912
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:57,080
not going to successful at and that's

913
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:58,370
the same it's almost the same formula to

914
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:00,740
reduce if you were just planning that

915
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:03,049
project for step one step two step three

916
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:05,470
step four was the cost was the time what

917
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:05,470
do I have the resources

918
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:37,440
and they become an obstacle to change

919
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:54,940
what is your advice has it go up for the

920
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:57,970
WAGs to become more objective and it's

921
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:59,200
really a personal it is really hard and

922
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:01,870
sometimes you have to understand does

923
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,270
the company want you to be that sort of

924
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:05,319
parent to the product or not because in

925
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:08,440
something there were years where

926
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:11,710
literally I was even though our services

927
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:13,720
are all owned by engineering big news

928
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:16,240
engineering and I'm gonna InfoSec I

929
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:18,069
owned our most profitable thing like I

930
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,589
had no engineers work for it but we the

931
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:22,990
second if to Paulo say what should we do

932
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:25,900
they coming and that was what the

933
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:27,250
company wanted that for a while and then

934
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,750
someone said ok we don't want that

935
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:30,850
anymore and that was one of the hardest

936
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:32,830
days of my life like my baby is gone

937
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:35,790
it's that I've thrown over my kids went

938
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:35,790
to college might feel like

939
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:42,320
but it's really hard it's one of the

940
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:45,290
most important things I can suggest that

941
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:48,470
you do is get people who work for you

942
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:49,970
who are willing to challenge you and if

943
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:52,370
you surround yourself with people who

944
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,939
are afraid of you and who will come to

945
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:54,770
you instead

946
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:57,680
look here you're making a bad call up

947
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:59,180
here and it's embarrassing me then

948
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,830
you're gonna have a problem because

949
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:02,149
you'll embarrass yourself and nobody

950
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:04,460
will tell you that you have done

951
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:06,320
something and that's really hard to get

952
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:07,790
to I was just going to say you have to

953
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,170
get someone higher up involved who's

954
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:11,720
going to make the business decision and

955
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:14,240
say you have to change n2oz product or

956
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:16,970
framework or whatever because it's not

957
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,350
helping us further our business and so

958
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:21,819
it becomes a business decision at that

959
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:21,819
point that's taken out of their hands

960
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:26,480
all right so just we're almost out of

961
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:28,069
time pitches really quick I just wanted

962
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:32,110
to have any closing thoughts and

963
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:34,250
specifically would you do it again and

964
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:47,030
but in general closing thoughts for the

965
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:52,700
audience in addition to that but I

966
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:54,880
suspect they find the place for what you

967
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:57,379
love to do is what they want me to do

968
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,150
right along the way we might have to

969
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:00,680
suck it up and do a job you're as

970
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:02,690
excited about their eyes inside of it

971
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:04,580
out those will stop those are ears

972
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:06,950
you're gonna lose that's maybe time

973
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:08,480
you've committed but find the place

974
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:11,000
where you are going to have a blast

975
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,140
every single day even when you're in the

976
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,990
middle of some of the most horrific

977
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:17,750
incidents like heartbleed suntanned I

978
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:19,609
had a blast every single day I would

979
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:22,630
come into work and go say how are you

980
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:22,630
and I'm like I'm awesome

981
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:34,580
so they should try to take my job they

982
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:36,920
should take something else I would

983
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:39,170
definitely continue to try on different

984
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,600
roles I guess the one thing that I would

985
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:43,130
say is I see folks struggling with this

986
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,680
along with it running it against

987
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:47,780
obstacles whether it be people or you

988
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,520
know the the framework of the business

989
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:51,530
don't spend that much time trying to

990
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,060
change the business if you have to go

991
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:55,610
somewhere else to do what you want to do

992
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:57,740
or green or an opportunity again don't

993
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:59,150
wait for somebody to say all of a sudden

994
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:01,850
we've changed our minds that you should

995
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:05,870
be in xy0 to make your own role and they

996
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:07,630
have to change business yep I have to

997
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:10,460
say I have to depend on the opportunity

998
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:11,930
for me I would I enjoy the technical

999
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:13,820
work as a percent forty five times

1000
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:15,410
already but if I saw the right

1001
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,820
opportunity I thought it was something I

1002
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:21,680
was gonna rejoin him that was my love I

1003
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:23,770
regenerated so it's for me and so sure I

1004
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:26,839
can definitely relate to it he's uh

1005
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:29,180
comment of do what you love and I mean I

1006
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:31,010
love what I do eat really hard we were

1007
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:32,839
in conference calls up to six in the

1008
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:35,120
morning one night and I loved it it was

1009
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,770
a blast the whole time we had fun so if

1010
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,750
you're not if you don't find that the

1011
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:40,580
thing you're doing is energizing if it's

1012
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:42,890
draining consider doing something else

1013
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:44,779
that's best night advice I could ever

1014
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:48,170
give anybody life's short doing what you

1015
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:49,550
said hate sucks so don't do it so with

1016
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:51,860
that I think that's all the time we have

1017
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:54,140
and thanks the talent and we're gonna be

1018
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:55,750
doing speed networking in this room next

1019
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:59,078
Thanks

1020
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:59,079
