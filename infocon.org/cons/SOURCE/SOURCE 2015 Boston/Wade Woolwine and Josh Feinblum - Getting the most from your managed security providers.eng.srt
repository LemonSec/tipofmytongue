1
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:16,189
good morning Southworth

2
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,190
packed packed room

3
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:21,610
obligatory introductions I'm Josh

4
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,850
Feinbloom I'm the vice president of

5
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:27,220
information security at rapid7 I'm lucky

6
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:31,000
and that I get to do for a living what I

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:33,580
enjoy doing as a child I've spent the

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,890
past eleven years building security

9
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:39,629
programs at organizations ranging from

10
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:39,630
large federal financial institutions

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,950
into the past five or six years at

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,900
hyper-growth technology companies mostly

13
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:49,210
either rebooting a security organization

14
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,280
or starting them from scratch and I'm

15
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:53,530
lucky enough to be joined by my good

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,800
friend Wade wool wine today talk about a

17
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:58,629
very fun topic very fun topic widow Anna

18
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,949
I run incident response programs for

19
00:00:58,629 --> 00:01:04,720
rapid7 I have been fortunate to have

20
00:01:02,949 --> 00:01:06,880
been part of some pretty exceptional

21
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,580
Incident Response Teams including Mandy

22
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,130
and AOL and I bring a bunch of that

23
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:15,840
experience forward with me in in my

24
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,839
quest to build these services at rapid7

25
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:22,799
so I think we decided to this talk as a

26
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,309
justice ism some conversations we were

27
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,170
having around the complexity of the

28
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,610
vendor marketplace that's going to be

29
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,369
its might be an interesting talk because

30
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,829
we both work for vendors we both work

31
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:37,500
for the same vendor but there's still a

32
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:39,689
little bit of cynicism at least as a

33
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,250
practitioner and I think the viewpoint

34
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,298
from the vendor's perspective was it

35
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,740
will be an interesting compare and

36
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:51,090
contrast we live in in this world where

37
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:53,009
we've got these legacy outsourcing

38
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,319
offerings like different types of pen

39
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,810
testing or advisory services or program

40
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:59,220
assessments and over the past maybe six

41
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,220
to eight years we've seen an explosion

42
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:04,798
of these managed security offerings

43
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:08,869
right and they really fulfill two needs

44
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:12,239
right one is this highly specific

45
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:14,069
function that is an expensive resource

46
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,450
and it's something that hopefully you

47
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:17,910
don't need frequently or if you do need

48
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,638
you don't need enough to justify a

49
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:22,109
full-time employee to work on it and

50
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,739
then you've got the other end of the

51
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:28,799
spectrum which is the more commoditized

52
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:31,980
or junior moving the things from point A

53
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:33,090
to point B and there's definitely some

54
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,709
mix towards the middle of the spectrum

55
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,989
but you'll find when you're looking at

56
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:38,430
program offerings or managed services

57
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:43,560
you're gonna end up on either one of

58
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:45,450
those spectrums and I think it's easy to

59
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,739
get to jump in and get lost and we'll

60
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,798
talk a little bit later about how you

61
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:51,720
select vendors but one of the things

62
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:53,940
that is important as you're trying to

63
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,410
dissect which vendors you want to select

64
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:59,669
to supplement your programs that you

65
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:01,410
don't end up in a situation where you're

66
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:03,209
saying I'm just going to use one vendor

67
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,459
that Dell SecureWorks to do everything

68
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:07,500
ok I saw something that I've seen a lot

69
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,700
different vendors specialize in

70
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,319
different things so when you're starting

71
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,839
to put this puzzle together figure out

72
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,429
what what use cases you're trying to

73
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,930
solve for internally what strengths you

74
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,660
have internally of what weaknesses you

75
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:22,070
have and figure out which vendors

76
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,070
helps supplement each of those areas

77
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:29,200
so before you even move into the vendor

78
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,450
selection process you you have to

79
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,089
understand where your program stands

80
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:36,760
today and where you want your program to

81
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:39,040
be tomorrow next year three years from

82
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,859
now because you're gonna have very

83
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,299
specific areas where you're good and

84
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,420
you're gonna have very specific areas

85
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:49,450
where you are deficient so one of the

86
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:52,530
things that I recommend when engaging

87
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:56,140
customers kind of in a presale model is

88
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:58,750
look at seven key areas for your

89
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:00,250
security program specifically around

90
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,050
threat detection scent response but it

91
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,720
applies pretty globally on top of that

92
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:08,200
first area is preparation so preparation

93
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,989
is policies processes any plans that you

94
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,238
have in place things like that and then

95
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:15,940
moving into the more technology specific

96
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,700
technology and people specific areas for

97
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,660
prevention so you want to be able to use

98
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,760
technology where it's going to be

99
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,500
effective so that your people don't have

100
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,230
to do the heavy lifting there and

101
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,370
prevention is one of those areas where

102
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:29,350
technology actually does a fairly good

103
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:31,960
job whether we're talking about IPS

104
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:33,790
whether we're talking about antivirus

105
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,520
and its ability to block threats before

106
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,530
they materialize into something real

107
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,140
those that the time saved by using

108
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:45,280
technology from a people perspective is

109
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:48,039
extremely important as a manager of

110
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,900
analysts there is nothing that a highly

111
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,900
technical highly specialized analysts

112
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:55,090
hate more than doing really really

113
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,729
boring work that could be done through

114
00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:00,460
effective technology so moving off from

115
00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:01,870
prevention once once you've established

116
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,219
you're not gonna be able to block all

117
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,229
threats you need to move into a

118
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,880
detection phase right so evaluate how

119
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:08,169
you're doing on a detection standpoint

120
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,300
whether that be technology or people

121
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:12,250
again it's really important to

122
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,050
understand that people technology

123
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,850
process is not just something that is

124
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,700
buzzword II it's actually a real thing

125
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:21,480
you can't develop a program without

126
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,849
having all of those components

127
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,080
moving from a detection into response

128
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,520
how are you going to be effective at

129
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,440
your response because breaches are gonna

130
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,240
happen it's inevitable you may detect

131
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,700
them you may not detect them for a

132
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,440
period of time but there is gonna be a

133
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,719
response aspect to every single security

134
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,700
breach and then kind of snowballing

135
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,810
through the last three remediation how

136
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,860
are you gonna block the threats once

137
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,950
you've identified how you're going to

138
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,540
contain the attacker clean up how are

139
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,909
you going to restore normal business

140
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,890
operating processes and most importantly

141
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,720
at least in my book how are you gonna

142
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:54,030
drive lessons learn to feed that back

143
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,500
into your security program so that next

144
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:59,190
time that this happens you're gonna be

145
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:02,100
bigger better faster so be real with

146
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,780
where you stand today in those seven key

147
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,000
areas there may be more that those are

148
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,549
really good areas to really start your

149
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,750
focus as you're as you're moving through

150
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,750
your vendor selection process

151
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:18,759
and dovetailing off of that where are

152
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:21,039
you strong right so in the seven key

153
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:22,630
areas that I talked about where are you

154
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,880
really feel like you're doing a good job

155
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:26,409
and it may not just be a feeling on your

156
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,789
behalf of me you may want to bring in an

157
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,620
external auditor or an external

158
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:30,280
consultant to evaluate what you already

159
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,229
have in place

160
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,599
maybe that's the beginning of your

161
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:36,880
vendor vendor selection process because

162
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:38,800
you're gonna want to go through and not

163
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,240
just how you feel about your program

164
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,830
because if you've built that program you

165
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,240
feel pretty possessive about it at least

166
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:46,240
I know I do when I build programs I'm

167
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,860
like no no I built that I know how to do

168
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,659
these things you can't find anything

169
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,979
wrong with it well you bring in a third

170
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:53,530
party maybe they have some different

171
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:55,419
areas of expertise than you do maybe you

172
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:57,190
have some different experiences that

173
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:59,469
they can bring to the table all very

174
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:01,870
important things to do so you know be

175
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:03,400
real about where you're strong maybe

176
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,110
it's on the technology front maybe

177
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,818
you've invested a ton of money and

178
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:09,099
bought in the biggest and best

179
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:10,300
technology resources that you have that

180
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:12,880
as a result you've kind of burned your

181
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:15,280
entire budget so you have no people to

182
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,199
to look at that technology to look at

183
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,719
the alerts derive by that technology to

184
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,070
actually perform the analysis when when

185
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:23,229
one of those technology events fires

186
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:25,090
maybe you've invested very heavily in

187
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:27,969
your people and now your people are

188
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:29,710
carrying the brunt of doing all the work

189
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:31,330
that the technology should be doing

190
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:33,219
maybe you've invested very heavily in

191
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,659
both so you have great technology you

192
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:36,219
have great people you haven't defined

193
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:37,599
any processes so everyone's run around

194
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:38,949
like chickens with their heads cut off

195
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,409
and that is a never a good situation

196
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:42,969
when it comes to incident response so be

197
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:45,219
real about where you've invested already

198
00:07:42,969 --> 00:07:46,569
be real about the areas of strength that

199
00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:48,280
you have because when you're selecting

200
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:49,509
your vendor you're going to want to be

201
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,919
able to pick a vendor that's going to be

202
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:55,229
able to complement the areas where

203
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:55,229
you're strong not create redundancies

204
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,330
one of the most frequently forgotten

205
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,590
components of effective relationships

206
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:05,080
with your third party is is this

207
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:07,628
confident networking you never want to

208
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,789
be in a situation where you're dealing

209
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:12,189
with a crisis or something that requires

210
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:14,349
a rapid response from you and you're

211
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:16,090
googling for a company or you're calling

212
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:18,878
a salesperson to say hey I need your

213
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:20,109
help what do you recommend there yeah I

214
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,599
think the first thing that comes to mind

215
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:23,710
are the external notifications from law

216
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:25,300
enforcement saying hey you've been

217
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,919
hacked and you're like oh my goodness I

218
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,240
need to go find somebody to help me with

219
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:30,789
IR and you're picking up the phone and

220
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,950
calling mandiant or one of the other big

221
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:36,039
name companies that that does that and

222
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,479
you're getting you're gonna start with

223
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,500
sales process probably to get slammed

224
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:42,519
because they're coming to them last

225
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:44,320
minute on on hourly fees so but there's

226
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:45,790
a lot of other things that will happen

227
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,589
your career you'll get a new job we've

228
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:51,060
got a new boss you'll get a new board

229
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:54,279
member who has interest in in security

230
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:55,959
your organization will change right and

231
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:57,670
you're gonna end up in a situation where

232
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:59,529
you might say man I wish I had somebody

233
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:03,160
that could come validate my assessment

234
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:04,959
of this program or man I wish somebody

235
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,630
could come do a maturity assessment of

236
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,880
my organization to help me figure out

237
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:12,370
where I start first and if you're ever

238
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,959
in those points and when you enter

239
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:15,250
because I think you'll probably all

240
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:18,099
enter these points of time some point

241
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:21,190
your career you're gonna be operating at

242
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,540
the clock where your capital within an

243
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:24,730
organization is going to be largely

244
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:26,740
determined by how you function the first

245
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,790
90 days you're there okay so you don't

246
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,269
want to do is you don't to be in a

247
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:33,189
situation where you're trying to find

248
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:34,510
some somebody that you trust that you

249
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:37,660
can work with to come in and do an

250
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:40,800
assessment do a test help you better

251
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,800
understand your program needs

252
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,370
you know with that 90-day clock ticking

253
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,390
so if you start now and you spend your

254
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,310
netid you know the next two or three

255
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:49,110
years building relationships with a

256
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:51,209
couple of people at different Incident

257
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:54,300
Response firms different pen testing

258
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:56,550
firms different form management managed

259
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,140
service providers it allows you to enter

260
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,609
a situation it's okay look we're gonna

261
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,410
get an external assessment we're going

262
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,240
to outsource until we can staff up this

263
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,589
small management solution these over to

264
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,600
pick up the phone and talk to people you

265
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:10,460
trust about how how that how you

266
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:12,990
orchestrate all of that I think that

267
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,010
there's one other interesting component

268
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,870
that a lot of people in the security

269
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:18,420
space miss out on and if there's

270
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:20,130
networking within your organization okay

271
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:23,010
if you're ever in a situation where you

272
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:24,810
need to go get a third party having the

273
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:26,819
relationships within your legal function

274
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:28,619
your finance function but you can go to

275
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:32,190
either your peer or somebody who has

276
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,420
actual I'll use the word power don't

277
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,010
like using if there's actual power to

278
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,599
make something happen can help

279
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,260
accelerate your ability to push things

280
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,510
through

281
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:43,200
much faster if the first time you're

282
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:44,700
your VP of FPA is hearing of you is

283
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,350
after you've been there for three years

284
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,670
you have a new boss who wants to do a

285
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:50,040
program assessment in the next two

286
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:51,479
months then you go and they have no

287
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,560
working relationship with you you're

288
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,400
gonna you're gonna struggle

289
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,500
unnecessarily so make sure you mix the

290
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,030
external networking with the internal

291
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,160
networking because when you enter those

292
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:04,350
I won't even call them times of crisis

293
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,380
that would certainly apply but times of

294
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:09,870
the necessitate a rapid response to some

295
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,820
shift in your organization if you don't

296
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:13,590
have those those dots connected you're

297
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:17,310
you're gonna struggle a lot more than

298
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:20,070
you need to move up it's not just about

299
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:22,140
professional networking to help you in

300
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:23,700
your current job if you kind of think

301
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,699
about how all of you got to where you

302
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,980
are in your career

303
00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:30,618
have leaned on people to augment your

304
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:33,290
knowledge to help you get to the next

305
00:11:30,619 --> 00:11:35,179
stage in your career to help you acquire

306
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:36,829
some expertise that will be needed at

307
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:38,059
some point in your career what we're

308
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:39,858
talking about here is just an extension

309
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:41,719
of that you always have to keep learning

310
00:11:39,859 --> 00:11:43,339
in this industry it's never gonna change

311
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,839
because the attacker is always learning

312
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:46,459
they're always finding new techniques

313
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:47,689
there are new vulnerabilities coming out

314
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:49,069
every day there's new software coming

315
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:52,569
out every day which is introducing more

316
00:11:49,069 --> 00:11:54,410
vulnerabilities so really being able to

317
00:11:52,569 --> 00:11:55,998
continue that professional networking

318
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:58,209
throughout your career will not only

319
00:11:55,999 --> 00:12:00,799
help your own knowledge your own

320
00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:02,959
intelligence but will also help in in

321
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:05,299
the time of crises right so I know that

322
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,248
I have friends who were really good at

323
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:08,899
OPSEC I have friends that are really

324
00:12:07,249 --> 00:12:10,279
good at network analysis I have friends

325
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:13,609
that are really good at malware analysis

326
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:16,639
when I encounter something in my day to

327
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:17,749
day work that I am blocking on they're

328
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,579
gonna be one of the first calls that I

329
00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:21,290
make hey I'm looking at this particular

330
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:22,878
thing oh yeah I happen to see that last

331
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:26,299
week here's some details and that's

332
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:27,529
always going to help accelerate the the

333
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:29,029
information gathering and then

334
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:30,109
subsequently add investigations so on

335
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:33,139
and so forth if you're talking about a

336
00:12:30,109 --> 00:12:37,850
breach specifically if you are a leader

337
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:39,739
in your organization's InfoSec program

338
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:41,329
having that professional networking will

339
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:43,609
allow you to have brainstorming

340
00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:45,199
conversations with your network so that

341
00:12:43,609 --> 00:12:46,939
you can derive the best possible

342
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:48,410
solution remember I just talked about

343
00:12:46,939 --> 00:12:50,569
kind of getting pigeon-holed this is my

344
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:53,059
program I built it I think it's the best

345
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:54,769
thing since sliced bread well if you

346
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:56,629
have a professional network to lean on

347
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:57,709
to bounce those ideas off of maybe

348
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:59,569
you'll come up with something that you

349
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:01,608
didn't consider maybe there's a change

350
00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:03,439
in the particular pieces of technology

351
00:13:01,609 --> 00:13:04,759
that you're implementing or the HR

352
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:08,419
hiring processes or whatever it may be

353
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:10,399
that will help make your own progress

354
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:13,699
towards your goal as an InfoSec manager

355
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,529
better then and expanding on that for

356
00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:17,599
just a second just to put yourself in a

357
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:19,170
situation you're managing a security

358
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,600
team and

359
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:24,089
your general counsel or every report to

360
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,639
their your CFO comes and says hey we

361
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:28,110
just entered into an LOI with a company

362
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,060
to acquire them what do we need to do

363
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:32,190
for a security perspective if you've

364
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,719
never managed that before like it's just

365
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:35,130
a very like that's I think that's one of

366
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,380
the more common things that I've started

367
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:38,730
to see people struggle with a little bit

368
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,500
you don't manage something like that

369
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,880
before being able to pick up the phone

370
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,740
and call somebody even if you don't have

371
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,779
budget to outsource the work and say hey

372
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,980
what are the 10 things I need to ask we

373
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:48,660
make a huge difference we don't think

374
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,510
you look a lot a lot smarter internally

375
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,100
I think what happens is in the security

376
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:54,810
industry people will overcompensate so

377
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,579
if they're not familiar with role

378
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,630
they'll throw the book at it let's say

379
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:59,219
okay we gotta do these things we have

380
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:01,949
checked these four hundred controls we

381
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,209
got a you know do static code analysis

382
00:14:01,949 --> 00:14:05,609
of every single line of code in every

383
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:06,750
application some of those may be

384
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:09,000
relevant depending on the acquisition

385
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,440
but if you come in you throw it all at

386
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,930
somebody like the general counsel and

387
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,430
they've got a 60-day LOI they're gonna

388
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:16,709
be like you're crazy right so

389
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:18,420
understanding what approaches work and

390
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:20,069
having those resources to lean on it

391
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,149
gives you a lot of wiggle room even if

392
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:24,170
you don't have money to spend on

393
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:24,170
professional services

394
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:30,070
this is this is the fun part and this is

395
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:32,890
what really I think was the catalyst to

396
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:33,910
us wanting to talk about the subject one

397
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:35,620
of the things that happens really

398
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:37,000
frequently somebody will go to start a

399
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,770
program and we'll say okay man I need a

400
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,440
vole management program and then go find

401
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:43,900
a company and the outsource it and

402
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:47,230
there's no processes that support that

403
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:49,360
function right so outsourcing something

404
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:50,589
to a managed service provider doesn't

405
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,839
negate the need to have internal

406
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:55,240
business processes around it right so

407
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:57,520
step one before you start to think about

408
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,620
hey what vendor do I want you have to

409
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,189
define a what problem you're trying to

410
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,410
solve

411
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,000
but tactical with the requirements

412
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:06,040
around what these vendors need to do and

413
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,720
figure out either how it integrates with

414
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,310
existing business processes or what you

415
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,520
need to what you need to put in place

416
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:15,910
but you you lose three months worth of

417
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:17,589
money if you implement a loan management

418
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:19,660
program then you haven't spoken with

419
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:21,490
anybody in your IP function they're

420
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,810
gonna start getting some feed of data

421
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,220
saying hey look at all these vulnerable

422
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:26,589
servers and you're not going to make any

423
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:28,480
progress same same thing would go from

424
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:30,339
an incident response perspective if

425
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,320
you're standing up systems and you'll

426
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:34,540
have requirements you might sign a sign

427
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,920
up and NSA get somebody in boy on board

428
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,930
and then you're realizing wait a second

429
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,660
they don't have any capability of

430
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:43,150
monitoring AWS the Rackspace they do a

431
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,800
great job on my my stage call network

432
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:47,650
perimeter but in the software-defined

433
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,420
networks they flounder and fail alright

434
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:51,040
so if you're not going to tactical with

435
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,779
what will happen and you just just see

436
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,400
it time and time again this somebody

437
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:56,350
will go in they'll make a choice on a

438
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,630
vendor and then 12 to 24 months later

439
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:01,070
they have to switch vendors which just

440
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:03,560
creates a lot of work

441
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:06,020
always quit vendors in real-world

442
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,060
situations or have them have them

443
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:10,160
simulate real-world situations with you

444
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:12,890
get an engineer on the phone and say hey

445
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,230
you see this how do you handle it now

446
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:17,449
this is I don't be a lot of people that

447
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,980
do this and it sounds a little silly but

448
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,630
it will help you understand the caliber

449
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,980
a person that is working at the

450
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,810
organization you're dealing with a

451
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,940
different situation if you're talking

452
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:28,130
with the manager or director or a Nessy

453
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,780
or different components of an

454
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:32,450
organization that are supposed to be

455
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,680
customer facing I always always force

456
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,690
somebody to put somebody who's not

457
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,250
generally customer facing in front of me

458
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,450
if I'm doing this because I want to

459
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:45,560
understand what type of person I'm

460
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:47,270
working with I I think the other negated

461
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,339
component of vendor selection is

462
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:51,439
employee churn at the vendor there's

463
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,850
certain tasks that are moving from point

464
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,530
A to point B and it doesn't matter if

465
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:56,630
somebody's there for 12 or 18 months

466
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:58,610
there's certain functions that require

467
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:00,590
the people working on your data to have

468
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,900
an actual architectural understanding of

469
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:05,300
your environment so if you're expecting

470
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,619
somebody to look at different events in

471
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,089
your environment and tell you what's bad

472
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:10,129
what's evil what requires that you be

473
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:12,948
woken up at 3 o'clock in the morning and

474
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:15,560
you haven't dug into what that churn

475
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:17,810
looks like you might end up in a really

476
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,948
crummy situation where every time

477
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:20,179
somebody gets familiar with your

478
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:23,000
environment they're moving on to another

479
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:24,439
job and then this whole onboarding

480
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,869
process for the people managing or

481
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:29,180
interacting with your account that can

482
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:30,889
help explain what's going on - -

483
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,870
probably more junior level folks that

484
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:35,350
are doing the day-to-day work disappear

485
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:38,330
and that that's incredibly disruptive so

486
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:39,800
summarizing you gotta define will

487
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:42,560
probably you're trying to solve and be

488
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:45,050
specific but make sure your vendors do

489
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:47,240
what you need them to do not just hey

490
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:48,710
help me build a ball management or an

491
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,960
incident detection program because

492
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:53,539
everybody will say yes

493
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,100
and you've got to dig in and make sure

494
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:57,679
that they actually employ the people

495
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,269
that can help I hope you solve your

496
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,950
problems and interact with your team the

497
00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:02,600
way the way that you want to and I think

498
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:05,659
it all goes back to the idea basically

499
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:08,509
the be real with yourself if you if you

500
00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:10,009
don't go through that process you you

501
00:18:08,509 --> 00:18:11,269
could very well end up in a situation

502
00:18:10,009 --> 00:18:13,970
where you've got two guys that are

503
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:15,859
exceptional at solving problem a you get

504
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:17,960
a managed service provider is also

505
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:20,119
excellent at solving problem a and

506
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,470
instead of complimenting each other

507
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:22,970
you're now you've now created a

508
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:24,080
redundancy and you're gonna jump in

509
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,309
you're gonna say well now I've got two

510
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,158
more management guys that don't know how

511
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:29,928
to do anything else except what the

512
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:31,609
service is doing it happens it happens

513
00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:34,840
all the time so make sure you you

514
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:34,840
understand that dynamic

515
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,520
all right so you've gone through and

516
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,710
you've selected your vendor they're

517
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,720
important now you have to manage the

518
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:47,370
relationship because you have signed a

519
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,230
one-year contract a two-year contract a

520
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:52,620
3-year contract this vendor is going to

521
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:56,130
be around for a while also worth noting

522
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:57,510
that as you select your vendor and move

523
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:00,570
into the managing the relationship

524
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:03,330
portion remember that you're bringing

525
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:06,090
this vendor on to augment something that

526
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:07,889
you already have in place maybe it's a

527
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:10,800
technical need maybe you're bringing

528
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:13,530
them on to help you build programs the

529
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:17,580
important piece is there going to be a

530
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:19,680
an extension of your existing program so

531
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:22,710
with that you need to make sure that not

532
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:24,540
only from a technology perspective and a

533
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:26,430
people perspective and a needs being met

534
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:28,649
perspective that there's a good match

535
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:32,220
there but you also need a good cultural

536
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:35,730
match so if you are a start-up comm for

537
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:38,940
example and you bring in a big stuffy

538
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:41,280
top-5 consulting group it's not really

539
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:44,730
gonna work out well are they really

540
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:47,370
gonna be able to understand why there's

541
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,450
BYOD I mean assuming hopefully somehow

542
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:51,270
they would but that's the first example

543
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:52,650
that that came to mind is a big stuffy

544
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,360
organization going to be able to

545
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:56,910
understand why you are a little bit more

546
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,860
liberal with your policies for example

547
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:00,660
you're acceptable use policies and

548
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:03,199
things like that all right getting back

549
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:05,520
into the managing the relationship piece

550
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,549
the first part about managing the

551
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,999
relationship is the kickoff

552
00:20:07,549 --> 00:20:13,610
you as the customer need to be very

553
00:20:10,999 --> 00:20:16,129
comfortable understanding exactly how

554
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:19,519
these services are going to be delivered

555
00:20:16,129 --> 00:20:21,590
for you again because this is an

556
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:24,830
extension of your existing security

557
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:27,350
program if somewhere along the line

558
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:29,090
you're sorry if you if you go with the

559
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:30,320
kickoff and you're just kind of very

560
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,519
loosey goosey about getting the

561
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,840
information oh this is gonna be a

562
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:34,549
deliverable oh this is kind of the

563
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,039
process that we're gonna follow and you

564
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:39,710
don't challenge that you don't make sure

565
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:42,799
that your policies and processes mail

566
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:44,509
mesh well with the vendors you're gonna

567
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,950
end up in a sticky situation you're

568
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:47,359
gonna end up with a vendor that's going

569
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:49,460
to be providing you something either

570
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,980
more or less than expected you're going

571
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,119
to end up in a situation where the the

572
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,320
processes aren't going to be

573
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,019
complementary there may be some

574
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,399
redundancies there may be some friction

575
00:20:56,019 --> 00:21:01,009
so it's really important right off the

576
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:03,168
bat to understand exactly how the

577
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:04,820
service is going to be delivered again

578
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:08,179
whether it's a technology-based service

579
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:09,408
or whether it's a process building kind

580
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:11,330
of service it's going to be very

581
00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:13,639
important for you to understand how

582
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:15,439
exactly that's going to happen what

583
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:18,168
people do you need to bring to the table

584
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,759
in order for this to be successful what

585
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:21,049
people does the vendor need to bring to

586
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:22,309
the table in order for this to be

587
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:24,889
successful it's going to be the

588
00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:26,299
frequency of communication this far too

589
00:21:24,889 --> 00:21:28,758
often I've been in organizations where

590
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:30,859
they hire an MS SP to come in and the

591
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:32,929
only touch point that we got with the

592
00:21:30,859 --> 00:21:34,850
MSSP is when they send us an alert of

593
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:38,869
course it has very little context and

594
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:40,340
it's usually pretty crappy but there was

595
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:42,499
no context there was no follow-up there

596
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,970
was no person that I could call who was

597
00:21:42,499 --> 00:21:46,609
managing the relationship from the

598
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:48,950
vendor side who I could lean on to ask

599
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:50,600
questions or to challenge that they were

600
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:53,240
bringing me in order to customize the

601
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,159
service in any way maybe I know

602
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,810
that there is a particular system in my

603
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,370
environment that's constantly trying to

604
00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:00,980
exploit other systems because I'm doing

605
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:02,540
for management so I have an expose box

606
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,700
sitting in my environments are random

607
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:06,950
vendor pitch in there I have a

608
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,840
vulnerability management platform within

609
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:10,280
my environment that is constantly

610
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,439
scanning and trying to exploit boxes

611
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,870
within within my network I don't need to

612
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,980
know a hundred thousand times every

613
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:17,840
month when I'm running my mole

614
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:19,670
management program that this particular

615
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,580
device is generating alerts I just don't

616
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:26,390
care I know because I told it to do it

617
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:27,770
anyways on an ongoing basis you're gonna

618
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:29,480
want to have those regular touch points

619
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:31,250
with your vendor and to Josh's point

620
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,840
about churn within the organization or

621
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:35,180
within the vendor organization that's

622
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:38,510
extremely important because if this

623
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:41,840
happens to be a very very sensitive area

624
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:43,400
let's consider incident response or even

625
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,770
threat detection it's going to be

626
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,050
important to always have that same point

627
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:50,450
of contact who understands your network

628
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:51,800
who understands you who understands how

629
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,210
the service they are providing is

630
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,040
complementing the stuff that you're

631
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:57,440
already doing if you're in a vendor

632
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,990
relationship today that doesn't provide

633
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,430
that you've got the wrong vendor it may

634
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:03,110
be worth your while to break that

635
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:05,720
contract and move on to someone else

636
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:07,370
because the amount of money lost in

637
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,710
breaking that contract is going to be

638
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:11,989
significantly less than the money lost

639
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:14,630
on the churn within your organization

640
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:16,700
from a people process so whether your

641
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:18,200
people have to go and do a lot of work

642
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,150
to supplement or validate what the

643
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,500
vendor is giving you or if it just means

644
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:23,300
that when the vendor provides you

645
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,830
something that that is part of the

646
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,940
service you end up having to run around

647
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:27,620
like chicken with your head cut off

648
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:29,930
getting this approval that approval this

649
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:32,629
approval that approval it's just not a

650
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:36,710
good use of your time and your money if

651
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:37,730
the vendor relationship isn't working go

652
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:41,000
find somebody else

653
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:43,220
I found that vendors specifically in the

654
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,390
security space are much more focused on

655
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:49,940
the relationship management aspect of

656
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:51,850
service delivery these days because they

657
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,289
understand that

658
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:55,629
larger organizations that have

659
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:59,169
historically been in the security

660
00:23:55,630 --> 00:24:00,460
services market we're not providing the

661
00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:01,900
kind of stuff that they wanted so

662
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,669
they're going to smaller shops who

663
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:06,220
understand the value of the relationship

664
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:07,950
who understand the value of making sure

665
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:10,390
that the people that are customer facing

666
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:12,100
state within the organization they

667
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:13,330
compensate them appropriately they give

668
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,610
them the appropriate career to the

669
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:17,379
career development paths and entice them

670
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:19,510
to stay entice them to build those

671
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,700
customer relationships because good

672
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:23,289
customer relationships means renewal

673
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:26,740
that's what I'm putting my vendor hat on

674
00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:28,299
I put a huge premium on the folks that

675
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,549
interface with my customers whether

676
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:34,990
that's myself or my leads it is

677
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:36,760
absolutely critical that they put as

678
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:39,070
much emphasis on that relationship as I

679
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,570
do the beta the basically the thing that

680
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:42,730
I tell them is that customer needs to be

681
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:45,360
your best friend they really do I don't

682
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:48,280
care if they are the most ornery

683
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,530
aggravating person you need to find a

684
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:52,559
way to build that relationship with them

685
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:54,970
because the success of our business

686
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:57,039
doesn't hinge on our ability to deliver

687
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:59,260
the work it hinges on our ability to

688
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,030
manage that relationship because the

689
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,890
work is going to be different in every

690
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:05,289
customer environment actually it needs

691
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:06,820
to be for incident response if I go into

692
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:08,679
your organization or your organization

693
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:10,299
or your organization it's gonna be

694
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:11,380
different every single time the threat

695
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:12,908
is going to be different the environment

696
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,799
is going to be different the everything

697
00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:17,080
is going to be different the way that we

698
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,400
are successful and being able to execute

699
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,780
in those different environments is by

700
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,799
building those relationships and making

701
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,889
sure that we maintain them in the long

702
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,129
run

703
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:27,470
and I think as a practitioner I I

704
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:30,620
struggle with this because I have an

705
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:32,630
unending flood of invites and emails and

706
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,370
phone calls from current vendors from

707
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:36,740
people that want to be vendors and

708
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:38,889
trying to prioritize and figure out how

709
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:41,630
I manage that relationship can be tough

710
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:43,630
in in the context of just getting

711
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:45,890
getting the day-to-day stuff done so

712
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:47,510
always make sure if you're too busy if

713
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:49,549
you keep pushing a vendor off find

714
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:51,650
someone on your team that can have that

715
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:53,210
conversation because you going out you

716
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,679
sign this MSA and you've got somebody

717
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:57,350
offering your services and you're never

718
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:58,880
talking with them it's a problem because

719
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,750
then all of a sudden in six months

720
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,250
you're gonna have an issue you're gonna

721
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:03,380
want to raise it to somebody you're

722
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:05,419
gonna pick up a phone and call some some

723
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:07,610
some person that has absolutely no

724
00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:09,770
understanding of what your personality

725
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:11,000
type is that you're actually generally a

726
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:12,080
pretty nice person but you're really

727
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,419
annoyed right now and the only

728
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,520
experience with you is gonna be when

729
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:19,160
you're when you're being a jerk right

730
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,450
and and so if you're on if you're making

731
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,210
time you're gonna create unnecessary

732
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:25,160
friction for yourself at the very least

733
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:29,179
find somebody with every vendor that has

734
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:30,799
the time it can make an hour a month you

735
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:32,210
know and dedicate it to a specific

736
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,250
vendor and making sure that they're

737
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:37,010
managing that relationship the other way

738
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:38,990
I would say during the kickoff if you

739
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:41,120
see this a long time the first time

740
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:43,610
somebody in your organization has heard

741
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,570
of a project should not be in the

742
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:48,729
kickoff call with the vendor

743
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:50,408
you should be talking with these

744
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:51,909
stakeholders and have identified them

745
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,600
the same way you identify those business

746
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:54,639
processes

747
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,469
it shows sat down with them this goes

748
00:26:54,639 --> 00:26:57,668
into that networking side of the house a

749
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,899
little bit you should have had a

750
00:26:57,669 --> 00:27:01,570
conversation with them and said hey

751
00:26:58,899 --> 00:27:03,100
we're trying to solve this problem okay

752
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:04,480
and I can really use your support this

753
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,610
hour looking at doing it what do you

754
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,080
think let them give you feedback

755
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:09,370
hopefully they're like one of the sounds

756
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,230
like a great idea you're really sharp

757
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:13,840
and now you have an ally coming into

758
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:15,370
this meeting and you can also you know

759
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,199
help yourself identify issues or

760
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:19,479
concerns if you've got a cio who's

761
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,950
measured on uptime and availability and

762
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,120
you start doing vulnerability management

763
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:24,309
and patch management and their first

764
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,918
introduction is this kickoff call you've

765
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:28,928
now got this incredibly political

766
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:31,000
politically charged and challenging

767
00:27:28,929 --> 00:27:32,649
environment because you know I have a

768
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,029
CIO who's afraid that their bonus are

769
00:27:32,649 --> 00:27:35,768
there there are su and however they're

770
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:38,169
compensated there's gonna be diminished

771
00:27:35,769 --> 00:27:40,269
because once a week you need to have a

772
00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:41,590
maintenance window to reboot servers and

773
00:27:40,269 --> 00:27:44,500
that might not have been accounted for

774
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:45,789
in his it his agreement okay so these

775
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:49,269
are problems that happen all the time

776
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:50,220
and they're so easy to solve if you just

777
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:52,720
have a couple of conversations

778
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,340
beforehand you don't you don't want to

779
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,929
surprise people in your organization I

780
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,309
don't know if you see the same thing if

781
00:27:55,929 --> 00:28:01,149
you go into a customer and they're like

782
00:27:57,309 --> 00:28:03,879
yeah what's going on we got breached who

783
00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:05,469
you why are you here there's a bad

784
00:28:03,879 --> 00:28:06,699
conversations to have enough but

785
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:08,350
internal people are having that

786
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:12,120
conversation with each other yeah let's

787
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:12,120
let's expand on that in the next slide

788
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:20,080
so doing it wrong doing it wrong happens

789
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:23,168
an awful lot whether that be in my

790
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,908
current rule where I am I'm responsible

791
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:26,799
for architecting and delivering services

792
00:28:24,909 --> 00:28:27,999
or in previous schools where I was

793
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,820
mostly responsible for delivering

794
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:32,499
services I've always been the

795
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,279
relationship guy that's just kind of my

796
00:28:32,499 --> 00:28:36,399
thing

797
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:38,499
I feel like personal relationships and

798
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:41,379
conversations and understanding are kind

799
00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:43,539
of the key to undoing friction and

800
00:28:41,379 --> 00:28:44,199
friction of course as we all know exists

801
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:48,519
in spades

802
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:49,659
in all organizations so I have been I've

803
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,919
always been kind of the guy that they

804
00:28:49,659 --> 00:28:53,379
bring in when something is really going

805
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:55,389
wrong and they need someone to smooth

806
00:28:53,379 --> 00:28:57,969
things out that's that's kind of where I

807
00:28:55,389 --> 00:28:59,979
operate and and to the point of incident

808
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:02,440
response that was a very interesting one

809
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:03,999
I had a situation where we were

810
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,220
providing threat detection and Incident

811
00:29:03,999 --> 00:29:08,169
Response services for a customer we

812
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:10,359
detected a pretty significant breach in

813
00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:12,639
the customer environment showed up on

814
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:14,649
site to do our job our main point of

815
00:29:12,639 --> 00:29:17,289

816
00:29:14,649 --> 00:29:19,959
team in and I'm talking like all of the

817
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:23,408
C's the board we were sitting there you

818
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:25,749
know consultants that we are all nerds

819
00:29:23,409 --> 00:29:28,539
obviously don't know how to speak to

820
00:29:25,749 --> 00:29:31,869
c-level people and all these guys sit

821

just lost one hundred million dollars

826
00:29:39,999 --> 00:29:46,590
worth of transactions and the see

827
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:49,059
literally flips his expletive deleted

828
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:50,709
because our point of contact had not

829
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:52,450
followed chain of command and notified

830
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:53,590
this particular customer and their board

831
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:55,239
and their executives that they've been

832
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:57,789
breached so all of a sudden I'm in a

833
00:29:55,239 --> 00:30:02,410
situation sweating bullets trying to

834
00:29:57,789 --> 00:30:04,750
explain what had happened to to the CEO

835
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:07,630
and that was a bad day as you can well

836
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:09,580
imagine ever since that customer

837
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:12,100
relationship actually had been managed

838
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:14,919
very well I'm so post this particular

839
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:18,699
unhappy moment I became Account Manager

840
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:20,290
for that particular customer and not

841
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:22,060
only did I speak regular to the one in

842
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:24,550
contact but I also challenged that point

843
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:26,770
of contact to make sure that he was

844
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:29,110
communicating effectively throughout his

845
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:32,379
organization thankfully we were able to

846
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:36,490
investigate and and remediate the breach

847
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:39,040
fairly quickly and everything everything

848
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:40,570
ended up going okay but that's kind of

849
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,280
the value of the human relationship

850
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:43,240
there we took the time to go on site

851
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,170
even though we could have done all of

852
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,730
our work remotely

853
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:48,640
we took the time to go on site because

854
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:50,530
we felt like we really needed to talk to

855
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,910
this point of contact and make sure that

856
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:53,649
the rest of the organization knew what

857
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:56,020
was going on knew about the vendor

858
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:58,240
relationship there and how we preferred

859
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:00,670
to deal with things so that's that's

860
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,420
kind of a Horror Story on the on the

861
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:06,760
vendor side Josh as a consumer of

862
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:09,670
services so I think the point a that

863
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:12,180
what a co-op I wanted to make is that we

864
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:14,440
know that 75 to 80 percent of

865
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:15,910
compromises that are discovered or

866
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,530
discovered because an external party

867
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:20,500
Viet law enforcement or a partner a

868
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:22,000
vendor a customer says hey we're seeing

869
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,710
suspicious traffic it looks like you've

870
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,890
been compromised

871
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:28,840
and so we've seen this explosion of

872
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:31,060
managed security services and we're

873
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:33,850
still in this world where the vast

874
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:36,220
majority of significant compromises

875
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:38,290
aren't being detected by these providers

876
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:40,960
who are supposedly connecting them for

877
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:44,860
you so I think when it comes to

878
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:47,530
consequences overconfidence right

879
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:50,110
especially if you've got people that are

880
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:51,910
supplementing your programs capability

881
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:53,350
but we're trying to supplement your

882
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,760
programs capability and you haven't

883
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:57,459
really found a way to integrate that

884
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:00,670
with the business if you're just using a

885
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:02,800
program to send you a CSV file once a

886
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:05,760
week and you're not measuring the

887
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:08,980
success and seeing how that particular

888
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:12,280
offerings going you're you're creating

889
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:13,600
you're creating a set of set of

890
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,820
circumstances where you're likely to

891
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:20,290
fail if the right set of things aligned

892
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:21,970
and I think this is gonna sound a little

893
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:23,409
a little silly the biggest the biggest

894
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:26,050
thing that I've seen personally and the

895
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:29,350
lessons learned that I've had they're

896
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:30,970
not super scary there you go and you say

897
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:33,709
an MSA and it takes you four to six

898
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:36,020
months to get something up and running

899
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:38,570
right and you know you could have just

900
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:41,870
wasted 50 100 200 thousand dollars

901
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:43,610
depending on what you're doing trying to

902
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:45,320
get a program up and running when you

903
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:47,689
could have invested that time and

904
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,908
focused on building out the framework so

905
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:52,010
when you launch a program it works today

906
00:32:49,909 --> 00:32:53,690
and and that may be it sounds silly but

907
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:55,129
the impact that that has on you

908
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:57,350
professionally in the organization where

909
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:59,240
that happens is significant because what

910
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:01,158
will happen is you'll be in situations

911
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:04,390
where people will trust you less with

912
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:06,160
money because they see that

913
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:08,049
and so when you're going through the

914
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:10,420
process of finding a vendor and solving

915
00:33:08,049 --> 00:33:12,309
these problems always remember that when

916
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:13,720
you sign that MSA when work starts when

917
00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:16,690
you start paying them that you need to

918
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:18,929
be at a point where you know on day one

919
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:22,330
you can bring them in and have them

920
00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:23,620
significantly ramped okay just like just

921
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:25,120
like a new hire right you know what

922
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,320
we're gonna do I have them sitting not

923
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,879
doing work for two or three months

924
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:31,240
because you didn't think about what this

925
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:33,220
new I would be doing and so I look I

926
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,320
don't want a hyper sensational eyes big

927
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:37,720
scary things that happen there's

928
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:40,178
definitely a lot of frustration that can

929
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,710
brew a lot of broken processes that can

930
00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:43,720
happen but I think the biggest

931
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:46,630
consequence to me is you just end up

932
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:50,160
wasting money money that you could be

933
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:50,160
doing much more valuable things with

934
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:58,980
so

935
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:01,200
Network make friends there's one thing

936
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:03,210
you take away that's what the internally

937
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,950
externally communication is one of the

938
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:07,170
most important things that we have to

939
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:11,399
deal with is practitioners we still have

940
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:13,139
a huge problem where people view the

941
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:16,770
challenges that we face as a technology

942
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:19,560
problem and technology is is a small

943
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:22,830
portion there's people and legal and

944
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:24,570
product and insert you know business

945
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:26,580
unit here problems that we have to face

946
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:27,720
and challenge if you're not networking

947
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:30,389
with the right people and building

948
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:33,120
relationships it's going to make the

949
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:35,149
succeeding much harder be really careful

950
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:38,058
when you're selecting vendors

951
00:34:35,149 --> 00:34:39,288
take time now there's always situations

952
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:41,299
where sometimes you have to spend money

953
00:34:39,289 --> 00:34:43,609
and where you lose it

954
00:34:41,299 --> 00:34:45,559
yeah exercises exercise whatever

955
00:34:43,609 --> 00:34:49,730
diligence is necessary there that's a

956
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:53,059
different different challenge but the be

957
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:55,099
mindful that you're going to a vendor

958
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:56,389
that employs people and then you treat

959
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:58,099
those people well and employ the right

960
00:34:56,389 --> 00:35:01,039
people or you're going to struggle to

961
00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:02,990
succeed and manage the relationship well

962
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:05,299
once you sign on the dotted line that

963
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:06,348
doesn't mean you're just beginning now a

964
00:35:05,299 --> 00:35:07,849
lot of people have to they go through

965
00:35:06,349 --> 00:35:09,829
this whole process feel like that the

966
00:35:07,849 --> 00:35:12,349
end like they've reached reach the goal

967
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:14,059
point the goal line and if you're not

968
00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:16,490
communicating and managing and

969
00:35:14,059 --> 00:35:18,349
challenging that vendor you're gonna end

970
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:19,879
up in situations where stuff stuff

971
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:21,020
happens and you're not able to

972
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,700
communicate well you're not able to

973
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:24,079
solve problems you don't you don't

974
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,669
understand how that vendor works they

975
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,260
don't understand how you work and you

976
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:29,059
just create a significant amount of

977
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:30,410
unnecessary friction that could have

978
00:35:29,059 --> 00:35:32,390
probably been avoided with 10 to 12

979
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:35,750
hours a year dedicated to solving that

980
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:37,788
problem yeah I think Josh covered it you

981
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:39,260
know definitely know what you what

982
00:35:37,789 --> 00:35:41,029
problem you need to solve when you need

983
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:42,559
to bring in an external vendor make sure

984
00:35:41,029 --> 00:35:44,119
that that external vendor is actually

985
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:45,619
solving that problem make sure that

986
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:46,849
there's a good cultural fit make sure

987
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:48,589
you're managing that relationship again

988
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:50,329
that vendor is just an extension of your

989
00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:52,009
program it's like having another team

990
00:35:50,329 --> 00:35:53,569
should happen to belong to another

991
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:56,799
company they're still providing the same

992
00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:56,799
function treat them as such

993
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,150
questions

994
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:09,629
any question maybe we were so

995
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:13,180
comprehensive people still awake

996
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:19,020
but it sounds like rampant 70

997
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:19,020
provokes these relationships over

998
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:24,810
other vendors you may find are not as

999
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:26,380
receptive as part of your culture

1000
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:29,770
perhaps

1001
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:31,960
rapid seventy is not the only vendor for

1002
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:33,540
other services that you don't provide if

1003
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:36,340
you're doing with the others how you

1004
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:38,830
remove that relationship building with

1005
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:42,220
them SL you guys are receptive to input

1006
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:43,900
so first I think that our intent wasn't

1007
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:47,379
to come up and speak for rapid7 more

1008
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:49,680
speak from personal experience I think

1009
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:52,360
the answer goes back to cultural fit

1010
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,890
right here you're never going to

1011
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:56,920
convince another vendor to change their

1012
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:58,330
culture to mesh with yours and you just

1013
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,430
have to be honest with yourself right if

1014
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:01,690
you're going then you're getting you

1015
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:02,109
know something as simple as a sock -

1016
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:03,970
done

1017
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:05,590
then you go to KPMG they're going to

1018
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:07,899
have their set criteria this is how it's

1019
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:10,180
gonna work and you're at your 200 person

1020
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:11,890
scrappy software as a service company

1021
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:14,080
it's got a continuous deployment model

1022
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:15,520
KPMG they're not gonna care there's a

1023
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:18,190
flag you they're gonna say developers

1024
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,340
have access to production you fail okay

1025
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:22,900
so understanding those this cultural

1026
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:24,550
hopefully I don't get your criteria and

1027
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:27,340
establishing that relationship in the

1028
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:29,440
first place yeah but if there's a little

1029
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,880
bit of salt touch that goes in there

1030
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,520
that you can't really put on a piece of

1031
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,710
paper you just have to interact with

1032
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,330
people and understand and that you know

1033
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:38,860
think you could I don't I feel like you

1034
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:40,150
can tell I can tell I'm interacting with

1035
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:42,460
the vendor fairly quickly they're gonna

1036
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:44,200
be a good fit and if you're challenging

1037
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,070
the vendor and in the ways that Josh was

1038
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,770
saying you know hey bring a

1039
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:49,690
non-technical person to the table have

1040
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:51,940
them explain to me how this service

1041
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:52,960
delivery is going to work you're really

1042
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,880
going to be able to get some good

1043
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,460
answers out of them and a good feel for

1044
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,690
whether there is a fit remember there's

1045
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,580
always going to be another vendor out

1046
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:02,350
there to be able to help you look prop

1047
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:06,250
it up like weeds I mean literally the

1048
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:08,170
security space is inundated with with

1049
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:10,390
different vendors there's always an

1050
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:12,190
option to go select someone else the

1051
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:14,859
onus is on you and it's going to take

1052
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:16,510
you more time however in the long run

1053
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,620
once you've identified a vendor that is

1054
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,820
truly going to be able to help you

1055
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,920
you're gonna be able to stay with that

1056
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:22,480
vendor for a long time so that was worth

1057
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,880
the investment we're more of a beautiful

1058
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,610
flower

1059
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:28,610
we're not without a weed thanks Josh

1060
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,840
any more questions

1061
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:36,920
how many recommendations where people

1062
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:40,640
are stuck with like you're reading a

1063
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:43,010
straight RFP process like that see

1064
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:45,109
you're working up wanted to the

1065
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:47,480
right thing foot

1066
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:48,830
yeah I mean it's it's gonna be a game

1067
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,410
especially when it comes to RFP process

1068
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:54,020
it's gonna be a game if you have found

1069
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:56,240
the vendor that you want to do this work

1070
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:58,520
for you you can help them through the

1071
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:01,310
RFP process that is perfectly acceptable

1072
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:03,800
even in government space so making sure

1073
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:06,279
that they understand the points that

1074
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:09,830
they need to hit on in order to pass the

1075
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:11,870
contracts barrier you can do that make

1076
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:14,240
sure you do that because if not they may

1077
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:16,220
fumble the the proposals process and

1078
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:19,129
they may not get selected for the final

1079
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:21,290
one again if you're not the decider it's

1080
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:23,690
on you to build the relationships within

1081
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:26,950
your own organization so that you do

1082
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:26,950
make it to that deciding table
