1
00:00:02,689 --> 00:00:08,219

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:18,810
moderator for the next hour hour and a

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:22,350
half I work for Akamai I blog for dark

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:25,198

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:29,539
the side called the OCD Diaries glad to

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:33,690
be here and I'm glad to be here with

9
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:37,680
with my friends here who have differing

10
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:41,640
views on the role of government in cyber

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:45,539
warfare and you've probably seen on your

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:49,829
chair it's not cyber war its cyber war

13
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:54,210
tags so feel free to wear the one that

14
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:56,399
you are more in agreement with I'm gonna

15
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:00,359
launch right in but I want to say that

16
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:03,840
while it's a debate I want you to feel

17
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:09,570
free to break in at any time with

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:12,330
questions with opinions it's all good as

19
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:15,508
long as it's civil and it will be so

20
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:18,420
what I want to do now is what my friends

21
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,880
introduce themselves and Brendan stop

22
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,610
with you cool

23
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:27,509
so high so I'm Brendan I'll do a little

24
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:29,520
bit later when I start speaking so as I

25
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,500
mentioned we are doing a formal debate

26
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,179
right so we have a resolution resolution

27
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,320
is resolved or this conference stands

28
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,600
resolved for those of you that if a

29
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,158
school debate recognize this format that

30
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,320
the current state of the internet

31
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,210
represents a de facto cyber war and that

32
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,419
is the role of governments to prosecute

33
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,720
such wars so it's a two part thing my

34
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,860
friend dr. John little Griffin is

35
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,539
representing the affirmative side that

36
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,070
this is totally true and it's cyber war

37
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,560
and military should get out there and

38
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,329
I'm saying no not so much so you guys

39
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,159
have three big locals right the first

40
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:01,979
rule is that we need your participation

41
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,180
to call us to task and that is going to

42
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,439
be in several different things but one

43
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,810
of the cool ways is that we have our own

44
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,090
hashtag just for this talk so you

45
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,250
obviously use the hashtag source Boston

46
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,470
SRC vos but we also have as you notice

47
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,630
on the

48
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,950
ribbons hashtag cyber ring because it

49
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,780
turns out that nobody was using that and

50
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,320
it's not going to get unfunny anytime

51
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,300
soon

52
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,040
so if you would like to ask questions

53
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,480
bill as the moderator is going to be

54
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,980
looking for the best questions to come

55
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,720
off of Twitter you'll probably also

56
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,340
allow random questions from the audience

57
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,270
as well but if you have something you

58
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,520
don't necessarily want to shout it out

59
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,080
put it on hashtag SCI brain we'll make

60
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,720
sure to see it and it's good also you

61
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,740
know comments comments that one of the

62
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,270
moderator or like one of the two

63
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,250
speakers is boring and the other one is

64
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,510
hopefully less boring but every like

65
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,730
they just like blue better than read

66
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:44,709
those moderator I'll tell them if

67
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,359
they're boring as we go exactly

68
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:47,709
second we need your participation at the

69
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,780
end cuz we're just gonna have a vote

70
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,520
which means for the first time that I

71
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:56,680
can remember somebody run with this a

72
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,880
chance of losing a conference talk and

73
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,340
I'm proposing we're gonna have it on

74
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,260
your resume or CV like in the Baseball

75
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,550
Hall of Fame with steroids right so if

76
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,720
you have you lose the power to talk you

77
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,780
have to put a little asterisk next to

78
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,370
the talk and at the bottom lost if later

79
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,330
on we could expand this to all talk so

80
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,100
that if more than half the audience

81
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,980
dislikes you at the end of your talk you

82
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:18,130
get a little star - exactly

83
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:20,799
but or screwballs but for today we'll

84
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,900
just do this third and finally we're

85
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,920
going to allow heckling which is going

86
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:28,420
to be fun sure about that and the way

87
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,070
everybody to do it how many of you have

88
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,630
ever seen Prime Minister's Questions are

89
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,549
the funniest thing on this British

90
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,260
youthspan know nobody okay so the way

91
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:37,840
this works is very simple in British

92
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,459
Parliament's you can yell at other

93
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,650
people when you don't like them which is

94
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:43,690
amazing so if you like the idea exactly

95
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,220
if you like the idea you can shout here

96
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,660
here or you can pound the table or you

97
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,650
can if you've asked nicely pound the

98
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,680
person in front of you to make an

99
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,970
ex-president sound right if we're in the

100
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,100
ball Burghley pretty head table to be

101
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,220
cool and if you don't like it shame or

102
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,420
hiss at them or whatever boo right

103
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,010
the moderator is here of course to keep

104
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,630
you all within some semblance of order

105
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,399
and dignity or whatever seems good at

106
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,829
the moment and the moderator is here to

107
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,760
tell you that it's his turn to seems

108
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:11,290
good ha but now now for the the non

109
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,590
boring one to come up and talk for a

110
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:16,120
little bit so I am I'm John Griffin I'm

111
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,790
delighted to be here I really appreciate

112
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,889
the opportunity to to speak this side of

113
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,959
the of the equations

114
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:23,159
before I get started I need to make the

115
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,229
standard corporate disclaimer that

116
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:26,849
you've been hearing all week I work for

117
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:28,080
TripAdvisor they're here in the local

118
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,878
Boston area

119
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,800
TripAdvisor was happy to give me the day

120
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:33,300
off to come speak today but they wanted

121
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,219
me to make sure to let you know that

122
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,699
they don't have an official position for

123
00:04:35,219 --> 00:04:41,849
or against cyberwarfare I'm here

124
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:44,849
speaking on my own behalf so Brendan lay

125
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:46,319
out what the what it is that I would

126
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:49,590
like you to vote in the affirmative for

127
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:52,139
the state of the Internet is de-facto

128
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:54,508
cyber war and it is the responsibility

129
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:55,680
of governments to prosecute such wars I

130
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:58,110
think there's a couple of very

131
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,509
interesting things that fall out of that

132
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,729
that then affect us directly as security

133
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:04,199
practitioners but also affect the way

134
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:06,000
that our governments are going to

135
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,099
execute cyber warfare in the future

136
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,229
which is why I think it's important for

137
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:12,139
us to agree that this is in fact the

138
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:16,589
case that we can use that going forwards

139
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:18,270
as I was preparing for this talk I I ran

140
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:19,919
it by my colleagues and everybody

141
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,659
laughed at me and said cyber warfare

142
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,150
like that's just you know that's that's

143
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:26,430
a buzzword that's a meaningless term I'm

144
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,560
not trying to be sensationalistic with

145
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:30,539
the use of the word cyber warfare the

146
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,330
tagline for this part of the talk could

147
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:37,199
be if it quacks like a duck it's a duck

148
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:39,839
right cyber war is warlike actions in

149
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,210
the electronic domain and in particular

150
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:48,599
war is in the eye of the beholder yes

151
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:51,270
sir I absolutely can that's a fabulous

152
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:53,909
segue to point one beyond my notes here

153
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:56,310
which is that war is when a nation acts

154
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:59,849
with intent to violate the sovereignty

155
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:02,039
of another nation excellent so I have

156
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:03,628
one of the 30 of you agreeing with me in

157
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:06,990
about 15 minutes I should have another

158
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:09,839
29 degree this will be great so I'm

159
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:12,149
going to give some examples of war as we

160
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:14,159
know it and then war as we know it in

161
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:16,169
the cyber domain obviously there are

162
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:17,879
things that have physical impact if

163
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:19,620
you're in Eastern Europe and you drive

164
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:21,449
tanks across the national border in

165
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,330
order to acquire more territory

166
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:27,089
that's pretty obviously an act of war if

167
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:29,710
you in the physical domain with cyber

168
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:32,710
stuff if you launch the Stuxnet attack

169
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:35,500
and purportedly caused physical damage

170
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:37,570
to another nation's uranium enrichment

171
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,250
facilities in a way that's set back

172
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:43,060
there they're programmed by several

173
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:45,160
years or by several months that is by

174
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:48,430
the you know by any definition of

175
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,900
warfare that is an attack right that is

176
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:52,960
something that the other nation could

177
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:54,340
respond to as an act of war there are

178
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,409
other things that aren't just physical

179
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,320
if we think about economic impacts of

180
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:00,510
undercutting an economy by

181
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:04,270
systematically stealing trade secrets

182
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:06,460
through spies or perhaps by inhibiting

183
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:08,710
the use or trade of a country's currency

184
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:11,469
by putting counterfeit notes out there

185
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:13,060
or by by causing it to tank on the

186
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,530
international markets these are things

187
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,880
that could be considered acts of war

188
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:18,489
right you're violating that other

189
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,140
nations sovereignty and at the in the

190
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,360
cyber domain theft of intellectual

191
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,800
property is a very obvious one right

192
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,470
there are people who do it turn of

193
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,660
piecemeal but if it's the if it is the

194
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:30,250
stated goal or even the unstated goal of

195
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,290
a government that we are going to steal

196
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,640
all of some other country's trade

197
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:36,160
secrets and we're going to use that to

198
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,380
bolster our own economy that to me

199
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,360
crosses the line into the definition of

200
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,610
war violating the sovereignty and in

201
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,590
particular causing a lasting harm to the

202
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:47,230
people of that country to the economy of

203
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:49,359
that country and basically making it an

204
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:50,920
unequal playing field so we've got a

205
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,910
physical level patch we've got economic

206
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:57,220
impacts you can think of political

207
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:58,390
warlike actions for example if you

208
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,100
assassinate the leader of another

209
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,240
country to try to cause a change of

210
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,370
government to something that's more

211
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,800
favorable to your government that could

212
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:08,920
be considered an act of war in the cyber

213
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,450
domain you could we haven't seen

214
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,040
examples of this to my knowledge but you

215
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,420
could hack into voting machines and you

216
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,910
could cause a change in the outcome of

217
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:17,530
an election you could hack into Gmail in

218
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:21,040
order to expose the Secretary of State's

219
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:25,840
emails and then that was the only joke I

220
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:28,360
had and so you can think of ways that

221
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,299
you can try to either blackmail people

222
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,490
or influence the the politics or the the

223
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,810
geopolitics of another nation again in a

224
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:37,030
way that's violating their sovereignty

225
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:38,530
and the important aspect of this is

226
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,649
these seem innocuous

227
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,129
but but

228
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:45,800
again war is in the eye of the beholder

229
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:47,839
right if if if I walk across the

230
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,969
Canadian border with a gun I'm a

231
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,369
crackpot right that's not an act of war

232
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:54,439
by the United States but if you go back

233
00:08:52,369 --> 00:08:59,629
20 or 30 years if you're Korean Airlines

234
00:08:54,439 --> 00:09:02,360
flight zero zero seven and you was that

235
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:04,579
correct was it Korean Airlines yeah and

236
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,410
you and there's a time of heightened

237
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:07,388
international tensions and you fly off

238
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:10,040
course

239
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:11,689
penetrating Soviet airspace several

240
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,449
times to the extent that they believe

241
00:09:11,689 --> 00:09:16,939
that it's a NATO exercise and they shoot

242
00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:18,800
the plane down to the Soviets that's a

243
00:09:16,939 --> 00:09:21,139
totally justified thing to do it was a

244
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,779
warlike action right and we respond to

245
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:27,949
acts of war with other actions that are

246
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:30,679
physical in nature and in violence and

247
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:32,599
so that's the that's I think part of the

248
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:34,339
critical aspect of this argument that

249
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,009
the state of the Internet is de facto

250
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:38,779
cyber war is that it looks like cyber

251
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:40,040
war to the people that are being

252
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,779
attacked

253
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:45,139
there was a very fascinating article

254
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:46,910
that I read that was published a year

255
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:49,370
ago and I'll talk more about this later

256
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:52,219
in the talk but the author the author

257
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:53,899
was describing the difference between

258
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:57,829
network attack and network exploitation

259
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:59,059
as they're used for United States cyber

260
00:09:57,829 --> 00:10:01,008
operations

261
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:02,990
you know operations in cyberspace in the

262
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:04,490
military domain if you look up the

263
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,899
Wikipedia article on this it talks about

264
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,429
everyone talks about the United States

265
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:09,019
because every other country is very

266
00:10:07,429 --> 00:10:11,269
secretive about what they do whereas the

267
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:12,949
United States is actually somewhat open

268
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:14,420
about the things that it's doing and so

269
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:16,550
there's Wikipedia articles on what it

270
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:18,410
does and the the person was describing

271
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,540
that there is there's what's known as

272
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,610
network attack which is you're actually

273
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,799
going in and disrupting denying raiding

274
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:26,629
all the D words you know somebody else's

275
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:28,069
ability to use their computer systems or

276
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:30,350
deleting the data or something like that

277
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:32,870
and then there's the separate concept of

278
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:35,179
network exploitation where you are going

279
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:37,999
in doing reconnaissance doing spying

280
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:40,610
trying to pull secret's out trying to

281
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:42,860
get a tactical advantage over the

282
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:44,080
adversary by learning what they know

283
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:47,080
without letting them know

284
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:49,570
know it and the the author of that

285
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,940
article and I and I agree at this stated

286
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:55,530
that exploitation even though it's

287
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:57,970
spying and that it seems innocuous is

288
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:59,770
actually attack from the point of view

289
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,210
of the people being exploited if you see

290
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:02,050
somebody on your network you don't know

291
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,510
why they're there

292
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:06,280
there's no attribution it's you know and

293
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,450
there's comes people from companies in

294
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,209
this room that can help with the problem

295
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:14,050
but most places don't don't hire you

296
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:15,940
companies and so it forces you as the

297
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:17,979
recipient of this to treat it as

298
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,780
seriously as possible and if we're

299
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,250
thinking about response on a national

300
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:25,959
scale it can force the government to

301
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:29,250
treat it as an act of war and yeah I've

302
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:31,090
talked about about physical economic

303
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,740
political impact

304
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:35,770
there's obviously things like weapons of

305
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:38,140
mass destruction the United States has

306
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:40,750
said has stated that if you attack the

307
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:43,569
US with nuclear biological or chemical

308
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:45,610
agents that the official response to the

309
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,080
United States is we're going to deploy

310
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:49,360
nuclear weapons in response right

311
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:52,540
anything that falls into the weapons of

312
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,390
mass destruction we're going to use

313
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,349
nuclear weapons as a response to that

314
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,960
and those are viewed as sort of

315
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:03,430
equivalent in class type stuff there's

316
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:06,250
the I am NOT going to dive into what it

317
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:07,900
would mean to have a weapon of mass

318
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,580
destruction in the cyber domain we can

319
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,900
talk about that in the question section

320
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,790
if you want but I wanted to bring that

321
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:17,010
up to say there are levels below that

322
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:19,270
right and so there was there was news

323
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:20,830
three years ago or so back to the

324
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:25,329
Iranian nuclear program that somebody

325
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:27,280
was assassinating Iranian nuclear

326
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,600
physicists on their way to work they

327
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,430
would just disappear or they would be

328
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,110
shot or something like that and the

329
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,819
speculation in the news was that there

330
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:37,480
was another country that was not happy

331
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:40,300
with the Iranian nuclear effort and that

332
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:43,060
that country viewed it as preparation

333
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:45,870
for war for nuclear war or for some sort

334
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:49,329
of threat and so they decided to take

335
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:50,499
the action of killing that person that

336
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,719
they viewed

337
00:12:50,499 --> 00:12:55,509
this thing of working to enrich uranium

338
00:12:52,719 --> 00:12:57,729
equals something that I should should

339
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:59,289
fire a gun or drop a missile or

340
00:12:57,729 --> 00:13:01,659
something like that drop a bomb shoot a

341
00:12:59,289 --> 00:13:04,839
missile and that these are equivalent

342
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:07,899
concepts and that's that's one of the

343
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:11,739
points that that that I wanted to to

344
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:14,499
convey in this first part is if these

345
00:13:11,739 --> 00:13:16,389
actions are cyber war if certain of

346
00:13:14,499 --> 00:13:18,819
these actions are cyber war let's say if

347
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:20,109
you know I use the Canadian example if

348
00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:21,669
someone tries to hack the Bank of

349
00:13:20,109 --> 00:13:24,249
America or denial-of-service them

350
00:13:21,669 --> 00:13:29,619
that's they're a crackpot but if a group

351
00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:31,959
of hackers get this right if a group of

352
00:13:29,619 --> 00:13:33,969
hackers using non-trivial techniques

353
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:36,549
infiltrate commodities trading networks

354
00:13:33,969 --> 00:13:38,109
and cause the effect of disrupting or

355
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:40,749
degrading that markets ability to

356
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:43,599
function what might be viewed as a

357
00:13:40,749 --> 00:13:46,809
legitimate response by the state in

358
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:49,029
which those markets operate might be the

359
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:49,598
same token they might say that's pretty

360
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:51,369
serious

361
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:54,189
right you have attacked us in the cyber

362
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:56,229
domain you have caused damage right you

363
00:13:54,189 --> 00:13:57,759
have affected our data you have affected

364
00:13:56,229 --> 00:14:00,849
our people you have affected our quality

365
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,739
of life that is a clear and present

366
00:14:00,849 --> 00:14:05,559
danger to our national security we're

367
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:06,879
going to respond in like kind but

368
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:10,389
instead of in the cyber domain with

369
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:13,049
physical stock and that to me is what I

370
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:17,409
think is the most interesting

371
00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:18,489
implication for us for the people in

372
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:20,229
this room for the people in this

373
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:21,970
conference for people who consider

374
00:14:20,229 --> 00:14:24,399
themselves to be cyber practitioners

375
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:25,599
that if the state of the internet is

376
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,419
cyber war according to these

377
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:30,459
descriptions then for one certain

378
00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:33,789
participants can be legitimate targets

379
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:36,339
of warfare but even if you're not being

380
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:39,009
assassinated by another country a state

381
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:41,199
bears responsibility for the actions of

382
00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:43,209
its actors or the people that are acting

383
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,309
on its behalf and so even if you're not

384
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:47,439
going to be targeted for assassination

385
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:49,478
you might be targeted for prosecution if

386
00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:51,248
you're doing something to get your

387
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:53,409
country in hot water in the

388
00:14:51,249 --> 00:14:54,939
international market if if you know the

389
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:55,929
United States wants to show that they're

390
00:14:54,939 --> 00:15:04,598
being tough on crime

391
00:14:55,929 --> 00:15:06,728
then they might yes because letting

392
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:08,470
people dive in right from the get-go

393
00:15:06,729 --> 00:15:12,959
we have a tweet that is come in

394
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:16,749
outstanding the pro cyber war speaker

395
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:23,008
and source Boston has a drink too much

396
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:23,009
marketing kool-aid you knew that was

397
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,689
you've been up here and you can you know

398
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:37,080
you've laid it out in careful detail

399
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:38,870
what do you say to folks who I mean this

400
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:42,080
is run-of-the-mill

401
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:44,310
you know somebody on the other side

402
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:48,750
doesn't agree with what you're saying

403
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:50,310
therefore well I mean I think that dr.

404
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,840
O'Connor is going to be getting up here

405
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:54,089
in about five minutes and is going to be

406
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:56,100
able to go into great depth on the ways

407
00:15:54,090 --> 00:16:00,000
in which my argument might have holes in

408
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:01,680
it yeah um I you know I would say that

409
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,630
for for those that consider me the the

410
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:12,300
pro cyber war speaker give me another 10

411
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:13,200
minutes so for full disclosure I

412
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,400
actually work for the marketing

413
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:18,750
department of TripAdvisor and so I

414
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:33,300
appreciate the see I kind of suspected

415
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:36,390
it was an insider so so the the the

416
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:38,819
broader point and I guess I'll give you

417
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:40,770
the the the money shot at the end and

418
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:43,590
then try to go back and fill it in right

419
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:47,970
the the the main point I want to get to

420
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:51,120
here in point two C dot one is if you're

421
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:54,930
doing cyber work where furtively you're

422
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,060
doing it wrong I it's I've already

423
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:59,310
described this burdensome and inaccurate

424
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:01,619
and sometimes impossible to determine

425
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:03,119
the the intent of malicious activity on

426
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,280
your network and in you know in the case

427
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,410
of anonymous attacking then that can I

428
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,660
can make it challenging but one of the

429
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:12,839
things that concerns me about cyber

430
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:15,449
warfare I I used to be a government

431
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:17,639
contractor for about ten years before

432
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:23,699
taking my current job I'm no longer

433
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:25,440
working in security and I went to visit

434
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:26,610
the Air Force Research Lab about ten

435
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,190
years ago they were working on a program

436
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:30,959
called cyber craft this was in Rome New

437
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:33,360
York in the cyber craft program which

438
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,550
was unclassified was this yeah the idea

439
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,080
was that it was the it was the agents

440
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,570
right if this was the Air Force right

441
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,730
and so you

442
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:41,529
imagine a drone or a plane or something

443
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:43,029
flying around doing things the idea was

444
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:44,380
this is the drone or the plane in the

445
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:46,029
cyber domain right you could put the

446
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,919
payload into it or you can have it act

447
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:49,620
as an agent to do information gathering

448
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,669
or to take whatever affection one and

449
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,258
several the speakers that were there

450
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:55,450
including the highest-ranking people

451
00:17:53,259 --> 00:17:58,029
from the government side talked very

452
00:17:55,450 --> 00:18:00,700
deeply about battle damage assessments

453
00:17:58,029 --> 00:18:03,070
and what it meant in the context of

454
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,049
cyber warfare that it turns out that if

455
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:06,189
you're at least in the US military and I

456
00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:09,399
assume this is the case for most

457
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:11,200
militaries worldwide if you want to take

458
00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:13,299
an action of some kind if you want to

459
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,889
drop a bomb you can't just go grab the

460
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:17,080
biggest bomb out of your arsenal and

461
00:18:14,889 --> 00:18:19,508
drop it you have to say what is the

462
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,129
effect that we want to have what is the

463
00:18:19,509 --> 00:18:24,129
way that we can accomplish that effect

464
00:18:21,129 --> 00:18:26,168
with minimum civilian casualties right

465
00:18:24,129 --> 00:18:28,600
with minimum collateral damage and yet

466
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:31,419
still you know achieve the military aim

467
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,939
that it is that we're going for and part

468
00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:37,929
of the the claim of the internet being

469
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:40,389
in a state of defacto cyber war is is we

470
00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:43,600
have all of the detriments of having the

471
00:18:40,389 --> 00:18:45,428
war with none of the advantages of the

472
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,350
processes that are in place to protect

473
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:49,450
people who are not combatants and to

474
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:51,610
protect people who are you know ordinary

475
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:53,769
citizens trying to lead their lives I

476
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:55,539
had some funny quote in here that I you

477
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:57,009
know if people want to fight each other

478
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:59,080
in the network that's fine as long as I

479
00:18:57,009 --> 00:19:00,639
can continue to get my cat videos off of

480
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,908
YouTube without being interrupted in

481
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:06,070
that um and so I'm not standing up here

482
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:09,789
saying that war is great I think war is

483
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:11,830
the worst right the if anything the the

484
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:13,269
only point of war should be to get all

485
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:16,000
sides back to a state where they can

486
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:18,340
they can engage diplomatically to try to

487
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,350
resolve the differences between them but

488
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:25,809
we want it to be war because if it's war

489
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:28,570
that means there are rules that all

490
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:34,658
sides have to follow that means that

491
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:36,730
that people who are sure and I can't fix

492
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:39,039
that but that means that there are and

493
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:41,080
so but an example I wanted to give was

494
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,820
was there's nothing special about the

495
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,760
word cyber right just because it's

496
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:47,939
happening in the cyber domain there's

497
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,889
still you know it can still be owned

498
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,149
somebody can still affect people if you

499
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:53,370
think a cruise ship going in

500
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:54,959
international waters just because it's

501
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:57,059
in international waters doesn't mean

502
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,580
that you can go like sink of the cruise

503
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:02,629
ship or export the people that are on it

504
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:07,100
or take it hostage or anything like that

505
00:20:02,629 --> 00:20:09,209
that's that's covered underneath the UN

506
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:11,370
something something convention of the

507
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:13,409
item not a maritime expert right but but

508
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:16,799
it is covered under international law

509
00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:18,779
and multiple countries in the on the

510
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:22,710
piracy example outside of Samoas i mean

511
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:27,629
multiple countries come together to act

512
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:30,090
as a an anti bad force in that area to

513
00:20:27,629 --> 00:20:32,009
try to get commerce back up to try to

514
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:33,269
get civilian protections back up to the

515
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:36,029
state they were before the piracy

516
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:38,159
started and so that's the I think that's

517
00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:40,049
the core reason why I'm up here

518
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,309
advocating for again the resolution is

519
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:43,168
the state of the Internet is de facto

520
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:44,759
cyber war and it's the responsibility of

521
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:47,070
governments it's the role of governments

522
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:50,610
to prosecute such wars is if we define

523
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:53,519
it as war then we're going to be better

524
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:56,370
off than we are right now and again not

525
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:59,279
everything is cyber war but if there's a

526
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:02,639
you know if there is a government a

527
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,960
country that is sustainably trying to

528
00:21:02,639 --> 00:21:06,090
violate the sovereignty of another

529
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:09,419
nation and in the specific example you

530
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:11,070
gave if if there are people who can be

531
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:12,480
attributed to even if there's a larger

532
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:15,149
anonymous effort or something that's not

533
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,340
that then that should have repercussions

534
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:19,320
for the people that are doing it and for

535
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:22,879
the country that is that is allowing it

536
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,879
or advocating it or sustaining it

537
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:28,959
action

538
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:34,460
there were gates of anonymous they're

539
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:38,000
not a nation-state in fact they're

540
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:39,680
divided across very much so I think this

541
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,480
is probably a very good time for me to

542
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:45,080
turn the floor over to dr. O'Connor so

543
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:48,530
that he can go into exactly those points

544
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:52,460
so Glenn why don't you come on up and I

545
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:54,230
think you know you brought up a good

546
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:58,240
point and one of the things that kept

547
00:21:54,230 --> 00:22:02,240
going through my mind is when we

548
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:04,550
classify this a certain way and we're

549
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,140
kind of giving the government the green

550
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:08,000
light to act accordingly

551
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:11,060
I think the concern that I hear a lot

552
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,180
from people is that the government then

553
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:17,360
goes to the throat and overreaches and

554
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:21,050
things that are in fact not cyberwarfare

555
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,879
become cyber warfare so I think that's

556
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:24,800
exactly that's one of the major concerns

557
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:31,180
and I'm going to raise here so perfect

558
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:33,409
good Saints do so hi hi Brendan

559
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:35,570
dr. O'Connor is one of those terrifying

560
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:37,400
things I'm actually a lawyer which is

561
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:39,230
technically a doctorate but we don't

562
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:43,910
call it that because it makes us look

563
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:45,680
like jerks my bio is long my bio is both

564
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:47,570
long and odds I will summarize I'm a

565
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,850
hacker caught between worlds I'm a

566
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:51,649
lawyer and so you all spent 20 minutes

567
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:54,560
yesterday at the first keynote listening

568
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:55,910
to how awful I totally was somebody

569
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,610
can't seem to the micro no just a

570
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:00,440
kissing sound weird like hey now be say

571
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,729
I'm not your lawyer I did two cyber fast

572
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,650
tracks and yet still ended up a

573
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:05,600
consultant not a product developer I

574
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:07,430
still think drink every time somebody

575
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,580
says cyber even though that's what this

576
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:11,660
talk is about and I am just to confirm

577
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,490
all the horrible things you already

578
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:15,770
think about lawyer I am in fact this is

579
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:18,620
P and my only excuse that I have is I

580
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:19,970
was young and needed the money so I have

581
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:22,639
three major points in opposition to this

582
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:25,280
resolution the first is that war is a

583
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,740
very precise specific thing under

584
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,990
international law whose definition

585
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:31,310
nothing on the internet means currently

586
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,879
second the rampant criminality caused

587
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,499
for

588
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:36,259
least response not a military response

589
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:38,359
and the third that allows the military

590
00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:41,179
to declare cyber as a new battlefield to

591
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:43,339
meet land sea and sky will destroy our

592
00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:45,319
fragile little village to save it and

593
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:49,999
since you and I are the villagers on the

594
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:52,549
internet that's gonna suck so first what

595
00:23:49,999 --> 00:23:56,029
is war hundred international law look

596
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:57,139
war is hell right yeah or all is fair in

597
00:23:56,029 --> 00:23:58,579
love and war we hear lots of things

598
00:23:57,139 --> 00:24:00,678
involving the word war and so we bought

599
00:23:58,579 --> 00:24:03,319
this general nebulous sentence that war

600
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:04,999
means just bad things or as dr. Griffin

601
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:06,940
pointed out war is when a country

602
00:24:04,999 --> 00:24:10,519
violates in other countries sovereignty

603
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:13,579
that last part taken literally is almost

604
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:15,440
correct but not point Awards when a

605
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:18,289
sovereign state decides that he hates

606
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,599
another country very very much and sends

607
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:23,389
its military forces that is the people

608
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:27,019
in that country designated to act as the

609
00:24:23,389 --> 00:24:28,069
the weaponized arm of the country to

610
00:24:27,019 --> 00:24:30,079
invade the sovereignty of another

611
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:31,519
country and we mean they have to

612
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:32,629
physically invade you can fly over and

613
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:34,459
drop bombs or whatever but that's the

614
00:24:32,629 --> 00:24:36,228
general idea under the primary

615
00:24:34,459 --> 00:24:39,589
definition of the Geneva Conventions a

616
00:24:36,229 --> 00:24:42,559
war strictly requires two sovereign

617
00:24:39,589 --> 00:24:44,809
nation-states at least two it can't be a

618
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:47,928
war between one sovereign nation-state

619
00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:49,969
and anything else it especially can't be

620
00:24:47,929 --> 00:24:54,349
one this only anything else is a now

621
00:24:49,969 --> 00:24:56,539
like terrorism or cyber or drugs or

622
00:24:54,349 --> 00:24:58,039
poverty or when it's past participle or

623
00:24:56,539 --> 00:25:00,919
whatever you can't have war on things

624
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:03,169
that are the country extraordinarily

625
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:06,379
recently illegal terms which means 50

626
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:07,729
years ago the rest of the world some

627
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:09,408
people decided we should actually expand

628
00:25:07,729 --> 00:25:11,449
this a little bit and they expanded it a

629
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:12,649
little bit and the United States ignored

630
00:25:11,449 --> 00:25:14,149
it but everybody else has signed on to

631
00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:16,189
the first optional protocol which

632
00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:18,408
expanded it to include essentially civil

633
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:20,659
wars at the time they were thinking of

634
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:22,339
the Spanish Civil War if you haven't

635
00:25:20,659 --> 00:25:23,719
taken care of in history recently think

636
00:25:22,339 --> 00:25:25,668
of the American Civil War that works

637
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:27,440
essentially the same way the idea in

638
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:29,659
this definition is that both sides have

639
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,499
to claim sovereignty that is they have

640
00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:32,569
to say that there are legitimate

641
00:25:30,499 --> 00:25:34,519
government of their people and they have

642
00:25:32,569 --> 00:25:36,769
to hold territory from which they

643
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:38,110
launched their attacks which makes them

644
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:40,000
kind of country level

645
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:42,309
this allows you to say things like

646
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,200
Crimea can be a summary sovereign thing

647
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:46,000
or their eastern Ukraine could be a war

648
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:49,540
without having to go into whether it's

649
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,950
really Russia or not here TLDR it is but

650
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,389
we don't have to worry about that issue

651
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,920
because we can just say it's a war

652
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:57,400
because there's a territory from which

653
00:25:53,920 --> 00:26:00,280
they're launching attacks notice what

654
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:02,770
these definitions don't include they do

655
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,840
not include attacks or random dudes on

656
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:08,049
the internet even if they hang out in

657
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:10,149
IRC and we're scary Guy Fawkes masks

658
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:12,100
right anonymous is not a country

659
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:13,120
anonymous does not claim to be a

660
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:26,379
sovereign country and it certainly

661
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:28,120
doesn't hold territory so the question

662
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:29,320
was you all heard of all repeated with

663
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,479
the recording well what if they're being

664
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:34,059
backed well what if they're being backed

665
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:36,070
right if that could be proven a lot of

666
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:37,809
things would be true right but frankly

667
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:39,070
if the United States federal government

668
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:40,570
could prove everything it's currently

669
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,990
said about the state of cyber war on the

670
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,879
Internet

671
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:44,770
we live in a land where North Korea is

672
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,490
the most terrifying we've ever enemy

673
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:51,309
we've ever faced since Hannibal probably

674
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:52,929
not true frankly but we can assume that

675
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:57,490
our window and I'll talk about a little

676
00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:59,559
bit later so it's not anomalous right

677
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:02,650
it's just not and we have a word for

678
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:05,889
things that are warlike actions that are

679
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:08,679
not perpetrated by a military they're

680
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:10,990
called criminal acts right but because

681
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:12,220
the law of armed conflict comes from

682
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:14,049
international law and international law

683
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,880
so these is a lot of Latin we have a

684
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:17,530
really cool world for a word for

685
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,020
international criminal acts it's called

686
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:21,760
brigand ray which is a great word so

687
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:23,230
international people who are attacking

688
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,690
things are brigands under international

689
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:29,410
law they're not committing war crimes

690
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:31,690
because they can't start a war which is

691
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:33,190
a crucial distinction so Anonymous can't

692
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:34,990
start a war and there's lots of people

693
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:36,970
in the industry right now who say oh my

694
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:38,169
god hackers are legitimate targets of

695
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:40,270
war no they can't because they're not

696
00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:42,460
military and so anonymous is never going

697
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:44,500
to be justified of a cyber rivet of a

698
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,970
kinetic response by our military we are

699
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,230
not going to stick a cruise missile down

700
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:48,750
your chimney that's someone at the

701
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:51,810
Pentagon anonymously leaked

702
00:27:48,750 --> 00:28:03,780
to the press because it can't work that

703
00:27:51,810 --> 00:28:05,129
way no they can't and I'll talk about

704
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,500
what it's actually not a bad question

705
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:08,760
but I'm going to talk about how we start

706
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,950
a war first and then I'm gonna get to

707
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:13,680
that principle so how do we start a war

708
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:15,540
we need a use of force which is a

709
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,400
specific term under international law

710
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:20,760
and it does not mean shoving the

711
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:25,170
moderator or John or anyone right so the

712
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:27,450
use of force occurs a use of force has

713
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:29,880
to occur by a military and has to meet a

714
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:31,920
few conditions right the primary

715
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,680
condition is that it has to like for the

716
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:37,200
old like kinetic thing it has to cause a

717
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:39,150
bunch of damage right to property or to

718
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,860
losses has to cause damage equivalent to

719
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:42,960
bombing to something there's generally

720
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:44,340
what's accepted which means you know it

721
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,110
has to be like the kind of thing that

722
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:47,939
militaries do right we don't just like

723
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:49,500
go in and shoot somebody tend to go in

724
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,790
to kill hundreds of people right or

725
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,460
assassinate heads of state all those

726
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:55,950
destinations are a problem something

727
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:57,180
large and specifically it has to meet

728
00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:00,150
what they call the de minimis threshold

729
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:01,830
and de minimis just means like a bare

730
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:04,170
minimum threshold but what it means in

731
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:06,300
international law is very simple it has

732
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:07,350
to be something past the smell test for

733
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,149
the rate of rest of the international

734
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:11,899
community and the best way to define

735
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:14,280
this is in practice a couple months ago

736
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:18,090
Mexico invaded the United States

737
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:21,740
the Mexican army took military equipment

738
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:26,270
with guns on it and glue into Texas

739
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:28,740
because they suck at GPS this happens

740
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:30,030
some of you watched West Wing so -

741
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,450
thought this was a joke but this isn't a

742
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:32,490
joke

743
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:35,610
one time the Montana Army National Guard

744
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:38,730
invaded Canada like cuz they suck at GPS

745
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:41,040
because Montana um and they do open

746
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:43,800
Canada the matter is like oi what's the

747
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:47,340
tiger a group of army people do even

748
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:48,930
Canada they're like Mounties are not the

749
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:51,449
kind of police force we have back in

750
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:52,020
Montana this is not a good sign and what

751
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,730
they do

752
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:55,560
Canada's adopted Claire were on the

753
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:57,720
United States right they did not start

754
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:59,649
bombing random celebrity families and

755
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,330
singing songs Allah

756
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:02,920
South Park right what happened instead

757
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:05,199
was they took their guns away made the

758
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:08,160
March back to Montana and gave them back

759
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,910
their guns and said use of GPS next time

760
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,730
because it was a de minimis threshold

761
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:14,290
right it was clearly not enacted for

762
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:16,480
because it doesn't pass the vague smell

763
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:19,530
test and yeah it's not a bright line but

764
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,820
you know one guy doesn't constitute an

765
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:24,310
innovation one guy does not constitute

766
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:26,020
an active force it has to be something

767
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:28,300
that you'd think you'd start a war over

768
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:29,260
basically right like this that's kind of

769
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:33,730
the de minimis sense a lot of these

770
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:34,870
things are kind of fuzzy lines and in

771
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:36,580
case you're curious in New Mexico thing

772
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:39,270
a similar thing happened we scrambled a

773
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:42,760
couple jets the Mexican helicopter said

774
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:44,680
let's do a look look our jets uh-huh we

775
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,300
turned the back around and we put them

776
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,100
back in Mexico and like this mine right

777
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,690
but he not declare war on Mexico this is

778
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:54,129
nobody's interest to have more is having

779
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:55,720
like that so in war we have rules this

780
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:57,130
one I'm gonna cure issue when you have a

781
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,570
couple principle I'm going to talk about

782
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:00,250
there's lots and lots of rules but the

783
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:01,750
big rules are pretty simple one is the

784
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:03,160
principle of distinction which is what

785
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,480
gets your gorillas question the

786
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,510
principal distinction is you have to

787
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,740
wear a uniform and if you can't afford a

788
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:11,650
uniform you have to wear some

789
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,700
distinctive emblem that you that hold

790
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:14,740
you out as a member of the military

791
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:17,140
those you have seen like the myth movies

792
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:19,780
or on Broadway or something I remembered

793
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,380
like the big arm bends friends right or

794
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,850
the big flower

795
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:24,460
they variously worn different

796
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:26,080
productions other people might think

797
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,150
well god if we have you know a big huge

798
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,740
like bright colored armband then that's

799
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:31,000
going to be our distinction it can be

800
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:33,220
almost anything you just have to be able

801
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,770
to see it from a long ways away and the

802
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:38,560
reason for this is very simple if you

803
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:40,060
look like the civilians in an area and

804
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,710
some of you are military and some of you

805
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:43,840
are civilians it's going to be a

806
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:46,120
somewhat more valid military decision to

807
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,520
just Massacre the entire village because

808
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:50,559
I can't tell who it is

809
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:53,470
so the principle of distinction is

810
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:55,480
designed to protect civilians that's the

811
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:56,770
entire purpose and so it is a violation

812
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,470
of the law of war it's actually a grave

813
00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:01,360
breach of the law of war to not wear

814
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:02,830
uniform or some distinctive emblem and

815
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,209
there's been some debate more recently

816
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:05,710
in the international community about

817
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:07,630
whether this is really fair because the

818
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:09,790
United States has lots of bombs that can

819
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:14,440
actually see emblems of distinction and

820
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:16,420
bomb them but it isn't okay to set

821
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,330
yourself up as have that going to be a

822
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:20,320
war that is going to be a combatant and

823
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:22,178
then say I'm never going to expose

824
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,909
myself to risk I have to be the secret

825
00:32:22,179 --> 00:32:27,309
guy that's never been acceptable for

826
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:28,960
like six hundred years to say well I'm

827
00:32:27,309 --> 00:32:31,178
going to be just a secret fighter you

828
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,940
have to hold yourself out in order to

829
00:32:31,179 --> 00:32:35,170
gain protection under international law

830
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,550
this is why you end up with lots of kind

831
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:37,750
of confused statements if you remember

832
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:38,919
think the Bush White House I'm like well

833
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:40,270
they didn't follow the law of wars we

834
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:43,450
don't have to treat them like enemy

835
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:45,160
combatants right there are reasons that

836
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:47,260
Bush said that they're not entirely

837
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,280
valid but the reason is in general if

838
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,120
you don't hold yourself out with a

839
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,920
principle of distinction

840
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,239
you can't perceive a lot of the other

841
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:56,320
protections and the Geneva Conventions

842
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,970
solution area war had a lot of problems

843
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,110
and everybody gets to point to their

844
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,429
favorite at war and say well that war

845
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,419
was special right but wars aren't

846
00:33:00,429 --> 00:33:03,190
special I'll get to that later

847
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,929
most of the principle targeting which

848
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:06,910
means how many of you ever played

849
00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:09,010
Counter Strike for some of the yeah half

850
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:11,440
the room exactly remember don't shoot

851
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:13,030
the hostage okay don't shoot the hostage

852
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,530
is actually a fundamental rule of the

853
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:16,780
law of war right don't shoot hostages

854
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:18,250
prisoners of war or civilians in general

855
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:19,960
you have to you know following the

856
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:21,270
principle distinction shoot only the

857
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:24,340
guys wearing the distinctive employ

858
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:25,929
fairly straightforward and then there's

859
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:28,419
principle proportionality which says

860
00:33:25,929 --> 00:33:31,059
look sometimes the bad guys are right

861
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:34,059
next to the non-combatants and there's

862
00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:35,590
going to be a fuzzy bits of problem

863
00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:37,750
Americans think this because it's not

864
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:40,559
very easy to define and say bad and good

865
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:43,420
but there's maybe a rule that says look

866
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:45,399
you have to kill an amount of civilians

867
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:47,500
that is a reasonable collateral damage

868
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,900
in exchange for the military objective

869
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:52,630
or getting it doesn't mean you can't

870
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:54,670
massively overkill combatants right it

871
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:56,800
is totally legal to drop a 20,000 pound

872
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:57,250
bomb on a deserted island to kill one

873
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,000
sniper

874
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,680
totally

875
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,080
that's massive overkill right but that

876
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:04,390
isn't proportionality it is not okay to

877
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,490
drop a 20,000 pound bomb in the middle

878
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:07,660
of an elementary school to kill one

879
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:09,750
sniper who may or may not be there

880
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:12,040
that's the principal proportion holiday

881
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:13,230
so yeah there are times when people

882
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,918
didn't hold themselves out as

883
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:16,570
non-combatants that doesn't mean that

884
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:17,859
was okay it often means that it was a

885
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:21,310
war crime or what would be considered a

886
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:23,129
war crime now if they got caught but

887
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:25,449
it's amazing how often people do get

888
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:27,429
regions in fact most breaches are not

889
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:31,480
punished by the victors people always

890
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:33,040
think of go ahead though so people

891
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,480
always say well Nuremberg was always

892
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,918
Victor's justice right another kind of

893
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,800
war crimes tribunals we've had after

894
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:39,819
Wars you can make that argument there's

895
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,250
actually a lot of due process that

896
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:44,340
happen at Nuremberg but the actual thing

897
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:46,810
is most war crimes are punished by the

898
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:48,909
commanders in the army that committed

899
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:52,029
them there are people right now at Fort

900
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:53,830
Leavenworth who are were tried sentenced

901
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:55,419
and committed to Leavenworth for

902
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:57,730
committing war crimes during the u.s.

903
00:34:55,418 --> 00:35:00,430
invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan as US

904
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:02,320
soldiers the US Armed Forces who are

905
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:04,120
sitting there because they committed war

906
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,380
crimes not always big war crimes right

907
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,930
not always massacring a thousand

908
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:10,180
civilians right often relatively small

909
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:11,589
things because we punish the people who

910
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:14,770
violate the law of war because we think

911
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:15,900
the law of war is important give

912
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:20,460
something more

913
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:22,230
I guess I have but just so you know I

914
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:25,440
moved to the back of the room because my

915
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:35,130
microphone is making the speaker over

916
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:38,999
there was so so I think the two both of

917
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:41,630
you have very clearly laid out your

918
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:41,629
positions

919
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:48,379
you one thing I'm interested in knowing

920
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:52,140
is you know we're talking a lot about

921
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:56,010
the rules of engagement and such do we

922
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:58,069
have any former or current military

923
00:35:56,010 --> 00:36:03,900
personnel in this room right now I

924
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:09,329
spotted the Fed I'm interested in

925
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:13,950
knowing what you think you have been in

926
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:18,480
the military you have you know you're in

927
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:26,990
security now that you hear these debates

928
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:29,220
going all the time you don't have to

929
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:31,500
though I'm looking at my friend Eric

930
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:35,129
Kapur Twitter because he's a good friend

931
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:36,210
and I'm kind of a jerk but if not I've

932
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,560
got plenty more to lay out which we

933
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:45,810
might disagree with more they yell okay

934
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:48,779
more so rules of engagement are

935
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:52,049
incredibly important whether we're

936
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:55,000
talking about the military engaged in

937
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:56,440
armed conflict or we're talking about

938
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,950
[Music]

939
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:03,830
electronic warfare right and if you

940
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:06,379
would not want what we see what happens

941
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:08,690
when people don't get prosecuted for

942
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:10,760
breaking the rules of engagement if you

943
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:14,420
look at the way that some of the issues

944
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:16,850
we have with police officers over using

945
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:18,320
deadly force at times but police

946
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:19,700
officers aren't the military and I think

947
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,530
that's a crucial distinction but they

948
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:25,910
have rules of engagement but they often

949
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:29,180
get a pass because of what's called

950
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:31,250
sovereign immunity so this is you're not

951
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:35,029
why they get passed okay anyway

952
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:36,680
soldiers tend to not get a pass when

953
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:39,200
they break the rules of engagement

954
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:41,779
which means that they will follow the

955
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,730
rules of engagement more likely than

956
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:48,050
them right having served in the military

957
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:49,430
and wartime that it you know that you're

958
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:52,540
gonna go to Leavenworth if you kill a

959
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:56,419
civilian and somebody sees you do it

960
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:58,340
right so rules of engagement are really

961
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:00,860
important but just as important is

962
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:03,760
actually following up on the rules of

963
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:06,730
engagement and in for something right

964
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:11,890
some and by the way I don't believe that

965
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:11,890
I'm not a I'm not much of a fan of

966
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:16,490
people who are not in the military or

967
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,859
law enforcement trying to pursue

968
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:21,709
electronic warfare themselves right

969
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:23,540
let's yeah let's I think that see those

970
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:25,850
reasons right once we this is exactly

971
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:27,529
where discussed yeah so that's how she

972
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:29,720
finds this is close to my third point so

973
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:30,950
let's jump to it so we're talking about

974
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,899
rules of engagement and we can have a

975
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:36,109
just a disagreement about what police

976
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:37,370
are oh you are and are not later when we

977
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:39,350
talk about a role of engagement of the

978
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:41,210
military the first thing that happens

979
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:43,400
the kind of basic condition is that you

980
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:45,020
recognize that it's okay to have a

981
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,700
battlefield and you designate what the

982
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:48,770
battlefield is going to look like right

983
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:50,540
since the battlefield is we're on the

984
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:53,060
road to Baghdad right or whatever

985
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:55,040
there's some designation if we allow the

986
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:56,870
military to designate the internet as

987
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,120
another force as another battlefield

988
00:38:56,870 --> 00:39:01,310
another place where we can fight with

989
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,480
other countries we have a problem

990
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:04,040
because there are people who live there

991
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,870
and there are ordinarily people who live

992
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:10,160
in battlefields right we call them about

993
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:13,000
to die you know what really sucks about

994
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:15,589
having your village be a battlefield you

995
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,840
die for no reason you die for collateral

996
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:19,850
damage when you're not in the military

997
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,900
you're just the bystander and sometimes

998
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:24,049
you die for no reason

999
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:26,510
20 years later I have a friend who when

1000
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:27,950
he was growing up was told you can't

1001
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:30,440
play in fields you have to play on the

1002
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:32,660
sidewalk or on certain big streets paved

1003
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:35,030
streets the reason that is really simple

1004
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:36,799
because until he was 10 his country was

1005
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:39,590
fighting a particularly nasty civil war

1006
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,660
and they filled the entire country with

1007
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:44,060
millions upon millions upon millions of

1008
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:46,399
plastic landmines which you can't detect

1009
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:48,140
with metal detectors so every now and

1010
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,930
then kids go running and playing soccer

1011
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:51,920
in a field and one of them blows up

1012
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:54,549
because of the defensive emplacements

1013
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,240
left by a war that ended when he was 10

1014
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:58,370
that's the thing

1015
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:01,149
we spent allowing declaring the Internet

1016
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:02,740
to be a cyber battlefield right

1017
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:04,660
and the rest of us are going to live

1018
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,950
with the consequences we're going to

1019
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:07,450
we're going to have a situation where

1020
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:09,850
defensive emplacements 20 years later

1021
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:11,680
are still blowing up and we can say well

1022
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:13,360
how would that possibly work the neat

1023
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,890
thing is we don't have to decide how

1024
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,360
it's going to possibly work every new

1025
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:18,129
advancing military weaponry has always

1026
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,690
brought with it a promise that hey

1027
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:21,520
we won't still be killing people with

1028
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:23,050
this 20 years later right hello cflink

1029
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,160
land mines we're gonna end the war

1030
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:25,150
there's not gonna be an invasion zone

1031
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,770
that could be a problem

1032
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:28,840
that was the rule of cluster bombs

1033
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:30,520
they're all going to go off we promise

1034
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,980
that these days the bombs are all going

1035
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:34,690
to go off that was the idea with really

1036
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:57,180
big bombs is that there's so much bomb

1037
00:40:34,690 --> 00:41:09,520
that he will all blow up and get online

1038
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:11,950
where's that pointer cyberspace sure

1039
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,680
what look at this let's take

1040
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:17,169
hypothetical Stuxnet 2.0 well it sucks

1041
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,970
net because it's not as good Stuxnet is

1042
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:20,710
apparently something from public news

1043
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:22,569
sources like the New York Times and who

1044
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:24,400
can trust the New York Times was it

1045
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:27,250
apparently extremely well targeted right

1046
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,600
it only looked very specifically for

1047
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:30,130
only things that were likely to be in

1048
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,360
Iran he was looking for languages and

1049
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:32,410
such long I don't know all the details

1050
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,850
been a while since I've read them for

1051
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:36,580
the point is it was only going to in

1052
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:38,440
fact certain computers in Iran that were

1053
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:40,720
attached to certain programmable logic

1054
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,710
controllers in this one bedroom let's

1055
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,509
say the next one isn't throw together

1056
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:45,670
quite as well right it's not as quite as

1057
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:47,990
hyper focused in target it didn't spend

1058
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:50,599
as many years in its development

1059
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:52,220
so it looks for PLC's of a certain

1060
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:55,540
vendor because they could be all over

1061
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:55,540
right we could have enemies among us

1062
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:01,280
right now it blows up a few centrifuges

1063
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:03,290
ten years from now those same PLC's you

1064
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,849
know if people who work in SCADA notice

1065
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:06,080
that he'll cease don't get swapped out

1066
00:42:04,849 --> 00:42:08,450
where you tend to have the same models

1067
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:10,009
on and on for decades on out ten years

1068
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:13,149
from now we might have breakouts from

1069
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:15,260
floppies or old CDs because you know

1070
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:16,550
this stuff still propagates across the

1071
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:18,440
internet and it propagates across the

1072
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:20,180
internet says I found a bunch of those

1073
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,609
old PLC's laid around I know my mission

1074
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:24,399
I'm going to kill the PLC but now rings

1075
00:42:22,609 --> 00:42:27,950
in those peal seats for ventilators or

1076
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:30,200
hospitals or things that aren't uranium

1077
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:32,359
enrichment devices and now we really do

1078
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:34,810
have a problem because random PLC's this

1079
00:42:32,359 --> 00:42:37,220
old hardware tends to stick around and

1080
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:39,529
there are instances of this already

1081
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:41,540
happening there are published reports of

1082
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:43,849
Stuxnet having shown up in hospitals and

1083
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:46,310
not having gone off just because it

1084
00:42:43,849 --> 00:42:48,050
didn't pass the final language that's

1085
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:49,490
right it's like hospitals detected but

1086
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:52,220
they detected the thing that flipped was

1087
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:53,930
that it wasn't in Farsi I believe and

1088
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:56,598
therefore it didn't go off in the end so

1089
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:59,060
you could easily see a single bin flip a

1090
00:42:56,599 --> 00:43:01,820
random mutation the street finding its

1091
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:03,589
own use for things suddenly it does go

1092
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:08,119
off and that's the end of that hospital

1093
00:43:03,589 --> 00:43:13,420
so legacy malware has right okay look at

1094
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:13,420
still crash or Neuromancer John

1095
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:30,900
so we've heard the audience sorry I was

1096
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:32,430
actually very I was very delighted to

1097
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:47,520
see dr. O'Connor sort of go down this

1098
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:50,250
last set of if there's again we want

1099
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:52,530
this to be warm right we want to avoid

1100
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:54,330
the situation that's just being

1101
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:55,710
described right there there they're

1102
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:57,119
going to be atrocities they're always

1103
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:59,460
going to be atrocities right

1104
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:01,320
somebody can create a bomb a cyber bomb

1105
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:06,570
you know they thought his example was

1106
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:08,580
was was a nice one and and and people

1107
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:11,280
could be affected years in the future

1108
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:13,319
in ways that that that weren't attended

1109
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,869
right that when I lived in in Baltimore

1110
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:18,570
I remember seeing an article about

1111
00:44:14,869 --> 00:44:20,400
digging up mines from the Revolutionary

1112
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:21,690
War era and that there was some concern

1113
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,010
that they would still be alive I mean I

1114
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:24,119
think this is probably a problem that's

1115
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:28,859
happened throughout history but the

1116
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:30,660
reason that that we want to so when when

1117
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:32,130
dr. O'Connor gets up and gives us a

1118
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:34,140
bunch of legalese I mean I hate to

1119
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:39,450
resort to ad hominem attacks to win the

1120
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:40,980
debate but I'm willing to do that if you

1121
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:42,990
know he gets up and spouts a lot of

1122
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:44,400
legalese and in the preparation for this

1123
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:45,540
I was worried that you could get up and

1124
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,040
you would say well look the United

1125
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:48,599
Nations has made it clear what is and

1126
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,700
isn't for and it's illegal to have war

1127
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:53,520
right we've outlawed the concept of war

1128
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:55,830
because we want to make that good and

1129
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,030
and life grand and everybody is happy so

1130
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:59,549
what we end up with there are these

1131
00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:01,830
skirmishes or these these actions are

1132
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:03,720
these things that go on for years that

1133
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:06,299
aren't technically war or they're Wars

1134
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:09,689
you know wars against concepts as he

1135
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:13,800
pointed out we want what's happening on

1136
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:16,050
the Internet to be cyber war in part so

1137
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,280
that it will be regulated the way that

1138
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:19,560
war is right

1139
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,860
agreed with the gentleman who who who

1140
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:24,390
commented that we don't want to see

1141
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:26,010
electronic operations being done by

1142
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:27,839
civilians we certainly don't want to see

1143
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:33,990
electronic operations be done at all I

1144
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:38,490
don't particularly but but if that is in

1145
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:40,080
the role of warfare then as dr. O'Connor

1146
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:42,750
points out if you do it you can be

1147
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:48,390
prosecuted for it right the police can

1148
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:50,040
stop you for it but even more so more is

1149
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:51,900
in the eye of the beholder to re

1150
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,580
reiterate the point that I made right if

1151
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:55,110
the other country feels that your

1152
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:58,290
actions are more like we have a

1153
00:45:55,110 --> 00:46:00,450
questionnaire then it you know it

1154
00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:02,850
doesn't so much matter how you define it

1155
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:04,230
you know you could get what's coming to

1156
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:06,270
you and I don't want to see that happen

1157
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:08,100
right I want to see I want to see

1158
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:12,180
civilians I want to see security

1159
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:14,160
practitioners protected from in general

1160
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:16,370
the things that happen during war yes

1161
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,370
sir

1162
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:30,159
[Music]

1163
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:39,259
oh so if this is Fox News I am NOT

1164
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,950
declaring a war on cyber let me be clear

1165
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:44,880
about that

1166
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:46,980
right I agreed with with the opening

1167
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,530
statement that dr. O'Connor made war is

1168
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:52,500
war between two countries right and

1169
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:54,090
that's why when I define what war is for

1170
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,830
the concept of this war is a nation

1171
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:57,720
acting with intent to violate the

1172
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:59,549
sovereignty of another nation I think

1173
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:04,379
the core disagreement here with with

1174
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:06,690
that part of it is two years ago a good

1175
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:09,380
friend and I gave a talk at Pumpkin

1176
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:13,530
I shouldn't be clear it was dr. O'Connor

1177
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:16,140
we we were looking at a document that

1178
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:19,290
had recently been released called the

1179
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:21,990
talent menu the new cooperative cyber

1180
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:24,240
defence centre of excellence tall and

1181
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:26,669
manual on the international law of armed

1182
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:29,040
conflict applicable to cyber warfare it

1183
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:31,920
has a 300 word title I'm so so sorry

1184
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,290
it's it's this it's this fascinatingly

1185
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,540
vague document it's available online the

1186
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:38,370
various NATO member countries got

1187
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:40,710
together and said okay what does it mean

1188
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:43,710
to have war in the cyber domain and what

1189
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:46,200
are the things that that implies and so

1190
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:48,270
in one of the sections where they were

1191
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:51,779
looking at it they said well what's the

1192
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:54,509
definition of a warlike action well it's

1193
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:57,780
when you and I'm paraphrasing here right

1194
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:59,550
it's when you when you cause a physical

1195
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:01,680
attack against something or against

1196
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:03,990
territory of someone that you know and

1197
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:06,450
it has this you know you hurt them or

1198
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:09,029
you you know there's some physical or

1199
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:10,230
measurable harm and the way this

1200
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:12,090
document is written is there's a

1201
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:14,130
statement like that and there's three

1202
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:15,330
pages of footnotes where the various

1203
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:16,530
people that were involved in the

1204
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:18,720
committee because this was like 15

1205
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:20,340
countries that got together all sort of

1206
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,200
threw in their interpretation of what

1207
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:25,410
they meant and interpretation number

1208
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:29,069
seven said just because something is

1209
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:32,009
digital or electronic doesn't mean that

1210
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:34,620
it can't be affected by force

1211
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:37,830
right they left open the door to say if

1212
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:40,549
you attack data or if you attacked

1213
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:43,470
systems containing data

1214
00:48:40,549 --> 00:48:46,950
they said this could be considered an

1215
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:50,519
act of war in the context of that so I'm

1216
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:52,230
not you know I appreciated the gentleman

1217
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:53,490
bringing up the anonymous but I'm not

1218
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:54,900
talking about anonymous I don't believe

1219
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:58,589
dr. O'Connor is talking about anonymous

1220
00:48:54,900 --> 00:49:01,470
this is if you are a citizen of a nation

1221
00:48:58,589 --> 00:49:04,650
and you are a subject or whatever you

1222
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:09,058
can be and you are acting in a way that

1223
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:11,220
furthers an ongoing intent of your

1224
00:49:09,059 --> 00:49:13,140
country to violate the sovereignty of

1225
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:14,490
another nation in such a way that that

1226
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:16,650
other country can view you as a

1227
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:19,799
participant in the war I'm arguing me

1228
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:22,319
that we want that to be defined as cyber

1229
00:49:19,799 --> 00:49:25,019
war because it protects the people that

1230
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:27,480
are absolutely don't the issue with that

1231
00:49:25,019 --> 00:49:30,180
is that then you have a situation where

1232
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:32,849
every Yabu signs up for their well

1233
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:36,598
disordered militia and says I'm gonna go

1234
00:49:32,849 --> 00:49:37,920
fight me some apt one and turns out

1235
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:39,240
that's bad there's a reason why we

1236
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,369
leaves the middle of the war to the

1237
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:44,609
professionals is because they have rules

1238
00:49:41,369 --> 00:49:46,499
and training and schooling them lots and

1239
00:49:44,609 --> 00:49:48,180
lots of schooling and other things that

1240
00:49:46,499 --> 00:49:50,430
we find important that they don't go

1241
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:52,470
around rattling video work arms if every

1242
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:55,200
drunken Yahoo with a Metasploit account

1243
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:56,999
goes out and starts attacking China and

1244
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,519
then we declare that that's an act of

1245
00:49:56,999 --> 00:50:03,359
war then we're never going to know not

1246
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:04,618
war just by the way I want to just

1247
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:06,480
address this thing he's brought up twice

1248
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:08,160
that I forgot to get to war is in the

1249
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,109
eye of the beholder no it's absolutely

1250
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:12,420
not

1251
00:50:09,109 --> 00:50:14,009
worries is an objective act and war has

1252
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:15,059
to be actually recognized by the rest of

1253
00:50:14,009 --> 00:50:17,579
the international community to be

1254
00:50:15,059 --> 00:50:20,609
legitimate that's partially result of

1255
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:22,410
the UN but not entirely you don't get to

1256
00:50:20,609 --> 00:50:24,269
say well it was completely legitimate

1257
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:26,009
for the Soviets to shoot down the Korean

1258
00:50:24,269 --> 00:50:27,419
flight it was not it was a crime but the

1259
00:50:26,009 --> 00:50:29,609
Soviets did shoot down a creating flight

1260
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:31,859
cuz you can look at it using binoculars

1261
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:34,890
and notice that it does not say NATO on

1262
00:50:31,859 --> 00:50:36,839
the side and before you say well they

1263
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:38,160
could just not say NATO on the side no

1264
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:40,109
that would be perfectly that would be a

1265
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:42,328
grave breach because pretending to be a

1266
00:50:40,109 --> 00:50:44,279
civilian for the purpose of having

1267
00:50:42,329 --> 00:50:45,420
warlike actions is one of those things

1268
00:50:44,279 --> 00:50:48,150
that literally every

1269
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:49,829
country in the world is required to seek

1270
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:53,240
you out and punish universal

1271
00:50:49,829 --> 00:50:56,300
jurisdiction Universal extradition I

1272
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,299
[Music]

1273
00:51:27,349 --> 00:51:32,630
think we both want to hit this but I'm

1274
00:51:29,309 --> 00:51:36,390
gonna start no and here's the thing

1275
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:38,730
every war has been said by the people

1276
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:40,770
who are living around it since the dawn

1277
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:42,480
of time to be a new war where we're

1278
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:44,400
going to throw the wall the law of war

1279
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,569
away because it's too important we're in

1280
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,720
too much danger and it doesn't really

1281
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:50,579
apply literally everyone you can find

1282
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,529
people who said oh my god

1283
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:54,690
Hannibal led elephants through a

1284
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:55,829
mountain pass we can throw away all the

1285
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:57,690
rules and we're going to burn their

1286
00:51:55,829 --> 00:52:00,089
crops which is one of the oldest times

1287
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:01,799
like laws against war nothing is so

1288
00:52:00,089 --> 00:52:03,808
important that we need to throw away the

1289
00:52:01,799 --> 00:52:05,730
laws of war because the laws of war are

1290
00:52:03,809 --> 00:52:08,099
what protects civilization their

1291
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:13,799
recognition that we have to end war at

1292
00:52:08,099 --> 00:52:15,630
some point but it was a war it's not

1293
00:52:13,799 --> 00:52:16,680
about declaring war that's a us this is

1294
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:16,980
the thing that Americans screw up all

1295
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,109
the time

1296
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:20,280
that's a US political process it's

1297
00:52:19,109 --> 00:52:22,529
irrelevant to the international

1298
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,180
community that was absolutely a war as

1299
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:25,470
declared by everyone in the world except

1300
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,970
the United States and what we call it

1301
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:28,799
internally doesn't matter because what

1302
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:30,959
would what did we do we sent the

1303
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:32,369
military of a sovereign country to go

1304
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,530
invade another sovereign country

1305
00:52:32,369 --> 00:52:42,180
absolutely hot state-on-state action

1306
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:44,020
it's a war i moderator

1307
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:52,120
so I don't actually have a very good

1308
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:54,759
response to the question which is I

1309
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:57,279
think about it in a in a little bit of a

1310
00:52:54,760 --> 00:53:05,380
different domain I'm not a fan of Cold

1311
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:07,030
War's and I would like to see I gave my

1312
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:09,190
in my definition of why you would want

1313
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:11,350
to have more the goal of war if anything

1314
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:23,440
is to is to reach a state of diplomacy

1315
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:29,140
to try to have a a open up front well

1316
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:30,610
I'd rather talk about the eye there was

1317
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:34,870
a second part of this talk that we ended

1318
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:38,520
up getting too derailed by the the the

1319
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:40,690
moderator encouraging the questions I

1320
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:43,210
was I was going to go into some even

1321
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:45,490
more contentious stock which would

1322
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:47,940
further undermine my my my support in

1323
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:51,339
the room but I wanted to point out that

1324
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:52,840
then things like government provide for

1325
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:56,290
the common defense government promotes

1326
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:58,690
the general welfare that there are there

1327
00:53:56,290 --> 00:54:01,029
are reasons why we if you if you've had

1328
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:02,860
if you haven't had a chance to read or

1329
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:05,170
watch President Obama's Nobel Peace

1330
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:08,200
Prize acceptance speech it was a very

1331
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:10,060
fascinating series of arguments that he

1332
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:13,029
made and one of them was that there is

1333
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:15,310
the concept of justifiable war right he

1334
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:17,530
lives in a pragmatic world there is

1335
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:21,640
sometimes evil from the point of view of

1336
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:23,800
him and that justifies doing things that

1337
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:25,569
seems otherwise at odds with receiving

1338
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:27,070
the Nobel Peace Prize and he wanted to

1339
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:30,910
sort of get that out there in the open

1340
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:32,920
right there are one of the one of the

1341
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:34,180
problems that that has come up with the

1342
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:36,940
way that the government has been

1343
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:38,379
prosecuting you know if if we accept for

1344
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,360
a moment that this has been cyber war

1345
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:41,380
then that people have complained about

1346
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,030
the way the government has been

1347
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:46,060
prosecuting the cyber wars we get things

1348
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:48,040
like the NSA snooping and and stuff

1349
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:51,070
going on behind the scenes and potential

1350
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:52,150
erosion of civil liberties and it's done

1351
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:55,000
in a total

1352
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:58,119
clandestine way and there's no

1353
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,069
accountability except by me there's all

1354
00:54:58,119 --> 00:55:01,779
right so there's all three branches of

1355
00:55:00,069 --> 00:55:03,160
government that seem to approve of

1356
00:55:01,779 --> 00:55:05,020
what's going on but from the outside

1357
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:06,788
perspective there's you know you you you

1358
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:08,079
can't tell what's being done you can't

1359
00:55:06,789 --> 00:55:09,849
tell what the effect of what's being

1360
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:12,130
done you don't know you know it's it's

1361
00:55:09,849 --> 00:55:14,230
pretty obvious when the u.s. invades

1362
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:17,200
Korea North Korea it's a lot less

1363
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:19,299
obvious if you know China or the United

1364
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:21,129
States or Iran or take your pick is

1365
00:55:19,299 --> 00:55:23,109
doing things in the cyber domain of the

1366
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:29,910
other country you can say cyber is North

1367
00:55:23,109 --> 00:55:33,250
Korea that's funny and so you know I I

1368
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:35,170
individual liberty is important I would

1369
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:36,609
like for my government to protect that

1370
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:38,170
but there are other things that are also

1371
00:55:36,609 --> 00:55:40,750
important that aren't part of the

1372
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:43,510
conversation because we're fixating on

1373
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:45,279
that right commerce is important the

1374
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:47,619
economy is important right my ability to

1375
00:55:45,279 --> 00:55:53,200
look at cat pictures is important and

1376
00:55:47,619 --> 00:55:57,130
and what I expect from governments is to

1377
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:59,710
be the the the ultimate arbiter in this

1378
00:55:57,130 --> 00:56:01,510
space right it's it's I I want the

1379
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:03,099
government to make the decision of when

1380
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:04,480
they're going to take actions right when

1381
00:56:03,099 --> 00:56:06,279
are you going to bomb somebody when are

1382
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,289
you going to take offensive cyber action

1383
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:10,779
against somebody and I want that to be

1384
00:56:08,289 --> 00:56:12,849
you know voted on by Congress in this in

1385
00:56:10,779 --> 00:56:14,079
the court in in the United States and I

1386
00:56:12,849 --> 00:56:15,940
want there to be sort of a clear

1387
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:17,589
delineating set of the reasons we're

1388
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:19,000
doing this or this and these are the

1389
00:56:17,589 --> 00:56:20,200
things we're going to do to get that and

1390
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,420
once that's there we're going to stop

1391
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:25,538
doing this and so the argument that I

1392
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:29,470
would make about the Cold War question

1393
00:56:25,539 --> 00:56:35,190
is one of the reasons we want this to be

1394
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:39,578
war is if we define these as acts of war

1395
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:41,710
then maybe we don't have as many Cold

1396
00:56:39,579 --> 00:56:42,610
War's which I think would be a good

1397
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:44,260
thing

1398
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:46,150
I'd like to be on the jonad I'm gonna

1399
00:56:44,260 --> 00:57:28,450
start here and then I'm going to work my

1400
00:56:46,150 --> 00:57:30,880
way over to you is that a real word but

1401
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:32,230
somebody killed right so we had my

1402
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,150
destined operations going on all the

1403
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:35,830
time and Tess if you didn't actually say

1404
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:40,530
to work nobody got all the way I was

1405
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:40,529
saying it kind of works

1406
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,460
first yeah there's two different issues

1407
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:58,790
of what you raise which are both image

1408
00:57:55,460 --> 00:58:02,570
rustic one is the is it it's just a

1409
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:05,480
violation of sovereignty enough and I'm

1410
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:07,040
spacing but it essentially becomes the

1411
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:08,810
question of attribution is really the

1412
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,890
issue right like what do we do when we

1413
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:10,880
don't know who it is and there's

1414
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:13,089
actually a question on Twitter about

1415
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:15,260
that to end up that was you

1416
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:16,730
so let's talk about first it like he's

1417
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:19,130
violating the Great Firewall of China it

1418
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:21,830
up it's go to war no it's just not

1419
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:23,630
because this is one of the things the

1420
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:26,450
talent manual definition right that it

1421
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:28,220
has to be cyber damage it essentially

1422
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:31,250
has to be property or blood is

1423
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:32,810
equivalent to a kinetic strike the good

1424
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:35,680
thing about that is it does say that

1425
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:38,240
like a DDoS is not an active war

1426
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:40,430
anti-censorship is not an active war

1427
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:42,109
that's sitting beside the whole fact of

1428
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:43,700
you can't declare war on your own

1429
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:45,680
citizens right that's not a war that's

1430
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:46,939
an internal police issue right we can

1431
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,259
see whether that's a good thing there's

1432
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:50,990
a whole ethical issue of of Chinese

1433
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:52,460
censorship but through the law of war it

1434
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:55,100
doesn't enter into it there's no

1435
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:56,360
territory invasion there's no there's

1436
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:57,830
none of the kinds of violations of

1437
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:01,370
sovereignty that we actually see for

1438
00:58:57,830 --> 00:59:03,410
that the second issue is what do you do

1439
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:05,089
when we can't attribute now you have a

1440
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:07,430
problem the law of course I mentioned

1441
00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:10,310
clearly requires the principal

1442
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:11,629
distinction right so you have to set out

1443
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:13,220
and say like you know this is you know

1444
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:17,660
this ddos brought to you by the United

1445
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:19,730
States Army have a problem right because

1446
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:21,890
this sounds a lot like right the ietf

1447
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:23,720
proposal for an evil bent right you'll

1448
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:25,580
have American military dead packets

1449
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:27,709
right so there's a question as to what

1450
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:31,970
attribution but what distinction really

1451
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:33,920
means in terms of ongoing cyber war but

1452
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:35,839
one thing is fairly clear if you're

1453
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,160
taking act and you have no distinction

1454
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,880
there's just nothing you're just doing

1455
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:40,009
it clandestinely

1456
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:42,290
that's a violation of the law of war and

1457
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:45,710
that's why for hundreds of years you've

1458
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:46,759
been able to hang spots cuz spies aren't

1459
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:48,440
combatants

1460
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:50,450
spies don't set themselves out as

1461
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:52,730
uniformed military and so when you catch

1462
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:54,859
them they aren't subject to protect

1463
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:57,140
of the log or you could just hang them

1464
00:59:54,859 --> 00:59:58,369
as spies totally accepted our

1465
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:00,650
international law for hundreds of years

1466
00:59:58,369 --> 01:00:02,119
these did was we tend not to do it tends

1467
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:07,599
to annoy the Israelis when we catch an

1468
01:00:02,119 --> 01:00:07,599
entire troop but that is still allowed

1469
01:00:07,869 --> 01:00:13,730
so I want to like the question was

1470
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:15,440
worded in such a way that I could really

1471
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:16,609
show how evil I was that can be like I

1472
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,820
hate bunnies and I think they should all

1473
01:00:16,609 --> 01:00:22,400
die

1474
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:26,690
right um I I am not advocating for cyber

1475
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:31,190
war I am not advocating for how a nation

1476
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:34,670
might respond to a perceived act of war

1477
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:36,380
against it I I would respond to your

1478
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:41,210
question by sort of non responding to

1479
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:43,040
your question by saying that one of the

1480
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:45,680
things that does isn't talked about much

1481
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:47,599
in the fear mongering articles about

1482
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:51,740
critical infrastructure being vulnerable

1483
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:54,020
to cyber attack is how will we or they

1484
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:59,140
were the owners of the critical

1485
01:00:54,020 --> 01:01:01,490
infrastructure risk once it happens and

1486
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:03,170
one of the reasons that I agreed to

1487
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:04,430
participate in the debate today knowing

1488
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:07,670
that it was going to be a little bit of

1489
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:10,250
an uphill battle especially arguing

1490
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:16,040
against a lawyer which I never wanted to

1491
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:18,290
do again is yeah I recently watched the

1492
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:21,170
sum of all fears right I'm a big fan of

1493
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:25,400
the of the Tom Clancy books and in the

1494
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:27,349
sum of all fears the the leaders of the

1495
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:28,819
executive branch don't take seriously

1496
01:01:27,349 --> 01:01:31,190
the threat of a nuclear explosion and

1497
01:01:28,819 --> 01:01:37,180
then one happens and the hits the

1498
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:37,180
fan and our hero of narrowly avert

1499
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:45,250
global thermonuclear war through a

1500
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:45,250
totally plausible set of actions and

1501
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:50,700
a reason that I want to have this debate

1502
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:52,590
now Ryan a reason that I think this is a

1503
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:54,509
right time for us to speak at source and

1504
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:55,950
it's a right time for you know everybody

1505
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:58,310
to be sort of talking about the

1506
01:01:55,950 --> 01:02:01,080
implications of this is when it happens

1507
01:01:58,310 --> 01:02:02,970
you know what do we do if China does

1508
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:04,680
decide that that's that they're going to

1509
01:02:02,970 --> 01:02:09,450
take a kinetic response to something

1510
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:11,190
that threatens their way of life there's

1511
01:02:09,450 --> 01:02:14,310
not really a good legal infrastructure

1512
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:15,570
in place to deal with that you know

1513
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:17,640
we'll other countries see it as a

1514
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:20,760
justifiable response if they drop a bomb

1515
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:22,500
on somebody will that be an act of war

1516
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:24,300
that then causes another bomb may drop I

1517
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:27,500
don't know I'm not advocating for that

1518
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:31,400
to be the response but I'm arguing that

1519
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:31,400
given my definitions

1520
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:41,230
it's we may see that kind of response

1521
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:43,180
and so we'd like to figure it out in

1522
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:46,690
advance beforehand that's the best

1523
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:48,430
answer I can give I'd be curious to hear

1524
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:55,960
more of your thoughts that go on so I

1525
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:57,580
want to get some more okay so you're

1526
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:59,770
characterizing the debate as a spectrum

1527
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:01,090
between not war on my end and it's very

1528
01:02:59,770 --> 01:03:02,470
obvious and war at the other end it's

1529
01:03:01,090 --> 01:03:04,660
very obvious but this gray area in

1530
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:06,640
between the negative has given a degree

1531
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:08,259
of characterization around the edges of

1532
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:10,150
their greater I like the other here the

1533
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:12,220
affirmative clarifier what does not war

1534
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:16,090
and what is the most not war you can get

1535
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:18,759
before it gets moving she wants you to

1536
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:26,730
respond I how much cyber does it take

1537
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:26,730
before words library what is not cyber

1538
01:03:31,279 --> 01:03:36,529
stop them I mean I'm looking at the

1539
01:03:35,179 --> 01:03:38,599
paragraph where I actually wrote down

1540
01:03:36,529 --> 01:03:40,609
exactly this but I don't think that my

1541
01:03:38,599 --> 01:03:45,619
answer comes comes up really well right

1542
01:03:40,609 --> 01:03:50,089
I gave the a single act a single denial

1543
01:03:45,619 --> 01:03:52,909
of service isn't a sustained campaign

1544
01:03:50,089 --> 01:03:55,969
that has a measurable impact on economy

1545
01:03:52,909 --> 01:03:58,939
or on the quality of lives of another

1546
01:03:55,969 --> 01:04:01,009
country's citizens or on the ability of

1547
01:03:58,939 --> 01:04:04,519
that country to compete in worldwide

1548
01:04:01,009 --> 01:04:08,089
commercial markets or on the freedoms or

1549
01:04:04,519 --> 01:04:13,008
whatever the the core aspect is I mean

1550
01:04:08,089 --> 01:04:16,249
there are if it's done

1551
01:04:13,009 --> 01:04:25,130
so yeah I'm I'm a marketing guy for

1552
01:04:16,249 --> 01:04:28,218
TripAdvisor right if if there is a

1553
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:29,809
sustained effort by one country to

1554
01:04:28,219 --> 01:04:32,269
violate the sovereignty of another

1555
01:04:29,809 --> 01:04:36,829
country and part of that effort involves

1556
01:04:32,269 --> 01:04:38,419
stock manipulation then the argument

1557
01:04:36,829 --> 01:04:40,609
that I'm putting forth is that the other

1558
01:04:38,419 --> 01:04:43,129
country can consider that one of several

1559
01:04:40,609 --> 01:04:49,150
act more like actions that are happening

1560
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:50,779
to take place in the cyber domain I

1561
01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:52,219
can't answer that

1562
01:04:50,779 --> 01:04:56,469
I think that's an unfair question to ask

1563
01:04:52,219 --> 01:04:58,400
in this context I'm not trying to react

1564
01:04:56,469 --> 01:05:01,640
is something of an unfair question

1565
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:04,099
because there aren't bright lines that's

1566
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:05,419
when it's good but there isn't there's

1567
01:05:04,099 --> 01:05:09,859
not a bright line or there's not a clear

1568
01:05:05,419 --> 01:05:12,109
dividing right there isn't a clear

1569
01:05:09,859 --> 01:05:16,009
moment we didn't get a third color right

1570
01:05:12,109 --> 01:05:17,750
so we had to pick one side I don't agree

1571
01:05:16,009 --> 01:05:21,320
with John on this one dr.

1572
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:24,200
we're going to be annoying I don't think

1573
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:26,030
that Cheerilee economic damage can

1574
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:27,680
qualify as an invasion of sovereign to

1575
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:29,330
eat such that it isn't it becomes an act

1576
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:31,549
of aggression I just don't think so I

1577
01:05:29,330 --> 01:05:33,200
don't think if apt one causes the next

1578
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:35,690
flash crash that that's an act of war

1579
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:38,060
that we can legally respond to but that

1580
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:39,470
is an open area for debate and nerds all

1581
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:43,250
over the world are fighting it out at

1582
01:05:39,470 --> 01:05:46,279
this one including on it it's also a

1583
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:47,630
little bit challenging Brendon mentioned

1584
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:50,690
debate club at the beginning of the

1585
01:05:47,630 --> 01:05:52,700
potox right I think it's pretty clear

1586
01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:54,470
that that Brendon has put a lot of

1587
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:56,270
thought and effort into positions he's

1588
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:59,169
advocating today it's a little more

1589
01:05:56,270 --> 01:06:01,490
challenging from my perspective I

1590
01:05:59,170 --> 01:06:05,690
personally fall somewhere in the gray

1591
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:07,609
area I think but I also did not have any

1592
01:06:05,690 --> 01:06:10,760
problem preparing the arguments for this

1593
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:13,220
I mean I'm I I wanted to when when

1594
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:14,780
Brendon first approached me to ask me if

1595
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:17,750
I would be interested in debating him on

1596
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:20,360
this topic we realized that there was a

1597
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:23,000
little bit of a Star Wars theme going on

1598
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:26,660
right that Here I am you know the the

1599
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:29,900
Sith Lord advocating for you know the

1600
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:32,450
the global hegemony of and and got young

1601
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:34,130
Luke over here who's sort of fighting

1602
01:06:32,450 --> 01:06:37,220
the Rebel Alliance and so when he was

1603
01:06:34,130 --> 01:06:39,080
describing that you know that no this

1604
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:42,640
this this isn't war I wanted to say

1605
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:42,640
search you know

1606
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:47,550
because I'm not sure that's the Star

1607
01:06:45,090 --> 01:06:49,350
Wars character I would be playing since

1608
01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:50,880
you know he used to be my teachers I'm

1609
01:06:49,350 --> 01:06:52,860
pretty sure I'm Darth Vader in this sort

1610
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:57,300
of about to die horribly right at the

1611
01:06:52,860 --> 01:07:01,110
end so you know so to summarize you know

1612
01:06:57,300 --> 01:07:02,430
the last of my points right I I think it

1613
01:07:01,110 --> 01:07:03,990
is reasonable to look at what's

1614
01:07:02,430 --> 01:07:07,109
happening on the internet and state that

1615
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:08,339
that you know reasonable countries can

1616
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:09,660
look at the things that are happening to

1617
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:11,880
them and if it's a sustained campaign

1618
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:14,370
and it appears to be coming from one or

1619
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:17,640
more nations that they have an

1620
01:07:14,370 --> 01:07:19,529
adversarial stance against to say we

1621
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:21,870
consider these to be warlike actions

1622
01:07:19,530 --> 01:07:24,480
right and so instead of just sitting by

1623
01:07:21,870 --> 01:07:26,580
and taking it or filing appeals with the

1624
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:28,650
International Court of Justice we feel

1625
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:31,710
justified in taking some matters into

1626
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:32,850
our own hands and responding to that I

1627
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:34,440
believe that it's the role of

1628
01:07:32,850 --> 01:07:35,580
governments so I'm asserting at least

1629
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:38,820
that it's the role of governments to

1630
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:41,520
prosecute such wars and the reason that

1631
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:43,230
these are important is again if you're

1632
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:45,720
doing it furtively you're doing it wrong

1633
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:47,520
right I would like to see the use the

1634
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:49,200
development and use of cyber munitions

1635
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:52,160
to be something that happens more in the

1636
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:56,609
open once you all agree to vote yes

1637
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:58,529
because I think that that that means

1638
01:07:56,610 --> 01:08:01,200
that the implications that I talked

1639
01:07:58,530 --> 01:08:03,240
about right the the the the possibility

1640
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:05,250
that somebody could be considered a

1641
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:06,569
combatant even if they're you know

1642
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:08,430
they're babs that they're wearing is

1643
01:08:06,570 --> 01:08:09,570
that they're wearing Cheetos dust

1644
01:08:08,430 --> 01:08:10,589
because they're sitting in front of

1645
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:12,660
their computer in their mother's

1646
01:08:10,590 --> 01:08:14,790
basement

1647
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:16,050
I shouldn't be I'm actually trying to

1648
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:18,810
make a serious point so I shouldn't make

1649
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:20,370
as many jokes I guess um that that

1650
01:08:18,810 --> 01:08:22,680
that's what we want you know we want to

1651
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:24,990
say this is war or this can be

1652
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:27,540
considered and we want to think about

1653
01:08:24,990 --> 01:08:29,700
the implications of that so that we as

1654
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:31,680
security practitioners respect are

1655
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:34,139
protected but especially so that

1656
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:36,720
civilians and civilian infrastructure

1657
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:38,580
and financial systems and mail systems

1658
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:41,670
and communication systems that could be

1659
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:44,069
you know in dr. O'Connor's village that

1660
01:08:41,670 --> 01:08:45,690
gets taken out right that these are

1661
01:08:44,069 --> 01:08:48,029
things that we say look we explicitly

1662
01:08:45,689 --> 01:08:49,740
want these to be protected so if nations

1663
01:08:48,029 --> 01:08:52,200
are engaging in cyber war with each

1664
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:53,849
other we want to exclude these and we

1665
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:57,389
want to say that if you have

1666
01:08:53,850 --> 01:08:58,890
to violate these there is some larger

1667
01:08:57,390 --> 01:09:00,270
international justice that will come in

1668
01:08:58,890 --> 01:09:01,050
and say no you can't do that you

1669
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:02,730
shouldn't have done that

1670
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:04,050
you need to make reparations to the

1671
01:09:02,729 --> 01:09:06,809
people that you effected by doing that

1672
01:09:04,050 --> 01:09:08,550
and so to conclude I would like your

1673
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:10,800
vote in saying that the state of the

1674
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:12,240
Internet is de facto cyber war and then

1675
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:32,640
it is the role of governments to

1676
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:35,040
prosecute such wars you can

1677
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:37,290
snipers but but more to the point a

1678
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:40,140
group of soldiers can operate from

1679
01:09:37,290 --> 01:09:41,729
camouflage and ambush and they still

1680
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:43,740
have to be identifiable but they can

1681
01:09:41,729 --> 01:09:46,559
hide themselves so you don't have to I

1682
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:48,179
don't think during wartime the United

1683
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:50,430
States government would have to put on

1684
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:53,850
the DDoS attack brought to you by the US

1685
01:09:50,430 --> 01:09:56,220
Army but they have cannot bring on the

1686
01:09:53,850 --> 01:09:57,840
DDoS attack brought to you by the Red

1687
01:09:56,220 --> 01:09:59,040
Cross they have to put you yeah they

1688
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:01,730
can't pretend this from somewhere else

1689
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:04,290
so I just wanted to quibble about that

1690
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:05,910
but the other thing I wanted to say is I

1691
01:10:04,290 --> 01:10:09,090
think the real distinct the real

1692
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:11,430
argument here is not between peace and

1693
01:10:09,090 --> 01:10:14,520
war or cold war and war but between

1694
01:10:11,430 --> 01:10:19,820
espionage and war come at it from that

1695
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:19,820
perspective so so stand back up and talk

1696
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:27,480
the I actually just went to play having

1697
01:10:24,510 --> 01:10:29,220
having done a dominant attack I want to

1698
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:31,519
make another fallacy and appeal to

1699
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:34,080
Authority

1700
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:36,240
so I mentioned an article before Bruce

1701
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:37,650
Schneier is March 2014 article in the

1702
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:39,300
Atlantic so you can find this on his

1703
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:43,530
blog or you can find it on the Atlantic

1704
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:44,820
he and he made he sort of addresses the

1705
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:46,590
point that you've brought up right he

1706
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:48,570
says that there is Network attack

1707
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:50,130
there's network exploitation for one

1708
01:10:48,570 --> 01:10:52,889
both of these should be only under the

1709
01:10:50,130 --> 01:10:54,360
purview of the military but for two for

1710
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:56,670
the same reasons I mentioned earlier in

1711
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:59,219
the talk because there is no attribution

1712
01:10:56,670 --> 01:11:00,330
right now for exploitation in spying

1713
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:02,700
activities that are happening on the

1714
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:05,220
network that those should right now be

1715
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:06,470
considered network attack actions as

1716
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:08,550
well and so both of those things

1717
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:09,480
according to Bruce Schneier are loved

1718
01:11:08,550 --> 01:11:11,640
together

1719
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:12,839
I enjoyed reading his article and I just

1720
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:16,440
wanted to point everybody to that as

1721
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:18,980
well for March 2014 did you want to make

1722
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:18,980
a closing statement

1723
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:36,139
it's a comment in terms of uniforms we

1724
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:38,540
have color you know special ops people

1725
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:41,120
who are not working from uniform

1726
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:44,930
we're fighting combatants who are not

1727
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:47,140
uniform though things like that in our

1728
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:50,050
own physical warfare

1729
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:52,490
in the soccer warfare we're dealing with

1730
01:11:50,050 --> 01:11:55,550
potential adversaries where there's a

1731
01:11:52,490 --> 01:11:57,320
major economic impact should they decide

1732
01:11:55,550 --> 01:11:59,790
to pull up and sell a lot of all the

1733
01:11:57,320 --> 01:12:01,980
bonds that are in the u.s. comments

1734
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:04,330
[Music]

1735
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:07,419
specifically talking about nation-states

1736
01:12:04,330 --> 01:12:09,470
who happen to buy some of our publicly

1737
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:11,690
available

1738
01:12:09,470 --> 01:12:14,270
so there are a number of ramifications

1739
01:12:11,690 --> 01:12:16,820
that just say okay we're going to fight

1740
01:12:14,270 --> 01:12:20,350
back in Andover you know declare war

1741
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:23,990
etcetera has very big economic impacts

1742
01:12:20,350 --> 01:12:28,270
on our economy and everything we do as

1743
01:12:23,990 --> 01:12:32,090
well as west of the world it's not a

1744
01:12:28,270 --> 01:12:33,980
simple matter of saying they launched my

1745
01:12:32,090 --> 01:12:36,200
act on us we're going to launch an

1746
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:38,209
attack but one may be fighting back who

1747
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:41,780
knows we don't know what's going on we

1748
01:12:38,210 --> 01:12:46,730
know the NSA has a lot of still being

1749
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:48,400
taken advantage of and disk very deeply

1750
01:12:46,730 --> 01:12:53,110
embedded systems

1751
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:58,000
you know Stuxnet is pretty well known

1752
01:12:53,110 --> 01:13:01,179
it's really terrible

1753
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:09,670
but declaring war is probably pushing

1754
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:11,110
things that's it let's say I think a

1755
01:13:09,670 --> 01:13:12,790
very good point and it really

1756
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:15,400
underscores the point that the gentleman

1757
01:13:12,790 --> 01:13:19,450
over here made as well about the nature

1758
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:20,740
of Cold War's that if we look back over

1759
01:13:19,450 --> 01:13:22,750
the last seventy years of military

1760
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:24,160
history well now there's an atomic bomb

1761
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:25,810
so we're never going to have war again

1762
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:26,860
right now there's been these atrocities

1763
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:28,270
and so we're going to set up these

1764
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:30,519
international things we're never going

1765
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:32,710
to have war again and the human race

1766
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:35,250
just keeps you know outshining itself

1767
01:13:32,710 --> 01:13:38,390
and we keep finding ways to have war

1768
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:38,390
[Music]

1769
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:43,870
since Hiroshima and Nagasaki to my

1770
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:46,139
knowledge we have not used nukes in New

1771
01:13:43,870 --> 01:13:46,140
York

1772
01:13:48,219 --> 01:13:57,530
right um you know I think that's a and

1773
01:13:55,460 --> 01:14:01,369
did you have anything you want to say I

1774
01:13:57,530 --> 01:14:02,659
mean that's I mean it wasn't phrased in

1775
01:14:01,369 --> 01:14:08,900
the form of a question really right I

1776
01:14:02,659 --> 01:14:11,900
think the you maybe maybe there is this

1777
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:15,739
new class of war right in this new class

1778
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:17,080
of war is is covert war and it's it's

1779
01:14:15,739 --> 01:14:20,110
things that are done without attribution

1780
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:22,730
right and it's it's things where

1781
01:14:20,110 --> 01:14:24,650
collateral damage is more except was

1782
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:26,089
this morning in the bathroom before I

1783
01:14:24,650 --> 01:14:27,549
left to come here I was reading an

1784
01:14:26,090 --> 01:14:31,730
article from The New Yorker from about

1785
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:34,849
three months ago that was about the

1786
01:14:31,730 --> 01:14:38,509
CIA's proxy involvement in international

1787
01:14:34,849 --> 01:14:40,429
student organizations as part of a early

1788
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:42,590
cold war effort against the Soviet Union

1789
01:14:40,429 --> 01:14:45,440
that was also fostering large

1790
01:14:42,590 --> 01:14:47,119
organizations and it was just a it was

1791
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:50,269
just an astounding article to read

1792
01:14:47,119 --> 01:14:53,659
because well the Soviets are doing it it

1793
01:14:50,270 --> 01:14:56,150
must be bad we can't overtly support

1794
01:14:53,659 --> 01:14:58,129
this because a our taxpayers don't want

1795
01:14:56,150 --> 01:15:00,500
to see us wasting tax money on this and

1796
01:14:58,130 --> 01:15:02,360
B we can't be seen to be giving the

1797
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:04,070
Soviets you know the Cruden's of what

1798
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:05,239
they're doing is okay so what we're

1799
01:15:04,070 --> 01:15:07,190
gonna do is set up some shell

1800
01:15:05,239 --> 01:15:08,449
corporations and funnel some money to

1801
01:15:07,190 --> 01:15:10,699
some people that we've already vetted

1802
01:15:08,449 --> 01:15:12,799
we're gonna make sure that only CIA

1803
01:15:10,699 --> 01:15:14,928
friendly candidates become the

1804
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:16,310
presidents of these organizations so the

1805
01:15:14,929 --> 01:15:17,630
money gets spent the way that we want

1806
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:21,349
and it was just jaw-dropping

1807
01:15:17,630 --> 01:15:22,849
and that's what we did 50 years ago who

1808
01:15:21,349 --> 01:15:26,090
knows what we're doing today I don't

1809
01:15:22,849 --> 01:15:27,530
know but I am willing to stand up here

1810
01:15:26,090 --> 01:15:31,610
and say it say the same answer I gave

1811
01:15:27,530 --> 01:15:34,759
before it I don't like this right if if

1812
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:36,830
the if what war does is forces you into

1813
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:39,590
a state of diplomacy this is some middle

1814
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:42,290
state where you can continue for a long

1815
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:43,710
time to have negative impact on people

1816
01:15:42,290 --> 01:15:47,679
and on economy

1817
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:50,920
everything without any attribution

1818
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:56,290
without any visibility without press in

1819
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:58,150
many cases and so if yes and so if if

1820
01:15:56,290 --> 01:16:01,780
through this resolution or in video

1821
01:15:58,150 --> 01:16:02,980
beyond the the ages of today right if we

1822
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:05,290
can get to a point where we say that's

1823
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:07,178
not an acceptable way to do this I think

1824
01:16:05,290 --> 01:16:32,500
that would be a great feature state for

1825
01:16:07,179 --> 01:16:35,080
us to follow those laws just because

1826
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:36,790
they don't doesn't mean you're just

1827
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:39,250
because there is no more doesn't mean

1828
01:16:36,790 --> 01:16:42,429
your village is safe there can still be

1829
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:44,560
enemies that can come in and kill the

1830
01:16:42,429 --> 01:16:47,650
people and take over the village there

1831
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:53,489
still is no war until another sovereign

1832
01:16:47,650 --> 01:16:55,420
state declares that they are well so

1833
01:16:53,489 --> 01:16:59,349
there's two points there but okay

1834
01:16:55,420 --> 01:17:06,840
another question

1835
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:06,840
that you said there needs to be some

1836
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:37,210
what if well I mean so there's two

1837
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:38,559
questions in that last thing and we'll

1838
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:42,100
go back to the first one the first one

1839
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:43,870
is if you know if a nation-state breaks

1840
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:45,640
into Internet of Things and causes the

1841
01:17:43,870 --> 01:17:49,059
internet of pacemakers to be internet of

1842
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:50,200
nothing yeah that can absolutely be an

1843
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:51,310
act of war that's a body count it's

1844
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,780
actually not just an active war it's a

1845
01:17:51,310 --> 01:17:54,730
war crime because it's killing civilians

1846
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:56,559
I don't think there's any real question

1847
01:17:54,730 --> 01:18:00,730
about that the question of attribution

1848
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:02,560
is one of you know so dr. Griffin

1849
01:18:00,730 --> 01:18:04,690
brought up before the state attribution

1850
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:07,540
doctrine to state action doctrine which

1851
01:18:04,690 --> 01:18:09,009
is if it is truly an act on behalf of a

1852
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:11,410
state then it gets described to the

1853
01:18:09,010 --> 01:18:14,020
state and that's in a few different ways

1854
01:18:11,410 --> 01:18:17,290
there's interesting cases that I won't

1855
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:18,900
bore you with but about Argentina and

1856
01:18:17,290 --> 01:18:22,690
the debt crisis and there's neat stuff

1857
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:25,719
if you can absolutely prove that it's

1858
01:18:22,690 --> 01:18:27,790
backed by a government then sure that

1859
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:29,860
could probably be that level but I don't

1860
01:18:27,790 --> 01:18:31,330
see right now is I see a lot of finger

1861
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:33,849
pointing I see a lot of FBI most wanted

1862
01:18:31,330 --> 01:18:36,370
postings I don't see an awful lot of

1863
01:18:33,850 --> 01:18:41,860
proof that certain groups are actually

1864
01:18:36,370 --> 01:18:44,349
bad but I've ever mice and there's two

1865
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:45,929
missed quota John no no John Scalzi to

1866
01:18:44,350 --> 01:18:48,400
misquote of science fiction novella

1867
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:50,650
there is more to life than these two

1868
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:52,629
sides I think there are third actors

1869
01:18:50,650 --> 01:18:53,580
right I think there are other groups and

1870
01:18:52,630 --> 01:18:55,600
I think sometimes they have their own

1871
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:57,309
purposes they have their own ends I

1872
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:58,870
don't think every possible negative

1873
01:18:57,310 --> 01:18:59,920
outcome to the United States is

1874
01:18:58,870 --> 01:19:00,449
necessarily they get an outcome that

1875
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:02,729
would be

1876
01:19:00,449 --> 01:19:03,719
by an enemy of the United States there

1877
01:19:02,729 --> 01:19:05,789
are other people who might want

1878
01:19:03,719 --> 01:19:06,959
especially economic harms to befall the

1879
01:19:05,789 --> 01:19:08,610
United States or to befall other

1880
01:19:06,959 --> 01:19:10,309
countries I don't think you have to get

1881
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:12,570
the cyber war or just war to get there

1882
01:19:10,309 --> 01:19:14,610
but one other thing I wanted to point

1883
01:19:12,570 --> 01:19:17,940
out the idea of not everybody follows

1884
01:19:14,610 --> 01:19:21,749
the law of war totally correct but the

1885
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:24,089
law of war isn't like Foursquare on the

1886
01:19:21,749 --> 01:19:25,880
playground right it's how well he didn't

1887
01:19:24,090 --> 01:19:28,590
play fair so I would have to play either

1888
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:32,989
and the reason for that is because we

1889
01:19:28,590 --> 01:19:36,300
have to have something go back to if you

1890
01:19:32,989 --> 01:19:37,589
accept the lost ground of their not exit

1891
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:38,969
they're not following FEMA conventions

1892
01:19:37,590 --> 01:19:42,300
or the other rules to protect civilians

1893
01:19:38,969 --> 01:19:44,789
so we don't have to either you've given

1894
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:46,440
up the only thing that makes war end and

1895
01:19:44,789 --> 01:19:48,780
you can see what happens

1896
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:51,900
because we have two examples in the last

1897
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:53,550
century that dramatically show that one

1898
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:55,228
is the Irish War of Independence over

1899
01:19:53,550 --> 01:19:57,420
the troubles the other one is Israel in

1900
01:19:55,229 --> 01:19:59,130
Palestine and so in both cases you have

1901
01:19:57,420 --> 01:20:02,429
a situation where there's an original

1902
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:07,289
war that's fought by people who remember

1903
01:20:02,429 --> 01:20:08,789
what it was to be not at war and there's

1904
01:20:07,289 --> 01:20:10,130
atrocities and there's killing of

1905
01:20:08,789 --> 01:20:13,530
children then there's burning the fields

1906
01:20:10,130 --> 01:20:15,659
there's poison at the earth and you end

1907
01:20:13,530 --> 01:20:17,400
up in a situation where now people who

1908
01:20:15,659 --> 01:20:19,049
are laughs don't know anything before

1909
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:21,719
especially the children who grew up the

1910
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:23,639
few who weren't bombed etc have never

1911
01:20:21,719 --> 01:20:25,199
known anything but war and so they've

1912
01:20:23,639 --> 01:20:27,690
played a different thing it's not a type

1913
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:29,610
of war that leads to a resolution ever

1914
01:20:27,690 --> 01:20:31,440
it's a permanent war it's a total war

1915
01:20:29,610 --> 01:20:33,329
it's a war of assassination and bombings

1916
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:34,888
and killings of unrelated government

1917
01:20:33,329 --> 01:20:36,539
officials and it's a world where both

1918
01:20:34,889 --> 01:20:40,039
sides feel equally justified if it

1919
01:20:36,539 --> 01:20:42,539
atrocities these every time you have a

1920
01:20:40,039 --> 01:20:43,920
Israeli airstrike that blows up a

1921
01:20:42,539 --> 01:20:45,360
Palestinian school you have a

1922
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:47,550
Palestinian suicide bombing that blows

1923
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:50,459
up in Israeli school bus and back and

1924
01:20:47,550 --> 01:20:52,409
forth and around the atrocities go and

1925
01:20:50,459 --> 01:20:54,479
neither side is justified and it will

1926
01:20:52,409 --> 01:20:56,480
never end because neither side has

1927
01:20:54,479 --> 01:20:59,510
anything left that

1928
01:20:56,480 --> 01:21:02,690
we have the law of war and we stick to

1929
01:20:59,510 --> 01:21:04,040
it even when enemies don't because we

1930
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:06,019
believe that there's something more

1931
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:07,640
important than our current battle even

1932
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:09,020
if it is an existential threat we

1933
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:11,690
believe the civilization is more

1934
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:13,250
important than our current wars so it is

1935
01:21:11,690 --> 01:21:14,660
crucial that we have to follow the law

1936
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:17,840
of war that's why we fiddle around with

1937
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:19,580
definitions is because these definitions

1938
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:22,430
are what we've come up with over

1939
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:27,309
centuries to protect having a human way

1940
01:21:22,430 --> 01:21:27,310
of life at all so we're down to the last

1941
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:42,179
[Music]

1942
01:21:45,820 --> 01:21:48,950
that's irrelevant of the law of war

1943
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:50,509
however again as I mentioned before

1944
01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:51,980
internal political struggles are not

1945
01:21:50,510 --> 01:21:54,560
relevant to an external international

1946
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:56,000
people definition of war it's just it I

1947
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:57,890
mean like we can fuss around all day

1948
