1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:04,739
so who is Jeremiah mad scientist that

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:10,170
OpenDNS

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:11,639
last venomous as an MS in computer

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,690
science from University of San Francisco

5
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:17,910
actually just graduated recently

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:21,689
previously I worked at mandiant doing

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:25,230
instant response DNS research Evernote

8
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:29,400
doing app SEC uh and IR and also over

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:32,308
doing a data science so my career goals

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,199
I just even outside network security

11
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:37,078
just overall I'd like to solve

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,700
interesting problems I was in network

13
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,640
security I'd probably be in bio

14
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,430
computing bioinformatics or maybe kind

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,980
of working on GPS tracking I like that

16
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,440
stuff I've done some Kalman filtering I

17
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,849
like video games kind of not necessarily

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,539
cuz I play video games but just because

19
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:57,420
kind of the cool programming and yeah a

20
00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:03,739
bunch of other stuff in a proud SF SPCA

21
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:05,760
pit bull puppy owner pretty crazy but um

22
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:07,890
so I just want to let you guys know I

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,520
have a lot of stuff today so if I go a

24
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:13,220
little fast

25
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:16,170
I'm intend to so yeah so basically

26
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:19,048
OpenDNS Security Labs what do we do I

27
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:23,040
say in a summary we're data science

28
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:26,159
intersects network security so big

29
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,490
security data DNS traffic I'm sure

30
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,250
you've all heard like in the marketing

31
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:35,610
70 billion DNS for over seventy 70

32
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,460
billion DNS queries per day and also we

33
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:41,579
have HTTP HTTP traffic now with our

34
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:45,059
proxy team so 10.1 million requests per

35
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:47,789
day so our daily tasks are detection

36
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,610
algorithms building detection algorithms

37
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:53,159
security data analysis distributed

38
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:58,020
systems big data engineering and data

39
00:01:53,159 --> 00:02:01,229
visualization so just the overall

40
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:04,110
purpose of this talk is to describe one

41
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:07,469
of our new models that are built and

42
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:09,929
it's called NOP rank and basically at

43
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:10,859
its core it's a fraud detection system

44
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,010
using natural language processing

45
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,830
technique

46
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:17,950
and traffic features to identify domain

47
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:20,950
squatting and brand spoofing in DNS and

48
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:23,940
HTTP traffic and this is a technique

49
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:28,629
that is commonly used by fishing in apt

50
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:31,989
SI toos and just a note so when I say

51
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:37,480
apt I'm a data scientist this is just a

52
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:38,890
label data set and I will used to work

53
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,200
for mania so it's just not to go with

54
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:47,679
like gung-ho and like super buzzword

55
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:51,129
heavy on the apt term so yeah and I'm a

56
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:55,989
Python fan boy I used

57
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:57,429
I love Python I use it every day NLP for

58
00:02:55,989 --> 00:03:00,420
NLP it's great and data science

59
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:05,680
obviously NL TK is widely known

60
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:07,238
scikit-learn and I really like Jensen if

61
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,519
you guys haven't used this you guys got

62
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:12,579
to check it out it's pretty cool for

63
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,410
topic modeling and this is being

64
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:18,099
developed and catching a lot of fire and

65
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:19,930
the data science community and for so

66
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:24,250
web scraping for beautifulsoup

67
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:27,609
and L XML okay so the origins of the

68
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:29,739
system so OpenDNS labs you know when i

69
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:32,280
first came there it had a lot of

70
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:35,500
detection models for commodity malware

71
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,630
botnet fast bots DGA detection and they

72
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:41,410
needed a model for targeted attacks and

73
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:43,269
phishing a phishing attack so basically

74
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:47,380
I was assigned the dark hotel data set

75
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:50,620
to analyze write a blog on and so the

76
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:52,930
basic question is how does tech evil and

77
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,629
DNS records using lexical features of

78
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:58,329
the fully qualified domain name and not

79
00:03:55,629 --> 00:04:02,048
only that validate the results because

80
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:03,879
false positives are obviously you know

81
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:07,810
one of the major problems among

82
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:09,970
detection models so I just want to

83
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:13,290
propose this and just to keep in mind as

84
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:15,730
it's an overall theme for the talk

85
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:17,500
human-computer interaction so basically

86
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:20,108
targeted attacks from a psychological

87
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,479
perspective if you were a high profile

88
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:24,789
executive for a company what kind of

89
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,440
links would you click on what are your

90
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:30,210
interests

91
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,790
so basically commodity commodity fishing

92
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:36,609
follows the same psychology and

93
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:39,010
obviously it preys on like the human

94
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,870
nature so topics of interest obviously

95
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,860
money

96
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:45,070
everybody likes getting stuff for free

97
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,990
everybody likes getting money bank

98
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,510
accounts credit cards obviously

99
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:53,830
financial that'll be want one so then

100
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:55,270
news security software updates which is

101
00:04:53,830 --> 00:05:03,359
are getting them all the time and also

102
00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:07,510
social network so these are the kind of

103
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:11,860
brands and like really I want to

104
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:15,580
emphasize I my model is only focused

105
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:21,700
right now on the big brand names and as

106
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:24,640
you can see here so I just want to talk

107
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:27,520
briefly about the data pipe pipeline for

108
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:31,090
for harnessing all that data

109
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,490
it's a project called Avalanche managed

110
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:35,830
by and written by a senior security

111
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:38,440
researcher Tebow Tebow Hawaii and

112
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:42,250
probably butchered that but it's a

113
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:44,800
real-time system a real-time system with

114
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:47,800
a streaming graph architecture and this

115
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:52,180
stream is a series of nodes basically

116
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:54,520
processors threads or ec2 machines and

117
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:58,090
then edges are the streams between the

118
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:01,150
input and output nodes and the scalable

119
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:02,890
real-time processing system and NLP you

120
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:05,440
rank is running currently on its

121
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:07,030
authoritative logs handles white listing

122
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,730
black listing and also enriching the

123
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:16,409
data so a supplemental lookup for like a

124
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:20,980
SNS and you know geoip lookups so yeah

125
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:24,310
so yeah just this is just a basically a

126
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:29,400
graph this is the graph architecture but

127
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:31,890
also this is shows you could see here so

128
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,700
basically sometimes we sample the data

129
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:36,130
depending on like you know when we're

130
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,000
testing models we can do like point 1

131
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:39,070
percent of our

132
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,290
10% of the traffic versus 90% of the

133
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:43,030
traffic or then we have a matter for

134
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,980
like blacklisting and whitelisting and

135
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:47,229
then the enricher node the console here

136
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:49,930
is just like a UI so you can see it and

137
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:55,060
then we have the models this is just a

138
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:58,780
like an example so yeah you can see like

139
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:00,880
basically at each each node basically

140
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:02,440
you're getting either you know you're

141
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,930
filtering that you have a filter on the

142
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:09,940
traffic or you're getting a processing

143
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:12,910
the traffic on your model so yeah let's

144
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:18,219
delve into it so for heuristic number

145
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:20,440
one ASN filtering so for those who don't

146
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,820
know what a ASN is basically autonomous

147
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,469
system number is basically it's like

148
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:26,080
your neighborhood or zip code on the

149
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:27,970
Internet sociated with your internet

150
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:32,710
service provider and basically a set of

151
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:36,370
routers under specific or multiple

152
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:37,870
routing protocols and domains exhibiting

153
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:39,550
fraudulent behavior are observed to be

154
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:41,260
hosted on SNS that are totally

155
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:46,480
unassociated with the company they are

156
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:48,159
spoofing so basically you know something

157
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,800
with like google update that's not

158
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,840
coming from google's ASN that's kind of

159
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,210
weird

160
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,919
here's some examples so so you expect we

161
00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:00,190
would expect like a fully qualified

162
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:04,539
domain containing Adobe to be associated

163
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:08,890
with Adobe's ASN and these are these the

164
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:12,360
ASN of Adobe and then also like for

165
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:15,130
example Java some fully qualified domain

166
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,560
for example like a Java update that's

167
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:21,250
not coming from Oracle's ASN that will

168
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:24,580
be also kind of weird so yeah and here's

169
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:27,850
something real life example so and in

170
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:31,359
the apt example from the recent carbon

171
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:33,659
act banking Trojan it's Adobe update and

172
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:38,800
they're coming and also update that Java

173
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:42,250
coming from Petersburg internet internet

174
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:44,140
and network LLC in Russia and usually

175
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:48,150
basically why aren't they coming from

176
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:51,199
Oracle and Adobe they ascend and say

177
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:53,970
think for the commodity fishing examples

178
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:58,080
security check PayPal why is it coming

179
00:08:53,970 --> 00:09:00,720
from eBay ASM yeah the dishes typically

180
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,840
know what what paypal.com would be

181
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,120
beyond and they're coming from Cirrus

182
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,910
one and josue services and these are

183
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,370
common perpetrators the usual suspects

184
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:14,490
yeah Cirrus one is the top so this was

185
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:17,580
taken stats from fish tank so these are

186
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:20,840
the top like offenders for phishing

187
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:23,730
sites serious one unified layer OVH

188
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:26,310
GoDaddy and obviously yeah the usual

189
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:33,060
suspects we see these all the time I'd

190
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:36,359
say II nom - yeah ok so first step yet

191
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:38,660
so we want to take a big chunk out of

192
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:43,920
the traffic because text processing is

193
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:47,130
computationally intensive so work with

194
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:51,420
dia on this and we we work with a lot of

195
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:53,670
ASN data on at Open DNS and DMF module

196
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:56,069
is a PhD in graph theory he spoke here

197
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,990
last year actually he does like best

198
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,930
books and ASN analysis

199
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:02,820
so basically authors come in with it's

200
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:07,410
been richer node what we'll do look up

201
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:09,990
on the a essay on the IP and I get the

202
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:11,579
ASN and included in the logs so

203
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,510
basically we create a mapping of brand

204
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:16,800
names to the legitimate ASNs and

205
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:20,610
basically lookup domains as they come in

206
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,170
and if they do not come from those

207
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,000
legitimate answers we just we just throw

208
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:28,229
them out so we don't want anything

209
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,950
coming from Google Yahoo s and we just

210
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:36,000
want yeah kind of the low of the lower

211
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:38,370
ranking stuff so so here it's a

212
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,840
heuristic number two so now we get in

213
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,800
the kind of like natural language the

214
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,790
beginning natural language processing

215
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,439
aspect so defining a malicious language

216
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:50,640
of the internet with full equality

217
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:52,980
within fully qualified domains so first

218
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,960
thing i did i'll and i always do is that

219
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:59,940
they decide to build intuitions you know

220
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:02,490
eyeball the data run basic metrics you

221
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:05,200
know just get a good grasp of the

222
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:06,279
and I can't sure there's enough all the

223
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,200
times I just start sometimes I just

224
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:09,610
start writing code I'm like wish I went

225
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,240
back and ran metric metrics at the

226
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:14,980
beginning and yeah so basically I

227
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:20,680
extracted important words and sub

228
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:23,589
strings in the apt datasets and I found

229
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:26,079
kind of that apt domains exhibit similar

230
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:28,870
similar lexical features to commodity

231
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,180
fishing domains so it's and it's

232
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:33,010
important to look at the co-occurrence

233
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:36,939
co-occurrences or buy grams and try

234
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:39,279
again try grams within these domains and

235
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:41,079
so yeah you could like basically go

236
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,459
through the domain and look at all this

237
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:46,810
look at the sub strings and fine if I'd

238
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:49,000
like basically for example take

239
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:51,729
dictionary words just throw the

240
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,070
dictionary at it like extra and extract

241
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:55,450
like you know whatever words in the

242
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,589
dictionary look at that that's kind of

243
00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:00,250
interesting

244
00:11:56,589 --> 00:12:02,260
so from the apt days that's extract your

245
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:05,890
words from the dictionary and applies

246
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:08,800
stemming which is a text processing

247
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:11,740
technique to basically get the get the

248
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:15,939
root of the word so here are the top

249
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:18,790
counts of the apt data sets like the

250
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:21,820
from the dictionary words so you could

251
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:26,140
see mail news soft soft which is like

252
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:29,829
software serve server update game online

253
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:31,630
auto port host free login link kind of

254
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:37,029
interesting right

255
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:39,430
so with bigram collocation so basically

256
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:41,320
that the co-occurrences words that

257
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,739
appear often with each other Adobe

258
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,839
update

259
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:46,050
yeah update - Java this is a common

260
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:49,570
theme no they could be McAfee update

261
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:54,520
McAfee you know - secure - server -

262
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:57,070
update the list goes on so the idea is

263
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:59,920
that you have a brand name of what I

264
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:01,690
term is called it's called my own

265
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:06,670
made-up word is it's an advertising

266
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:08,920
action word plus it the TLD so what I

267
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:11,140
mean by advertising action word is that

268
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,399
they're advertising something to the

269
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,449
user like again going back to

270
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,520
human-computer interaction

271
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:18,710
I would you want to click on the link so

272
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,600
for updates software update security

273
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,830
update you know and execs don't know

274
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:26,140
yeah they're targeting they're not

275
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:26,140
hiring security people apart like execs

276
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:34,900
so here's some examples so Adobe updates

277
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,310
comm this is this is the dark hotel and

278
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:40,220
I don't need to go into that but

279
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:43,040
basically yeah it's a yeah Kaspersky

280
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:46,160
released a report of you know hacking

281
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,490
hotel Wi-Fi anyways so Adobe updates

282
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:52,100
calm adobe plugs dot Adobe register -

283
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:54,980
surf net Microsoft XP update so you

284
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:59,120
could begin to see the trend and here's

285
00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:02,510
from the apt one report by man yet Gmail

286
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,810
boxes Microsoft Update info Firefox up

287
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:07,610
data and the bottom one Firefox up data

288
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:09,979
is one of the reasons why you stemming

289
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:15,730
because that won't be caught by just

290
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:18,500
using update so I need the room okay so

291
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:21,200
basically creating malicious language

292
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,390
drive and lexical features of the apt

293
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,820
and phishing data sets so I built a

294
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:27,199
corpus out of these domains similar to

295
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:30,710
examples in the previous slide and

296
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:33,320
basically I have two dictionaries one of

297
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:36,050
brand names and one of these you know

298
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,520
add action words so the reason first

299
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:41,270
yeah and the reason for something I just

300
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:43,819
said so then I you know a full a full

301
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:46,189
string match is good and gives back

302
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:49,430
great results and more often not than

303
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:50,990
not they use that but also I use the

304
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:55,250
edit distance algorithms so if there's

305
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:58,760
like a one-off so if it's like a 1 Inc

306
00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:02,570
in dotnet versus yeah LinkedIn dotnet

307
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:06,970
you know you know Wells Fargo with a

308
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:09,640
with a one at the at the ELLs you know

309
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:12,020
Google with a zero zero for the O's

310
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:15,920
which is common I'm sure you guys have

311
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:18,260
seen so yeah minimum minimum edit this

312
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,360
is over you just back to the algorithms

313
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,530
class so shortest path dynamic

314
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,360
programming algorithm checking

315
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:26,660
similarity between two strings think

316
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,370
spellcheck so widely used in many fields

317
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:31,880
for example bioinformatics

318
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:33,650
for a DNA sequence alignment how many

319
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,830
operations or edits takes to turn one

320
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:39,709
string into the other so yeah just think

321
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:41,930
of string similarity initial state

322
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:44,540
string that transform operations are

323
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:47,719
insert delete and substitution so the

324
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:49,430
goal state is the final string and yeah

325
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,740
and the path cost is the minimum number

326
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:53,300
of edits so the initial string for

327
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:56,150
example here I'm sorry it's not lined up

328
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:59,420
part or the it's annoying

329
00:15:56,150 --> 00:16:01,670
so basically inception turned into

330
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:05,740
execution so there's five edits three

331
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:07,010
substitutions so from insert two I to

332
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:11,180
space

333
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:16,010
it's a deletion and TE a substitution

334
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:20,329
see X substitution blank to see it's an

335
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:22,720
insertion and p2u is substitution v so

336
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:29,089
Google here to edit two substitutions

337
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:36,790
o 0 o and o 2 0 0 0 and in the Google

338
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:39,920
Google domain so here is the next step

339
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:41,719
so we have that first edit distance on

340
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:46,550
the domain and that could also be

341
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:48,740
applied to URL so here next step is I

342
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:51,969
want to recreate the researchers mind

343
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:54,920
with by analyzing the HTML of the page

344
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:58,250
and again I want to apply the edit

345
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:02,930
distance as a previous step so because

346
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:08,209
lookups are costly we want to minimize

347
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:11,448
yeah whatever you know basically

348
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:13,610
consuming resources and when we're

349
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:15,970
reviewing the malicious domains what a

350
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:19,010
typical method methodology for review

351
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:21,140
visit the site in tor browser the

352
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:23,329
researcher processes information on on

353
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:26,540
site looks for clues and gains a summary

354
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:29,120
of the page then it makes it they make a

355
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:32,030
decision whether the site is legit or

356
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:35,030
malicious so specifically for phishing

357
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:36,830
sites for human computer action of what

358
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:39,139
makes people fall for this what makes

359
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:42,470
people fall for phishing sites so

360
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:44,540
usually it's a just straight-up copy

361
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:46,700
sometimes they'll use tools you know

362
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,740
other times they just grab this the code

363
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,200
from the site so how can we automate

364
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,820
this process how can we recreate the

365
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,220
research researchers line

366
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:58,970
so can we apply document similarity

367
00:17:55,220 --> 00:18:00,980
algorithms this is a document similarly

368
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:04,370
algorithms already been solving for

369
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:06,070
example search so yeah again human

370
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:08,870
computer intersect in an interaction

371
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:11,090
examples from an apple phishing page so

372
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:13,159
why would you think it's a phishing page

373
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:16,459
oh because you look and you see like

374
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:18,730
title you see links and oftentimes

375
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:21,470
they'll link back to the legitimate site

376
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:24,559
for example if you click on the code no

377
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:27,170
careers and a fake phishing PayPal site

378
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:31,720
click on the careers it linked back to

379
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:37,370
like you know dev careers at PayPal calm

380
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:39,830
images obviously you know visual cues so

381
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:44,209
yeah other clues within the the source

382
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:47,629
so this was an example of found from a

383
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:49,370
PayPal phishing site they're using

384
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:51,530
actual like I don't know if you guys can

385
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:53,540
see it but basically a tool called HD

386
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:55,970
track which basically clones the whole

387
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:57,830
site and this is kind of more obvious

388
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:02,780
right so we could look for little

389
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:06,379
markers like that too so yeah so after

390
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:09,040
we grab the content from the page we

391
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:11,750
need it we need a kind of pre process it

392
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,580
and prepare it for the algorithm so

393
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:16,390
let's clean the data first strip

394
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:20,540
punctuation symbols unnecessary content

395
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:23,300
sometimes can take out numbers sometimes

396
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:25,550
the numbers are important normalizing

397
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:28,040
the data so we need yeah normalize it

398
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:31,190
kind of across across the board so you

399
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:33,500
apply stemming and I also I was having I

400
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:36,620
spent a lot of time on this so I did

401
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:40,490
some kind of data encoding because I

402
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:45,409
want to include you know the certain

403
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:47,690
terms basically for links and sometimes

404
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:51,260
images I want that as a yeah for example

405
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:53,760
here as a Google com I want it to have a

406
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:56,460
Google Google link because the algorithm

407
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:01,410
we use that that we were using relies on

408
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:03,900
this so it's harder than its name it's

409
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:05,640
just I spend my so much time beating my

410
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,940
head against the wall I tend to like

411
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:11,460
natural language processing talks

412
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:14,130
basically they're like you have to write

413
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,260
your own parser which is annoying but

414
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:18,600
yeah it's just that that's what I had to

415
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,770
do so that I'm still in the process of

416
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,449
doing that and proving it

417
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:24,240
so non-trivial yeah dealing with

418
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:27,390
malformed tags web data can be a huge

419
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,430
just powerful HTML so you had sometimes

420
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:31,740
lose data dealing with HTML and jeaious

421
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:35,340
with third-party libraries which tags to

422
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:37,440
encode title links images that's that's

423
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,730
what I started with and I applied basic

424
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,630
natural language processing algún

425
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:46,700
algorithms like tf-idf but again I need

426
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:49,770
more training more samples for training

427
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:51,960
so yeah and that so the overall in the

428
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:55,830
beginning when you're just using tf-idf

429
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:57,900
for the HTML content and I was even just

430
00:20:55,830 --> 00:21:01,500
hitting on the actual like edit distance

431
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:02,760
part I was finding a lot of success I

432
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,950
mean obviously there's a lot of false

433
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,510
positives in the beginning but and with

434
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,980
the tuning and stuff from the HTML

435
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:11,460
content I was able to limit the false

436
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:14,130
positives and actually proactively go

437
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:16,710
after false positives for example you

438
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:18,240
might think you know if it's a Windows I

439
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:21,450
say I'm looking for Windows in the

440
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,940
domain and it's actually a site about

441
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:26,250
with windows and doors and furniture the

442
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:29,190
keywords from the tf-idf would come back

443
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:31,110
with furniture windows doors so I could

444
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:34,350
just throw those out based on based on

445
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:36,090
those same thing with Apple right you

446
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:39,959
know app Apple might come back with

447
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:41,220
fruit and other other like market so I

448
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,810
could throw those out based on the

449
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,490
cutting the content of the page so I'm

450
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:46,770
proactively going after these false

451
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:49,350
positives javis the same thing about

452
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:52,230
coffee rather than you know rather than

453
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:54,870
the orange sometimes Java tutorials so I

454
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:57,390
could throw those up yeah

455
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:59,659
so yes successful identifying these

456
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:02,690
types of attacks and also flying

457
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:04,760
identifying other stuff too

458
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:07,310
then news new stuff and here's some

459
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:09,500
examples so the carbon act that bank

460
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:12,679
erosion from kaspersky report came out

461
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,690
in February you can see here and don't

462
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:18,380
have to believe me but here's the

463
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:19,910
timestamp 123 and update - Java and

464
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,760
obviously that's a few years of false

465
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:26,300
positives they were there but but uh

466
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:28,520
update that's java.net so that that was

467
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:30,889
kind of exciting and that only came back

468
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:34,070
as a highway suicide I I use those terms

469
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:35,840
because often update it would be

470
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:36,919
considered high risk with it with a

471
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,959
brand name

472
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:42,740
so yeah interesting results leaning from

473
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:46,210
guat one song Alabama so yeah this is

474
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:50,350
kind of yeah along with the trip Romero

475
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:54,200
attacks yeah obviously all those domains

476
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:56,480
crazy and sekolah so this was in the

477
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,550
soccer report same thing that leaning

478
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,160
email I'm just gonna go through a little

479
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:03,139
fast cuz I little time left so you found

480
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,480
these two which are also associated with

481
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:07,580
the blue cross primeira and then catch

482
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,200
these but it will be able to I was able

483
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:11,389
to find parking pages similar as between

484
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,900
parking pages and you can see here the

485
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:18,230
suspend suspended pages was useful

486
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:20,180
here's some fishing sites they I want to

487
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,730
talk about fish tank data this is a huge

488
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:24,980
fish tank has a huge cult following in

489
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:29,900
the community I always get asked about

490
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:31,880
fish tank basically yes this is a hold

491
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,770
repo it's basically a giant training

492
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,620
training set for security data

493
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:38,660
scientists and examples uh here's an

494
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:40,250
example of false positives and fish fish

495
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:42,290
tank so I want to limit the false

496
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:44,720
positives this was where I was now

497
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:48,220
testing on HTTP traffic because fish

498
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,510
tank deals with URLs so the hypothesis

499
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:53,600
it's similar the way Netflix recommends

500
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:55,790
stuff I wants you basically identify

501
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,350
phishing pages using I our topic

502
00:23:55,790 --> 00:24:00,050
modeling techniques and auto label fish

503
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:01,550
tanks submissions as they come in so

504
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:04,790
yeah this is kind of overview of how

505
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:05,360
machine learning works corpus text

506
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,970
documents

507
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,050
converting the vector space and turn to

508
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:11,990
a machine learning algorithm and

509
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:13,430
predictive model and you output your

510
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:17,360
expected label

511
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:18,800
kind of a follow so I used top Jennsen

512
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,050
for topic modeling which is awesome I

513
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,700
mentioned that before topic modeling

514
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:26,419
basically are trying to understand

515
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:29,140
themes concepts about documents so yeah

516
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:32,540
I want to understand themes of HTML data

517
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:34,490
content and basically for it's great for

518
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:36,320
building recommender systems and used

519
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:39,410
great for using as features for a

520
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:41,570
classifier so yeah built the corpus out

521
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:43,760
of the brand names yeah again focus on

522
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:46,909
the big name brands seeing all kinds of

523
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:49,400
fishes 90 mm PayPal 2015 Christian

524
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:50,570
mingle fishing so again yet so then I

525
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,310
started using tfiia

526
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:54,409
so first I get the counts from the page

527
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:58,310
of the terms and then they convert that

528
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:59,900
to tf-idf waiting yeah basically I want

529
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:01,940
to see not only of the terms frequent in

530
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:04,610
the document but how rare it is across

531
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:07,670
all documents yeah and this is the

532
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:09,979
formula for it yeah again you know

533
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:11,960
sometimes the term might be in one

534
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:14,810
document it might be a high occurrences

535
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,610
but I still we want through rarity we

536
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:19,790
need a factor in the rarity over all

537
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:21,709
documents so yeah then I use also the

538
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:26,060
cosine distance this is a way to measure

539
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:27,250
the similarity of documents yeah and

540
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:29,810
basically give a recommendation

541
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:31,340
normalize dot product in fact about the

542
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:34,700
the vector is basically converting the

543
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:37,030
word counts with the word of yes it's

544
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:39,350
basic once you convert to the tf-idf

545
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:41,660
like vectors then you could compare

546
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:43,909
cosine similarity and we're gonna apply

547
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:46,520
another algorithm quick too so yeah

548
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:49,790
here's a book going back to grade school

549
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:53,030
math geometry sohcahtoa coasts cosine

550
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:56,360
distance and here's a basically adjacent

551
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:58,250
over hypotenuse so then I use a latent

552
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,379
semantic indexing and I'm sorry I'm

553
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:02,210
short on time but I'm just gonna go real

554
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,920
quick over this but basically using

555
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:06,440
similar value of decomposition which is

556
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:10,240
basically a lot of nasty linear algebra

557
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:13,010
basically identifying concepts and

558
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:16,120
identifying clusters and one of the

559
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:18,500
drawbacks is you use the bag of will

560
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:20,030
first it uses the bag of words technique

561
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,070
but one of the shortcomings of the bag

562
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:24,590
of words technique is that it only looks

563
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:25,810
at one word so basically there's no

564
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:28,570
ordering

565
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:29,020
to kind of help normalize this I use by

566
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:32,830
Graham

567
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:33,970
try-try games so yeah input basically X

568
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:35,290
matrix where m is the number of

569
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:37,870
documents and is the number of term

570
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:40,750
through the decomposition have to pick K

571
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:42,699
which is K is the number of concepts so

572
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:46,570
yeah just kind of matrix transformation

573
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:50,500
and U is the matrix of documents K

574
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:54,010
concepts s is the basic cake K by K

575
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:56,500
diagonal and then the V transpose is the

576
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:57,430
M by K matrix where m is the terms and K

577
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,440
is the constant that we're most

578
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:01,350
interested in the V transpose because

579
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,330
what this is which terms make up a

580
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:06,969
constant or topic yeah here's just an

581
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:09,490
example basically some titles on the on

582
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:13,150
the left of books and you can see the

583
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:15,550
clustering stock market value investing

584
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:17,410
basically these are the kind of terms

585
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:20,320
that go along with it with it with the

586
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:23,770
concept so yeah here's getting great

587
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:25,929
results so sample output well basically

588
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:28,420
this is how it come comes that I picked

589
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:31,570
the top five the input pages of Wells

590
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:34,240
Fargo then we have basically five under

591
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:37,899
it and those are the documents from my

592
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:41,170
corpus that are most similar same thing

593
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:42,760
here's input chase URL and a-chasing the

594
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:44,170
top two and then close to Bank of

595
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,510
America and this is interesting I should

596
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:50,140
I showed this because it also falls

597
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:53,340
under the idea of basically it's the

598
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:56,410
same kind of topic right financial

599
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:58,230
because oftentimes banking sites even

600
00:27:56,410 --> 00:28:00,490
though the name might be different

601
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:03,310
they'll still have this this similar

602
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:05,980
like words insurance you know banks

603
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:07,330
finance what and so that's that's why

604
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:11,500
it's coming back and so that's kind of

605
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:13,179
interesting too let's say if we saw a

606
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,920
phishing site for a bank we never seen

607
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:16,600
before or we're not familiar with some

608
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:21,100
bank in Timbuktu

609
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:24,639
so yeah so yeah here's getting out into

610
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:28,209
the numbers so 423 total samples

611
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:31,360
70 in the corpus 345 tests

612
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:34,660
so basically going back to this side so

613
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,939
at the top right so for the time being

614
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:37,680
I'm just taking the top but also I'm

615
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,990
factoring

616
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:43,320
top five so three nor fourteen are

617
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:47,610
hitting as the top recommendation so at

618
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:50,340
the top like Wells Fargo number 169 the

619
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:52,260
remaining 31 are in the top five so we

620
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:54,060
could just do a little bit of waiting to

621
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:57,600
kind of move those up percolate those up

622
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:59,700
so kind of like three 30 out of 30 45

623
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,840
which is pretty good and I'm pretty

624
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,850
happy with some brands have a higher

625
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,310
accuracy like when there's nice juicy

626
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:07,679
HTML oh man it works off from Wells

627
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:09,870
Fargo like fishes like I have a nice

628
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:12,420
juicy h2o and it hits like pretty much

629
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:13,770
like hundred percent of the time here's

630
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:16,770
some like more data science statistics

631
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:20,340
for your data science out there and this

632
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:22,590
is ran actually on the only factoring

633
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:26,550
that if it hits on the top so not

634
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:27,659
tackling the top five so beyond fish

635
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:29,280
tank I'm just going to go through this

636
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:31,860
really quick quick only a few minutes

637
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:34,200
so Gina state is not the ideal match for

638
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,909
this HTP traffic as much better fit why

639
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,010
when doing lookups landing on the index

640
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:40,650
page like for AWC cgi-bin

641
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:42,570
and Paykel calm so then I have to go and

642
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:45,750
hit Pay Pal you know pick the Pay Pal

643
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:51,060
phishing site and go there the Pay Pal

644
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:53,580
stats issue - update calm and so within

645
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:55,530
DNS if I would just focus on DNS I will

646
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:58,020
and I'm going to do this I'm gonna build

647
00:29:55,530 --> 00:30:00,330
a web web crawler but for right now I

648
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:03,629
want to make sure the testing sound and

649
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:05,820
we're gonna use the proxy which is what

650
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:09,990
is opened is not really know known for

651
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:11,879
HTV traffic so yeah so the intelligent

652
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:13,590
proxy awesome team man-in-the-middle so

653
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,900
the gray list sometimes like we won't

654
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:17,459
blacklist the entire domain we'll just

655
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:20,130
put on the grey list and certain URLs

656
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:21,780
out of that domain will be blocked so

657
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:24,750
the next step in opens next generation

658
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:26,940
and open data security so here's some

659
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:29,520
examples you guys got the point of that

660
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:30,510
these ones here's the Wells Fargo you

661
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,700
could see from the you it could be

662
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:35,730
applied to URLs to Wells Fargo - online

663
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:37,050
dot server wells for you well for going

664
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:39,900
on yeah and then here's the edit

665
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:44,159
distance walls frag oh yeah so here is

666
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:46,830
the pipeline vehicle HTTP traffic white

667
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:48,600
listing ASM filtering popularity check

668
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:50,110
and this calls also we apply the

669
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:53,918
fishtank of it sometimes

670
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:56,740
those google.com dot PE you know could

671
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:59,289
be submitted so do a popularity check

672
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:02,470
and we have a edit distance that we do a

673
00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:04,480
get request and again at the top so red

674
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:07,870
is acquiring the data green is filtering

675
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,700
blue is NLP oranges output so ya get the

676
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:13,959
get request counts of words on the page

677
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:17,529
that should use tf-idf for wading

678
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:19,750
through latent semantic analysis compare

679
00:31:17,529 --> 00:31:21,820
cosine similarities take the top end

680
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,149
similar documents added to the block

681
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,730
list

682
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:27,518
auto tag brand brand / topics and

683
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:29,620
fishtank email daily results and the

684
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:32,769
build training sets period eiope retrain

685
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:34,570
corpus fetch legitimate grand sight okay

686
00:31:32,769 --> 00:31:38,649
and I just went through this

687
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:40,450
so yeah the conclusion is kind of that

688
00:31:38,649 --> 00:31:42,850
open dance I like to term it like

689
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:44,679
putting my PM hat on is agile research

690
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:47,139
building testing tuning iterating

691
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:49,539
experiment it need to experiment with

692
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:52,299
more structure of words like you saw

693
00:31:49,539 --> 00:31:55,960
that Wells Fargo up so applying reg Xing

694
00:31:52,299 --> 00:31:58,029
and my Gotama to theory so yeah

695
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,820
mentioned as a research again so

696
00:31:58,029 --> 00:32:02,370
additional feature ancient engineering

697
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:05,799
data collection and building corpus

698
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:08,250
filtering false positives and a no

699
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:08,250
patent

700
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,640
yep

701
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:24,149
oh yeah yeah so basically yeah we kind

702
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:26,460
of like one of the things that's been

703
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:30,480
kind of messing with our life parsers is

704
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:32,160
like puny code stuff and then like yeah

705
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,480
those things always cause problems with

706
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:37,350
like especially third-party library

707
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:39,120
parsers and definitely more for like you

708
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:41,669
what you are ELLs are all kinds of kinds

709
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,530
of crazy stuff but domains are more kind

710
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:47,720
of yeah the only problems we really have

711
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:47,720
is for the puny code stuff yeah

712
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:04,810
hard

713
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:19,090
oh yeah so like time between takedown

714
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,830
sometimes between like we don't really

715
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:23,439
have that that kind of data I guess that

716
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:25,029
would be a good kind of study but yeah

717
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,279
that's kind of like an interesting yeah

718
00:33:25,029 --> 00:33:30,130
but we're kind of reaching out to a

719
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:31,929
certain like a service provider and

720
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:33,909
basically saying like can you take down

721
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:36,460
the site fast and like you reaching out

722
00:33:33,909 --> 00:33:39,960
to like PayPal and uh yeah different

723
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:39,960
like companies yeah Apple
