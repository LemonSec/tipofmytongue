1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,369
and so when we think about humans one of

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:08,849
the things we often struggle with is why

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,099
do people make bad decisions and in fact

4
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:13,049
we say this off and we say bad decisions

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,269
is if humans aren't capable of making

6
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:18,090
good decisions right why are they always

7
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:19,590
making bad decisions and bad is a polite

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,630
word that we're using because what we

9
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,730
really mean is why did they make stupid

10
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,460
decisions this that's what we're telling

11
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,810
ourselves now that's also not nice so

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,090
let's let's tone that down a little bit

13
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,288
and let's instead ask ourselves why did

14
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,680
it make these decisions that are

15
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:36,270
incomprehensible to us because the

16
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,610
person making the decision doesn't think

17
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,290
it's stupid or bad although there are

18
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,540
times that I sometimes question you know

19
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,089
if I climb the top of a bridge whether

20
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,649
that was a stupid decision and so let's

21
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,539
look at those conversations right in the

22
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:50,879
security field we often get into topics

23
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,199
where we're a business owner comes and

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,899
they're gonna have a conversation with

25
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,539
us and what if the business owners think

26
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,670
about us right they walk in and they

27
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,140
think we're a bad guy right yeah we're

28
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,719
we're dressed in the black hat I

29
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,280
appreciate the white hat in the room you

30
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,890
know that all that we care about is

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,450
making their life hard I once had the

32
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,479
pleasure of sitting on a panel with the

33
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,760
CIO of Bechtel and he said you know to

34
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:19,610
me risk is anything that impacts my

35
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:22,470
schedule or my budget so you are risk

36
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,700
now we on the other hand as the security

37
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,619
profession will see this business owner

38
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,060
coming in and we know that they want to

39
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,619
you know launch a product that's

40
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,110
horribly insecure they want to do

41
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:33,630
something dangerous so we think of them

42
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,880
as this bad guy right they're coming in

43
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,908
they're gonna violate the rules they're

44
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,140
gonna do these things that are horrible

45
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:44,310
well this is modal bias

46
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:46,680
anybody here cycle one couple people or

47
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,649
pedestrian walk right what do you think

48
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,119
about drivers they're idiots

49
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:52,860
right they're rude they think they have

50
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,170
right-of-way they're gonna cut you off

51
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,520
we do these mean dangerous things and

52
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,850
they're in these armored vehicles

53
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,890
anybody here drive what do you think

54
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,539
about bicyclists and pedestrians they're

55
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,920
idiots they're self-centered they're

56
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,560
going to cut you off they won't right

57
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,110
away you know the best part is next time

58
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,060
that you're driving somewhere think

59
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,530
about that is

60
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,450
and what do you think about pedestrians

61
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:17,720
and then the moment that you get out of

62
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:19,060
your car and start walking recognize

63
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,250
that you don't think the same way about

64
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:24,890
the auto drivers and that's natural this

65
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:27,980
is modal bias we preference the mode

66
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:29,988
that we operate in and we immediately

67
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,720
forget all of the reasons why that other

68
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:35,030
mode might behave in this fashion so is

69
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,700
a security person we say look before you

70
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:40,160
deploy a system you have to do these 855

71
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:42,018
things and then how often do we follow

72
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,530
that list of things when we deploy a

73
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:46,819
system never right we switch modes and

74
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:49,040
we're like god I'm not gonna follow the

75
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:52,190
rules I know better well maybe they

76
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,459
think they know better too in fact

77
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:57,799
really important here is that in this

78
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:59,840
model each person told the story in

79
00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:03,620
which the other person was the villain

80
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,769
and the reality is nobody is the villain

81
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,989
in their own story right sometimes we

82
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:10,370
think we're the superhero sometimes we

83
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:12,200
just think we're a normal person trying

84
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,880
to go through our life and there's these

85
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,679
villains that come in and they're trying

86
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,810
to stop us and keep us from doing things

87
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,700
but nobody thinks they're the villain

88
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:21,950
like Darth Vader didn't even think he

89
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,589
was the villain right he's got

90
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:26,750
motivations right figure out what his

91
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:28,400
motivations are but the moment that I

92
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,200
cast you is the villain it's easy for

93
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,630
you to cast me as the villain and we're

94
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,940
certainly not going to be a team not how

95
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:38,019
the Avengers gets created by having

96
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:40,970
everybody thinks each other or villains

97
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:42,049
so how does this instantiate itself

98
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,600
let's look back to that conversation

99
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:46,010
about villains and we see the business

100
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,190
owner comes in and they said look I want

101
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:51,019
to launch a product is it safe now safe

102
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:53,389
is a really dangerous word sometimes

103
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:56,090
they'll say it's secure these words have

104
00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:57,650
no meaning right these are words that

105
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,930
every person brings to a different

106
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:02,450
context the best way I can put that for

107
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:04,310
folks is casper weinberger former

108
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,958
Secretary of Defense was once asked

109
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:08,359
about communications difficulties

110
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:10,160
dealing with the military and he says

111
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:12,500
look here's my problem let's say that I

112
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:16,608
give the order to go secure the building

113
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:18,320
and if I give that to the Marines they

114
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:21,638
will kill everybody inside the building

115
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,400
and probably blow it up for good measure

116
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:26,860
not a bad plan if I give that to the

117
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,198
army they're going to go put up

118
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,629
concertina wire and barricades around

119
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,159
the building have unfolding fire zones

120
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:34,750
to prevent anybody from coming in and

121
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:36,250
set up a checkpoint where you have to

122
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,860
have the password of the day to get into

123
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:41,319
the building and if asked the Navy to

124
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,759
secure the building they will make sure

125
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:44,439
that all of the lights are turned off

126
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:46,930
the windows are closed and the doors are

127
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:48,219
locked when they leave and the Air Force

128
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,060
will get me a three year lease with an

129
00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:53,530
option to buy

130
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:55,870
is it safe what does this mean so what

131
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:58,239
do we say we say something like this

132
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:00,460
look here's my checklist of everything

133
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,409
that every idiot has ever done wrong in

134
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,270
deploying the system demonstrate to me

135
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:06,490
that you haven't repeated any of those

136
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:10,719
mistakes all right that's what I saw

137
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:12,449
when t7000 - really is now they look at

138
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:14,919
this and they say oh my god it's like

139
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:18,099
875 pages it uses words I don't

140
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:21,099
understand could you fill it out for me

141
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:22,779
awesome guaranteed employment act now we

142
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:25,800
get to be employed filling out the

143
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:28,150
checklist that we handed them so we do

144
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,370
and we fill out this checklist and we

145
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,929
talked about as a tear at risk we say

146
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,789
things like god you're using the RSA

147
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:37,659
1024 and you really should be on the Ed

148
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:40,060
25 519 or you know we want to have a

149
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:45,219
hashing algorithm that's no longer sha-1

150
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:46,750
it's your poly 1305 chacha 20 like these

151
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:48,039
are the real words that we put in front

152
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:52,150
of people and they look at us and

153
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:57,190
they're like wood does this mean I can

154
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:59,710
go ahead now this is a trap why is this

155
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:03,069
a trap because they're absolutely yes/no

156
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:04,599
binary question if you say yes this is a

157
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:06,009
showstopper you should not go ahead

158
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:08,560
they're going to overrule you and go

159
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:10,779
ahead and if you say no this is not a

160
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,819
showstopper well you're the one who did

161
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:14,979
the risk assessment whose fault is it if

162
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:16,839
there was risk but it wasn't mitigated

163
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:18,729
this is a horrible conversation to have

164
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:21,099
and this is the conversation that 10

165
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:22,960
years ago we told everybody in security

166
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:25,330
they wanted to have that you want to be

167
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,520
the gatekeeper we're not gatekeepers

168
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:30,789
we're advisers this is a gatekeeping

169
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,859
conversation so let's think about that

170
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:34,270
let's look at prisoner's dilemma for a

171
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,250
moment - me too

172
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:38,020
try to understand what happens with

173
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,700
people here so they're very familiar

174
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,650
with the prisoner's dilemma if not quick

175
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,060
refresher we have two people they have

176
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:46,179
committed a crime and they have been

177
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:48,940
caught almost in the act so we are the

178
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,590
police where the district attorney we

179
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,360
have these two people and we can nail

180
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,010
you on a misdemeanor or maybe a small

181
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,770
felony but we'd really like to get you

182
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:58,240
to rat each other out because we want to

183
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,890
get you for the big crime that we know

184
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,810
you committed but we have no evidence so

185
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:04,030
we need your testimony that's the model

186
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:06,220
for the prisoner's dilemma so we say to

187
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:09,010
each one look you have a choice you can

188
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,560
cooperate or you can cheat um or give

189
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:14,430
the other person has the same choices

190
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:19,780
now so we'll save to Alice look if you

191
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:22,300
cooperate with us and by cooperate or

192
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:25,000
safe or operate with your partner then

193
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,830
you'll get the top set of penalties or

194
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,780
the left side if you cheat which is you

195
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:30,490
rat them out you'll get the right set of

196
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,750
penalties now notice you have different

197
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:35,320
penalties depending whether the other

198
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:37,420
person cooperates routines so if both of

199
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,760
you cooperate with each other we'll send

200
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:42,190
you to jail on your minor crime if one

201
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,750
of you cheats we'll let you off you'll

202
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:47,050
go to jail for a year the other one gets

203
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:50,590
ten and if both of you chief you'll both

204
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:52,210
get five relatively pointed this week

205
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:54,310
because this is what it has what's known

206
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:56,560
as a Nash equilibrium named after John

207
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:58,990
Nash who just died in a taxi accident

208
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,210
and what happens here is you look at

209
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,800
this you say ah well no matter what the

210
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:06,130
other person does I'm always better off

211
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,980
cheating so I should always cheat and in

212
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:10,480
fact when we study this on grad students

213
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:12,190
we discover that people will cooperate

214
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,680
with their buddy only about 13 percent

215
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:17,800
of the time that both people choose to

216
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:20,190
cooperate but that they will effectively

217
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,840
net cheating 40 percent of the time

218
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:24,610
that's pretty impressive that means

219
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,010
about two-thirds of the time any given

220
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:29,280
person will choose to rat out their

221
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,280
buddy

222
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,979
this is going to come back and we'll

223
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,050
come back to this in a moment boom but

224
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:37,880
that's it that's a case of historical

225
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:40,329
paranoia we know these stories we tell

226
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:43,070
ourselves these stories research done

227
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:44,510
apocryphally in the 50s they didn't

228
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:47,090
actually write down any of their results

229
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:48,710
just published a paper so we're not sure

230
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:50,750
it actually happened but take five

231
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:52,340
monkeys to create strain right take five

232
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,050
monkeys put them in a room put a table

233
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,700
in the room put a novel object on the

234
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:58,310
table doesn't matter what it is monkeys

235
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:00,110
are inherently curious animals just like

236
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:02,150
humans so what do you think the monkeys

237
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:04,430
do right they go interact with the novel

238
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:06,079
object or they try to as soon as they

239
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:08,120
get close to the novel object the

240
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,290
researchers use a fire hose to spray all

241
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,630
of the monkeys to keep them away from

242
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:13,400
the table repeat until the monkeys have

243
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,530
learned novel object on the table don't

244
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,300
go near it what they should learn is

245
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:20,319
researchers are bad Rise of the Planet

246
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:22,520
of the Apes is a great movie instead

247
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,320
take a monkey out of the room and

248
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:27,110
replace it with a monkey that has not

249
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,570
observed this before put a novel object

250
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:31,460
on the table what happens that monkey

251
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:34,700
heads for the table what do the other

252
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:36,470
four monkeys do attack tackle that

253
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,360
monkey beat it into submission so that

254
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:41,000
it never goes after the object on the

255
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,380
table repeat doing this until there is

256
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,080
no monkey that has ever been sprayed

257
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,640
with water in the room and allegedly

258
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,440
they will continue to beat each other up

259
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,199
every time a novel object comes into the

260
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,640
room they have historical paranoia we

261
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,350
are afraid of the object on the table

262
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,020
because we have always been afraid of

263
00:09:54,350 --> 00:10:00,350
the object on the table that's how we

264
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:03,410
operate the ISO 27000 too has controls

265
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:05,240
in it that are meaningless or worse that

266
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,670
are actively harmful to our security

267
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,920
today but it is the way we have always

268
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:14,270
done it you should have passwords that

269
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:16,069
rotate every 90 days why because at the

270
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:17,840
time we wrote that that's about how long

271
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:21,380
we thought an online password cracker

272
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:23,630
would take the reality is either you've

273
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:26,450
got about 90 seconds with your passwords

274
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:29,150
or you have forever either there is no

275
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:31,970
Oracle or there is and designing around

276
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:35,410
this 90 days means we're not protecting

277
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,410
the to cases that actually matter

278
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:43,440
what's our goal here's our goal is to

279
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:45,240
increase value so value is the resources

280
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,910
that we have finds the capabilities that

281
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,040
we apply them with and this is important

282
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:52,550
resources is easy it's your time it's

283
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,990
your money to a CFO they're all the same

284
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:57,390
but the mythical man-month does apply

285
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:59,370
time matters

286
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:02,160
now capabilities is interesting this is

287
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:04,020
the things we go do and what are the

288
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,910
three factors that go into that well one

289
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:08,370
of them is our skill how good are we in

290
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:11,100
doing a thing one of them is our effort

291
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:12,840
how well do we apply ourselves and now

292
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,300
this isn't an argument that people are

293
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,340
lazy it's an argument that things like

294
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,589
if you have developers they tend to work

295
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:21,630
in four hour sprints and if you schedule

296
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:23,430
them for a meeting every two hours to

297
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:26,030
ask them how they're doing you should

298
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:28,500
expect them to exert zero actual effort

299
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:29,819
not that they're not trying but you have

300
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,430
made it impossible for them to write

301
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:35,610
code and effective this is about an

302
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:37,469
organizational dynamic right did you do

303
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:40,350
a thing that the organization will take

304
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:41,580
because if not it has no value and did

305
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,200
you present it in a way that the

306
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:45,360
organization will like it and consume it

307
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:51,660
if not it's not going to provide value

308
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:55,890
and value is what we are paid for right

309
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:58,110
it is our organizations believe that we

310
00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:00,660
produce ongoing value they made an

311
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:03,180
investment in us and as time goes on so

312
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:05,699
risk perception it's what's going to

313
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:08,969
move upwards and our value is what moves

314
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:12,030
downwards that is none of those on we

315
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:13,980
get these impulses of new risk that the

316
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:15,870
security value we've invested in we'll

317
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,160
push that down and so we get to have a

318
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,930
constant level of risk in our

319
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,630
organization that's what your

320
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:22,920
organization probably believes I'll come

321
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:25,200
back what organizations believe in a

322
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,120
minute but if we don't believe that

323
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,940
there is risk well you're gonna have low

324
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,770
investment and if we don't think that

325
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,860
you have good capabilities

326
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:36,180
we'll say that there is less risk right

327
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,460
if we don't see how you're possibly

328
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:40,319
providing value yet we're not getting in

329
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,450
trouble then clearly we're not in a

330
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,240
risky world and therefore we don't need

331
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:47,520
to pay you as much this is a really neat

332
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,380
cycle to get into and in fact we see

333
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,710
that cycle happen all the time when

334
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,900
people

335
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:54,360
ask the question well can't we just be

336
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:56,640
good enough and so we have to ask well

337
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,420
what would it mean to be good enough so

338
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,410
let's pause it

339
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:03,479
some tract of security value just to

340
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:06,180
confuse everybody I've reversed my

341
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,590
directions now so good security we'll

342
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:10,469
just put that in the middle this is not

343
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:12,780
to scale there's a reason there's no

344
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:15,750
numbers here and I would pause it then

345
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:18,810
if I wanted to attack your company today

346
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,810
if you had good security I probably

347
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:23,189
can't get in by the end of the day

348
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:25,199
you're sufficient against the casual

349
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:27,810
adversary that somebody who decided

350
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,720
today to do harm to you who is not

351
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:32,250
necessarily the best adversary out there

352
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,620
doesn't know anything about your systems

353
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:36,360
probably can't just walk right in that

354
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,390
seems like that's a reasonable standard

355
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,560
you should at least be better than that

356
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:42,960
now we're probably also going to say

357
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,900
that if they a sufficiently advanced

358
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:48,210
persistent adversary is probably going

359
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:51,209
to be good security right good enough is

360
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:53,400
not good enough to stop the NSA or China

361
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:55,680
should they really take a liking to you

362
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,240
I need to do something different in that

363
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,000
world okay

364
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,490
now let's think about perfect security

365
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,870
we all love to be better than that

366
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:06,480
Voltaire said it best the perfect is the

367
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:09,540
enemy of the good you do not get to good

368
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,640
enough by aiming for perfect you get to

369
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:14,370
perfect by incrementally aiming for good

370
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:17,220
you want to get better but the path to

371
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:18,960
the best is not a straight line if

372
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,820
you're at the bottom of a cliff and you

373
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,440
want to be at the top of the cliff the

374
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:25,650
fastest way to the top of the cliff is

375
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,520
not to start climbing it's to look for

376
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:28,949
the path that is in a different

377
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,300
direction that will take you up there in

378
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:33,300
much the same fashion you're going to

379
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,620
have that case here so I would assert

380
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,719
that you have to those using the

381
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:39,120
assessment not a community or who hire

382
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,010
them good Assessors should tell you

383
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,170
where you're good security isn't good

384
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:45,330
enough and can marginally get better and

385
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:47,370
this is a place that you'd love to live

386
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:48,780
in is where you can assess your security

387
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:51,630
either internally or externally move

388
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:53,280
forward that said most people we talk to

389
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:55,470
on their outside our companies are not

390
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:58,260
Assessors um in fact they're auditors

391
00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:02,460
but they're people people that we pay to

392
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:03,569
give us passing grades right if you have

393
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:06,840
a PCI Auditor

394
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:08,610
you pay them to give you an F no right

395
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:11,460
you pay them to give you a 100% perfect

396
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:13,800
any auditor is affected that's what

397
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:15,120
you're paying them for so we have an

398
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,699
incentive not to actually hire great

399
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,190
ones but we try to hire serious ones and

400
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,900
they're probably behind the times by a

401
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:24,060
few years they're not specialists in the

402
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:26,280
craft and so they're probably not going

403
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:28,579
to actually keep you above that line of

404
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:33,209
the fit of this casual adversary and

405
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:34,590
sadly you get what you pay for most of

406
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:36,390
the times we're not even paying for the

407
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:39,240
standard auditor and we're mostly trying

408
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:41,790
to fool them so we can hang out really

409
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,980
down low very easily and when you hang

410
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,750
out in that world you start to have

411
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,820
enterprises that think they can get away

412
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:49,800
with being even worse than that it will

413
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,690
just fake it a little harder when the

414
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,339
auditor shows up I'm not going to ask

415
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:55,830
for a show of hands four people work in

416
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:58,740
one of these companies I know they exist

417
00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:00,900
and so we can think of this is one of

418
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,520
the three categories odds are most

419
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,230
people want to live in that middle

420
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,990
that's where they ought to live we'd

421
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:08,190
love to get to that top and the bottom

422
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:10,770
unfortunately is we're all too many

423
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:12,720
people live Wendie neither coins the

424
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,760
term the security poverty line

425
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,240
Dominic would say that's the line at the

426
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:20,250
bottom if you want these slides by the

427
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,810
way I linked to them off of Twitter so

428
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,100
you can get them as well so you have a

429
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,689
higher resolution than just the

430
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:29,190
screenshot but I'm happy that photos are

431
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:30,840
great too so security is something

432
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:33,000
overtime right we don't just implement

433
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:35,310
it once that we change the adversaries

434
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,740
change so if we look at how all of these

435
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:39,420
move you know as time goes on what we

436
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,550
actually see is that the auditors and

437
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,990
the organizations that are trying to

438
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:45,150
fool them are falling farther and

439
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:46,740
farther behind in fact for all intents

440
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:48,120
and purposes the organization's might as

441
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,380
well just Park on the side of the road

442
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:55,290
they might be better off in that state

443
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:58,110
now I said what the organization thinks

444
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:59,849
they can get away with and now that's a

445
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:01,680
really interesting way to phrase it

446
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,510
because organizations don't think but

447
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,129
before we get that there's a thing

448
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:06,449
called the peltzman effect Sam peltzman

449
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:09,420
economist at the University of Chicago

450
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:12,079
when we were debating national seatbelt

451
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:15,000
laws for those of you who remember that

452
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:17,099
he said look if if we make everybody

453
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,510
wear seatbelts they will kill more

454
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:20,369
and so according the term killer

455
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:23,520
seatbelts and if you go look at NHTSA

456
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:26,339
data over the last 40 years it turns out

457
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,680
Sam peltzman might be right that in fact

458
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:31,320
the advent of safety technologies in

459
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:34,200
cars makes people drive faster fewer

460
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:37,409
drivers are dying 400,000 mine per

461
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,150
100,000 miles driven on the roads but

462
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:41,460
the number of pedestrians that are

463
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:43,890
killed in vehicular things is not

464
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:46,800
falling right we are transferring the

465
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:48,630
risk on to pedestrians because drivers

466
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,960
are taller look I can do 70 miles an

467
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:53,670
hour I can plow into things and live

468
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,890
where's 170 miles an hour and you're the

469
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:58,140
pastor in that I didn't see you're not

470
00:17:55,890 --> 00:18:00,210
going to survive and Sam peltzman said

471
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,190
look there's one safety technology that

472
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:04,500
we could put into cars that would

473
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:11,400
minimize how much harm people would get

474
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:13,620
into right if I put this in your car how

475
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:17,490
many of you are going over seven let

476
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:19,290
alone seventy right if I make you a bird

477
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:22,470
aware of the risk you'll react

478
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:25,170
appropriately that's a really important

479
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:28,500
thing to remember people who are aware

480
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:30,000
of risk modify their behaviors when I

481
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,740
first got to do the first version of

482
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,320
this talk two years ago here at source

483
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:36,210
right before I got up somebody came up

484
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,820
and I think it was GPA actually and did

485
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:40,380
a public service announcement that the

486
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,290
prior night somebody had been mugged

487
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:45,360
walking around the corner to the ATM if

488
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:47,460
you have gotten money out late at night

489
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,040
or walk you back and some said hey nice

490
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,920
money you just got there can I have it

491
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:53,760
probably not quite that polite she gives

492
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,890
this public service announcement

493
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,150
everybody's like oh my god what am I

494
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,370
going to do like to check their pockets

495
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:01,500
they make sure they're safe they became

496
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:03,989
aware of risk and their behavior

497
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,270
instantly changed it's interestingly

498
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:08,640
most Empire would not going to go walk

499
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:10,080
to an ATM at night but they became aware

500
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,370
that you know you're in Boston to the

501
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,669
theater district this isn't the safest

502
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:16,229
place in the world now I did say what

503
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,160
your organization thinks it can get away

504
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,320
with

505
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,690
contrary to what lots of people would

506
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:24,679
like you to believe organizations are

507
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:29,520
not human organizations don't think

508
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:30,429
people think organizations behave in the

509
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,889
way that the people

510
00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:34,269
work for the organization believes that

511
00:19:32,889 --> 00:19:36,459
the organization would want them to

512
00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:38,139
behave and very convoluted right we

513
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:40,059
model our organization's almost like

514
00:19:38,139 --> 00:19:41,649
deities and we've behaved the way that

515
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:44,080
we think the day he wants us to behave

516
00:19:41,649 --> 00:19:44,908
and therefore the organization behaves

517
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,269
that way

518
00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:52,960
now people think or do they Daniel

519
00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:55,960
Kahneman economist got a fish university

520
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,570
he's at posits that the human brain is

521
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:01,119
composed of two systems and most of the

522
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:03,939
time one of our systems is doing our

523
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:07,449
behaving for us that is our fast lizard

524
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:09,970
brain it doesn't think it is an expert

525
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:12,549
system all of the tasks that we can do

526
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:15,490
that computers can very easily do for us

527
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:17,918
are done by system one for instance if I

528
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:21,309
say what is two times two everybody just

529
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:24,340
thought for you didn't do math if I said

530
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:26,529
what is 17 times 85 you might have to

531
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:29,649
start doing math before you'll get to 14

532
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:31,570
45 for that one right system one

533
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:33,939
answered the first one for you it's why

534
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:35,769
we do multiplication tables is so we can

535
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,529
learn very quickly how to do things and

536
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:40,450
we don't have to waste resources because

537
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:42,580
our attention is a valuable resource and

538
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:44,919
we don't want to spend it doing mundane

539
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:46,869
tasks system one does it for us what

540
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:48,519
system one does is it takes all of this

541
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:50,799
input that is coming in from the world

542
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:53,110
and at some point it decides to do

543
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,610
something it has rules and so you go

544
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:56,619
take an action based on those rules

545
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:58,479
everybody who raised their hand because

546
00:20:56,619 --> 00:21:00,610
they were a driver his probably at some

547
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,039
point gotten home and realized that they

548
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:06,580
don't remember driving home system one

549
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:08,080
can drive a car this might explain why

550
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,668
we think about a lot of drivers they're

551
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,830
not really sentient when they're driving

552
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:15,129
they're letting an AI drive their car

553
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:17,080
Google might be better at this now

554
00:21:15,129 --> 00:21:19,209
system one is also a bigot very

555
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,678
important for people to recognize if you

556
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:23,440
happen to walk out of here at night and

557
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:26,320
you see large man in an alley you

558
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,990
probably think danger that's okay that

559
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,330
system one saying it's dark there's a

560
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:32,830
person there bigger than I am let me

561
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:34,269
cross the street even if they're not

562
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:36,759
bigger than I am let me cross the street

563
00:21:34,269 --> 00:21:39,249
it's important to recognize that this is

564
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:40,380
where much bigotry comes from is from

565
00:21:39,249 --> 00:21:42,720
system one

566
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:46,980
making judgments based on inputs that it

567
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,299
has now we do a little exercise partly

568
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,650
cuz it's already the morning people need

569
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:51,480
to make sure they're awake so I'm gonna

570
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:54,360
put words up on either side of the line

571
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,549
just a left side and a right side all

572
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:59,699
that I want you to do is say left or

573
00:21:56,549 --> 00:22:01,860
right depend on which side of the line

574
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,240
the word shows up on now to practice

575
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:14,490
it's really easy

576
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:15,870
I love the humor it is not the point

577
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:19,080
that are just like Oh God where is he

578
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:35,939
going with this let's clear it out okay

579
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:37,139
okay so what happened there this is

580
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,929
actually one of the best friends I've

581
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:41,909
ever had a system to over writing system

582
00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:44,010
one here's the thing that's interesting

583
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:47,039
left right decision-making is not

584
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:51,179
something system one can do but it can

585
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:53,460
read so your system one's like oh I got

586
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:54,809
this the words on the left stay left the

587
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:57,000
words on the right stay right I will

588
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:59,039
just read the word aloud you get fast

589
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,330
you get resigned to it and you're going

590
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,890
through and then all of a sudden I throw

591
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:04,049
something on the wrong side and system

592
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:05,520
one is like oh hey wait a second

593
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,780
something's wrong they're most proud

594
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,668
than the other half the people to say

595
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:11,100
the first one wrong but you notice how

596
00:23:08,669 --> 00:23:12,870
forceful everybody was that was system

597
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:15,689
to coming in and saying system one shut

598
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:17,399
up I have to think about this I have to

599
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:19,830
take an extra half second and come up

600
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,210
with something but we're very good at

601
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:24,418
this it's sometimes overriding our

602
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:26,100
system once but that's a very easy

603
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:29,940
example for you of how system one works

604
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:32,070
now system one trains itself it learns

605
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:35,580
things right you just saw it learn how

606
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:38,460
to do a task well guess what we take our

607
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,510
system 1 and our company systems 1 and

608
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,440
for instance we send them to

609
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:42,360
computer-based training

610
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,890
it'll say something like you have annual

611
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,570
security where it is training is

612
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:47,940
required of all employees because bla

613
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:50,189
bla bla bla bla and what do they learn

614
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,340
out of getting messages like this oh

615
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:54,799
right it's that annual check

616
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:58,520
last thing I gotta do let me click the

617
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:59,779
button god I hate this and think they

618
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,668
actually improved in their security

619
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:04,010
awareness at that point or did then then

620
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:05,929
did they instead say god I hate these

621
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:09,340
people who make me do this work they're

622
00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:09,340
evil and why do we employ them

623
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:14,120
so let's come back to the prisoners in a

624
00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:15,710
dilemma remember this one now it turns

625
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,989
out that all of our knowledge about how

626
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:20,600
people behave with one another is based

627
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:22,159
on doing Studies on grad students now it

628
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:25,399
turns out that grad students are a very

629
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:27,140
poor model for humanity all models are

630
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:29,120
flawed some are useful it turns out

631
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:31,010
they're incredibly not useful for

632
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,168
understanding how people will decide to

633
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:34,820
cooperate or cheat with one another so a

634
00:24:33,169 --> 00:24:37,309
university in Australia said well that's

635
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:40,370
great why don't we do this test instead

636
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:42,889
on actual convicts we have these people

637
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:44,209
in prisons we can model behavior in the

638
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:46,730
same way like the test that we do to

639
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:49,669
simulate aren't with actual people who

640
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:50,929
are we suspect were convicted or have

641
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:52,940
committed a crime we actually is a

642
00:24:50,929 --> 00:24:55,730
rewards based system to model it instead

643
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:58,340
and all of a sudden what happens is this

644
00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:00,980
that the cooperation rate jumps up to

645
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:03,980
30% of the time they're both cooperating

646
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:05,690
and in fact they're only both cheating

647
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:10,480
about 19 percent of the time we just

648
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:14,350
flipped from about 65% cheating to 65%

649
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:18,080
cooperating like that's phenomenal

650
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:19,279
what's the difference here the

651
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,750
difference is you convince a grad

652
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,880
student that this is a two-player game

653
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:24,529
but no way you ever going to miss a

654
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,659
convict that this is a two-player game

655
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:28,640
they recognize that the researcher is

656
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:32,299
the authority and that they're a player

657
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,370
in the game different model of humanity

658
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:36,260
and a different model of the world right

659
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:38,389
they recognize that they are not the

660
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:40,070
villains to each other but Alice and Bob

661
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:41,299
you two when they were grad students you

662
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:43,549
could totally convince them that each

663
00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:45,460
other was a villain and his villains

664
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:49,629
they became remarkably non-cooperative

665
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,630
we don't want to be villains

666
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:57,209
there's my demand so when we talked

667
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:59,010
about organizations considering risk

668
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:00,810
it's important to understand that

669
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:02,550
everybody in the organization thinks

670
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:05,970
about risk but they think about it

671
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:07,169
differently so for instance we'll take

672
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:09,480
these the people in that organization

673
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:12,150
and let's take you know any business

674
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,530
owner they're responsible for a P&L they

675
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:15,600
want to understand if they're doing well

676
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:17,340
at their market share to them risk is

677
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,320
all about product launch and product

678
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:22,740
failure and are they capturing enough of

679
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:25,320
the TAM to work forward you know we look

680
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:26,790
at the CEO and in a sense in a lot of

681
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,169
senses the risk they're looking at is

682
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:30,389
based on quarter to quarter or

683
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:34,320
profitability alright are we doing well

684
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:37,380
as a company we can look at folks in

685
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,000
sales their risk is you know my income

686
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:41,250
is entirely based on how much I sell I

687
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,770
got to make my quota am I going to make

688
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:46,500
my quota selling this product imagine

689
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:49,440
that you have one product that you have

690
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:51,420
say 25% margin on but sells for $1,000 a

691
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,440
month if you have another product that

692
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:55,230
you have like seventy five percent

693
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:58,230
margin that sells for like $20,000 a

694
00:26:55,230 --> 00:27:00,780
month most sales reps will go sell 20 of

695
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:02,520
that $1,000 a month deal even though

696
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:05,160
it's less profitable for your business

697
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,990
because they're going to fill quota so

698
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,090
you have a business owner who cares

699
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:11,100
about P&L and a sales rep who cares

700
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:13,110
about quota that are now adversarial

701
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:15,360
we've incented them to go solve

702
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:17,820
different problems very important sorts

703
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,889
of things for us to pay attention to we

704
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:22,950
look at the CFO and they worry about

705
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:24,660
resource allocation we've got people who

706
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:28,110
can actually predict how much money they

707
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:30,630
will spend and you know actually come on

708
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:32,459
budget under budget is a bad thing in a

709
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:33,960
public company for those who have not

710
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,180
had the joy of being in a public company

711
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:39,090
or managing a budget at the same time

712
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:41,340
the oh I should save money is a horrible

713
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:43,320
idea if you're going to save money you

714
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:45,360
have to tell the CFO you're going to do

715
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,620
it before you do it because if they

716
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,750
thought you were spending ten million

717
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:50,760
dollars this quota up this order and you

718
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,560
only spent three million dollars that's

719
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:55,590
seven million dollars of money that they

720
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:57,659
allocated in the wrong place that they

721
00:27:55,590 --> 00:28:00,000
don't really get to get back because

722
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:01,410
they're reporting quarterly hitting the

723
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,330
budget is more important than saving

724
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:05,759
money now if you can save money and hit

725
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:08,590
the budget they're really happy

726
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:10,119
employees often ask the question Wow am

727
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,439
I gonna have a job but I've got sales

728
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:13,869
reps that are selling things that aren't

729
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,989
profitable I got the CFO is taking my

730
00:28:13,869 --> 00:28:18,639
money back because I didn't spend it is

731
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:21,190
this well-run company am I gonna sell

732
00:28:18,639 --> 00:28:22,748
the job next week and of course you know

733
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:26,200
and the security we ask questions like

734
00:28:22,749 --> 00:28:27,940
is this safe all right those first five

735
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,129
questions are all seem answerable don't

736
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:31,239
they but those are very tactical real

737
00:28:30,129 --> 00:28:33,850
fears

738
00:28:31,239 --> 00:28:36,399
this isn't this safe comes back to that

739
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:38,168
earlier conversation about safety now

740
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:40,539
let's be honest I use the lizard brain

741
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:43,720
here a stereotype to everybody in those

742
00:28:40,539 --> 00:28:45,669
fields including our own that's not

743
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:49,779
always the only thing that people will

744
00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:52,629
think about now let's go back to risk

745
00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:56,080
tolerance so the oh you have perceived

746
00:28:52,629 --> 00:28:57,908
risk over time and now I hypothesizing

747
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,619
and kaanum in this economy's belief is

748
00:28:57,909 --> 00:29:02,470
that we basically have a set point of

749
00:28:59,619 --> 00:29:04,809
risk tolerance we will tolerate so much

750
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:06,759
risk that we accept and so if you

751
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:09,730
increase it something comes in and

752
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:12,909
scares us we will then act to decrease

753
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:14,859
it push it back to where it was and that

754
00:29:12,909 --> 00:29:16,659
in theory this repeats all the time in

755
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:19,389
our lives now you assume the other

756
00:29:16,659 --> 00:29:23,289
direction if risk goes down you will act

757
00:29:19,389 --> 00:29:26,619
to increase risk we see things like the

758
00:29:23,289 --> 00:29:28,269
mandatory bicycle helmet laws looked at

759
00:29:26,619 --> 00:29:30,639
first like they would had decreased risk

760
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:32,649
they broken this rule because all of a

761
00:29:30,639 --> 00:29:34,809
sudden more bicyclists are surviving

762
00:29:32,649 --> 00:29:37,539
until you go and looked at all wheeled

763
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:39,009
vehicles and discovered that all of a

764
00:29:37,539 --> 00:29:41,350
sudden a whole bunch of the riskiest

765
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:43,739
bicyclist had all moved off of bicycling

766
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:45,939
onto more dangerous vehicles

767
00:29:43,739 --> 00:29:48,340
skateboarding you know the the rip

768
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:50,980
boards etc because they could get that

769
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:53,559
thrill and so the the head related

770
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:59,529
injuries had gone up in other wheeled

771
00:29:53,559 --> 00:30:01,480
sports now you saw in there that I had

772
00:29:59,529 --> 00:30:04,179
perceived risk and so there's perceived

773
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,159
risk and actual risk these are in theory

774
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:08,019
and harmony but not necessarily so at

775
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,999
any given point you're somewhere here

776
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:12,429
and hopefully those line up in a decent

777
00:30:09,999 --> 00:30:15,249
fashion and you can move without point

778
00:30:12,429 --> 00:30:16,760
around so your actual risk can increase

779
00:30:15,249 --> 00:30:18,830
but you're not aware of it

780
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:21,530
thread ignorance probably not a great

781
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:23,240
place to be in I would assert that

782
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:24,410
almost all threats to start out with

783
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,900
this and then hopefully you learn about

784
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:30,410
them at some point to get back onto that

785
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:31,670
that beautiful dotted line you could

786
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:33,380
have known vulnerabilities or risk

787
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:34,040
happens you're aware of it you assess it

788
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:36,080
correctly

789
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:40,940
therefore your perception moves out the

790
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:43,610
same way your actual risk does there's

791
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:45,170
FUD which is what you know us vendors

792
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:47,870
will start all of our slide decks with

793
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:49,730
slides 2 3 & 4 of almost every extra

794
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:51,800
slide slide when is the title slide to

795
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:54,560
is about the company slide 3 is the

796
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,820
headline scare flood slide slide 4 is

797
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,040
the case study of somebody being

798
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:59,990
breached and slide 5 is how I'm going to

799
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,399
save you from this but pretend that

800
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,690
that's not what this slide really is so

801
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,330
I'm supposed to go through 15 more

802
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:08,060
slides but it's what sells right now

803
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:09,679
fear is good we buy stuff because of

804
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:12,169
fear but you want fear to be aligned to

805
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:14,270
a real risk if I show you a headline for

806
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:17,480
company that's not yours probably not a

807
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:19,820
real risk now we can improve things

808
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,080
stealth improvements I always love when

809
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,490
people are so embarrassed that they

810
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,350
haven't fixed something in years that

811
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:25,700
they fix it and don't tell me and then

812
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:27,949
it takes me another couple years to

813
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:29,450
discover that fix that happened I'm

814
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:31,130
thinking well you know I thought you had

815
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:34,160
more risk so I was pushing you to fix

816
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:35,510
other stuff too great but this is not

817
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,100
actually a great place to be you don't

818
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:40,670
want your perception and actual to not

819
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:42,949
align you can reduce risk you can also

820
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:44,420
do security theater hey look here's this

821
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:47,630
thing we're doing to reduce risk

822
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:49,280
it doesn't actually reduce risk now I

823
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:51,740
left out two directions these are the

824
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:54,410
fun directions because one of these is

825
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:55,820
blind to compliance we do a thing

826
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:57,710
because we are told this will reduce

827
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:59,530
risk we believe it and it turns out it

828
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:03,260
doesn't actually reduce our risk at all

829
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:06,320
one of my favorites I was in the UK a

830
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:08,660
while ago was in a hotel and in the

831
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,980
shower there's the sign which is hard to

832
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,300
read it says you have for your comfort

833
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:14,180
and safety before showering

834
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:16,580
please ensure the bath mat is securely

835
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:19,460
in place and the shower curtain is

836
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:21,379
inside the bath now you can envision

837
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:23,690
when they created this sign that had

838
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:25,880
some people slip or fall in the bathroom

839
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:28,190
and their lawyer said oh my god we have

840
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,049
a risk here where you

841
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:31,549
we'll be accused of being negligent so

842
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:33,590
we'll make up the science we'll put them

843
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:35,210
in every one of our bathrooms so that

844
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:37,250
now it's the customers fault if they

845
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:39,080
slip and fall right so that they think

846
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:42,409
they have reduced their risk but what

847
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:46,939
wasn't in that bathroom a bath mat or a

848
00:32:42,409 --> 00:32:48,679
shower curtain right so now they've gone

849
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:51,230
for it instead of going down in rhythm

850
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:53,210
on up in risk if I slip and fall they

851
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:55,759
have gone from negligence to

852
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:59,149
recklessness they knowingly created this

853
00:32:55,759 --> 00:33:00,169
risk for me now I had somebody pointed

854
00:32:59,149 --> 00:33:01,610
out to me they said yeah but I think you

855
00:33:00,169 --> 00:33:04,490
were really safe in that bathroom

856
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:07,070
weren't you and in fact I was because I

857
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:08,750
had the opposite I had awareness like

858
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:10,908
there was this risk that it always had

859
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:13,129
now it's oh my god I'm really aware of

860
00:33:10,909 --> 00:33:15,590
it and I'm going to change my behavior

861
00:33:13,129 --> 00:33:18,469
because I'm so aware of risk like I've

862
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:20,750
overreacted this is a great place to be

863
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:22,639
like you kind of want people to over

864
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:24,590
react in a good way and then say okay

865
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:27,799
maybe I overreacted a little but hey now

866
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:29,480
I feel safer but that feels good right

867
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:35,240
being in that axis that feels really

868
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:37,129
awesome so the downside is sometimes we

869
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,259
don't mitigate risk and what happens

870
00:33:37,129 --> 00:33:41,928
when we - what story do we tell

871
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:43,820
ourselves so we're going along we have

872
00:33:41,929 --> 00:33:47,419
some perceived risk something new comes

873
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:49,460
in we get scared we take some action and

874
00:33:47,419 --> 00:33:52,669
the action doesn't actually fix our

875
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:55,250
problem and so our lines don't match up

876
00:33:52,669 --> 00:33:58,190
and that's really uncomfortable for us

877
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:59,720
and so we have to tell ourselves some

878
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:01,970
stories about what we might do at this

879
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,379
point now an ideal story would be we'll

880
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:06,649
go push the line down somewhere else

881
00:34:03,379 --> 00:34:08,710
that's probably too simple for us so one

882
00:34:06,649 --> 00:34:11,540
story that we might tell ourselves is

883
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:15,530
that well that was just my perceived

884
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:17,750
risk my actual risk was always up there

885
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:20,030
to begin with when a retroactive

886
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:22,510
continuity anybody who reads comic books

887
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:24,859
is very familiar with this technique

888
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:27,790
that's also pretty uncomfortable and

889
00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:29,929
hard for us to really don't get with

890
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:30,770
either/or we can tell ourselves a

891
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:33,980
different story

892
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:36,710
and so our different story goes

893
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:38,599
something like this you know i was here

894
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:40,879
and i got told about this risk and i

895
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:41,600
took an action maybe that risk wasn't

896
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,029
really

897
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:46,159
bad as I thought it was and in fact we

898
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:48,950
who was it that told me about that risk

899
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:50,779
always Bob the Oh Bob's told me about a

900
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:53,120
whole bunch of other risks that were in

901
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:56,810
my system too maybe I could even order

902
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:59,870
those also and so now all of a sudden

903
00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:00,620
hey I'm doing much better than I was

904
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:02,810
before

905
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:05,299
in fact I'm doing so much better that

906
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:07,820
I'm at such low risk that I can go do

907
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:10,430
some cool risky things I've got this

908
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:13,640
risk budget that I can go spend to get

909
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:15,799
back to where I thought I was I've

910
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,750
actually worked with folks who verbally

911
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:21,350
squawked me through that that change of

912
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:23,930
thinking kind of scary where we want to

913
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:25,370
be is to train people we say look the

914
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:28,520
risk that we know about is not what our

915
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:31,400
organization knows about so when new

916
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:33,620
risks come in what we actually want to

917
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,270
do is get them to mitigate that risk and

918
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:38,150
so that might have been a risk that's

919
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:41,390
new to us but what we'd like you to do

920
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:43,760
is mitigate that risk in a way that will

921
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:45,319
bring down our overall risk so that

922
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,420
while we look at it we're back to where

923
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:49,550
we were they might see themselves as

924
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:53,750
getting better or they might not believe

925
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:55,460
that what we do and as we go on you can

926
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:58,220
train this so hopefully it was a great

927
00:35:55,460 --> 00:36:00,320
example for this right if all the people

928
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:02,209
didn't heartbleed was rotate their

929
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,400
certificates they weren't actually

930
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:06,530
getting better but if what they did

931
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,110
instead was say things like oh wow you

932
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:10,490
know why do I have my open SSL compiled

933
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:13,190
with heartbeats because all that I'm

934
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:15,410
doing is TCP base TLS and I don't need

935
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:17,150
heartbeats boom you just mitigated a

936
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:19,879
risk that had been there the whole time

937
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:21,200
and you got better but all that you

938
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,480
thought you did was fixed one

939
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:26,810
vulnerability right so taking

940
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:29,510
opportunities to respond to an impulse

941
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:30,980
with a systemic fix and these feel

942
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:32,180
really good people start to feel good

943
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,010
about themselves because they're

944
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:36,140
actually able to respond to hard

945
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:37,640
problems and they might tell themselves

946
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,900
the story that they're on the bottom and

947
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,540
we might tell ourselves the story were

948
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:43,250
on the top I don't know who's right but

949
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:48,410
we can train risk management and risk

950
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:50,840
response so better conversations we'd

951
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:52,399
like to have is to do hazard and safety

952
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:54,230
analysis with our business owners when

953
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,680
they ask if something is safe tell them

954
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:58,820
you

955
00:36:54,680 --> 00:37:00,859
no help them do the analysis it's really

956
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:04,430
scary the first time because they don't

957
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:06,410
understand this you know here's how we

958
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:08,149
think about safety you tell us and you

959
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:10,759
write down the risks that you have and

960
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:12,290
if you will do that if you will write

961
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,120
down your wrists and advertise them up

962
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:15,560
to your management then I'll say yeah

963
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,150
you're good to go to with a lunch

964
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:20,000
because you understand your wrists

965
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:21,260
because now they are aware and because

966
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,910
they're aware they're scared and they

967
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:26,690
will act better in the next product

968
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:31,790
Persia and possibly even in this one we

969
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:33,680
find this works remarkably well so very

970
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:34,850
quick said I'm running tight on time how

971
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,279
do you get better because you're all

972
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:40,040
overwhelmed with work right nobody here

973
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,990
is underemployed you were hired you had

974
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:44,960
three things to do take care of desktops

975
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:48,200
take care of servers take care of you

976
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,850
know data security then you have to

977
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,319
worry about adversaries you have to

978
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,490
worry about monitoring you have to worry

979
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,440
about internationalization and

980
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:56,149
globalization and innovation and all of

981
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:58,850
these other things 17 things on your

982
00:37:56,150 --> 00:38:01,070
plate if you juggle you know that

983
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:03,230
juggling three balls is moderately hard

984
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:06,110
juggling five balls is really hard and

985
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:07,670
juggling 17 balls is impossible if you

986
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:09,920
have 17 balls to juggle the way to

987
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:12,740
succeed is to put 14 of them on the

988
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,720
ground and juggle three balls and pick

989
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:16,310
your three balls wisely and pick the

990
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,410
ones that will give you another arm or

991
