1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
this is the first time I gave this

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:08,280
presentation so but yeah this is I so

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,380
I've been working on this the past few

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:15,570
months and what this came out of

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:19,020
basically was in a sock that I was

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:21,750
working in they didn't really have good

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,960
threat Intel and so what I wanted to do

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,529
was set up something personally for

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,900
myself that I could read that I could

10
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:33,390
reference so that whenever alerts pop I

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:37,440
would have something to go look at some

12
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:40,739
a reference and so this has roots in

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:45,420
focusing on in focusing in on open

14
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:47,459
source intelligence so just a little bit

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,079
about me

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,989
so first of all here's the standard

17
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,930
slide you know these are my opinions and

18
00:00:51,989 --> 00:01:01,709
don't represent anybody else except for

19
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:04,769
me so I go tigrex on tool on Twitter you

20
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,530
might fall follow me or see me tweet at

21
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:11,510
you there I have about 20 years of

22
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:14,340
industry experience of that 16 was

23
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:17,640
focused specifically in information

24
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,189
security in the past five six years I've

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,689
been doing sock type stuff like really

26
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:28,020
just deep just really on the D defensive

27
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:30,449
side and just going around the circle

28
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,689
here I basically cut my teeth doing web

29
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:38,729
application security back probably in

30
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:41,329
the early 2000s a little bit of pen

31
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:45,750
testing got in to doing security

32
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:47,970
engineering tight type work got into

33
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,540
FISMA so does it any this is anybody

34
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:54,060
here do any government stuff alright so

35
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,399
all the CNA stuff so that kind of fits

36
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,009
in with the security engineering stuff

37
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:03,990
nice for the company that I work for

38
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:07,290
I'll do props and things like that I was

39
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:09,478
really at that point I found out that I

40
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,340
was creating a lot of you know

41
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,819
powerpoints and words and things like

42
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,640
that

43
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,170
and I wasn't able to

44
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,019
and I was missing getting some of the

45
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:21,739
hands-on skills so that's where I took a

46
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:23,960
step back found a position doing trade

47
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,790
studies so bringing in all the different

48
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:29,180
commercial products that are out there

49
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:31,220
testing them doing de costs and then

50
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:34,690
like I said I've been involved in

51
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:38,810
working with socks in some way shape or

52
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:42,260
form the past five years and also do a

53
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:46,040
lot of IT security training with my

54
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:48,980
current employer so just a little bit of

55
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:51,019
backstory so so the Nova in Eden Fassett

56
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:54,350
comm that's just sort of a side thing I

57
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:57,290
actually work for a large DoD contractor

58
00:02:54,350 --> 00:03:00,530
where I did most of this stuff here but

59
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:03,109
the side thing that I do run is is this

60
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:05,390
website it's been up for about I don't

61
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:08,090
know probably about eight years now try

62
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:11,208
to get a blog post out it's just a play

63
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:17,390
area where I can you know put stuff out

64
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:19,760
and get some comments so so basically

65
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:22,429
what I'm trying to do at this point is

66
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,780
I'm trying to do maybe into trying to go

67
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:29,360
into my own consulting business due to

68
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:34,040
some of the limitations with working at

69
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:36,530
large corporations so slowly trying to

70
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:41,000
wait in it's a very scary thing to start

71
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:50,330
your own business but anyway back to the

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:52,070
topic at hand so this probably I don't

73
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:54,650
know is probably about six years that

74
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:57,709
that I've that I'm going to tell this

75
00:03:54,650 --> 00:04:01,160
story of of where I started out and how

76
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:03,769
I came to you know choosing Evernote as

77
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:06,470
a possible solution and the thing that I

78
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:08,330
want to make clear here is you know you

79
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:11,480
wouldn't like a large corporation

80
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:14,200
wouldn't use Evernote as their threat

81
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:17,000
Intel or case of the attachment system

82
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:20,358
but what this was is more of an

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,780
experiment to see if we can use the very

84
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:27,638
flexible platform like Evernote to do

85
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:31,549
those security intelligence folks

86
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:34,069
and creates some sort of a framework and

87
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:37,250
then based on that framework you can

88
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:40,539
create a simple platform like maybe you

89
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:44,539
already have a wiki in-house or

90
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:47,090
SharePoint workflow system or something

91
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:50,750
like that or even something like remedy

92
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:52,669
or RT or whatever basically take that

93
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:55,940
system and this would give you the

94
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:59,530
framework of how to use that system so

95
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:04,940
that you can build your own intelligence

96
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:08,570
so first of all what I've seen over the

97
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:11,150
years is that we for simple solutions we

98
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:12,860
tend to over engineer so what we

99
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:15,380
basically do is hey well we want the

100
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:19,220
simple workflow system and then oh we

101
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:21,139
gotta like collect read the requirements

102
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:26,139
we have to do a test plan we have to

103
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:29,860
develop it we have to test it deployable

104
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:33,550
on process you might not even have the

105
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:35,900
the solution that you need so I

106
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:38,810
basically like to stick with the KISS

107
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:41,270
principle to keep it simple stupid where

108
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:45,820
hey let's take and use what we have now

109
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:48,770
in form some sort of quick and dirty so

110
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:51,500
solution it isn't gonna get us get us a

111
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:53,889
hundred percent of the way there but if

112
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,599
a simple Scylla if we can do a simple

113
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:59,780
solution that can get a sixty to seventy

114
00:05:56,599 --> 00:06:03,130
percent of the way there then that's

115
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:06,549
something that we can at least use to

116
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:09,469
tweak and to figure out what our true

117
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:12,259
requirements are because in the end may

118
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:15,710
may may be this quick and dirty solution

119
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:18,650
is something that will just work and you

120
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:22,580
can stick with it you know worst case is

121
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:26,330
this will allow you to identify the gaps

122
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:29,620
that that system doesn't support so that

123
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:31,789
you can from that identify your

124
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:35,560
requirements and then go with them or

125
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:36,990
come a more commercial solution or a

126
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:41,900
solution that

127
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:44,640
you would build so the example here is

128
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,590
so there's like on a program that I

129
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:50,039
worked on we had a simple onboarding

130
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:52,710
workflow system and so a high-level

131
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,750
manager expressed this need where we

132
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:57,299
needed this workflow and so several

133
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,980
people went out and they develop tools

134
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:03,530
and you know there were like access

135
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:06,750
databases and SharePoint workflows and

136
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:10,530
you know and just they were unusable or

137
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:13,980
if they built them the program manager

138
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:15,960
would have their underling they'd image

139
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:20,490
it because because the program manager

140
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:23,940
wasn't really able to use it so after a

141
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:25,800
few months go by I come back and he

142
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,469
tells me oh well we've developed this

143
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:32,160
this this or I've developed this

144
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:35,070
workflow system and it seems to work

145
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:39,000
well you know here's here's the process

146
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:41,909
for it so so he pointed me to where it

147
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,490
was and it had ended up being like

148
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:47,700
basically like a simple folder structure

149
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:50,130
where if we were gonna onboard somebody

150
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:52,260
I would fill out this word form stick it

151
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:55,350
in the inbox and then that would get

152
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:59,810
checked periodically and then the

153
00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:03,840
manager would review it make any changes

154
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:05,760
submit it to the customer and then she

155
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,729
would move it to the to the simply

156
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,800
submitted folder and then lastly once

157
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:13,680
the customer approved we would just move

158
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,420
it to the approved folder so this is

159
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,090
something where there were a lot of

160
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:20,250
people on the program that developed

161
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:23,820
these really complicated solutions that

162
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:26,220
no one could that no one wanted to use

163
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:28,710
because they were they were just hard

164
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:32,880
but in the end just this simple thing

165
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:38,039
got us he knows 62 said 60 to 70 percent

166
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:39,740
of the way there and the other thing the

167
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:43,429
other point that I want to make is that

168
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:48,440
we want to build or at least try to

169
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:48,439
before buying and this gets back to

170
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,170
you know using the tools that we already

171
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:55,199
have

172
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:57,929
setting up the good processes all around

173
00:08:55,199 --> 00:09:00,809
using those tools you know and then

174
00:08:57,929 --> 00:09:03,569
having smart people that can enforce

175
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:07,559
those processes and using a simple

176
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:10,860
solution like like just a just the full

177
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:13,829
the folder structure that I showed you

178
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:18,209
can continually evolve the processes

179
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:20,670
based on lessons learn and then in the

180
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:22,920
end maybe that will solve your need that

181
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:25,709
simple folder structure the other thing

182
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,878
is else it helps you understand what you

183
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:31,949
really need through through the gaps

184
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:33,689
that you've identified and then that's

185
00:09:31,949 --> 00:09:36,689
when maybe you would want to go try to

186
00:09:33,689 --> 00:09:39,689
build something or or go with it a

187
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:42,839
commercial pro product but the thing

188
00:09:39,689 --> 00:09:45,868
here is is that you have a really great

189
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:49,439
or a really good understanding of what

190
00:09:45,869 --> 00:09:51,720
you need so that can help you better

191
00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:54,360
choose the commercial product that

192
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,399
you're looking for and then the whole

193
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:00,269
process here is you know investing

194
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:03,029
people and process first to to to get

195
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:05,970
those foundations down understand what

196
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:09,439
your requirements are maybe you can stop

197
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:13,199
there if if not then you can go to the

198
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:15,719
products so the thing here that I want

199
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:18,599
to make is that this whole premise is is

200
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:24,779
is based on some of the different threat

201
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:27,240
Intel sources that are out there so kind

202
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:30,329
of a little bit of history so a long

203
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:33,379
time ago I was a stock engineer and I

204
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:36,569
was hired to do to create dashboards

205
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:38,970
they wanted to measure what risk was and

206
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:41,549
so it was a manual process but you know

207
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:45,420
we just used a basic risk equation that

208
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:47,819
involved threat vulnerability and then

209
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,649
some sort of impact to although they at

210
00:10:47,819 --> 00:10:52,469
the time they weren't too interested in

211
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:54,389
that so the goal was to have this nice

212
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,429
little dashboard where the manager could

213
00:10:54,389 --> 00:11:01,550
look and say oh this is what my risk is

214
00:10:56,429 --> 00:11:05,780
and so for the vulnerability

215
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:09,229
figure we had D data based on patch and

216
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:14,089
other tools so we knew how many like hi

217
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:17,000
patches we were missing so threat at the

218
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:19,700
time this is like six years ago we sort

219
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,350
of knew we we knew what what the threats

220
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:28,070
were but but at the time there was no

221
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:29,510
way to bring them together so so I just

222
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:32,000
went out and said oh well I'm going to

223
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:34,610
query some of the different vendor sites

224
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,980
because they've cuz though that is your

225
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,900
threat based on what they're seeing and

226
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,750
so I sort of averaged that normalized

227
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:43,610
that and then averaged it and put it

228
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:46,220
together and so I basically had this

229
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:48,200
dashboard with a big graph that shows

230
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:51,770
hey this was our risk was and you can

231
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,900
essentially drill down to see well well

232
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:55,520
this is what your vulnerability figure

233
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:58,939
is and you could drill down and say oh

234
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:03,050
well these are the contributing numbers

235
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:05,870
that were stats that went into that

236
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:10,969
vulnerability number so it was a good

237
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:13,910
start so the other thing too so

238
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:16,850
dashboard - - oh I started being a stock

239
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:20,060
analyst and so I wanted to keep up with

240
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:23,420
a lot of stuff that was going on so we

241
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:26,180
had a nice email folder that you could

242
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:29,449
put you know just discrete create an

243
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:32,719
email folder with for a distro list and

244
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:35,060
so whenever you know somebody created an

245
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,120
incident ticket or if things were

246
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:41,119
updated everything would just get put in

247
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,400
to this distro list and and I don't know

248
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:48,530
a lot of people kind of poopoo the email

249
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:50,720
as a tracking that given ism but it's

250
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:54,230
pretty useful you know you have this as

251
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:59,030
long as everybody uses it following the

252
00:12:54,230 --> 00:13:01,820
processes so that was nice and then the

253
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:03,650
other thing too depending on the which

254
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:06,860
side of the system you're on you can

255
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:08,930
also suck in like RSS feeds so that was

256
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,910
nice but I wanted a little bit more

257
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:14,780
because that was only one ask

258
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:16,339
of what I was looking for there so so I

259
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:18,709
took some of the prior dashboard

260
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:21,020
research that I did and I built my own

261
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:23,650
risk tab in iGoogle

262
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:27,170
so I basically pulled in some of these

263
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:30,770
resources and our SS feeds and pulled

264
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:36,170
them together created this this risk tab

265
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:39,199
in I Google if you remember that and it

266
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:42,290
just just as an in as an analyst it just

267
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,670
gave me situational awareness so this is

268
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:46,250
essentially kind of what it looked like

269
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:48,530
long time ago and and these aren't

270
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:51,260
actual screenshots but so I started out

271
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:54,770
Google Reader you know long live Google

272
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:58,819
Reader so what you could do is you could

273
00:13:54,770 --> 00:14:00,710
group feeds and then with the feeds you

274
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:03,440
could put them into one of the gadgets

275
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:05,930
and then and then the third image there

276
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,440
is one of the gadgets close up so you

277
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:12,079
can basically get this nice flow of data

278
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,960
that you can check out maybe every 10

279
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,100
minutes to see kind of what's go what's

280
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:20,810
going on in the world

281
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:23,090
unfortunately that all went away and so

282
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:25,280
every so I transferred everything over

283
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:27,320
to feedly and and so you can actually

284
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,900
see some of the sources that I have here

285
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:32,390
so I have the gadget for vulnerabilities

286
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:35,060
the gadget for threats and gadget for

287
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:38,300
risk and I just sort of sucked those in

288
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:40,310
and that would give me an idea of what

289
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:43,910
was going on there and what you could

290
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:45,500
see here is I started pulling in I don't

291
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:48,949
know sort of I wouldn't call threat

292
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:53,390
Intel per se but that's but it's more

293
00:14:48,950 --> 00:15:02,450
like data or they're like data feeds

294
00:14:53,390 --> 00:15:05,810
like the CVE list from from nist so at a

295
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:09,260
certain point I just didn't like feedly

296
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:10,640
feel so I moved into this product that I

297
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,830
found called Netvibes

298
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,689
and it's a pretty cool site you just go

299
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:17,000
to it and you can set up tabs and

300
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:18,890
they're integrated with a lot of

301
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,550
different services but the one thing

302
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:23,449
that I like is that I can take some of

303
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,160
the date

304
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:27,470
some of the data feeds that I had in

305
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:30,410
feedly and I started putting them into

306
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:33,380
groups here so you can see here like I'm

307
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:35,360
really starting to get into just by

308
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:38,660
accident and I didn't even know it was

309
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,380
called threat Intel at the time but you

310
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:45,199
know the IPS

311
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:47,780
there's domains and and different things

312
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:54,560
and once again on the left-hand side we

313
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:57,110
have the CBE feeds too so overall the

314
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,420
takeaways here is that I found the

315
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:01,430
dashboarding and and I still use this

316
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:03,079
like that screenshot that I took of

317
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:06,739
netvibes there was something that I took

318
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:08,660
last night so I still use that kind of

319
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:12,050
lessons learned there is it's good for

320
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:16,300
you know blog post feeds or feeds that

321
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:19,910
push out data periodically but but

322
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:21,680
usually some of the open source Intel

323
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:24,890
sites they'll just dump a whole bunch oh

324
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:27,949
here's a thousand new IPs and so what I

325
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:31,069
really found is that the RSS feeds into

326
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:34,220
a dashboard like that don't work really

327
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:37,850
- well basically they're changing too

328
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:40,250
fast now there's there's the Netvibes

329
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:42,830
VIP it's what you can pay like a

330
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:45,890
thousand bucks a year but once again

331
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:48,140
this was for personal use because you

332
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:50,180
know that as an analyst I didn't have

333
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:52,520
access to this data and I was just

334
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:56,719
trying to create some thing that I could

335
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:59,329
use as a reference so netvibes VIP it

336
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,940
allows you to push all the RSS feeds in

337
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:04,160
to that and it actually maintains that

338
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:06,770
and then there's a search so you could

339
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,170
go in and search through that so that's

340
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:12,800
kind of nice and then a few years and

341
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:15,500
then feedly which I was using previously

342
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:18,079
but didn't like delay layout they came

343
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:21,560
out with a pro version that does the

344
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,449
same things the only limitation with all

345
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:26,960
this is that it doesn't work for these

346
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:28,310
peer periodically updated files so you

347
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:31,190
know and I can't think of anything off

348
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:34,658
the top of my head here but there's the

349
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:36,789
you know bad domain list and in

350
00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:39,429
those lists just get updated you know

351
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:42,849
maybe once a day maybe once a week and

352
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:44,619
so you would peers so you you would also

353
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:47,859
want that like here I want to download

354
00:17:44,619 --> 00:17:51,789
this this this text file of a thousand

355
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:54,699
IPS or a thousand domains and somehow

356
00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:57,729
stuff it in there and indeed so for

357
00:17:54,700 --> 00:18:02,259
those type purposes it didn't really

358
00:17:57,729 --> 00:18:07,690
work too well so in start-up speak I

359
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:10,029
decided to pivot so meanwhile over all

360
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:13,389
this time the threat Intel market was

361
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:17,950
growing it does anybody work for a

362
00:18:13,389 --> 00:18:20,769
threat Intel provider here no okay

363
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:25,690
because you may want to leave but first

364
00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:29,169
like over the next five minutes so but I

365
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:33,009
do believe in it but so so the third

366
00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:34,570
Intel market was just growing and so so

367
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:36,789
I started looking at what all this

368
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:40,749
threat Intel stuff was and I looked at

369
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:43,450
experts and and talked to consumers of

370
00:18:40,749 --> 00:18:46,450
these different threat Intel services

371
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:49,889
and then the basic takeaways that I

372
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:52,210
found is just it's a fascinating area

373
00:18:49,889 --> 00:18:57,039
there's you're just sucking in all this

374
00:18:52,210 --> 00:19:00,099
data and and you're mathematically kind

375
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:03,220
of doing correlation and and then you're

376
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:08,590
coming out with a way to you know you

377
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:12,129
have an indicator and a way to determine

378
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:15,988
if hey is this indicator saw something

379
00:19:12,129 --> 00:19:18,820
that I do or do not have to worry with

380
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:21,940
unfortunately you know a lot of the same

381
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:25,479
people that I talked to as well says

382
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:28,239
that it's not much value beyond open

383
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:30,759
source resources you know one person

384
00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:32,889
that I talked to said that if you follow

385
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:35,859
a certain number of people or if you

386
00:19:32,889 --> 00:19:37,389
follow the right people on Twitter you

387
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:40,539
know you'll actually find out about

388
00:19:37,389 --> 00:19:44,289
stuff first on Twitter then through any

389
00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:46,510
of these commercial services and the

390
00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:49,629
reason why I think though

391
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:53,800
is because these threat Intel services

392
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:55,810
are more just geared towards everybody

393
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:59,290
it isn't geared towards your specific

394
00:19:55,810 --> 00:20:02,800
organization so there's a lot of data in

395
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:06,159
there the vast amount of data that's

396
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:08,440
there isn't relevant or or isn't

397
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:13,380
something that you would use to take

398
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:16,300
action on in your organization so

399
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,770
learning all this I kind of looked at

400
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:21,280
some of the dashboard stuff that I was

401
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:24,490
doing previously and I found that you

402
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:27,639
know the dashboarding concept I was sort

403
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:29,680
of on to something there you know in

404
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:33,070
terms of trying to pull all this open

405
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:40,090
source data together so that you could

406
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:44,169
search it so basically we baselined it

407
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:45,520
so so I was I talked about netvibes

408
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:47,260
v.i.p

409
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,360
but I was looking for something that was

410
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:51,310
cheaper because it was just me doing my

411
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,689
own thing and something that was a

412
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:56,230
little bit more flexible you know

413
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:58,870
Netvibes was good for taking in Aris RSS

414
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:02,740
feeds but you know you sort of limited

415
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:07,209
the beyond that so what I wanted was a

416
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:09,550
bucket to dump everything into so it

417
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:13,570
could be from these you know certain

418
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:17,080
blogs for situational awareness it could

419
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:20,260
be other feeds like social media you

420
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:22,830
know those those right individuals that

421
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:26,230
you should be following on Twitter the

422
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:28,510
data-driven feeds so you it could just

423
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:30,760
have this bucket that just you just

424
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:34,360
throw everything into and then also

425
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:36,070
datafiles having a way that to take

426
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,439
these these huge lists that are updated

427
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:40,600
periodically and just once again throw

428
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:43,630
them into the bucket and then anything

429
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:46,360
else like there's a site out there like

430
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:49,960
called ATP notes and I think it's hosted

431
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:57,399
on github but the guy basically indexes

432
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:59,830
all the ATP or apt reports so but that's

433
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,460
nice right but I go to this site and

434
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,619
look

435
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:05,860
right like what what I'd like to do is

436
00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:11,199
get all those vendor reports or if I see

437
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:14,199
a new vendor put out their a report on

438
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,970
some new threat act after I just want to

439
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,100
grab it and throw it into this bucket

440
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:19,840
because and if it's all in one place

441
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,990
then I can search it and I can make

442
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:32,709
sense of it I can look for four four

443
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:36,009
trends so yep well it's it's ATP and

444
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:37,990
then notes and I don't I don't know if I

445
00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:40,720
have it but if you search for ATP notes

446
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:43,059
I think it's hosted on it off github but

447
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,850
and I haven't checked it recently but I

448
00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:47,350
assume he's keeping up with stuff but I

449
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:50,350
mean even I mean that's a good place to

450
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:53,980
seed your content but if but if there's

451
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:55,779
any reports that I mean maybe there's

452
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,700
reports that come out that he doesn't

453
00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:59,950
put in that you think oh this would be

454
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:07,629
useful it doesn't matter this bucket I'm

455
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:12,070
just shoving it in right yeah I mean it

456
00:23:07,629 --> 00:23:14,860
may have been him so so we have this big

457
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:17,279
bucket and so we need a way to find

458
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:19,990
stuff so you know just your basic

459
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:23,259
organizational principles so searchable

460
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:28,960
maybe have some categories and tagging

461
00:23:23,259 --> 00:23:32,499
right and tagging I think is is very

462
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:35,649
powerful especially with some of the

463
00:23:32,499 --> 00:23:37,960
tools out there that allow you to do

464
00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:41,439
tags but put them in sort of a tree

465
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:44,200
structure you can do a lot of powerful

466
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:47,590
things with that you can search through

467
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:50,499
you can just by searching on different

468
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:51,840
tags you can look at the same data in

469
00:23:50,499 --> 00:23:56,139
different ways

470
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:58,209
so that's a very powerful concept that

471
00:23:56,139 --> 00:24:01,360
that I wanted in the system that I was

472
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:04,090
bill building here and the other thing

473
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:06,369
is because I worked you know at my job

474
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:08,590
is I wanted something that was cob based

475
00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:12,480
so something that I could access from

476
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:12,480
from home from work or whatever

477
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:19,169
you know two examples that I gave here

478
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:21,210
was that like in the old days with email

479
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:22,740
folder with the distro list and stuff

480
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,900
and you can search that and that was

481
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:27,210
really nice but but the problem is is

482
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:29,400
that would only be like maybe at work

483
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:31,110
but I wouldn't have that at home I mean

484
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,330
obviously I could use like a web-based

485
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:36,570
provider too but there are some

486
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:38,820
limitations they're in and then you

487
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:41,189
could have there's different aggregation

488
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:44,070
tools that hey well you know like I

489
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:46,830
could even I could set up Splunk and I

490
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:49,050
could access that from you know when I'm

491
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:51,449
home but I may not have access to that

492
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:54,659
when I'm at work because work may have a

493
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:57,300
policy that says I can't VPN out into my

494
00:24:54,660 --> 00:25:01,950
own home stop so just whatever your

495
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:07,800
limitations are so so who's heard of the

496
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:10,500
secret weapon yes one person so what

497
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:15,210
this is the who's heard of GTD getting

498
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:22,140
things done all right so what this is is

499
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:25,080
it's a way of using Evernote as a it's a

500
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:26,610
way to implement GTD in Evernote and I

501
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,280
recommend like it first it looks

502
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:32,399
complicated too to set up but once you

503
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:35,639
set it up you just really see the power

504
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:39,840
of being able to create these different

505
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:42,950
higher hierarchies of tags which allow

506
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:46,860
you to view the things you have to do

507
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:50,640
depending on you know what the project

508
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:52,649
is when you have to do it is it

509
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,200
something that I'm gonna do now or is it

510
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:56,520
something that I'm going to do later you

511
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,580
know where is this something I want to

512
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:03,210
do at home at work whatever and then

513
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:07,379
also who you know who it's related to so

514
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:10,170
you could you know if if it's something

515
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:12,480
that involves your wife and you know

516
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:17,230
then then you would tag that to do with

517
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:24,940
with her name her his name

518
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:27,039
yep yeah yeah yeah so that's the cool

519
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:29,440
thing like and these are just the

520
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:32,440
high-level categories here because what

521
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,240
you do under active prod projects you

522
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:38,019
actually have whatever your active

523
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:40,419
projects are and so you can tag it at a

524
00:26:38,019 --> 00:26:43,929
project level so hey I'm going to do

525
00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:45,639
this specific or this specific project

526
00:26:43,929 --> 00:26:48,039
and then under that you would have of

527
00:26:45,639 --> 00:26:50,469
these are the 10 tasks I have to do to

528
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:54,370
complete that project but then you can

529
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:58,029
apply the when tag so hey this something

530
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:59,709
I'm gonna do daily now soon later in you

531
00:26:58,029 --> 00:27:01,659
can make these whatever you want you

532
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:03,519
know some people may want to make them

533
00:27:01,659 --> 00:27:05,320
you know this week next week two weeks

534
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:08,320
from now you know just whatever you're

535
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:11,580
comfortable with so this is his system

536
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:14,710
when he published it out on the web but

537
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:17,730
you know I kind of took this and made it

538
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:21,580
my own so I have kind of my own personal

539
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:24,070
implementation too but the cool thing is

540
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:27,158
you take Evernote and you're basically

541
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:30,460
treating Evernote like a big database

542
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:34,860
and a notebook is a table and a note is

543
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:36,760
a free-form record so there's different

544
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:39,428
organization things so you could have

545
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:43,059
nested notebooks and I our are already

546
00:27:39,429 --> 00:27:45,370
talked about the tree tagging then also

547
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:49,389
search so you can create complex

548
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:53,469
searches by specific note notebooks one

549
00:27:49,389 --> 00:27:55,570
or more tags keywords whatever and then

550
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:57,909
the other very powerful thing is you can

551
00:27:55,570 --> 00:28:02,260
you save searches so if you are

552
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:04,840
implementing a workflow system in

553
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:07,860
Evernote you could have a saved search

554
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:10,480
for hey show me all the stuff that

555
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:13,149
that's in the inbox it has to be

556
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,250
processed and then maybe maybe the next

557
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:18,158
step would be well I'm going to take

558
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:21,580
ownership of it so so now it goes to the

559
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:24,159
working State so you swap out the inbox

560
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:25,809
tag with a word with the working tag and

561
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:29,259
then you can even add

562
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:31,989
there's the who aspect to it as well so

563
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:34,599
you can add your name to it as another

564
00:28:31,989 --> 00:28:36,099
tags so you can go back and say like

565
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:39,099
well what are all the cases that I

566
00:28:36,099 --> 00:28:41,109
worked you know this past year that were

567
00:28:39,099 --> 00:28:43,718
closed and you can basically build that

568
00:28:41,109 --> 00:28:48,309
search query and create a safe search

569
00:28:43,719 --> 00:28:50,200
for it so basically this is what I've

570
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:53,649
been talking about where we basically

571
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:55,749
take all all these feeds and we in data

572
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:58,658
and we treat Evernote as this huge

573
00:28:55,749 --> 00:29:03,669
basket where we have defined notebooks

574
00:28:58,659 --> 00:29:06,899
and this tagging tree for defining what

575
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:10,179
the metadata data is so this could be

576
00:29:06,899 --> 00:29:13,599
like if it's an OS int feed it could be

577
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:16,210
like the owner of the data so if it's

578
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:18,549
coming from you know malware domains com

579
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:21,369
you could have a tag for that and maybe

580
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:23,049
malware domains com has several feeds

581
00:29:21,369 --> 00:29:25,839
and so you could have a name for each

582
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:27,879
one of the feeds and then depending on

583
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:30,580
what the type of feed is you could have

584
00:29:27,879 --> 00:29:39,339
what the indicator type is so oh this is

585
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:42,460
IP host hash whatever and it just really

586
00:29:39,339 --> 00:29:46,119
provides this flexible framework that

587
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:48,609
you can easily you know once you get

588
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:51,549
some basic safe queries down you know

589
00:29:48,609 --> 00:29:54,369
once again everybody from you know the

590
00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:56,739
tech guy in the trenches that's doing

591
00:29:54,369 --> 00:29:59,228
all the analysis work to even you know

592
00:29:56,739 --> 00:30:01,509
like the manager can easily easily

593
00:29:59,229 --> 00:30:03,159
easily go in and just select this one

594
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:05,349
search and if they want to find

595
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:08,649
something different it's nothing more

596
00:30:05,349 --> 00:30:12,070
than erasing one tag and adding and

597
00:30:08,649 --> 00:30:13,570
adding another tag so then the but the

598
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:18,070
question is how do you get all the stuff

599
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:20,619
into Evernote so the ways of doing that

600
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:23,200
is if you have the data like if you're

601
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:27,279
subscribing to an email list well you

602
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:32,529
can have your Gmail or whatever forward

603
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:37,239
it to your Evernote address and then you

604
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:39,429
can define tags and the cat and the

605
00:30:37,239 --> 00:30:43,479
notebook that you want it to go in

606
00:30:39,429 --> 00:30:47,799
- by using specific labels in the

607
00:30:43,479 --> 00:30:50,289
subject there's if then if that then

608
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:52,450
this so that's great especially for

609
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:55,419
getting like RSS feeds and saying hey

610
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:58,179
whenever a new item is added to this RSS

611
00:30:55,419 --> 00:31:01,570
feed you've post it to Evernote

612
00:30:58,179 --> 00:31:04,599
essentially and then zapier is another

613
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:07,629
one that's look does a little bit more

614
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:09,999
so so in some cases you would use that

615
00:31:07,629 --> 00:31:12,968
and then lastly is you know just scripts

616
00:31:09,999 --> 00:31:15,399
so like I haven't been able to find it

617
00:31:12,969 --> 00:31:18,039
an easy system where I could take these

618
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:19,539
huge list of domains that should be

619
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:21,549
blocked

620
00:31:19,539 --> 00:31:24,009
I haven't found an easy way to kind of

621
00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:26,080
use one of these automated services and

622
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:28,089
just stuff that into Evernote so you end

623
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,960
up using like a bash script that

624
00:31:28,089 --> 00:31:34,928
basically down downloads it checks it to

625
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:38,049
see if it's changed the last time it

626
00:31:34,929 --> 00:31:40,359
downloaded it and if it's changed and it

627
00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:43,389
emails it to Evernote using the right

628
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:44,859
label so it gets gets put in the right

629
00:31:43,389 --> 00:31:54,968
notebook and tagged

630
00:31:44,859 --> 00:31:57,519
appropriately so and just a little bit

631
00:31:54,969 --> 00:31:59,379
of background here so and I've talked

632
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,450
about these but you know really looking

633
00:31:59,379 --> 00:32:04,299
at the three sources of threat Intel so

634
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:06,159
there's the OS int that I could do on on

635
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:08,109
a personal basis there's information

636
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:13,119
sharing groups there's case in the end

637
00:32:08,109 --> 00:32:16,559
it's because there's a lot of data like

638
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:20,978
a lot of people will a lot of in

639
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:23,139
analysts will will look at certain cases

640
00:32:20,979 --> 00:32:26,739
but nobody ever steps back and looks

641
00:32:23,139 --> 00:32:28,089
across all the cases so but with

642
00:32:26,739 --> 00:32:30,940
Evernote you could actually do that

643
00:32:28,089 --> 00:32:35,710
because you can use search like hey

644
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:37,690
which which cases involve this IP you

645
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:42,190
just search that IP and you would

646
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:45,070
basically get all the Kate cases that

647
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:47,139
involved it maybe information sharing

648
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:50,379
groups that it came from that have also

649
00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:53,919
also seen it or if it's

650
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:57,580
open-source Intel and so this is just a

651
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:59,860
quick view of what open-source Intel is

652
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:02,679
you know I mentioned so you have your

653
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:04,899
traditional stuff there's lots of

654
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:09,460
open-source resources that are out there

655
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:11,380
every everybody has their favorite as my

656
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:14,440
research continues I'm gonna definitely

657
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:16,450
build like a good list that maybe people

658
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,310
can use as a reference to get started

659
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:21,430
with and don't forget the social

660
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:23,560
networks like I said and then the other

661
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:25,810
thing that you really want to want to do

662
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:29,200
to make the data more relevant to your

663
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:31,389
organization is mix in data that's

664
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,910
associated with your order organization

665
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:38,110
as well so you already have those those

666
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:40,540
case play like the workflow system that

667
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:43,000
I talked about but you need just simple

668
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:45,610
things like put a honeypot out there and

669
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,710
depending on there there's a nice little

670
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:49,629
honeypot systems where you can set up a

671
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:53,010
whole range of and they get pulled back

672
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:57,190
to the central thing to the central can

673
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:59,710
controller then there's basically an RSS

674
00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:02,980
feed that comes out of that which you

675
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:04,930
can feed in there but I mean the whole

676
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:07,120
thing and the amp is this here is

677
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:10,540
getting all this data and putting it

678
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:13,270
into one big place and it's essentially

679
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:19,629
the same thing for threat Intel sharing

680
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:22,000
groups so I historically I haven't

681
00:34:19,629 --> 00:34:23,739
really been too impressed with with some

682
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,090
of the different shirt sharing groups

683
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:27,819
that are out there but they're getting

684
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:29,409
that better but once again there's this

685
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:32,260
need to kind of pull everything together

686
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:34,780
in one place and in case management

687
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:37,060
right so there's a lot of great

688
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:40,419
solutions that are out there but we need

689
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:41,889
to you know have it everything put in

690
00:34:40,418 --> 00:34:45,310
one place and maybe you could use a

691
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:47,800
solution like remedy or ardor or RT

692
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:50,739
versus implementing a workflow system in

693
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,929
Evernote but as long as there is some

694
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:55,359
sort of feed or API so that you can pull

695
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:59,620
the data out and put it into your system

696
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:00,910
of record you should be fine

697
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,710
so there's a lot of different solutions

698
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:03,640
that are out there you have your open

699
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,980
source

700
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:09,490
tell I think most people are pretty

701
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:11,710
familiar with crits and SIF and I can

702
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:14,859
definitely talk about that offline and

703
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:17,290
then also vendors are you know you go by

704
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:21,040
any vendor product there's a threat

705
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:23,730
Intel add-on that you can get to so they

706
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:26,680
get their data from various sources

707
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:28,780
Intel sharing bulletin boards and I

708
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:31,930
already talked about case management and

709
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:34,510
there's a few all-in-one systems but the

710
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:37,450
whole point is that we put this all this

711
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:43,390
data into one system that anyone could

712
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:46,060
find things in so that basically kind of

713
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:48,640
summarizes it I'm speeding here because

714
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:50,140
I'm running out of time this is just a

715
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:55,270
description of some of the different

716
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:58,379
search theaters and then this goes into

717
00:35:55,270 --> 00:36:01,240
more detail with some of the different

718
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:03,130
automation things one thing that I want

719
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,689
to pull like I mentioned most of these

720
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:09,070
here the one thing that I want to pull

721
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:12,040
out is this o this v filter tool that'll

722
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:14,590
actually usually one if you subscribe to

723
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:16,870
an RSS feed you you usually get the

724
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:19,330
title and then part you you don't get

725
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:22,210
the full content well then this is a

726
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:26,080
simple like $20 tool that you can use

727
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:28,390
and it'll it can download all the

728
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:35,380
content I don't know how the website

729
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:38,830
owners feel about that but and and so

730
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:42,570
that this is just kind of shows what it

731
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:46,319
looks like from an open source Intel for

732
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:48,970
the current feeds that I'm pulling from

733
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:51,210
and there's like I have this huge list

734
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:53,740
of stuff that I want to add in but it

735
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:57,130
involves more like I'm gonna up start

736
00:36:53,740 --> 00:37:00,009
scripting stuff but basically I have my

737
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:03,510
OS n DB tag and the nuts there's a

738
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:07,840
hierarchy there of these are all the

739
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:12,520
sources so you see I the ISC for the

740
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:14,890
sins is C and then you also have down

741
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:17,750
here

742
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:20,210
well excuse me these are the sources and

743
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:24,230
then up there is the type of data that

744
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:27,530
it's coming from and as we know we

745
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:30,740
probably most of us in our organizations

746
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:32,300
can't use ever new right so but the

747
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:37,549
whole point is to come up with a

748
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:40,130
framework and define the system and then

749
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:43,609
implement that system in whatever tools

750
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:45,440
you current currently have so maybe if

751
00:37:43,609 --> 00:37:47,900
you want to go open-source you know

752
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,990
great log or log stash if it's something

753
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:54,410
you can implement internally or you can

754
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:56,990
go with Splunk most sims you can throw

755
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:58,549
data into those and then there's some

756
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:02,060
others too you know use something like

757
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:04,400
media wiki in a certain way or a

758
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:06,799
wordpress blog you know maybe that's

759
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,440
something you could use or SharePoint or

760
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,200
you know just use a file structure like

761
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:15,290
I originally showed but the whole point

762
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:17,000
is that you have data that's tagged it's

763
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:20,630
searchable and it all goes into the one

764
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:26,210
big bucket you're leaps and downs ahead

765
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:28,190
of others so just close things out so

766
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:31,330
there's a lot of solutions that are out

767
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:35,630
there but they just focus on one thing

768
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:38,779
you know and once again start with tools

769
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:41,119
and resources that you have to kind of

770
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:46,609
figure stuff out and in the end maybe

771
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:49,430
that solution is fine but at least it if

772
00:38:46,609 --> 00:38:53,810
not it will at least help you identify

773
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:56,480
the gaps or what your true needs are so

774
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:59,839
that you can implement or buy a more

775
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:03,290
customized solution and with that I

776
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:07,790
think I'm a few minutes over time so I

777
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:11,109
have my I'll take questions outside you

778
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:13,580
can follow me on twitter my website and

779
00:39:11,109 --> 00:39:15,650
there's a contact or if you want to

780
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:23,109
contact me it's basically just grex

781
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:23,109
gr e CS at Nova InfoSec com so thank you

782
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:41,950
now look at this so you see this and

783
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:41,950
it's like oh I just think it's much
