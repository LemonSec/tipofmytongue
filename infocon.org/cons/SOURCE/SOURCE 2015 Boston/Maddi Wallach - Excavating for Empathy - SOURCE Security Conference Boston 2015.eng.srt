1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:11,110
basically what I'm going to be

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:14,719
presenting here is in the handout and

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:20,029
the handout is also something that you

4
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:23,930
can take with you because it is a lot of

5
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:39,230
information and not all of it will be

6
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:41,629
immediately digestible so what welcoming

7
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:44,569
everybody first of all what we're going

8
00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:50,718
to be talking about is and you'll see

9
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:54,710
there are two old school papers on the

10
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:57,829
wall this one this one relates to the

11
00:00:54,710 --> 00:01:02,120
first two parks and that one relates to

12
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:09,939
the third part the first part is going

13
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:14,539
to be about how presumably most of you

14
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:18,380
started out and some of the qualities

15
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:22,220
that you possessed the second part is

16
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:25,729
going to be some of the struggles that

17
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:28,939
came out of those parts and I was

18
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:32,020
interesting I had so many different

19
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:36,000
models in my head

20
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:40,929
the last one that I had was of a heart

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,060
with arteries and veins and being as

22
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:46,420
this is the soft side it was pretty

23
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:51,640
appropriate and those getting blocked

24
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:54,780
and unblocked so stage two is kind of

25
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:59,770
blocked stage three is kind of unblocked

26
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:03,640
so what I'm gonna do go through which

27
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:11,410
you have on the first page after the

28
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:13,989
cover of your handout you have this and

29
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:16,420
you have it further fleshed out than

30
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:18,880
what it is there but not completely

31
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:22,450
fleshed out so I'm going to go through

32
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:27,730
that first for the original child and

33
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:34,140
for the ramifications and then for the

34
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:41,140
recovery there are a lot of this

35
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:46,298
presentation represents a 63-year body

36
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:49,570
of work a chunk of which is mine and a

37
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:55,030
chunk of which I learned about so it's a

38
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:58,048
synthesis that was done for this for you

39
00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:04,060
guys so we'll see if it's brand new

40
00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:09,709
consider yourselves guinea pigs so the

41
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:14,540
first part is a qualitatively

42
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:17,040
diverse process wait for these people

43
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:24,198
who are settled and then we'll begin

44
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:24,198
[Music]

45
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:36,810
so if you turn it the two of you who

46
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:38,459
just came in turn past if the two of you

47
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:43,230
who just came and turned past the first

48
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:47,489
page to the second page look for quality

49
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:50,369
diverse quality qualitatively diverse

50
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:58,340
process that's what we're going to be

51
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:58,340
talking about first people who are

52
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:06,600
extremely intelligent have a

53
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:09,780
qualitatively diverse process from the

54
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,799
norm most of you people will fall into

55
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:15,480
that category

56
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:18,269
and what I mean by that is that if you

57
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:22,409
look in the development books you'll see

58
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:24,750
that children of one two three four five

59
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:28,010
six up to twelve years old

60
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:35,240
supposedly don't have abstract thought

61
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:41,159
people of that age supposedly don't have

62
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:45,470
global awareness people of that age do

63
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:49,919
not combine concepts across disciplines

64
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:52,640
people of that age are not aware of

65
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:57,320
people other than themselves

66
00:04:52,640 --> 00:05:02,120
supposedly until they're four five

67
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:07,469
people who are extremely intelligent

68
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:11,639
often are they're often

69
00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:16,199
very very aware they're often putting

70
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:21,719
things together that they have no

71
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:25,709
ability to digest emotionally they're

72
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:28,439
often aware that they are different from

73
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:31,429
the kids around them they're often aware

74
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:34,619
that they're asking questions of adults

75
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:39,958
that the adults are giving them funny

76
00:05:34,619 --> 00:05:41,519
faces as they're trying to answer

77
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:43,679
they're aware of these things they can

78
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,749
be aware of these things at 1 years old

79
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:49,698
they can be aware of these things at 5

80
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:55,670
years old 6 years old even you know so

81
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:58,069
that qualitatively different process

82
00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:03,389
[Music]

83
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:06,179
they're also early to understand issues

84
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:09,389
and be aware of issues of morality and

85
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:11,568
justice they're often motivated by those

86
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:13,949
issues when they're supposed to be

87
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:18,839
motivated by learning to get good at

88
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:22,919
this in that deeper deeper levels of

89
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:28,319
things they also often make unconscious

90
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:30,748
leaps and I don't know if any of you

91
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:34,110
have had the experience of being in

92
00:06:30,749 --> 00:06:37,579
school in early grades or later grades

93
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:40,469
and being asked to show your work and

94
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:43,379
none of that work was actually

95
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:45,349
consciously in your mind you know you

96
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:49,009
went from here to here

97
00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:52,649
whether it was in mathematics or your

98
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:59,669
understanding of the world or other

99
00:06:52,649 --> 00:07:02,909
people and also lots and lots of

100
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:05,279
questions early questions questions

101
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:13,129
questions questions can anybody relate

102
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:18,449
to any of this thus far anybody yeah and

103
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:22,439
also that your experience of things was

104
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:27,209
powerful that you had at a young age a

105
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:31,490
strong emotional reaction to things and

106
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:35,219
especially since many of you are men

107
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:38,909
that is definitely not the way you were

108
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:45,229
supposed to be a lot of what we're going

109
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:47,090
to be talking about is how emotions were

110
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:50,240
disconnected

111
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:54,909
or perverted

112
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:57,940
not as in pervert but has it changed or

113
00:07:54,910 --> 00:08:07,220
arrested because they were so

114
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:11,510
unacceptable okay here's here's a list

115
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:15,620
from a man by the name of Bray Wasik who

116
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:19,760
talked about some of these qualities

117
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:23,680
that are qualitatively different from

118
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:26,599
the norms challenging assumptions

119
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:30,530
embracing dichotomies reconcile

120
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:33,620
opposites reconcile paradox recognizing

121
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:36,319
patterns search for systems seeking

122
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,560
change thinking globally thinking

123
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,170
holistically thinking pluralistic

124
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:47,329
thinking simultaneously now if you even

125
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:50,000
imagine a child doing that while they

126
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:52,550
are supposed to be learning what are

127
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,180
considered the basics which are reading

128
00:08:52,550 --> 00:09:00,829
writing and arithmetic those are not the

129
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:05,930
basics to this group of people those are

130
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:10,240
tools in service to more complex more

131
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:10,239
integrated deeper things

132
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:18,199
[Music]

133
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:20,230
anybody maybe your friend okay so

134
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:25,270
parents and children

135
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:31,730
next topic parents and children

136
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:39,189
typically if you have this your parents

137
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:42,230
had this typically your parents were not

138
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:45,170
given the tools to understand this

139
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:51,220
either or the ability to express it and

140
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:56,660
explore it so you have that generation I

141
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:59,960
once did a workshop with I didn't

142
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:03,199
workshop about multi-generational issues

143
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:08,660
at the profoundly gifted conference and

144
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:13,670
I asked people who were probably in

145
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:14,900
their 40s then or 50s then what were the

146
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:18,550
parents like what were their

147
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:22,280
grandparents like typically the women

148
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:25,490
who possessed this kind of ability in

149
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:30,800
their 20s were institutionalized as

150
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:34,070
insane I mean that was very very common

151
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,709
you know when you see all these women

152
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:40,940
poets and such who committed suicide I

153
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:43,370
mean they came from those they either

154
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:46,010
were those women or they came from those

155
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:52,140
women and even though most of you were

156
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:55,800
men you were raised by women and men and

157
00:10:52,140 --> 00:11:00,090
typically a lot of times the women and

158
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:04,109
men find each other and the men have cut

159
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:07,290
off pieces of their emotion to hold on

160
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:09,810
to their intellect and the women have

161
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:12,449
cut off pieces of their intellect to

162
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:16,439
hold on to their relation allottee so

163
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:18,750
now you have a couple who you know may

164
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,900
be of equal ability coping with it in

165
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,980
very opposite ways and they will hold on

166
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,600
to each other

167
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:28,010
that's another thing that's often very

168
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:31,740
typical no matter how bad it gets if

169
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:34,350
they recognize each other as potentially

170
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:39,330
able to understand even though they

171
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:41,040
won't so then you have the child so

172
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:46,650
let's suppose now that you guys are the

173
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:50,760
child and so you are the child and you

174
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:55,230
are coming out with some of these gifts

175
00:11:50,760 --> 00:12:00,900
that the parents didn't really have a

176
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:03,240
good way of being able to grow them so

177
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,980
here you come with those gifts that

178
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,140
they've either suppressed one side or

179
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:10,980
the other and those are typically that I

180
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:15,480
they're definitely not universal so what

181
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:20,520
happens to that child that child is

182
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:27,120
either the door for the parents that

183
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:29,579
child is the threat to that parent that

184
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,860
child you know can be many many things

185
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:36,330
to that parent so that that's

186
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:41,640
complicated to and worth exploring worth

187
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:45,930
exploring how your parents related to

188
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:46,910
your gifts and also how they steered

189
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:50,390
them

190
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:52,730
you know did they see you you know did

191
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:55,939
they see you as your achievements did

192
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:59,720
they see you as be careful of your

193
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:01,580
achievements you know did they how did

194
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:10,280
they see you how did they see you in

195
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:15,680
relation to your gifts education how

196
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:24,860
many of you had issues with your

197
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:29,290
educational experience so significant

198
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:29,290
number you know her handouts here a few

199
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,240
we're on page one

200
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:53,240
so education I mean there are there are

201
00:13:48,620 --> 00:14:03,829
lots of there are lots of extremely

202
00:13:53,240 --> 00:14:06,680
intelligent my name's there are lots of

203
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:10,699
people who could you know who could take

204
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:15,649
the education with their abilities and

205
00:14:10,699 --> 00:14:20,449
just run with it and then there are lots

206
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:23,930
of people whose well my daughter my

207
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:26,139
daughter my daughter helped me get into

208
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:31,880
all of this

209
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:37,570
she read at 20 months and had issues

210
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:40,850
with global injustice by the age of 2 3

211
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:43,790
and went by the time and by the time she

212
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:46,790
was in the third grade they were giving

213
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:51,380
her the time for math tests and she

214
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:53,269
could do algebra at that point and she

215
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:55,760
was staring out the window she had done

216
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:58,519
two problems of the thing and the

217
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:02,120
teacher said to her me I know you know

218
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:03,529
this stuff and what happened and she

219
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,160
looked at the teacher she goes I don't

220
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:10,970
know my mind has a mind of its own and I

221
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:14,870
mean that one tends to be one of the

222
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:18,810
bigger problems it's like all of you

223
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:21,900
people must have really

224
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:26,609
really beautiful minds if you'll excuse

225
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:30,329
my prejudice towards you all and those

226
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:33,390
minds are powerful I mean how many of

227
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:35,580
you have experienced that if you really

228
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:37,620
want to learn about something or if

229
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:40,580
you're really thinking about something

230
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:43,770
if it's really important to you that

231
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:48,810
it's powerful how many of you guys

232
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:51,870
experience that yeah that's not true for

233
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:56,010
everybody there are some people who are

234
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:58,460
really happy to master and organize the

235
00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:04,850
body of knowledge that's talk to them

236
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:07,560
but there are also people who are very

237
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:10,670
intense and passionate about what their

238
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:14,880
intense and passionate about and that

239
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:17,520
that creates that creates a whole ball

240
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:21,630
of wax I don't even know where to start

241
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:25,949
with that one of those another thing

242
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:31,740
that often goes along with with

243
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:34,830
education issues is perfectionism people

244
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:39,260
who oftentimes people who whose minds

245
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:42,510
are very powerful can imagine

246
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:48,020
perfectionism I mean if you look at some

247
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:51,540
of the people who have really really

248
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:53,569
excelled in their fields you know I mean

249
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:58,770
you kind of need that whether you're

250
00:16:53,570 --> 00:17:01,290
Baryshnikov or Van Gogh or Einstein I

251
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:04,459
mean you kind of need that but it also

252
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:07,459
is the problem because it doesn't exist

253
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:07,459
so

254
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:19,609
so that I you know I remember my son at

255
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:23,689
age three he he was very artistic and he

256
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:28,969
could picture in his mind what he wanted

257
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:32,000
to draw but he couldn't do it in the

258
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:38,000
first five seconds you know so here he

259
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:41,090
has mental artistic picture that is 20

260
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,880
years old probably and he has the

261
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:50,510
patience skills and the fine motor

262
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:53,900
skills of a three-year-old so a lot of

263
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:58,250
that perfectionism can really become an

264
00:17:53,900 --> 00:18:00,710
issue and it can get jammed up at an

265
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:04,160
early age in a way that makes people

266
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:07,070
really hard on themselves and also makes

267
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:16,960
them afraid to try because they can't

268
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:16,960
achieve what they can see education

269
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:27,080
this one was this one I person who's

270
00:18:23,389 --> 00:18:31,090
taking care of my dog when I said what I

271
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:36,320
was doing she said that her son says I

272
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:42,309
am a geek on Monday I am a nerd on

273
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:47,629
Wednesday and I am a loser on Friday and

274
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:50,360
when we talked about it more it was like

275
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:58,460
you're a loser on Friday because now

276
00:18:50,360 --> 00:19:04,969
it's the weekend but I think that a lot

277
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:11,360
of people who were very intelligent felt

278
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:15,409
alienation and isolation as a result of

279
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:18,979
their differences and there in goes the

280
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:21,140
empathy we'll come back to

281
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:25,480
[Music]

282
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:30,350
oh here another one another one from

283
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:34,220
education is unchallenged what happens

284
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:36,949
to people if like if you're profoundly

285
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:39,410
gifted five standard deviations from the

286
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:41,660
norm you'll earn sixteen times faster

287
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:45,010
than the average person you're sitting

288
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:49,160
in the classroom for the average person

289
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:54,860
fifteen sixteen of the time you are

290
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:57,710
dormant I have I had a friend who did

291
00:19:54,860 --> 00:20:00,469
this whole presentation based on a

292
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,250
cheetah which is the fastest running

293
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:04,309
animal

294
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:08,929
it runs 70 miles an hour designed to run

295
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:11,410
70 miles an hour in short bursts and it

296
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:15,559
has the challenge of chasing antelopes

297
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:18,230
so what happens to a cheetah if it's put

298
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:21,610
in a zoo is it still a cheetah it

299
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:27,200
doesn't get to run 70 miles an hour but

300
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:30,110
in this case it's like what happens if

301
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:33,799
you don't get to use what you've got at

302
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:37,399
your speed how do you adapt and how do

303
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:40,629
you know what that speed is so you

304
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:45,049
either do your speed over here and

305
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:48,130
disconnect or you disconnect from

306
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:52,090
yourself to an extent

307
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:56,020
so under challenged I think it's a huge

308
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:58,000
one and and then what happens when you

309
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:02,200
get out of school and you wake up and

310
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,150
you realize ya might get this later but

311
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:08,380
could also lead to resenting people who

312
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:10,260
hold you back yes there in both the

313
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:14,410
empathy which is what was it yes

314
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:14,410
[Music]

315
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:25,149
intellectual precocity well business

316
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:28,720
this is pretty much in charge let's go

317
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:32,230
to asynchrony asynchrony I sort of was

318
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:37,240
talking about before when I was talking

319
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:39,190
about the three-year-old who can see who

320
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,929
can see the artists picture of a 20 year

321
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:44,950
old that only has the skills of a

322
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:49,809
three-year-old this asynchrony means

323
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:53,100
uneven development and I think that the

324
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:56,950
more intelligent you are the more

325
00:21:53,100 --> 00:22:02,740
imbalanced is you know the greater the

326
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:05,500
disparity of the asynchrony and it's in

327
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:09,850
all different areas and one of the

328
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:13,539
problems is with finding peers and

329
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:17,439
friends is that everybody's asynchrony

330
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:19,510
is different so you know you might be

331
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,429
really brilliant and your friend might

332
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:24,010
be really brilliant but you might be

333
00:22:21,429 --> 00:22:27,429
very brilliant there are different ways

334
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:30,400
and you might recognize the energy of

335
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:32,860
that but you might be interested in very

336
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:36,940
different things the other problem with

337
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:41,370
it is that if you are very brilliant

338
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:47,340
people expect you to be very mature

339
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:49,679
and that is not necessarily so or you

340
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:51,809
may be very mature and that may be the

341
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:55,860
thing that you care about you may be

342
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:58,670
that person that is looking at what's

343
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:01,199
going on around the room between people

344
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:03,870
instead of paying attention to what the

345
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:07,970
subject is you know you may be looking

346
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:11,370
at the dynamics even if you're here in

347
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:13,770
the tech field you know you may have

348
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:16,199
originally been looking around that's

349
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:18,929
dynamic you may be look under dynamics

350
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,000
and be interested in the tech field you

351
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:29,850
may be interested in the dynamics across

352
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:33,770
the board so asynchrony plays out a lot

353
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:40,678
another way that it plays out is that

354
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:43,559
you have a synchrony with your peers you

355
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:46,440
feel out of sync with the people around

356
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:50,790
you when you're in school potentially

357
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:53,940
you have a synchrony with the society if

358
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:57,030
you care about things I mean a lot of

359
00:23:53,940 --> 00:24:00,550
the people in this room are in the field

360
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:08,440
of protection correct

361
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:13,690
I mean you know like how many how long

362
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:19,450
did you care about protection is that

363
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:21,400
old for most of you it's that true for

364
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:25,120
most people that that that was like a

365
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:29,020
focus forever cuz that's it that's a

366
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:32,320
deep that's kind of a deep thing you

367
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:35,970
know it's like when in school did they

368
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,919
get around to talking about protection

369
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:42,640
you know and did it come from

370
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:47,260
feeling unsafe yourself and if so how

371
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:51,750
and how amazing is it that if it did

372
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:56,410
that you took that and did this with it

373
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:58,180
you know I think that is I mean as you

374
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:01,870
know as somebody from a very different

375
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:05,550
field I feel very honored to be standing

376
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:08,750
here with all of you people who are

377
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:11,370
trying to protect us

378
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:13,890
[Music]

379
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:21,030
and I think you know the whole empathy

380
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:25,980
thing I mean it's like it says like to

381
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:29,370
go from the arc of having felt unsafe to

382
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:32,490
trying to protect what we're doing with

383
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:35,250
the empathy in this particular workshop

384
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:38,610
is kind of the same thing it's kind of

385
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:44,360
the same idea is taking wherever you are

386
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:47,070
with it and growing it to a place that's

387
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:54,169
where you want it where you ultimately

388
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:56,629
will want it to be okay so sensitivity

389
00:25:54,170 --> 00:26:01,309
and intensity

390
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:01,309
turn to page

391
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:16,299
turn to the page that says overexcite

392
00:26:11,659 --> 00:26:16,299
abilities at the top of it

393
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:31,929
did you all find that this is an

394
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:36,550
interesting theory that I came upon when

395
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:40,810
I was doing the work with extremely

396
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:44,740
gifted children and adults was this

397
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:48,280
notion of over excitability there is

398
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:53,260
this theorist called Dobrowski who has

399
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:58,510
this whole theory of emotional

400
00:26:53,260 --> 00:27:05,379
development and moral development and he

401
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:10,990
starts with this idea that people who

402
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:15,460
are extremely intelligent tend to have

403
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:21,490
what most people in our society would

404
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:25,810
call too much of a good thing and when I

405
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:29,470
was a child my adaptation of going

406
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:33,480
through school was and it was my

407
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:38,470
father's as well you questions

408
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:45,930
everything you question every injustice

409
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:48,970
you question every limitation you expand

410
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:51,940
everything anything you know you be that

411
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:55,860
gadfly of society you be that person

412
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:58,770
that you know and it's it

413
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:00,740
it's kind of an imbalance stance and it

414
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:04,290
was definitely a defense mechanism

415
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:06,600
because when I was little I was

416
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:08,760
questioning what was there when there

417
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:12,800
was nothing when I was four I was

418
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:16,890
running around the neighborhood asking

419
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:20,010
the parents and all the kids what was

420
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:22,830
there there was nothing I was awake for

421
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:25,440
two weeks trying to close my eyes and

422
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:28,199
expand my mind around the concept of

423
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:31,520
space and time to figure out what was

424
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:37,220
there when there was nothing and I got

425
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:41,129
as you can well imagine you know just

426
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:41,670
the major brush-off everywhere except at

427
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,470
home

428
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:48,030
which is pretty cool that at least I had

429
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:51,120
that but by the time I graduated high

430
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:54,270
school my definition of myself was

431
00:28:51,120 --> 00:29:03,139
somebody who had an insatiable need for

432
00:28:54,270 --> 00:29:07,830
attention and was very contrary and very

433
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:11,490
aggressive and then had my daughter and

434
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:17,330
then I got into this stuff and then I

435
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:20,140
saw this list and when I saw this list I

436
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:24,428
cried for a week

437
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:26,830
because that whole definition of always

438
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:30,880
feeling like I was too much it's like

439
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:34,720
okay now 36 years old and I'm finding

440
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:40,179
out it was a good thing this is a good

441
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:48,040
thing like how many people look at this

442
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:52,679
list and relate to any of it yes yes

443
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:57,159
that's the that is the asynchrony

444
00:29:52,679 --> 00:30:02,169
everybody who's got it has got it in

445
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:05,410
some areas and not others very few

446
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:10,419
people have it in all areas the areas

447
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:13,660
that you have it in are probably you

448
00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:16,120
know are the areas of your authentic

449
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:25,510
self or the areas of your strengths are

450
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:27,370
the areas to sink your teeth into does

451
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:29,850
everybody feel like they have it in some

452
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:29,850
areas

453
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:38,230
does it feel it does also does everybody

454
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:58,480
feel like they haven't always felt good

455
00:30:38,230 --> 00:31:01,080
about some of that stuff yes of course

456
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,080
you wouldn't

457
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:12,270
what I mean by that I don't you know for

458
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:17,650
me it's kind of a it's kind of a

459
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:19,990
superfluous label I mean this is this

460
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:22,450
stuff is kind of what I'm trying to

461
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:25,120
preset is kind of an alternative yes

462
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:27,100
Josh we anticipated some people might

463
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,899
feel that way we shouldn't assume every

464
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:31,929
single person InfoSec is profoundly

465
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:33,340
gifted in founded I think what was more

466
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:35,290
striking when we were designing this

467
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:37,300
over a year ago was whether or not

468
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:40,210
that's your cause for some of these

469
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:42,909
things we share a lot of demographic and

470
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:45,340
personality traits and deficits with

471
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:47,230
empathy so even if there's any patterns

472
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:49,179
we can take regardless if you didn't

473
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:50,410
think this fits you or not having known

474
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,940
several people in this room we have

475
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:53,800
quite a few we'll probably get two votes

476
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:57,800
that are not diagnosed through other

477
00:31:53,800 --> 00:32:00,178
elements of this there's

478
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:02,950
[Music]

479
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:05,679
and I think you know I think that whole

480
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:07,750
thing is just I mean this is kind of an

481
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:15,340
alternative to that I mean I think that

482
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:18,040
that's it's kind of my what I do as a

483
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:22,530
therapist the reason why I went into it

484
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:27,790
was to help people to find their own

485
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:31,918
authentic self putting a label on it of

486
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:36,309
some sort or not is in my opinion really

487
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:41,130
irrelevant I mean I think that the

488
00:32:36,309 --> 00:32:50,830
biodiversity is obviously necessary for

489
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:54,280
organic anything so I I'm not I I don't

490
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:58,299
really use the the gifted label what I

491
00:32:54,280 --> 00:33:00,190
used is find out you know what kind of a

492
00:32:58,299 --> 00:33:02,830
plant you are find out what kind of an

493
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:08,530
animal you are you know take bits and

494
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:11,139
pieces from everything and you know use

495
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:15,760
what you've got be who you are you know

496
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:20,140
and it's more about for me it's more

497
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:22,419
about that so I in through that door but

498
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:24,280
you know I also come in through the door

499
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:26,110
being an artist I've come in through the

500
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:28,240
door being a scientist I've come in

501
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:31,418
through the door being an educator you

502
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,940
know I'm kind of a jackass of all trades

503
00:33:31,419 --> 00:33:37,859
mistress of none

504
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:42,690
so that's sort of where that comes from

505
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:45,379
so these these overexcite abilities are

506
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:52,169
[Music]

507
00:33:45,379 --> 00:33:55,590
our potential their potential and if any

508
00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:58,220
of them are ones that you used to

509
00:33:55,590 --> 00:34:04,228
possess that you don't possess anymore

510
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:15,359
then they're part of maybe what needs to

511
00:34:04,229 --> 00:34:18,210
be reconnected really wow I hope this is

512
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:20,879
making sense I've put together so many

513
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:25,549
disparate pieces to try and paint a

514
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:25,549
picture so

515
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:42,699
the next one is society how do you

516
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:51,760
relate to society I mean I think as

517
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:55,159
protectors you obviously care and are

518
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:59,050
very very connected to some of the

519
00:34:55,159 --> 00:35:07,000
problems that we're having right now in

520
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:10,910
society I would imagine them the justice

521
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:16,750
issue is huge for most of you - most of

522
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:23,569
you feel pretty strongly about justice

523
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:32,330
yeah and and that and that must I mean

524
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:36,700
that do you feel like a do you feel like

525
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:36,700
a normal member of society

526
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:51,299
right right do you feel well let me ask

527
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:53,250
I mean I guess why so many questions had

528
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,230
more questions that I have things to say

529
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:58,200
but I guess part of it will be in nee

530
00:35:55,230 --> 00:36:01,440
there's an experiential part that maybe

531
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:05,250
will answer that do you feel like

532
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:08,070
there's a place for you in society it's

533
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:13,290
kind of do you feel like you understand

534
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:14,460
your place in society but I think one of

535
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:16,230
the reasons we spent so much time with

536
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:19,920
each other before the closest thing we

537
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:21,510
have to appear her mm-hmm and we all

538
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,930
start very nasty to each other we're

539
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:26,940
prepared in we're destructive or a

540
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:29,520
cynical we find what's wrong with

541
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:31,950
something so I think it's a combination

542
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,869
of both we spend a lot of time with each

543
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:36,450
other

544
00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:39,000
I'll be with a swamp garter is that

545
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:42,319
consistent you have like negative

546
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,240
outcomes of some of these yeah yeah yeah

547
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,930
it seems to me part of us being nasty to

548
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:52,370
each other

549
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:52,370
[Music]

550
00:36:55,430 --> 00:37:00,989
[Music]

551
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:08,610
yeah but those of you who were just

552
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:18,450
coming in their handouts that will be

553
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:22,730
helpful okay but you were not so you

554
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:26,430
know your relationship to society is oh

555
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:34,940
it's interesting where I am

556
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:40,259
oh here's another one from society I

557
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:41,880
would imagine that a lot of you have and

558
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:45,450
this and this is something you just

559
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:52,220
brought up from within but also from

560
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:56,669
without jealousy I would imagine that

561
00:37:52,220 --> 00:38:00,629
some of you have experience of people

562
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:04,470
being jealous of your abilities and also

563
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:08,280
a fear of people being jealous of your

564
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:11,759
abilities you know like a need to hide

565
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:15,690
in some ways or a need to come on strong

566
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,850
I mean I think that's you know depending

567
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:23,250
on how people do it I mean I think a lot

568
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:25,230
of that sparring is like okay it's never

569
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:29,150
felt safe for me to let down my guard

570
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:33,200
and be you know the

571
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:35,059
more tender side of Who I am so I'm

572
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,430
gonna just like take this and shove it

573
00:38:35,059 --> 00:38:43,059
down your throat I mean that was

574
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:47,558
basically my approach but and then

575
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:51,619
expectations I mean I would imagine as

576
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:54,859
people who see themselves as protectors

577
00:38:51,619 --> 00:39:01,849
you have very high expectations of

578
00:38:54,859 --> 00:39:04,970
yourselves and that you know that that

579
00:39:01,849 --> 00:39:08,690
that that you found that from other

580
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:11,990
people as well and again that goes back

581
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:15,319
to that perfectionism and how can you I

582
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:17,209
mean I think that empathy I think it's

583
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:18,980
very hard to have empathy for other

584
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:23,660
people if you don't have empathy for

585
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:28,490
yourself and I think that I would

586
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:31,098
imagine that that is that also might be

587
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:35,160
hard for some of the people in this room

588
00:39:31,099 --> 00:39:39,080
is to have real empathy for themselves

589
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:39,080
you know to have that or

590
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:50,259
gentle not not gentle as in you get a

591
00:39:44,829 --> 00:39:54,119
path but gentle as in you're human

592
00:39:50,259 --> 00:39:58,149
you're not flawless you know you're

593
00:39:54,119 --> 00:40:00,759
whatever you do is going to have flaws

594
00:39:58,149 --> 00:40:02,169
it's not going to be where you want it

595
00:40:00,759 --> 00:40:05,439
to be it's not gonna be what you see

596
00:40:02,169 --> 00:40:09,308
it's going to be that next step we were

597
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:11,439
talking about that at lunch yes one way

598
00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:14,289
the society thing manifests for me is

599
00:40:11,439 --> 00:40:16,449
just this great quote from George

600
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:18,269
Bernard Shaw says the reasonable man

601
00:40:16,449 --> 00:40:20,139
important himself to the world

602
00:40:18,269 --> 00:40:22,749
unreasonable man expects the world

603
00:40:20,139 --> 00:40:25,059
didn't form to him that's why all

604
00:40:22,749 --> 00:40:28,328
progress is dependent on the

605
00:40:25,059 --> 00:40:30,909
unreasonable man now I don't know why I

606
00:40:28,329 --> 00:40:32,879
was drawn to be unreasonable and they

607
00:40:30,909 --> 00:40:36,369
may not be the same for all of you but

608
00:40:32,879 --> 00:40:39,279
there's a tremendous amount of inherent

609
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:42,669
a package deal choosing that path to the

610
00:40:39,279 --> 00:40:44,439
bucket status quo is going to put you at

611
00:40:42,669 --> 00:40:48,060
odds with people who like the status quo

612
00:40:44,439 --> 00:40:49,799
or is going to

613
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:52,320
added the dimension to your

614
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:54,390
relationships about during your helping

615
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,520
fewer not helping even so it's an

616
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:59,370
occupational hazard if that's how you

617
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:01,800
manifest but I've always identified with

618
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:05,609
that notion that sass quo is not okay

619
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:07,830
and if you're trying to impressively

620
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:11,280
change that it can natal eat your chips

621
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:27,140
or come with a whole bunch of other

622
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:31,820
secondary effects sense of aloneness I I

623
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:34,560
remember being at one conference where

624
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:38,400
there was this guy who was the keynote

625
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:41,940
speaker his name was Feldman and he

626
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,070
studied prodigies and he was standing up

627
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:47,100
there I'm sitting in the audience he's

628
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:51,180
standing up there and he studied

629
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:54,630
prodigies he did not identify himself as

630
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:58,649
an extremely intelligent person he just

631
00:41:54,630 --> 00:42:01,680
studied prodigies and he said he

632
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:03,510
remembers one night when he was a kid he

633
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:07,200
was like looking out at the night sky

634
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:10,950
and he was looking out at the Stars and

635
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,509
he said he imagined himself you know

636
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:15,149
it's one of those stars and then he

637
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:19,500
imagined himself further out further out

638
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:22,980
and further out and then he said and

639
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:26,850
then I looked back and he said and I

640
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:31,070
realized that that's the way I feel a

641
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:33,720
lot of the time and then his face went

642
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:37,140
completely blank had in his

643
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:42,419
and he he looked absolutely terrified

644
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:45,960
he walked himself into a moment where he

645
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:50,370
felt all alone because he felt so far

646
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:54,450
out there and he didn't mean to go there

647
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:56,160
and I was sitting next to somebody who

648
00:42:54,450 --> 00:43:00,540
was a real mentor to me the cheetah

649
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:05,279
woman and she and I both started crying

650
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:08,360
and I didn't you know I didn't identify

651
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:12,900
myself as such a person at that point I

652
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:17,400
identified myself as when my daughter's

653
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:18,960
mother who was trying to help her I'm

654
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:27,000
like oh

655
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:32,880
excuse my French oh no and I think that

656
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:37,500
a lot of the people who really decide

657
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:40,800
that they are going to hold on to their

658
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:45,630
intellect and I think that many of the

659
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:53,630
people in this room would probably fall

660
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:56,300
into that category let go or let go of

661
00:43:53,630 --> 00:44:00,510
some of their connection to their

662
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:04,140
emotional self and they also formed a

663
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:06,570
lot of beliefs because people in you

664
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:10,830
know people who can really think as

665
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:13,869
children will come up with reasons for

666
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:20,680
why this is so

667
00:44:13,869 --> 00:44:23,950
it's like I remember I remember I

668
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:25,078
dropped out of school in first grade

669
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:28,960
[Music]

670
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:31,089
emotionally I was sitting at my desk and

671
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,099
they had a group of people up in the

672
00:44:31,089 --> 00:44:39,540
front who are learning the binary system

673
00:44:33,099 --> 00:44:43,150
and I loved math I mean I could I I

674
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:44,799
could do I could do lots of math at that

675
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:46,690
age and I loved math I loved the

676
00:44:44,799 --> 00:44:49,900
patterns I loved the numbers I love the

677
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:51,819
you know like that it was a language

678
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:56,230
like was a language of everything was a

679
00:44:51,819 --> 00:44:58,119
language under everything and and I got

680
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:59,890
C's in math because they just kept

681
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:01,780
giving us addition problems and more

682
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:05,109
addition probably some more additional

683
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:07,690
problems and I learned to read and do

684
00:45:05,109 --> 00:45:11,440
math with my head on the desk because I

685
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:14,619
was so bored and depressed that I would

686
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:17,380
like to sit there like this and I raised

687
00:45:14,619 --> 00:45:19,569
my hand and I said can I can I do that

688
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:23,920
can I be part of the advanced math group

689
00:45:19,569 --> 00:45:25,540
this fourth grade and and I said I know

690
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,549
how to do it I've been watching you I

691
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:30,009
know how to do what you're doing it's

692
00:45:27,549 --> 00:45:34,660
really cool and after that you can do

693
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:37,300
this and my teacher said to me you get

694
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:39,399
C's you sit down

695
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:42,190
and she said it like right in front of

696
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:48,460
the whole class and what I did with that

697
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:51,250
was okay all the school is never going

698
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:53,350
to work with for me this problem this

699
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:56,340
problem is going to dog me for the rest

700
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:59,589
of my life there's no point in me trying

701
00:45:56,340 --> 00:46:02,710
you know I made a dispossession section

702
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:09,810
last session decision second decision

703
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:13,780
and that was that and with this group

704
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:15,279
those those things those split-second

705
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:20,850
decisions and they're different for

706
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:26,320
everybody are the ones that are related

707
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:30,040
to the loss of connection the loss of

708
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:32,530
what's called the soft part either the

709
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:35,550
soft what is it the soft subjects the

710
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:39,160
soft customers soft skills thank you

711
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:43,810
those are related to the soft skills for

712
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:45,910
these people I can't son with myself

713
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:50,380
because I've kept more of my soft skills

714
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:53,920
and I kept my other ones but but from

715
00:46:50,380 --> 00:47:00,120
this room I think that it's probably

716
00:46:53,920 --> 00:47:00,120
pretty much the reverse in a lot of ways

717
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:17,980
remember at a time what I think I would

718
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:29,890
like to do is go to I'm gonna go to the

719
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:32,160
page of the questions and thank you so

720
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:32,160
much

721
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:37,430
so good

722
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:47,970
and so what I what I just did is I just

723
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:55,600
combined original child with

724
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:59,169
ramifications in a very slightly under

725
00:47:55,600 --> 00:48:01,830
drawn way and I apologize for that I

726
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:06,370
thought I wouldn't have enough material

727
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:13,170
these questions are questions that

728
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:20,319
pertain to your personal experience of

729
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:25,960
what I just crammed 63 years of

730
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:28,210
knowledge into an hour they relate to

731
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:32,950
the personal law your personal

732
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:39,040
experience of it and what I wanted to do

733
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:43,810
is have you take notes on these

734
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:48,490
questions for yourself and you you can

735
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:52,390
do it in one of two ways one way is to

736
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:56,459
actually do your own the other way is to

737
00:48:52,390 --> 00:49:01,020
look at it theoretically if it feels a

738
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:04,900
irrelevant to look at it on your own

739
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:08,380
fine do it theoretically if it feels too

740
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:11,280
much if it's like too close to home for

741
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:13,560
you to do it on your home on your own

742
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:16,950
do it theoretically good for some person

743
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:20,340
that fits this profile that I'm talking

744
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:24,720
about and what I'm gonna do after you do

745
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:29,010
it is have people get into groups of

746
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:32,058
five and discuss it yes

747
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:32,059
[Music]

748
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:45,239
[Music]

749
00:49:52,610 --> 00:50:02,540
is that does this feel useful to look at

750
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:02,540
these questions to people

751
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:23,180
do you all have pens if you want to take

752
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:26,540
notes does anybody need a pen to me was

753
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:29,529
he said that we learn empathy as kids by

754
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:32,529
hearing our peers be feared by our peers

755
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:35,060
because we didn't have many male peers

756
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:36,860
and they were maybe never even built

757
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:42,110
those muscles the image that I get that

758
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:52,880
wrong or that really yeah are we going

759
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:55,420
to that okay probably even more

760
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,420
important

761
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:02,399
[Music]

762
00:51:05,569 --> 00:51:08,569
10

763
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:15,109
look at that one more

764
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:32,710
here I think I have another one over

765
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:32,710
here I can't use one of my great boss

766
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:49,310
exactly totally use your non-dominant

767
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:51,410
hand too don't really do it see I have

768
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:56,259
one more pen if anybody else needs one

769
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:56,259
anybody else need a pen here
