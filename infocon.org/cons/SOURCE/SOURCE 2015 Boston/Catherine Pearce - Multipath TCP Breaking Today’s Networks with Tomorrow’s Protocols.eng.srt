1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,899
so I'm somewhat cynical I'm still up

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:06,199
there actually read RFC's unlike most

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:08,610
people have seen to the planet now oh

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,830
and my colleague Patrick Thomas ruse

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,629
bubble point is also disappearing so

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,719
unknown reason there's another security

7
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,000
consultant histah and the excess through

8
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,189
the net rotation security focus I have a

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,830
focus on are focusing our users

10
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:43,910
vigilance with bullets they are

11
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:43,910
appearing here alright so you know this

12
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:36,770
is basically the interesting from 65

13
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,780
one of the TCP stream that we won we

14
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:50,330
school for sports that it doesn't appear

15
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:53,510
upon the TCP stream which is really

16
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:55,490
quite awful because again we store it so

17
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:57,740
why don't they see it this makes

18
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,990
absolutely no sense but this is where I

19
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:04,970
take my coat aluminium this makes no

20
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:13,120
sense at all so that's a very simple

21
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:16,100
example how changes and it's worked

22
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,990
before you can read about some changes

23
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:20,540
with understand what was the motivation

24
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:23,020
for someone who just bought wrote an RFC

25
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:25,190
or whether some actual motivations might

26
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:31,280
technology reasons for doing this and

27
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:33,829
turns out there actually were it doesn't

28
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,480
use places I have an ability protect me

29
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:37,880
well people in novels and other

30
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,220
solutions to do that and also pretty

31
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:43,100
doesn't it does not help litigation

32
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:45,080
level if you have fired one big of at

33
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,420
least you haven't might one day be good

34
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:51,620
at lunch you cannot ever get in with TCP

35
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:53,268
alarm which is the other problem is we

36
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,250
get twelve happening to happen with our

37
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:58,160
work because you also can't multi-line

38
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,709
there multiple addresses you can't use

39
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,920
them in the same connection and

40
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:06,500
Commission it work it's just we don't

41
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,208
write their report easy dinner with fix

42
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,610
it should like fix aluminum networks and

43
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:12,130
insisted equal cost multi parking up

44
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:15,459
there just makes things interesting

45
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,459
should we say

46
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,780
no breakfast extends TCP to add some of

47
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,040
the functionality assembler speeches

48
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:30,790
artists the literature it works over

49
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,548
existing infrastructure is it is T it is

50
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:36,459
no companies hedonism sorry why the

51
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:41,590
moment but it is normal TCP with the

52
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:43,510
bonus nothing understandable

53
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,569
it looks like TCP and quacks like TCP

54
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,980
but it's actually a goose that really

55
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:50,939
doesn't make any sense if you come to

56
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,939
work with your existing assumptions

57
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,959
especially with security tools as

58
00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:00,340
security tools that bugs me to the

59
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:03,790
program the way that trust pertinent in

60
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:06,700
the Sutpen 1950 AllSaints into any

61
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:09,578
mutation resistant I believe it is very

62
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:12,099
speak to them talk if your security

63
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:14,049
tools trying to speak or modifier it is

64
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:18,728
practically invited me to trust normally

65
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:20,289
it's between now you could have begin to

66
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:21,659
get as no longer what we started with

67
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:24,940
the next time

68
00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:27,250
the first victim the protocol was not

69
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:31,479
designed security tools in mind as we

70
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:33,520
use them to be clear but badly see

71
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:36,580
failures have really really complain I

72
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:42,340
really do want to succeed I really like

73
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:44,440
it but we're not ready so if you it's

74
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,900
great but you can change the traces you

75
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,370
can imitate addresses nothing drops out

76
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,320
as you switch between Wi-Fi and cellular

77
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,060
trying to beat you know why anyone was

78
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,880
dropping in there your connections don't

79
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:57,720
completely fail they just work produced

80
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,719
a certificate that's wonderful that's

81
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,720
wonderful

82
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:05,250
but if you're coming in as a security

83
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,929
professional as a nuclear security

84
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,610
operation Tyrion

85
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:10,020
you only if we didn't maybe patrolling

86
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:13,440
with them this is going to be a

87
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:18,630
nightmare absolutely so that's a

88
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:21,539
background thinking about this and I

89
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:24,900
this recipe uses so few people probably

90
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:26,639
do I get across the page which led to

91
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,638
another clinic to another one on our

92
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,470
number anyway and then look all the

93
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:34,440
media attention including you know

94
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:36,690
registered doing this thing but after

95
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:43,800
their that was really strange weapon

96
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:46,169
that was exactly this silence was

97
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,690
exactly now we had fundamental changes

98
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:49,469
to a major protocol that the

99
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:53,250
infrastructure of the world that begins

100
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:54,449
upon no one was talking about and not

101
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,919
only were these changes occurring when

102
00:05:54,449 --> 00:06:01,860
happening fast that would be ever seen

103
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:05,639
before and I was talking about however

104
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:08,220
he never got a security the researchers

105
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,590
developers did a really good job a lot

106
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,229
of work north Rick rolls and the

107
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:15,859
philatelic has some issues but given

108
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:17,849
their goals there was a really good job

109
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,260
but it's not around here to talk about

110
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:21,630
I'm not here to talk about the thing

111
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:24,150
itself as much as you may think I'm here

112
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,860
to talk about the things around it the

113
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,690
security environment the raspberry pi

114
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,409
earned the infrastructure that depends

115
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:35,000
upon TCP acting as it went hence debt is

116
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:35,000
what was not nearly up there now

117
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:40,940
in a day that's what decision is about

118
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:43,700
what cannot be passed ACP was it may be

119
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:46,010
security today and what could it could

120
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,870
end our similar technology mean anything

121
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:50,150
further with one of these technologies

122
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:52,850
is rights produced whether this work

123
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:54,280
something else we have to change the

124
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:57,220
light into things

125
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,719
so far this talk is about multiple TCP

126
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:02,240
that is not the tank money the takeaway

127
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,740
is help that this thing is a problem the

128
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,560
takeaways should be that as soon as we

129
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,240
start splitting traffic on across

130
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,520
palaces tsutsu status and mobility

131
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,210
proclaim the currently work security

132
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,979
approaches begin to struggle India

133
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,799
because this was recently a couple of

134
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:21,050
proof of confidence in tools and

135
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,150
technical details well which I know

136
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,650
they're going to be given at time so

137
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,539
that was the real high level bedroom

138
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:31,630
moving into a technical interaction

139
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:36,470
motapod PCP this is an addition to TCP

140
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:39,320
the TCP the fundamental transmission

141
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:41,510
program that we all use with more than

142
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,760
they were communications has an IP

143
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:48,830
Airport one end and not the airport the

144
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:53,930
other that is not post to host that is

145
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:56,180
interface to interface in the past that

146
00:07:53,930 --> 00:08:02,690
is not measured but now have been is a

147
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:07,610
lot because suddenly one host has mobile

148
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:09,500
interfaces as mobile paths and the

149
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,960
presumptions we've had intimated first

150
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,820
first that are the same thing of a go

151
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:17,570
stopped reading on their way I may be

152
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:19,130
sixth of service but we hit delivery so

153
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:21,950
among compared disappear connection is

154
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:24,320
to find magnet unity this never sit

155
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:26,060

00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:30,380
cryptographically calculate understand

158
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,049

house transitive

160
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:40,380
what multipath TCP is and they say from

161
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:42,570
ionic strength up to the option still of

162
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:45,960
TCP to the internet which you can

163
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:49,020
aggregate associate multiple multiple

clip as what is it

166
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:56,939
they have stretching land on top of TCP

167
00:08:53,510 --> 00:09:00,660
that have stretched you away from it for

168
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:04,730
interfacing agents today we depend

169
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,730
localized that helps is diamond Atlantic

170
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:08,520
now they decide that these particular

171
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,800
things in mind the designed to the deck

172
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,990
it's compatible so that they didn't have

173
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,819
to read vidiians SCTP it's big

174
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:17,280
advantages in some of this stuff

175
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,870
however in DeBary took offer to crooked

176
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,060
the neighborhood things outside of

177
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,650
students faces whose backwards

178
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,239
compatibility medicine or mr. rip had

179
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:26,640
their infrastructure first thing that

180
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,950
now man take off backwards compatibility

181
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,360
is and this is a way it goes to

182
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,860
preventive instruction to summon their

183
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,870
ruins near existing systems the

184
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,390
performance has to be a bit of a noun or

185
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:40,800
at least as good it can be no worse than

186
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:42,720
now and of course the security has to be

187
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,030
less than or equal to now and in the

188
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:50,100
past that cost be historic well you know

189
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:52,110
with wider global privacy yeah but the

190
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,550
principal said when you're trying to

191
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:57,570
replace something you should be no worse

192
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:59,140
than it to get to give you a simple

193
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:01,810
example

194
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:04,630
let's bring up a picture so here we have

195
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:08,380
the prediction each wins alright then

196
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:10,420
this is Miss Pikachu c'mon participation

197
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:15,279
we'd never spun we planted this

198
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:18,449
objectively the same okay so there's

199
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:23,439
even one equation similar to this

200
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:28,029
lecture we're going to see can they work

201
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:30,490
out and city nation that entire thing is

202
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:32,760
a multi practice is the connection to

203
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:37,560
TCP things who stretched either

204
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:42,579
associated to give you one night and

205
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:44,229
across one clap you don't just have to

206
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:47,279
break one to the power to break up

207
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:49,690
review which any combination you like

208
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,880
and you can make the data for salinity

209
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:54,550
common actually like to copy to that in

210
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:57,339
a moment because the sinner with a

211
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:59,680
packet this who chooses where the day

212
00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:03,399
was meant to with a dinner seat there

213
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,019
was no protocol rather logistic patrol

214
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:08,050
this is an entire row of the

215
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:12,040
implementation the implementation

216
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:13,959
decides what was with and because it

217
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,399
says design resilient that in each

218
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:20,040
substitute of those connections drops

219
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:22,209
and one remains open publication status

220
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,160
it's designed to be resilient which is

221
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:25,750
really good for usability in so the

222
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,310
business box was they did a terrifying

223
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:31,269
of the 20 top in took the highway with

224
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:34,540
your ideas because not only can you

225
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:37,900
continue I like Uganda the random and

226
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:40,420
that's the rotations and hold the state

227
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:42,630
close so you can reach you in a

228
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:47,949
connection after some period of time

229
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:51,220
even including it is designed to be risk

230
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:52,540
than it seemed describing kind of

231
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,070
evidence so I say it wasn't tasty at the

232
00:11:52,540 --> 00:12:01,750
auction and to bring it up with one of

233
00:11:54,070 --> 00:12:03,820
these standard protocol by advance this

234
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:07,270
cookie to be serviced additional options

235
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:08,560
here and then I'm sincere Tyler the most

236
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:10,750
left needs to be a given

237
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,760
that's what this is for this and also

238
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:17,080
you bolted on to bring this wonderful

239
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:21,000
functionally they're gonna read and you

240
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,000
don't stop watching after we do that

241
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:34,150
right multi-party see if will not read a

242
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,280
single data across local streams but

243
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:39,880
whom they agreed to dinner I thought

244
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:41,230
that anyway is a pack three weeks of my

245
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,880
life I'm never eating an egg try figure

246
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,880
in the cheeks I'm Brock

247
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:52,510
but worse that they have any visitors

248
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:54,670
music with what school subtypes so you

249
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:57,100
have an option and with an action in

250
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:59,650
history other plans initiative to do

251
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:02,710
particular operations those are subjects

252
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:05,130
so first one of the eight that are

253
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,130
currently defined

254
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:10,809
who's gonna get the nectar the 8th of

255
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:14,619
the curve defined more palpable that my

256
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:16,149
ex's I suppose that's what does and this

257
00:13:14,619 --> 00:13:17,739
joint sir

258
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:19,509
if you want to have more competition set

259
00:13:17,739 --> 00:13:22,299
up you can see that another connection

260
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:24,339
with a joiner wrist say I want to try

261
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:27,309
this connection I think and with it

262
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:30,879
associated with a critical that's what a

263
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:33,459
joint NASA does sequence signal DSS

264
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:35,889
there's what leaders meant we had you

265
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:37,388
know how best methods to that party CPC

266
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:39,279
put special net straight on that Street

267
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:44,319
monestery that's what the assistants

268
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:47,439
admits there to the TCP flows address

269
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:49,539
there is the trace investment doctor to

270
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:51,488
the print I think it's one of the system

271
00:13:49,539 --> 00:13:54,399
I said I've got this other interest

272
00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:56,109
could you connect to a police there's

273
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,689
design connect to immersive deliverable

274
00:13:56,109 --> 00:14:01,209
and this is another use case remove a

275
00:13:58,689 --> 00:14:02,439
dress which is exactly interest within

276
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:06,069
their strength

277
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:07,689
could you please draw they're using

278
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:08,799
their address please there are some

279
00:14:07,689 --> 00:14:11,079
others which I'm not going to discuss

280
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:11,728
this year because they get over into the

281
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:16,169
detail

282
00:14:11,729 --> 00:14:19,479
so tell me it's already in every item

283
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:21,159
sir abuses this sorry everyman my new

284
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:23,919
synonym this is the newest eminent I

285
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:25,209
managed to use it that is then verified

286
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,100
as they are verified the customer at the

287
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:28,599
source that's been I'm not sure what

288
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,129
they're going to use it for this stuff

289
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,839
is rolling apples or in hundreds of

290
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:36,519
millions of glasses Osorio bursting

291
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:39,300
works that are not blocking syrup and so

292
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:41,350
this the primary

293
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,839
unless one has a couple of ways of

294
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:46,810
handling tiles and floors and stuff in

295
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:50,940
it kamesh if it possible in the first if

296
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:54,219
it was went to face Declan and in the

297
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:56,589
one path this is just in the crosswalk

298
00:14:54,220 --> 00:15:00,339
through every so-called very very good

299
00:14:56,589 --> 00:15:03,459
participant the remember so see this is

300
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:06,190
TC this is wallet is it is dead your

301
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:07,810
application does not lead to notice and

302
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:10,180
administer over this today I have done

303
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:12,760
as long as the employed to understand

304
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:15,069
this this is TCP socket layer Charlie

305
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:17,610
Kenton if you're making decisions based

306
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:19,630
upon his messages you might fall apart

307
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:20,290
but if through the sitting on the socket

308
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:22,500
of using it

309
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:26,769
this is transparent this just works

310
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:28,899
backwards compatible ammeter need the

311
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:30,459
course as I said you stood in different

312
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:33,670
connections in this case three plus one

313
00:15:30,459 --> 00:15:35,670
half this reason for the more

314
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:39,010
complicated by when you start using the

315
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:40,449
footage is far more interesting to look

316
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:44,500
at because previously we get three

317
00:15:40,449 --> 00:15:46,719
parallel paths and now we return to the

318
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:50,220
first one you will interface to even

319
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:54,100
think of those three that one they look

320
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:58,089
let's assume or the basis that's one

321
00:15:54,100 --> 00:16:01,470
level there's one TCP connection that is

322
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:01,470
a multipath PCP an end

323
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:07,699
and I vendor decided because the people

324
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:09,980
teams of personal missile need the

325
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:12,680
positive energy hangers with tenants can

326
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,930
lease it like one of the family rooms

327
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:18,050
and doesn't actually might want a sequin

328
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:20,900
that's a different component and we'll

329
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:23,209
get to that until you've got a little a

330
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:25,490
little bit deeper stir now that sits the

331
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:27,650
tcp tensioning with additional details

332
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:29,780
they capable play that's what

333
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:33,760
syndication conventions and when you

334
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,760
take those maybe do some time sequence

335
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:41,990
magnification makes the pump keeps

336
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:44,360
they're only communicated in an initial

337
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:46,600
pinch maybe if you don't keep them in

338
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,610
this will can't shake you cannot

339
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:53,710
properly and data let me

340
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:53,710
you cannot probably past six months

341
00:16:54,130 --> 00:17:00,470
because this will be educated and they

342
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:03,050
start with Vanessa seems your joint

343
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:07,540
since that's our to join that is my

344
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:10,049
challenge response answer the same way

345
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:12,609
so what do you see

346
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:14,889
recently and then it shuts down a

347
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:16,059
feature you have fast closed which is

348
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:18,520
analogous finishes then all the

349
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:19,109
connections however then it's within a

350
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,699
minute

351
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:23,589
so if you to capture that extract you

352
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:25,780
can on receive this blur that's finally

353
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:30,428
you have to sit the killing of your tcp

354
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:31,658
and good luck next and as I said it's

355
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:34,179
either the sides where the data goes

356
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:35,590
beginning highly important the most

357
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:36,640
important thing I don't feel like I

358
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:41,289
supposed to do

359
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:43,179
I can't like handle one of the things

360
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:43,960
we've released so far as HTTP which go

361
00:17:43,179 --> 00:17:46,210
through some of those typical

362
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,640
determinants max one who wants to format

363
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:49,870
an RFC and if you can get a chance to

364
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,789
look within a few actually want to sit

365
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:55,299
down do these calculations devastate you

366
00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:57,730
through them I said you get their town

367
00:17:55,299 --> 00:18:00,158
my restitution nearly around the

368
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,600
plastics of syrup and that's by far the

369
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:05,320
biggest implementation of inspectors

370
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,178
won't not be looking at this because

371
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,710
it's in oh absolutely it's of some other

372
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:10,870
experimental stuff the two really

373
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:16,390
interesting things but in terms of

374
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:18,250
incidence maybe see right now this is

375
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:22,570
what Shushan implementations you can get

376
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:24,100
this either you can instant this or all

377
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:28,020
of these systems of us in here it is

378
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:30,219
either one them or they are aware of it

379
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:32,020
whether there is a simple if you see the

380
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,890
security whether there is the fully

381
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:37,150
completeness and an air master tweaking

382
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:39,429
if we were those beamers there is some

383
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:42,520
degree of really suppose in theory see

384
00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:45,669
the configuration options and details

385
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:50,220
later impetus fully implemented only

386
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:55,539
limited some of the other leaders near

387
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:57,510
subscribe when I last checked was just

388
00:18:55,539 --> 00:19:01,200
looking for a tune on a rock

389
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:03,200
the actual implementation sisters headed

390
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,549
to doesn't want to be like a princess

391
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,730
then of course like any protocol let's

392
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:10,980
go for nurse and isn't it over notice in

393
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:13,080
male mentor from the consumer space say

394
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,480
no maybe there's a killer

395
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,340
however I don't a catheter for this

396
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,370
picture for mobile devices tablets

397
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:25,260
smartphones that may be enough given the

398
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:41,879
current state business model and as I

399
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:44,970
see it it said try to comic right now so

400
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:48,510
the average developer can easily give it

401
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:50,160
to end on microchip was different reason

402
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:53,010
that was not there and tip with nine it

403
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,530
is there to 20 I'm not managed to fire

404
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:57,480
by using the court did anything but for

405
00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:00,870
some reason at his ministers thank you

406
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,980
and if you look at the link to they've a

407
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:04,439
lot of the people were developing this

408
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:07,470
protocol the pasta connected IRC evicted

409
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:13,020
there's his name that may not be related

410
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:14,220
I don't know so I see these

411
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,600
implementations it's actually pretty

412
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:18,120
easy to get the some flavor them and

413
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,740
particularly the next implementation has

414
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,629
Debian introduced his simple

415
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,010
configuration instance you can see

416
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,890
there's something about ten minutes to

417
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:28,080
go to the derivative the patient website

418
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:30,410
morning pop - DC funeral it gives you

419
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,409
the sleeps

420
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:37,159
you can also get ever having however

421
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:38,659
that we approach our panel so anything

422
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,480
is defeated everyone a specific

423
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:43,460
provision that start to break that's it

424
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,230
not everything is and a lot of the tools

425
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,790
will give us 500 the strip this my

426
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:48,890
friend is me revelers are not deliver

427
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:51,260
this and see many of the other major

428
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,790
tolls because they do not need to

429
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:57,770
understand that they just need to focus

430
00:20:52,790 --> 00:21:01,070
on this is a beta 2 Debian packages are

431
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:03,710
place value Morgan devotes time but the

432
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:06,439
most cheerful thing which I played with

433
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:09,830
presented a look at the seco there's the

434
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:13,120
SD sequin is a plane there's a skate

435
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:13,120
implementation but it's available

436
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:18,980
but when you've got they're all paper

437
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:21,080
crafting with this it does not less done

438
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:23,930
this is what we're doing along with the

439
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:27,470
total because it is really granular

440
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:30,980
control over what is capping it a very

441
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:31,220
very creamy level and this is good

442
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,110
enough

443
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,850
this didn't get nearly enough attention

444
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:36,320
when it came out there's massive stasis

445
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:38,300
immerse what they moved on to do

446
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,649
something else what was left but that is

447
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,350
one of the best things you can eat if

448
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:43,820
you want to learn about this lately

449
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:47,929
otherwise of dominance with vs DC

450
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:48,860
current which is of real pain now the

451
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:50,960
best thing itself

452
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:55,790
let's that walk through whatever it was

453
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:57,560
it's me so the first most obvious bit

454
00:21:55,790 --> 00:22:01,190
you've probably already clipped out and

455
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:03,320
there's crossed paths fragmentation and

456
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:05,240
the past we have primitive linearly

457
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,580
we get there the kind of extreme each

458
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:10,420
other here here here here and there

459
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,419
breaks up some edges

460
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:15,090
this is different this is not checking

461
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:18,479
it literally this is checking it this

462
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:19,799
way that's very great difference what

463
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:22,590
we've seen in the most improvements on

464
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:23,609
the past particularly the PCP because

465
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:27,090
it's the whole point to multi-point

466
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:29,879
achievement so everything to the Chelsea

467
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:31,799
and that's again a wonderful thing to be

468
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:33,359
usability the Smith the ability to remap

469
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:34,769
the change in trysts is equal to

470
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:40,168
rescission as you go through a

471
00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:41,159
connection but in the past that's not

472
00:22:40,169 --> 00:22:46,470
judgment not true

473
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:49,590
within a day trip resilience you can't

474
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:50,700
kill us very easily at all which is

475
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:53,908
really good for the user

476
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:55,580
terrible particularly the traditional

477
00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:59,430
chapters

478
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:01,169
Sara supalen city Plaguelands the chilly

479
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:03,300
breeze up no spirit keeps government and

480
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:06,450
nor visit the Theresa Tillett Eagles go

481
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:08,389
through First Nations that investment is

482
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:10,860
a turnaround with roofers connections

483
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:14,010
and the color those small things because

484
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:15,449
of that crop fragmentation because that

485
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:17,640
ability in with your addresses rather

486
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:20,220
moving target because of that resilience

487
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,050
and the risk intentions because of those

488
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:24,060
four names that are really fun to be

489
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:26,639
tweeting if your security trolls are

490
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:28,950
requiring any of these basic assumptions

491
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,950
that a cultural in the past week and a

492
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:35,370
half times so if you rely ability to

493
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:36,120
steal anonymity CP strength it's not a

494
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,879
problem

495
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,860
if you provide the ability to a thetan

496
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:44,310
associate and launch position

497
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:47,070
it's when IP address online this is

498
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:48,200
system of shift this program rather is

499
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:50,820
in a stammering please

500
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,110
if you try to your connections you try

501
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:55,139
to talk into a fire hydrant it's not

502
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:57,990
going to work and you try to missus the

503
00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:02,010
fun if you're trying to disparate change

504
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:05,520
your plants grow coasters based upon the

505
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:09,420
initial connection that's wrong in this

506
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:11,129
world that is no longer true that who

507
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:18,330
can exclude defines appliances server

508
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:20,160
this breaks that this protects today are

509
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:21,149
extremely practical so there's nothing

510
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,720
less what's going on

511
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:28,040
however polio is due to trauma so if

512
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,040
you're talking to yourself it's fine

513
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:36,059
because it's not spotted you in a world

514
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:38,409
where that supports this word protocol

515
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:41,559
it's a little bit less feasible to do

516
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:42,909
these attacks in a naive way but things

517
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:44,889
have to change because there are whole

518
00:24:42,909 --> 00:24:47,740
new attacks before the long when you're

519
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:48,909
bidding understands this simple example

520
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:52,149
that comes to mind as I see their

521
00:24:48,909 --> 00:24:53,860
cryptographic kicks out you can just

522
00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:55,600
stop throwing the last bit of traffic

523
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,350
with the veil of chipsets and that's a

524
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,110
very nice feature

525
00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:00,639
Percy similar and the same item in this

526
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:02,918
picture this is another state traffic

527
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,500
model to them it's might be less the

528
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:07,360
user than attracting keeping the

529
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:10,659
connection of each of them it's friendly

530
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:15,789
to take my times things get a lot more

531
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:18,240
complicated and at the same time though

532
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:21,340
you can mitigate some of these things

533
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,169
there's a funeral you're normally

534
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:31,480
teaching like no pregnancy trip looks

535
00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:35,860
like because there's certain things to

536
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:38,529
change with the floors so I sleep in the

537
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:40,418
past I'm not worried about what we

538
00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:43,059
should do I'm worried about what we can

539
00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:45,010
do those the limitations are not going

540
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:50,039
to see the bite here am I here am I yeah

541
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:53,320
that's health we end mostly efficiently

542
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:56,049
so that I can be there and if you're

543
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:58,960
looking for it since so a pedagogical

544
00:25:56,049 --> 00:26:01,658
client will do pathological things they

545
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,390
not ethological plan overtime even or

546
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:05,919
odd

547
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:07,270
pick up either the sides as I speak you

548
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,110
can keep more like that nothing stopping

549
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:11,530
us so the simple example

550
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:23,610
[Music]

551
00:26:11,530 --> 00:27:23,309
the 3% with escape into space this is

552
00:26:23,610 --> 00:27:25,330
just one puppet all right so that's the

553
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:31,389
degenerate case that's a very simple

554
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:34,540
case same fight if we prepare to fire it

555
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:35,920
looks much the same today but we're

556
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:40,370
closed across the network that what they

557
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:50,320
might is expensive so we

558
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:53,199
for finally today anyway and this is why

559
00:27:50,320 --> 00:28:07,899
this is not a weakness of the audience

560
00:27:53,200 --> 00:28:07,900
this is the yes

561
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:29,620
addresses to the same the poor tomorrow

562
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:33,389
so HTTP traffic from Australia and New

563
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:33,389
Zealand nonsense collection a decision

564
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:45,930
the psychic over in aluminum is just

565
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,840
stated multi pop and then one HTTP

566
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:54,059
server so we can understand strange

567
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:55,409
fragmentation it's doesn't do it sir

568
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:57,870
obviously this has implications with

569
00:28:55,410 --> 00:29:00,420
broomis appear in his brother how would

570
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:04,679
you like it out okay this is we have an

571
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:06,570
outbound incoming connection you can't

572
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:13,640
determine your clients pursue this based

573
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:13,639
upon the connection setup direction so

574
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:24,809
TCP whatever non-students extracted and

575
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:28,940
then okay one its TCP what's your point

576
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:36,330
well what it's my decision we advertise

577
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:39,210
tricks man set up a connection to the

578
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:40,710
interest none of the implementations do

579
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:45,840
it even though the protocol specifies it

580
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:49,350
but at that and then you give the sweet

581
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:51,540
connection so the question is is there a

582
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:53,580
common or uncommon it's actually not a

583
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:56,149
sensible question in this case are you

584
00:29:53,580 --> 00:30:04,678
talking about the connection or the demo

585
00:29:56,150 --> 00:30:07,250
and really confused about this and you

586
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:10,820
remember this place

587
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:16,669
we interior turn so I suddenly we care

588
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:18,590
about more than just original sin like

589
00:30:16,669 --> 00:30:20,870
black people gonna I'm sorry I had to

590
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:22,340
alright moving as a network mention

591
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:23,959
before I talk myself into more craziness

592
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:26,418
so if you're trying to monitor your

593
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:29,059
traffic flows and your understand what's

594
00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:30,620
going on with multi path DCP you keep

595
00:30:29,059 --> 00:30:35,149
really crazy things like a drunken

596
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:38,479
spider that is one with browser trying

597
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:43,390
to cnn.com by a one with proxy both of

598
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,390
them occupancy with

599
00:30:54,490 --> 00:31:00,020
the studio metaphor scenes because

600
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,510
you've got to win but you don't have the

601
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:05,150
floor and I want to a little bit if you

602
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:07,010
remember stops oh those addresses

603
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:08,690
when knowing which person is one in

604
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:11,559
which connections going where things

605
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:11,559
look a bit more interest

606
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,810
this prevents multipath protection

607
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:25,560
addiction multi-stream fragmentation

608
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:26,850
addiction obviously this is not we want

609
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,550
to deal with the government in it work

610
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:30,780
so how do you deal with this well first

611
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:34,020
of all you make sure you're reading

612
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:37,040
content exists in the to look for debris

613
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:40,620
supplement then you make sure your tools

614
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:42,300
there's a couple of estimates here is to

615
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:44,760
know if they support it and you're gonna

616
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:48,050
sit up enough noise and introduces into

617
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:52,260
your environment and this also to

618
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:54,540
understand doesn't know how to the

619
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:57,290
tournament so if you're told us today

620
00:31:54,540 --> 00:32:00,690
our connections as one but not the other

621
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:02,250
your architectures are really ridiculous

622
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:03,930
like we have that sort of thing you're

623
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:06,270
too busy to live with inspection your

624
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:09,050
key is the format into two minute it's

625
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:12,150
not a proxy for everything truly makes

626
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:16,639
subsidy points which you control do not

627
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:19,440
do that just really really be a problem

628
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,290
all right so we're racists carrados's a

629
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,490
couple things that is the device that

630
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:26,940
materials device to see if that

631
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:28,680
supporter and it does that by basically

632
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:31,290
sees I'd like to turn your connection

633
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:34,530
then it's just some calcio right in the

634
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:37,110
services no all right it is much more

635
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:38,550
math you submit the services yes it has

636
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:40,919
no anyway we're talking about is just

637
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:42,090
nodding so that obviously don't and

638
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,040
that's the way that works presume

639
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:46,470
through their fortified everything

640
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:48,990
transparent proxies like any other

641
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:52,350
decision and the only real way to deal

642
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:55,500
with this world situation whether that's

643
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:57,449
with another CPC you care about getting

644
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:00,300
their data you should care about how it

645
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:03,030
leads to you it's it's why I wanted to

646
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:05,730
strip the roles but the risk of the

647
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:08,549
earth do that is going to buy us

648
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:09,960
pods if you're stripping know about

649
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:11,639
these at the end of one path in a movie

650
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,700
set up connection that's gonna drop you

651
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:16,559
and use everyone else which is right for

652
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:19,230
the user really annoying for you because

653
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,760
you've just sent them away to you if you

654
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,409
want to track the more friends you have

655
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,960
to catch the hitch name and perform

656
00:33:22,409 --> 00:33:28,860
non-trivial calculations this is not a

657
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:32,549
simple thing to do this is a lower state

658
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:35,100
to travel however the very thicknesses

659
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:36,870
have to see it to understand those are

660
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,370
great fourth at different news pets

661
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:41,010
becoming this for privacy perspective

662
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:42,539
you know and they are trust my eyes am i

663
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:43,980
selling the company they probably don't

664
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:46,049
like each other much either into that

665
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:48,389
where each other and so I should use it

666
00:33:46,049 --> 00:33:50,429
business books against the chance of two

667
00:33:48,389 --> 00:33:51,870
parts getting breached is to some degree

668
00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:54,000
lower than the chance of one meeting

669
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:57,268
breached that may not be a lot of

670
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,639
difference better this is something and

671
00:33:57,269 --> 00:34:00,960
if you start to look at them into a

672
00:33:59,639 --> 00:34:03,479
fusion you can do things like split

673
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,820
trust split passes in the trust report

674
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,919
me we've split up keys or you chain

675
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:11,940
across pounds but surely do not get

676
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:14,099
every pop you get no data you stop

677
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:15,030
moving around for privacy is run a way

678
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:17,069
that we can have been able to

679
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:18,329
efficiently in the past and there have

680
00:34:17,069 --> 00:34:22,259
been some research if it's into that

681
00:34:18,329 --> 00:34:26,250
already I'm going to so the things I

682
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:28,020
plan this particular implementation so

683
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:32,099
you're seventy I can get it to work I

684
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:33,690
gave up to never talk do not do this if

685
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:36,270
you're worried if you is a good reason

686
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:39,300
useful talk about this very very tightly

687
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:41,069
configured for a reason good way don't

688
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:47,760
worry about you can't slow traffic

689
00:34:41,069 --> 00:34:54,480
across boredom servants I would miss

690
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:55,790
with talking released one thing I love

691
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,609
to do is speedy enough

692
00:34:55,790 --> 00:35:00,130
[Music]

693
00:34:57,609 --> 00:35:02,109
rather than not and again you know I got

694
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:03,779
distracted because I have other things

695
00:35:02,109 --> 00:35:06,220
to do which is what I'm going to get to

696
00:35:03,779 --> 00:35:08,589
and the sense I had planned with since

697
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,299
I'm not multi participating now

698
00:35:08,589 --> 00:35:14,140
generalizing these attacks techniques

699
00:35:10,299 --> 00:35:16,150
and tools to the equitation man because

700
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:19,598
now let's not be pregnant in a different

701
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:21,549
way it's like HTTP I've written frankly

702
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,799
to the next defeated public landing down

703
00:35:21,549 --> 00:35:25,660
and checks across multiple paths or

704
00:35:23,799 --> 00:35:27,819
across the same time HTTP regular

705
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:29,379
quizzes to do that you can do these

706
00:35:27,819 --> 00:35:32,049
fragmentation to the other programs

707
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:34,029
there is just one applying digital radio

708
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:36,309
tivities from Oracle Canaries list up

709
00:35:34,029 --> 00:35:38,859
frequency open across them let's not

710
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:40,539
jump lists and ultimately this isn't

711
00:35:38,859 --> 00:35:43,480
really we've found them as Twitter let's

712
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:46,329
do it and it's really really awesome NIH

713
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:47,650
yeah Playa Vista whether that's

714
00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:49,599
definitely the Chancellor's multipath

715
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:51,549
communications acronym with this or

716
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:54,759
something else and then really find a

717
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:56,650
really good but it comparator business

718
00:35:54,759 --> 00:35:58,960
and have security laws we aren't leading

719
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:01,509
if we want to continue doing security

720
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:04,599
always had weed is no read and so we

721
00:36:01,509 --> 00:36:05,829
have to prepare if you want to play with

722
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:07,989
a bit of sentiment race through this

723
00:36:05,829 --> 00:36:10,839
there is the challenge of the URL which

724
00:36:07,989 --> 00:36:16,900
has a pecan wood you need to extract an

725
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:18,099
image not so cool present we also have

726
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,140
the solution Apple because this was

727
00:36:18,099 --> 00:36:22,680
relates to our there there was a few

728
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:24,720
ways of doing that

729
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:27,480
I can break that solution they put out

730
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:33,290
that is the Beast heuristic solution

731
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:33,290
so moving on questions

732
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:49,380
so the vesicles do the plants need to be

733
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:51,720
listening for vocal cords no the clutter

734
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:54,720
the clients they see the connections now

735
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:58,259
and if they ask to get kids back pixels

736
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:01,529
upon the Secretary's service economic

737
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:03,440
control so you see that 50 to 65 comes

738
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:07,310
back to 65

739
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:15,230
so you don't have to listen University

740
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:18,840
yes the Pinterest vision series is using

741
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:20,580
huge census there to be sort of more

742
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,940
widespread adoption or was there

743
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:26,460
something specific about that immediate

744
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:27,770
so the reason that's the trickiest was

745
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:32,549
with such

746
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:34,640
thanks for nothing 100 civilians does it

747
00:37:32,549 --> 00:37:37,950
shoots jump

748
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:41,250
it's the this is the digression care to

749
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:42,689
make I think this this is something

750
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:45,780
Grayson but it's gonna take off for the

751
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:47,760
next nickname at some point the dialysis

752
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:50,190
it's a concern that the techniques is to

753
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,170
be used so we have to be really and even

754
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:55,109
it's not this it's gonna be something

755
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:57,030
else because there is large use user and

756
00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:58,619
business pressures to do this or we

757
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:00,150
already seen with super growth areas

758
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:04,770
bringing out the various solutions for

759
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:06,390
roaming for cellular call will speak

760
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:09,509
nothing from ICONic all of these use

761
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:11,609
cases seem to be very pretty

762
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:13,410
Twitter protection under the particular

763
00:38:11,609 --> 00:38:16,910
states the right-hander's in the order

764
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:16,910
status to plan with limitations

765
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,339
all right
