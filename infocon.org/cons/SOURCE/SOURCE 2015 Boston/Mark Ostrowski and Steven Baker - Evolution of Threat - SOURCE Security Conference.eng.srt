1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,799
walk through probably the first five or

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,150
six slides things that you guys probably

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,950
everybody this room already knows about

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,740
which is really just if it's the age for

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,910
we're sort of at the last last few you

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,860
know three or four slides that I'll do

7
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,198
after Steve eight kind of talks a little

8
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,910
bit about some real-life scenarios that

9
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,710
have gone through so you have any

10
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,300
questions feel free to jump in you know

11
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,400
I'm hoping it's just a feel will will

12
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,410
keep us under forty minutes but we'll

13
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,150
see we'll see what we do so I mean as

14
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,230
far as in front landscape like I think

15
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,929
everybody knows from most familiar with

16
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,850
of what we've battled through what we've

17
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:35,940
seen over the years going back into the

18
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,469
1990s and the 2000s with worms and just

19
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,989
two things that are necessarily not

20
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:42,660
malicious but more of a nuisance right

21
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:45,480
the goal was to take down a specific

22
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,980
website cause network congestion right

23
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,349
it really it was a lot of a lot of

24
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,209
malice really other than the disruption

25
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,460
aspect of it and it really wasn't a lot

26
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,629
of focus on loss right data loss and

27
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,829
trying to steal credentials and all

28
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,710
things that we read about every single

29
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,760
day we all we all live through this

30
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,879
right and then the exact things

31
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,280
progressed into the late 2000s we heard

32
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,289
this term apt we people started to get

33
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,030
more organized and then I'll see you in

34
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,740
the world we live today we're all very

35
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,750
familiar with what's going on right

36
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,649
sponsors state-sponsored activities

37
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:18,180
whether they're here in the US or abroad

38
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:20,610
whether it's things for political

39
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,340
reasons every time some type of

40
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,229
political type of event takes place or

41
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,000
society base event takes place there's

42
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:29,009
always some type of ramification from a

43
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,659
from a computer or from a networking or

44
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:32,520
from attack perspective it's just the

45
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,869
world we live in right every day the

46
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,380
news is riddled with some type of

47
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:39,600
activity and again typically it falls

48
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,839
into some of these buckets here in the

49
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,850
2000s right kind of taking a little a

50
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,890
little bit of the wayback machine how

51
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,890
many people room had one of these almost

52
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,080
identical right

53
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:52,510
I live I live this thing lives in my

54
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,850
bedside table for for too many years

55
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:57,369
right constantly waking me up and the

56
00:01:54,850 --> 00:02:00,550
two that I remember mostly about in the

57
00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:02,530
2000s where a blaster and Code Red

58
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,509
right I mean these nights and these

59
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,340
three or four days there's no sleep for

60
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:07,630
anybody there really weren't a lot of

61
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,429
defenses for these things even though

62
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:11,230
they're very very simple to block I mean

63
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,850
who would think that an expression like

64
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,440
default and ID a question mark would be

65
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:17,019
tough to block back in these days right

66
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,880
today we can do it almost you know our

67
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,230
phones or you almost do in our sleep of

68
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,579
writing expressions to block that type

69
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,980
of stuff but these things are very

70
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,260
disruptive right brought down every

71
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,959
Network that these things got introduced

72
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:31,109
into again notice any malicious but you

73
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,340
know they were there I think blaster

74
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,300
obviously a simple attack I think I

75
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,910
think it was targeting like a

76
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,620
whitehouse.gov website trying to take it

77
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:40,630
down right and then you had you know

78
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,190
copycats though just take it and change

79
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,690
things around and you take down your

80
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,300
friend's website and that type of stuff

81
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:47,590
right pretty pretty benign stuff but you

82
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:51,610
lose this this is what we don't like

83
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:53,920
that with in the late 2000s right today

84
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:56,110
it's it's a completely different thing

85
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,268
right you don't really have to know

86
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:00,519
anything about anything to be a nuisance

87
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:02,590
right you know I was in college you know

88
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:03,940
we we worked very hard to to be a

89
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,620
nuisance right and you had to know a

90
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,620
little bit about something to be a

91
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,360
nuisance but today anybody can do it

92
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,269
right there's tools that you can

93
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,730
download for free multiple websites you

94
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:17,560
know to create your own barians and

95
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,359
stuff like that and then you've got you

96
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,250
got websites like virustotal

97
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,019
right so that that's owned by Google

98
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:25,510
that helps you validate that what you've

99
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:26,890
created won't become right so it's even

100
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,290
it's even easier to create this type of

101
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,578
stuff again this is a website that

102
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:33,220
you're probably everybody everyone has

103
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:35,140
gone to we could download any type of

104
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,609
malware that we want you know make a

105
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,500
slight change and run approve virustotal

106
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,180
and see if any of the major Ivy vendors

107
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,500
will pick it up all right if it doesn't

108
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,630
you've created something new that you

109
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,910
may try to use or against

110
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:47,470
to be a new sensor or you know attack a

111
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:51,100
competitor or something like that right

112
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:53,020
very very simple tools really just you

113
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,790
know any literally anybody anybody can

114
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,290
do it

115
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:58,929
so the malware infection rate has

116
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,250
obviously increased hugely right just

117
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:03,610
some numbers these numbers are based off

118
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:05,770
of my 2014 you know I'm not nothing

119
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,480
really that alarmist about it but you

120
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:10,120
can see you you know within you know

121
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,519
just a minute timeframe couple minute

122
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,440
timeframe a half a day day you know some

123
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,030
significant things do happen some of

124
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,820
those data is is actually pulled off of

125
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:20,589
our customer feedback that we've have

126
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,140
you know that we have across the across

127
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:27,520
the globe just to kind of give a generic

128
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:28,360
rate so what are we doing today so how

129
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,200
things evolve

130
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:34,090
I like to lump you know these three

131
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:39,099
technologies into the sort of the next

132
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:42,969
generation category right everybody or

133
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,650
at least 99% or high 90s have some form

134
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,630
of IPs right

135
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,789
whether stand alone with its open-source

136
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:50,740
whether its consolidated right they have

137
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:54,010
some level of it pretty unsophisticated

138
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,410
pretty easy thing to the easy to deploy

139
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:58,539
right prone prone to uh maybe a lot of

140
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,760
tuning and stuff but if you look at some

141
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:05,320
of the major vendors out there you know

142
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:08,020
whether it's awesome whether its Cisco

143
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:11,080
or juniper you know source fire

144
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,330
obviously acquired by Cisco relatively

145
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,580
easy to deploy right but very very

146
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:17,560
simplistic in its in its approach you

147
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,050
kind of have to know about it to

148
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:24,310
actually block something right it's it's

149
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:26,380
sort of post reaction again you know we

150
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,000
try very very hard to write signatures

151
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,530
or write specific anomaly detection

152
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,570
heuristics to be able to detect things

153
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:34,000
that go above and beyond the generic

154
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:35,500
signature that was created but still

155
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
very very much data to a sort of a

156
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,430
danger you know type of scenario right

157
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,930
you know we do pretty well

158
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:43,820
[Music]

159
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,199
a couple of full gamet then you have

160
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,880
antivirus and antibody

161
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,039
right they're kind of like kind of like

162
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,469
an unhappy marriage right you kind of

163
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,090
have to have one without the other

164
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:54,710
antivirus is kind of I I think it's

165
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:56,539
probably the biggest no-brainer

166
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:57,830
you know that's out there today millions

167
00:05:56,539 --> 00:06:00,110
and millions and millions of files

168
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:02,780
millions and millions of IPs and URLs

169
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,520
you know that have associated md5 s that

170
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,750
you just block at the front door because

171
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,000
you know if they're malicious

172
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:10,190
again not add a zero type of thing but

173
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,479
something that again whether you're

174
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:14,660
doing it on the network or doing it on a

175
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:16,789
desktop or doing it both right that

176
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:19,250
these these these types of things you

177
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:20,659
know exist right anti bots the complete

178
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,280
opposite of that what happens with

179
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,750
something gets in your network and that

180
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,150
is trying to communicate back to

181
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,380
somewhere right so that this is the sort

182
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,849
of the post infection we're like you

183
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,409
know if they're viruses or the pre

184
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:32,719
infection so these technologies that

185
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:34,699
exist out here right again

186
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,050
whether they're the consolidated on a

187
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:37,550
single security gateway whether

188
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,560
standalone products whether on the

189
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,449
endpoint whether than on the network or

190
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,490
on the network right these are things

191
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:45,860
that from a threat detection perspective

192
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:47,690
that we've evolved to the stage and I

193
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,210
would say I have like my customer base

194
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:52,070
on the East Coast you know who's a very

195
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,109
very high percentage I would say maybe

196
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:55,280
seventy five eighty percent of customers

197
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:57,320
that are deploying all these

198
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,270
technologies on the network side right

199
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,070
it's just it's just just it should we've

200
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,810
just come to that point where if you're

201
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:05,270
not blocking all things that you know

202
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:07,270
that or bad you're just letting to muck

203
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:09,889
it right and we all even talked about

204
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:10,849
HTTPS and encryption and being the man

205
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:11,810
in the middle and looking at that

206
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:13,699
percentage of traffic

207
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,620
let's just talk purely about stuff

208
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:17,750
that's unencrypted today right this is a

209
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:21,620
pretty good way right to kind of stop as

210
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:23,930
things kind of evolve over time so we

211
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,520
talked about right you know the bit the

212
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,509
basic the basic thing would we're trying

213
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,669
to get to when this conversation

214
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:31,250
signature-based stuff is not good enough

215
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:32,930
right so we talked about IPS and

216
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,330
antivirus and what they do right we can

217
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:37,909
enforce protocols and standards we can

218
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:40,070
we can detect variations from specific

219
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:41,659
protocols we can look into patterns we

220
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,460
can create proud that the patterns are

221
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:46,130
more broad and it's it's its ability to

222
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:48,590
catch things but what they are limited

223
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:50,210
to are these types of things and I even

224
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,469
showed you virustotal is a way that I

225
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:54,020
can take something that is going to be

226
00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:55,099
caught run a chain make a few slight

227
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,330
changes

228
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,610
and run it and make sure it's not being

229
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,530
detected it's that easy to do right

230
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,820
so again IPS these other technologies

231
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,619
aren't bad things to have because that

232
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,480
you have to have them but kind of like

233
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,920
you know the stands like airbags and

234
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,240
cars like when the you know you have to

235
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,430
have airbags you have to have these

236
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,880
these safety you know types of things

237
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:16,040
that are built in here's an example

238
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,290
right the Zeus builder right any of you

239
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,090
guys ever seen is used to pull de before

240
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:22,400
right probably everybody in this in this

241
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:24,320
room but you can download Zeus builder

242
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,270
make a change to make your own variant

243
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:31,159
of it right now a good IPS in a good

244
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:32,990
anti-bot antivirus strategy will block

245
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,750
these variants because if the variant is

246
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:37,250
throughout the tail end of what you're

247
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,929
creating but if you're sophisticated

248
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,760
enough you can probably build some

249
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:43,880
variant of Zeus that your own and try to

250
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,860
evade things right again this is why

251
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,660
anybody can really do it right this is

252
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,730
not something that you have to do you

253
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,260
know build or derive from your own you

254
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:54,220
simply bought you know download tool off

255
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:56,870
the internet and and you go for right so

256
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:59,630
well you know of course we're evolving

257
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:01,910
so I think Steve can jump in and talk a

258
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:05,840
little bit about some of the threats

259
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:07,819
here in the wild so I'm sure over the

260
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,960
past maybe year to some of you guys have

261
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,810
gone in you know it looks like that's

262
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,770
right looks like it came from UPS stock

263
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:14,780
column phone either you've got a

264
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:17,120
shipping notification you need to open

265
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:18,439
it up take a look at it we all know

266
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,510
hopefully in this room that that was a

267
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,330
piece of malware that was trying to you

268
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:24,830
know proliferate out there

269
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:27,350
real simple what it did right so it was

270
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:29,360
able to go out and folks would open it

271
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:31,670
it would crash when it relaunched open a

272
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,680
blank dog so there's nothing there but

273
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,930
it would also then launch some processes

274
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,029
on the machine that a lot

275
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:39,550
in essence became a keylogger screen

276
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:40,480
capture stop browser attack soon vlog

277
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,008
everything that the user was doing

278
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,180
capture their credentials capture their

279
00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:45,279
information

280
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:48,368
what simplest thing about this I think

281
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,319
is that virustotal when it first came

282
00:09:48,369 --> 00:09:52,569
out less than 10 percent infection rate

283
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:54,550
right so what markers talking about as

284
00:09:52,569 --> 00:09:56,949
far as you know folks being able to go

285
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:59,139
in and make a real small modification to

286
00:09:56,949 --> 00:10:04,569
their to their malware can very easily

287
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:06,610
evade detection so my team at Rotter

288
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:08,050
earlier this year we were called into an

289
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,999
organization to help them out because

290
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:11,258
they were they thought they had a

291
00:10:09,999 --> 00:10:12,970
problem in their environment they had a

292
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:15,879
couple of indicators that they had some

293
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:17,470
malware going on and that maybe some

294
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:20,170
credentials have been compromised within

295
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:21,759
their environment so we were able to get

296
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,290
in and kind of do some forensics with

297
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,600
them and through the course of talking

298
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:28,300
to them we found out that very similar

299
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,040
to that ups attack the number of people

300
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,990
in their organization had received an

301
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,929
email from the US Postal Service saying

302
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:36,309
hey open this document and print it we

303
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:37,869
need to print your shipping confirmation

304
00:10:36,309 --> 00:10:40,329
now not everybody clicked on it but a

305
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:42,339
few people did and one of those

306
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:44,819
computers that the user clicked on it

307
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:47,889
didn't have proper antivirus on

308
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:49,599
immediately a trojan was installed well

309
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:50,470
download our trojan and i'm not sure if

310
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,999
you guys are familiar with how that

311
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,069
doesn't work but in essence what they do

312
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:55,689
is once they're on there they allow

313
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:57,729
whoever's controlling that trojan to

314
00:10:55,689 --> 00:11:00,179
download a different payment so in this

315
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:04,899
case once the trojan was on the computer

316
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:06,249
they were able to download an additional

317
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:07,959
piece of malware I'll get into that in a

318
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:10,240
minute but what's interesting is while

319
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:11,979
it was talking hello to the network to

320
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,900
go and pick up that other pail of the

321
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,480
to download we were seeing what looked

322
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,530
like normal traffic going on so the user

323
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,910
was trying to have that look like that

324
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:21,880
computers trying to act as though you

325
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:24,610
know I'll call Microsoft comm and mixed

326
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,590
in with that was traffic to a bad site

327
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:29,370
where they were downloading which is

328
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:32,260
code all in all

329
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:33,880
once that trojan is on there once that

330
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,830
download of trojan is on there and if

331
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,020
you know the hacker that were the person

332
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:39,610
who's controlling it is able to get the

333
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,650
rights that they need they can install

334
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:45,100
whatever they want in this particular

335
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:47,170
environment about 200 computers or so

336
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,730
were ultimately infected by different

337
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:52,120
types of malware in it wasn't just one

338
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:54,250
thing it was at least eight different

339
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,240
types of malware that we saw I listed

340
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,470
out a couple of them here because they

341
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,050
thought it kind of showed something

342
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:02,260
interesting they didn't just stick with

343
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:03,729
that smoke loader downloader they

344
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,080
realized that that wasn't going to work

345
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,580
on some computers so they were able to

346
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,220
install another downloader that worked

347
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:11,860
on those computers then they started

348
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,300
learning on malware to get the data that

349
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,970
they wanted right so credentials after

350
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,349
the financial stuff they were pulling

351
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,580
the password Zeus you guys are familiar

352
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,960
with that's a pretty big financial

353
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:22,720
throat

354
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:25,080
they were ultimately able to get a lot

355
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,740
of data because you know the

356
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,870
organization in question had a

357
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,520
relatively small security profile and

358
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,440
you know they've had some advanced tools

359
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,230
that were able to evade detection they

360
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,970
were changing their malware regularly to

361
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:39,340
be able to avoid detection we took

362
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,630
samples because we would find as we were

363
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,640
going through this process we would find

364
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:45,939
new samples in their environment we put

365
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,290
them in virustotal and we get 0% and

366
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,400
then after a couple of days it would

367
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,920
show up because I think you know they

368
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,600
were obviously using it in other places

369
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,040
one of the things we came across and I'm

370
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,570
not sure if you guys have run into this

371
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,969
but this Pollock's malware is very

372
00:12:55,570 --> 00:13:00,850
interesting it's 100% registry resident

373
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:02,680
once it's on the machine and running it

374
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:04,660
will spawn processes but it can actually

375
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,609
regenerate itself out of the Windows

376
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,829
registry so if you run a file scan it's

377
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:10,360
not going to see anything it's pretty

378
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,130
pretty advanced stuff and watching it

379
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,020
work is pretty interesting the kind of

380
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:16,590
shows that you know the strategies that

381
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:19,060
are being used are definitely evolving

382
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:21,640
strategy these folks are using to build

383
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:23,140
malware is definitely evolving and and

384
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,040
they're trying to stay ahead of us and

385
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,470
we're trying to stay ahead of that

386
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,439
obviously so it's it's kind of an

387
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:31,450
interesting you know interesting example

388
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,730
ultimately so this organization that we

389
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:35,710
worked with we weren't able to kind of

390
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:38,020
contain it and you know work with them

391
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:40,600
they ended up having to reimage about

392
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:44,280
200 systems because it was not possible

393
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,280
with that much malware floating around

394
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:56,580
so now that we'll talk a little bit

395
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:59,130
about technology and how its evolving

396
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:00,839
it's a Steve's point right that there's

397
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,640
many many types of malware right

398
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,980
something more sophisticated than others

399
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:07,319
so what you've probably heard out the

400
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:10,770
marketplace you know fire I kind of

401
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,060
kicked off a lot of a lot of attraction

402
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:13,620
and a couple years ago relative to

403
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,989
sandboxing but this is you know

404
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,610
obviously what what one technique to

405
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,230
look ass or add a zero type

406
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:21,510
vulnerability right most companies now

407
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:23,220
have a sandboxing solution when it comes

408
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:25,589
down to is how effective it is at

409
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:28,380
catching specific things relative to to

410
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:29,820
emulating files or downloads or web

411
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:32,070
sessions or flash sessions or other

412
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,930
types of things right so just to get so

413
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:35,520
we're all on the same page what is what

414
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:37,410
is sandbox and what does emulation

415
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,510
typically it's it's something that's

416
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:42,540
hypervisor based that actually can run

417
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:45,649
you know Windows 7 or Windows you know

418
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:49,260
windows 8 maybe even going back to XP

419
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:51,420
desktop user sessions on some type of

420
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:54,000
hypervisor was proprietary or something

421
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:55,680
that's open source right files come in

422
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,990
whether it's coming in from a HTTP

423
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,540
download or email or I said look I said

424
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:03,930
some type of browser type of plug-in

425
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:06,599
like flash it's intercepted by some type

426
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:09,630
of gateway right the gateway then sends

427
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:12,079
that file to something for it to be

428
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:14,160
emulated right this hypervisor based

429
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:17,729
system that's running the multiple of

430
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:20,279
desktops right so PDFs spreadsheets Docs

431
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:22,230
powerpoints a typical stuff right goes

432
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:23,760
into the emulation device and what ends

433
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:26,610
up happening is that we and we emulate

434
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,250
what actually happens when that file

435
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:32,010
gets executed right it makes sense that

436
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:33,630
an adobe may talk to a PDF may talk to

437
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:35,310
adobe right it makes sense that certain

438
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,720
things happen but there are glaring

439
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,920
things that could happen that don't make

440
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,230
any sense whatsoever

441
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,860
like making tons of rot registry edits

442
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:45,040
making communication to countries that

443
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,320
typically are something that that

444
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,689
a PDF may do same thing with a docx file

445
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,310
I'm all out of type of stuff right then

446
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,899
that the after the emulation is complete

447
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,459
right and and really in the industry

448
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:57,070
what you're seeing here is how long that

449
00:15:54,459 --> 00:16:00,699
takes from an effective rate perspective

450
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:02,680
so obviously the smaller period of time

451
00:16:00,699 --> 00:16:04,060
it takes to emulate a file the better

452
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,219
off you are cuz the end user experience

453
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,660
is less effective right if you can

454
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,550
relate something for 35 minutes

455
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,899
something just didn't get an email for

456
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,740
35 minutes and you're sitting in like

457
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:14,529
what's going on

458
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:16,060
right our average times where checkpoint

459
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:18,130
respect is around 4 minutes in the worst

460
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:20,529
case scenario right just to give you an

461
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:22,750
idea of what if what it could be if it's

462
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:24,579
if it's a sophisticated malware so you

463
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,199
sandbox the emulate it and then you tell

464
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:28,029
the gateway or you tell the employment

465
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:29,969
or you tell some some device in your

466
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:32,709
network that don't let this file through

467
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:34,149
block it on the incoming outgoing right

468
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:35,709
and then hopefully the system also

469
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:38,199
reports back to you saying these files

470
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:40,300
of malicious tissue these individuals

471
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:44,949
already downloaded so you know go help

472
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:47,199
them remediate right now we're good so

473
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:49,510
here's an example right of emulation at

474
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,250
work right you know screenshots if it B

475
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,540
is provided up here in the right hand

476
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,160
side of what the file looked like when

477
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:56,769
it was executed whether it's a PDF or

478
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,170
docx file here the file is created right

479
00:16:56,769 --> 00:17:01,750
in the registry keys that were tampered

480
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:03,010
with you know to Steve's point here are

481
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,079
the processes that were really kicked

482
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:07,150
off or modified right pretty easy stuff

483
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:08,889
to detect when you're sandbox and you're

484
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:11,199
emulating type of stuff and then here's

485
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:13,329
like an example of you know anti-bot

486
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,659
right which would actually particularly

487
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:20,520
catch the the call to home right which

488
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:23,530
is an unsafe network connection right so

489
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:27,099
Steve's point earlier this has become a

490
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:28,809
giant arms race right now Laredos will

491
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:31,570
try to write malware that the tech nodes

492
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:33,100
being sandbox right so then we tried to

493
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:35,408
detect that they're trying to detect us

494
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,399
and then again we take another step and

495
00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:38,799
we're trying to detect they're trying to

496
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,080
detect we getting this giant giant loop

497
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,520
right they put timers in so we

498
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,490
accelerate the clocks to make time go

499
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,900
faster right you can imagine that versus

500
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:48,400
this is a game that we're not gonna win

501
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,600
right because the malware writers are

502
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,040
always going to have the upper step

503
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,990
because we don't know what they're gonna

504
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,760
try to attempt it

505
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,410
you don't get me wrong it's a great

506
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,059
technology and you have to do it if you

507
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:59,130
want to catch days and real stuff and

508
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:02,129
you catch a very very very large

509
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:04,320
percentage of it of an hour but if

510
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:09,179
you're smart enough or clever enough

511
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:10,649
you're gonna find some way to avoid your

512
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:14,520
file or a piece of malware being

513
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:17,100
emulated right so I took this screenshot

514
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,720
actually like a week ago right is the

515
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,949
URL on the bottom here is just uncheck

516
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,550
them except where you can pop this thing

517
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,050
up

518
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:26,159
but this was like I think around 10

519
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:27,960
o'clock and there was 800 lot of

520
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,420
connections of no malware connections

521
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:33,690
right that we had logged you know and

522
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:36,600
you can see it a day before there's like

523
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:38,370
a hundred at 1.7 million attempts that

524
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,840
we logged a day before right so every

525
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:41,159
you can go here every single day bring

526
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,199
up this website this kind of get an idea

527
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,520
you know where the hot topics are on

528
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,650
that type of stuff but the point of this

529
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:50,400
slide was a little bit like a wargames

530
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:52,110
kind of representation that there is

531
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,240
just kind of this arms race that we're

532
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,809
battling from an emulation so as they're

533
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,570
evolving

534
00:18:54,809 --> 00:19:00,030
alright security companies like

535
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:02,490
ourselves we have to evolve as well so

536
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:04,170
the next thing that that that folks are

537
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:06,510
getting involved was was just file

538
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:08,370
scrubbing it takes the emulation out of

539
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:11,910
the picture right when is it happening

540
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:16,229
is is that all the invented objects the

541
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:18,300
macros the code links user-defined links

542
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:22,590
all that type of stuff is scrubbed out

543
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:25,320
of the file bless you

544
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:26,610
it's got down in the file right so now

545
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,470
when the end user

546
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:30,479
you know set off the one that when the

547
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:31,830
recipient receives a specific file what

548
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,929
they're getting is a scrubbed benign

549
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:36,480
version of the file so therefore it is

550
00:19:33,929 --> 00:19:37,920
not malicious so it doesn't matter right

551
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,550
by the way the percenters of that is in

552
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:43,980
the very very high 99% ratio ratio so

553
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:45,840
the end user gets a benign file a benign

554
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:48,059
file may not have all the actions that

555
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,939
the original file had you know drop-down

556
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:52,770
vendors in Excel you know that type of

557
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,300
stuff right but they can request from an

558
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:56,100
end-user operational perspective they

559
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,029
can request the original file that will

560
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:00,428
go through more rigorous checking

561
00:19:58,029 --> 00:20:02,409
this is a great technology or a boring

562
00:20:00,429 --> 00:20:03,969
way to avoid the unknown because you

563
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:08,379
know because at this point you're just

564
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:10,239
removing it so file scrubbing right you

565
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:12,129
by the way you can also do this from the

566
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:13,809
from from a web browser perspective with

567
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:16,478
it with a browser plugin so you can

568
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:18,009
scrub the actual browser content still

569
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:20,080
used to may say that you know this this

570
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:21,669
is this is a great technology some may

571
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,289
choose to adopt it some may not choose

572
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:25,359
to adopt it based upon how the end user

573
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:26,769
experience is affected but a very very

574
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:28,840
successful strategy and by the way a

575
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:30,159
very very quick strategy typically a

576
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,728
file to be scrubbed in less than a

577
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,619
second

578
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:34,629
now you take four minutes down to a less

579
00:20:32,619 --> 00:20:36,339
than a second the end user doesn't get

580
00:20:34,629 --> 00:20:38,649
the original file but they're also being

581
00:20:36,339 --> 00:20:40,059
protected in the other and email and web

582
00:20:38,649 --> 00:20:41,529
sessions are happen in a very very quick

583
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:43,210
manner so there's a trade-off that

584
00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:46,450
security administrators have to be able

585
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:48,190
to pick here so again further of you who

586
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:50,229
shouldn't even be on that right how can

587
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:53,859
we catch things that are less agnostic

588
00:20:50,229 --> 00:20:57,129
how can we catch things that you know

589
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:59,889
that necessarily can't be emulated and

590
00:20:57,129 --> 00:21:01,869
and I think I think only the future

591
00:20:59,889 --> 00:21:04,299
we'll be able to determine how much of

592
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:06,639
help sophisticated malware I will get so

593
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:07,749
so a further illusion from from from a

594
00:21:06,639 --> 00:21:09,279
checkpoint perspective that we're

595
00:21:07,749 --> 00:21:12,249
looking at and that you'll see

596
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:15,129
relatively soon is the actually chip

597
00:21:12,249 --> 00:21:17,739
level sandboxing right so here's just an

598
00:21:15,129 --> 00:21:19,629
idea this is a typical malware is in its

599
00:21:17,739 --> 00:21:21,009
infancy right you have vulnerability

600
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:22,689
right there are thousands of out there

601
00:21:21,009 --> 00:21:24,549
but from an exploit perspective is a

602
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:26,830
handful right well there's privet that's

603
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:28,869
called mule privilege escalation whether

604
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:31,629
it's stack jumping whether it's

605
00:21:28,869 --> 00:21:34,570
shellcode execution is this this may be

606
00:21:31,629 --> 00:21:36,789
less than ten around that number of

607
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:38,529
actual exploits that are known right and

608
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:40,570
then for malware right this mil is we

609
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:43,570
all know that right so what happens if

610
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:44,859
you can detect the exploit right these

611
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,359
types of things here that you see here

612
00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:47,408
always controls right things like that

613
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:50,529
what happens if you can detect that

614
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:52,299
detect that at a chip level before the

615
00:21:50,529 --> 00:21:54,789
malware even gets downloaded on the OS

616
00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:58,119
right and who knows what the OS is what

617
00:21:54,789 --> 00:22:00,489
happens to be if a Mac OS exporter or a

618
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:03,290
piece of malware gets running an Intel

619
00:22:00,489 --> 00:22:05,060
based emulation engine

620
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:07,550
right it gets through the front door

621
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:10,310
right so what can we do what can we want

622
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:12,290
how can we evolve right so in modern

623
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:13,639
modern-day intel chipsets there there

624
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:16,550
are things that are built in to do this

625
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,740
right you know DEP a SLR right there are

626
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:22,159
things that the the Intel chipsets

627
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:23,930
actually enable and look to do look for

628
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,340
specific exploits and prevent those

629
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:27,650
exploits from happening from operating

630
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:29,300
system perspective right these are these

631
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:32,390
are designed inside here but people also

632
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:34,490
try to try to evade them just as much so

633
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:35,960
the next level or the next evolution of

634
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:38,210
sandboxing like I mentioned is chip

635
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,710
level sandboxing inside the Intel

636
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:41,060
Haswell chipset which is the latest

637
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:43,100
ships have been Intel released they have

638
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:44,720
an API the API can actually you can

639
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,860
actually monitor different aspects and

640
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,920
different characteristics and heuristics

641
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:51,260
of the CPU itself right so if you look

642
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:53,000
at the CPU and how its behaving and you

643
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,980
actually write controls around the

644
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,020
modern-day exploits that you know about

645
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:59,990
you can predict whether that the code

646
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:01,580
that's being run is either malicious or

647
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:04,820
it's happening under the typical

648
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:08,360
standard finite you know of a good

649
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:09,649
application or a good you know piece of

650
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,320
document or what-have-you

651
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:13,880
right so if you if you write it or if

652
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,649
you write it to the active the API of

653
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,690
the Haswell chipset you look at these

654
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:19,070
types of things you can you know exempt

655
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:21,770
you again you can you can do searches

656
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:23,210
you can look for stack stack overflows

657
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:25,310
you can look for jumps and runs you can

658
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:26,750
look for the various level different

659
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:29,419
things that happen from an exploit

660
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:32,000
perspective and then completely agnostic

661
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:34,790
to the operating system before it even

662
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,680
needs to go to emulation to be run you

663
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:38,090
can detect these types of these types of

664
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,100
vulnerabilities whether it's again you

665
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:40,550
know rootkits are hidden malware or

666
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,230
what-have-you

667
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:43,370
it's more resilient to sandbox because

668
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,660
you actually have to have to get to the

669
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:47,030
sandboxing level because you're looking

670
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:48,890
at the Intel look in the Intel data from

671
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:51,110
the CPU and what the exploits look like

672
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:52,730
if you couple this with the technology

673
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:54,979
that we talked about right and you layer

674
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:57,860
on IPS you layer on aunt they buy you

675
00:23:54,980 --> 00:24:00,860
antivirus you do right emulation

676
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:02,570
but did you layer this on top right you

677
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:04,280
get a pretty good strategy over pretty

678
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:06,049
good defense against modern day malware

679
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,790
the beauty of this is like the is Baloo

680
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:09,500
the OS agnostic part of it you catch the

681
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:11,750
Mac OS stuff before if you're not

682
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,549
emulating Mac OS you know critical

683
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,240
infrastructure right you know running on

684
00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:16,490
siemens

685
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,500
hardware and all this stuff is

686
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:20,000
proprietary people can write malware for

687
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,440
that as well if they're targeting it we

688
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,040
all know about stuff then the Stuxnet

689
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:27,500
how famous that was and how delay the

690
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:30,470
the obviously the nuclear program for so

691
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:33,080
very long a technology like this could

692
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,880
potentially look at how the CPU is being

693
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,590
affected in the term and these types of

694
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,210
things were unrelated to the Microsoft

695
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:43,820
operating system which obviously is the

696
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:44,780
major focus of the malware writers and I

697
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,340
you know I talk to them

698
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,870
a lot of what I talked about was more on

699
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,610
the networking side right picking up

700
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:51,379
files off of the network and emulating

701
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:53,149
and pickup up files or destinations of

702
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:55,730
IPs or URLs or what-have-you

703
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:57,740
right but this also extends down to the

704
00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:00,230
end point right here's an example you

705
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:02,150
know where ant I bought antivirus

706
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:04,010
emulation is actually running on the

707
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:05,510
endpoints up on the side as well

708
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:07,340
you can you can you can report the

709
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:08,950
effective processes the infected files a

710
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:12,379
lot of type of stuff so it extends

711
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:14,750
beyond just a network and obviously you

712
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,520
can do it on the endpoint side the next

713
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:19,190
biggest thing and I'll hand it back over

714
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,990
to Steve to wrap up is the predictive

715
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:23,870
intelligence right retroactive

716
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:25,610
intelligence today the most common thing

717
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:27,979
is is that you know you have an

718
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:29,389
infection at for past nine that's great

719
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,860
it's great that you have the infection

720
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:32,660
it's great that I think I can get a log

721
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:35,510
and I can create a report and say these

722
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:37,700
individuals were known to contain

723
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:39,710
malware at 9:15 this is where they tried

724
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,150
to go and this is what they tried to do

725
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:44,179
this is the data that potentially tried

726
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:45,980
to escape but what happened before right

727
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:47,809
one of the machines were involved as

728
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:49,309
part of this right there's a lot of

729
00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:51,379
information from up remote from a

730
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:53,720
predictive or a retroactive perspective

731
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:55,580
that's very very important right to find

732
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,410
out you know the 200 machines that are

733
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:59,149
affected right and

734
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:01,190
and having that having that inventory

735
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:03,470
and going back you know just just me

736
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:06,289
going to Google at 8 o'clock in the

737
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:09,860
morning it's not a big deal but at 9:15

738
00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:11,270
own what did I go to Google for what you

739
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,559
know doing a packet capture what it

740
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:14,030
looked like what I went to Google what

741
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,520
did I download what's the website did I

742
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:18,500
go on which DNS server responds at WME

743
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,580
google.com and I did that that's the

744
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,620
type of information that's being

745
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,570
cataloged and being used for for later

746
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:25,610
on so that when you get an infection you

747
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:26,629
can reverse back and see what actually

748
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:28,520
will the condition is where that set

749
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:30,919
that up so you can do a better job with

750
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:40,520
your clean up with your forensics and a

751
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:42,140
lot type of stuff Steve I think so you

752
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:46,850
know I think one of the things I want to

753
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:48,980
make sure probably do why are we even

754
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:50,840
talking about this right so as we said

755
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:53,750
malware is continuing to evolve there's

756
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,158
been you know a week or two without

757
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:57,920
hearing about some data breach I think

758
00:26:55,159 --> 00:27:00,360
there was a virus one

759
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:04,570
[Music]

760
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:07,289
accounts we're seeing a huge increase in

761
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:10,178
that year-over-year some of 2013 to 2014

762
00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:13,390
25% increase in power there was 317 new

763
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:14,980
variants of malware that's that's an

764
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:17,860
order number if you think about it right

765
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:19,360
that's that equates to a large number of

766
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:21,158
malware every couple of minutes that's

767
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,020
being modified and some of that is

768
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:24,880
malware than the same family that's just

769
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,649
being changed to avoid detection some of

770
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,299
its new various sorts of things that

771
00:27:26,649 --> 00:27:31,689
we've never seen before using exploits

772
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:33,490
that are new you know folks are going

773
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:36,070
after mobile devices right so there was

774
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:38,440
a I think it came from Symantec there

775
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:40,289
was a report that 17% of android apps

776
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,010
right now have malware like

777
00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:43,450
functionality and them now they may not

778
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:45,610
be completely malicious but they have

779
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:48,340
malware characteristics that's a pretty

780
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:49,990
big number ransomware I'm sure just

781
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,699
about everybody in here knows somebody

782
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:53,320
who got hit with ransomware in the last

783
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:56,200
12 months right and it's it's

784
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:57,070
interesting because the the theory if

785
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,350
you think about it

786
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:01,240
the malware writers need money to fund

787
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:02,649
their efforts right and making money

788
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,529
through ransomware is a great way to do

789
00:28:02,649 --> 00:28:07,239
it because people are gonna home users

790
00:28:05,529 --> 00:28:08,950
and folks like that I've got to click on

791
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,299
a link and they're gonna lose their

792
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:12,700
documents and they're gonna pay the

793
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:14,470
money to get them unencrypted you know

794
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,190
these guys are these guys see this does

795
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,809
a big business

796
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:18,309
they've actually got customer service

797
00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:19,510
portals now if you lose your recovery

798
00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:21,340
code you can put in your order number

799
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:22,149
and get the code again alright so

800
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,649
they're they're taking it pretty

801
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:25,779
seriously that's because it helps fund

802
00:28:23,649 --> 00:28:28,350
their you know their more lucrative

803
00:28:25,779 --> 00:28:28,350
efforts

804
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:32,309
and I think you know I think it's

805
00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:36,000
important to understand that there's no

806
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:37,470
single approach that that makes this go

807
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,150
away right you can't focus just on

808
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:40,820
technology you can't focus just on

809
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:42,720
process you can't focus just on

810
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:45,270
educating your users you kind of have to

811
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,830
do all of that stuff and you have to

812
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:48,780
look at it from more than just this is

813
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:50,610
an email based threat or this is a

814
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,350
website based right you have to start

815
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:54,719
looking at how do I protect my mobile

816
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:56,850
devices how do I protect you know the

817
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,470
Internet of Things is coming right it's

818
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:00,178
kind of here but it's it's evolving

819
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:02,789
there's going to be additional security

820
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:04,950
features and threats in that area as it

821
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:06,809
evolved so you have to kind of look at

822
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:09,030
it from all those avenues to say alright

823
00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:10,889
how can I put together a strategy that's

824
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:15,389
gonna protect my organization and myself

825
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:17,400
against this stuff I think that strong

826
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:19,289
technical controls help right so things

827
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,970
that mark talked about certainly are are

828
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:23,669
part of that strategy but you can't

829
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:25,890
really stop there you know everybody

830
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:27,690
jokes about patching and vulnerability

831
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:29,070
analysis and vulnerability assessment is

832
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:31,470
up like that they're really important

833
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:33,990
because you can help understand it can

834
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:37,020
help to understand what your what threat

835
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:38,640
vectors can be used against you you also

836
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:41,539
need to start looking and I'm sure most

837
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,440
folks are but the idea of extending the

838
00:29:41,539 --> 00:29:44,640
security controls beyond the corporate

839
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,909
network right so people take their

840
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,320
laptops home you can take them on the

841
00:29:47,909 --> 00:29:51,809
guest Wireless here right now who knows

842
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,370
what's going on on that right so you

843
00:29:51,809 --> 00:29:55,590
need to start looking at that stuff and

844
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:57,360
putting in controls whether it's

845
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:59,760
something that can extend your your

846
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:03,209
corporate network security out

847
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,710
- you know those remote users or you

848
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:07,050
know taking a different approach and

849
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:09,690
looking at how can i how can I at least

850
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:13,680
know what's going on and I think that's

851
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:16,680
a really key point is that visibility so

852
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:18,930
visibility folks how many folks in here

853
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,490
use or have visibility tools like a sim

854
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:22,950
or or something like that what they're

855
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:24,390
getting data what I hear from a lot of

856
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:27,360
folks is they have all of those tools

857
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:28,740
but they get a ton of noise right and

858
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,560
it's hard to beat out the false

859
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:33,090
positives from the good stuff and you

860
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:36,270
know what do I need to react to what can

861
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:37,830
I just think nor I would say take a walk

862
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:39,030
out look and make sure you're using the

863
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:40,560
right tools and that they're tuning

864
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:42,180
correct because that data is there for

865
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:45,419
you in a lot of cases being able to use

866
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:46,800
it like Mark said post-infection or pre

867
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,120
infection and post infection is

868
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,040
important because you need to understand

869
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:52,290
what happened you can't protect yourself

870
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,550
you know a machine has been compromised

871
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:54,960
it's hard to protect yourself against

872
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,370
that compromise if you don't know what

873
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,010
happened before what happened happened

874
00:30:56,370 --> 00:31:00,810
right you can't modify firewall rules to

875
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:02,730
block a bad sight if you don't know what

876
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:04,530
site they went through Cyrus so getting

877
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:05,600
tools that really work from a visibility

878
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:07,830
point of views of

879
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,020
also don't discount the data that's

880
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:12,480
available to you I mentioned earlier my

881
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:14,370
organization health one of our customers

882
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,200
with a malware outbreak and one of the

883
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:18,479
things that came out afterwards is that

884
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,490
they had noticed during the period that

885
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,680
they were infected a large office tick

886
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:24,300
in machines that were crashing and

887
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,650
blue-screen and all their stuff they had

888
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,990
all that data in their ticketing system

889
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:30,510
but nobody went back and looked to say

890
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:32,070
hey we know we started having a problem

891
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:33,480
around that one other characteristics

892
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:35,310
that we see in our environment

893
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,510
afterwards they did and they found you

894
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:39,030
know from a period from when it started

895
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:40,740
to about when we got everything cleaned

896
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:42,180
up they had a huge uptake on the number

897
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,320
of machines that had to reimage in their

898
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,760
environment they were having problems

899
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,740
use their reporting stuff that's

900
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,450
valuable data that you can use to know

901
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:51,840
that something's wrong and if you need

902
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:54,090
to take a closer look education

903
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,800
obviously you know stay on top of the

904
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:57,750
current trends around you know things

905
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,490
like certain stuff that's being released

906
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:01,920
you know stuff that's being released as

907
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:04,020
far as our vulnerabilities things like

908
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,490
that educate your users - I know

909
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,320
everyone kind of laughs about that

910
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:09,510
because it's not always super effective

911
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,189
but I think users even you know

912
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:13,020
non-technical users are becoming more

913
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:15,360
aware of the fact that there are threats

914
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:16,560
out there I mean how many you know how

915
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,240
many folks in there have had at least

916
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,760
one credit card replaced in the last

917
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,250
year right you're not alone I think I

918
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,660
had two or three done last year from

919
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:26,790
staples at home people and stuff like

920
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:29,040
that your users are having that issue -

921
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:29,370
so I think the message resonates a

922
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,600
little

923
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:46,739
better to them now that it may have been

924
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:47,939
years past questions I don't think

925
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:53,280
you're talking about in there

926
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:55,890
you got a tool and part of that

927
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,430
effective operations like the data is

928
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,500
there

929
00:32:56,430 --> 00:33:00,500
tip like you need to enable your people

930
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,510
you know looking for that page for the

931
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:05,549
sympathy

932
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:05,549
[Music]

933
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,429
[Music]

934
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:22,710
[Music]

935
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:24,209
yeah I think I think leveraging you know

936
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:25,740
leveraging the tools but like you said

937
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,540
you need people to look at those tools

938
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:30,170
and then you need people to do follow-up

939
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:32,700
on that and you also you don't need

940
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:34,680
tools like that like a simple tool or a

941
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,900
data analytics to look great but you

942
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:39,090
also need some level of understanding of

943
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:40,680
what goes on beyond you know the network

944
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:42,570
and the endpoint you need to understand

945
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:45,090
business process to a little some extent

946
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:47,399
right because I can write rules within

947
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:49,290
just about any sim to tell me when you

948
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,600
know this network connection is made

949
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:52,530
from this server to this server and out

950
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,820
to the internet but what does that

951
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,870
matter cuz I understand what those

952
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,730
servers are doing and what they're

953
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:58,620
supposed to be doing so I think that

954
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:00,330
that's you know that is a key element of

955
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:03,239
it right is having folks that have the

956
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:04,110
cycles whether it's a you know an

957
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,940
environment where you have a full-blown

958
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:07,110
sophomore somebody that dedicates a lot

959
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:09,300
of their time to reviewing that stuff

960
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:10,710
and then following up to make sure that

961
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,370
that stuff that you see is being

962
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:13,370
analyzed

963
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:21,660
reward them whether that they thought or

964
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:23,279
that connection to a conference or you

965
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,810
know insight or whatever happened to

966
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,880
