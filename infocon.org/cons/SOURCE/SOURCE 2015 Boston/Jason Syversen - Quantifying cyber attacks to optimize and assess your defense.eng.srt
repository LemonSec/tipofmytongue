1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,460
that's gone on so the outline I'm going

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,960
to talk up introduce myself the topic

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:09,360
would is cyber qualification from our

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,400
perspective how do we do that

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,879
what's an approach to measuring and

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:19,529
predicting offense and defense I will

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:22,170
talk about discussions and conclusion so

8
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:24,029
Who am I I used to be an engineer now I

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,789
kind of manage engineers and wish I was

10
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:28,320
an engineer I spent some time at thought

11
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:31,109
I was a program manager running a bunch

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,640
of interesting our D programs and that

13
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,450
sort of key technologies about six years

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,399
ago sieges an offensive defensive

15
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:40,110
technology company they stopped over the

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,750
border in New Hampshire and we're hiring

17
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,460
if any of you are looking for a job I'm

18
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,800
gonna use that pitch opportunity when I

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,739
have it so I'm going to talk about

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,078
different methods to quantify cyber

21
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:54,120
security this is obviously our problem

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,190
as many of you realize we do not know

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,899
how to measure goodness you don't know

24
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,420
how to measure if you're secure if

25
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,469
you're insecure unanswered research

26
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,170
problems are spilled number of

27
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,180
vulnerabilities in code how secure are

28
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,580
you but the same problem happens in the

29
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:12,030
offensive side and this is kind of where

30
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:15,658
the research came from about 10 plus

31
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,040
years ago I built an offensive command

32
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:21,630
control attack system kind of like a

33
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,310
plan X program and the goal is to give

34
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,130
an operator for the military who's

35
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,600
trying to say hey we might want to turn

36
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,329
off the power and Iraq right when they

37
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,829
attacked and you're trying to say should

38
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:34,589
we blow up this power generation

39
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,089
facility and risk killing people and I'm

40
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,920
real versatile effects or can we use

41
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,110
this nifty cyber technique that somebody

42
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,850
might have developed the problem is they

43
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,259
don't trust those cyber capabilities

44
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,479
right they have a kinetic capability

45
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,920
that they know they can turn to their

46
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,509
kinetic planning guys and there's a

47
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,799
group called the Jay TCG I mean that

48
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:51,540
dropped a bunch of bombs and they say

49
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,540
hey we drop ten bombs nine times it blew

50
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,250
up they can say F equals MA we know it

51
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,259
falls like a parabola the blast radius

52
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,149
is this and there's a civilian

53
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,219
population density so there's a 14%

54
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,189
chance thrillin casualties we send one

55
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:08,098
f-16 it's 62% probability of success is

56
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:09,989
sent to it goes up to 94%

57
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:12,060
it'll be on target in 42 minutes they

58
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:14,150
turned to the summer guy and he's like I

59
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,519
got this cool thing and it might work

60
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:20,010
and they say so how long's gonna take no

61
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:20,879
done this before how do they know

62
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,040
they're not gonna bring down a hospital

63
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,340
and in some other country like well we

64
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,959
don't think so and so kind of you can

65
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,000
fill in the blanks on how that story

66
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:31,560
goes departments they just don't

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,590
understand what those effects for be so

68
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,980
are they in sorting this research over

69
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,749
ten years ago is not to solve all the

70
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,790
problems it's just to you know we don't

71
00:02:39,749 --> 00:02:43,709
have to have perfect confidence in all

72
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,179
things at all times we just have to be

73
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:46,650
kind of outrunning the bear you're not

74
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,959
on the bear just have to be faster than

75
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,060
the other guy our goal is to be as good

76
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,659
as the kinetic planning community is and

77
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,280
say okay

78
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:55,888
they have matters that actually work in

79
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,719
people trust and can use let's develop

80
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:58,799
that for offense and then we said okay

81
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,989
if we can actually predict it on offense

82
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:02,699
let's use those algorithms against

83
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:04,530
ourselves and say how does that help us

84
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:06,239
tell how to secure our network because

85
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,889
if I can predict the impact to an

86
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,480
attacker and their probability success

87
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:12,030
changes based on what I do on defense

88
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,488
well now I can make quantified optimized

89
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,769
defensive posture decisions based on how

90
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:18,659
it impacts the attacker that's kind of

91
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:21,769
where look they had the story the

92
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:21,769
background probably got there

93
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:28,780
all right so I'm sorry little philosophy

94
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,670
on kind of our approach to doing this so

95
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,610
the first is I believe strongly the

96
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:35,679
offense defines the defense so market

97
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:38,590
offense is better for those that focus

98
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,330
on defense we work on both sides but

99
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,920
really I don't think you know you can

100
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,390
talk about a well and say that's a

101
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,799
really great defense I built and it

102
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,569
might work awesome against a kid on a

103
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,880
bicycle that we weren't well against a

104
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:50,290
UAV right so it's all about what is your

105
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,880
threat so you have to define what the

106
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,400
threat is before you define what your

107
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,950
defense against the threat is so we

108
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,290
think measuring defense you have to

109
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:01,268
start with defining need offense right

110
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,650
seems obvious but people especially

111
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:04,090
people that have an exclusively

112
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,830
defensive background sometimes think you

113
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:08,110
can start with defense their defense all

114
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,670
day and define what the defense is doing

115
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,260
but I think the opposite you have to

116
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:13,988
start with attack figure out what theirs

117
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,760
attacks are hopefully create and define

118
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:17,560
the future of those attacks and then use

119
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,238
that to say okay how would we measure

120
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,479
how do we create defenses against those

121
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:25,590
who we measure those defenses real big

122
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,280
fans of data there's a lot of

123
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:29,260
qualitative approaches have been used

124
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,590
I've seen some folks that use QA

125
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:35,710
methodologies or maybe surveys or ask

126
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:38,500
the user that kind of guess actually saw

127
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:40,419
a case with some contractor that was

128
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,800
building a tool and if it's behind a guy

129
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:43,479
type in their own numbers and then they

130
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,340
multiplied like 15 numbers together and

131
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:47,530
they had an answer with like 45 degrees

132
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,330
of precision not super useful in my

133
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:52,150
opinion right your best bet right

134
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,349
talking to humans is high low medium you

135
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,479
probably can't get much more precise

136
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:58,060
than that our approach is really driven

137
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:59,830
by lots of data not that we're gonna go

138
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:04,990
with an exclusively car fitting model

139
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:06,310
right sergey brin from Google his

140
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,930
approach is kind of like let the data

141
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:10,270
talk to you when you can actually if you

142
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:12,490
have enough data you can actually pull

143
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:15,400
out underlying mechanisms that you don't

144
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:17,810
realize they're Reza's port approaches

145
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,640
something that's more qualitative

146
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:22,310
we've spent a lot of time automating the

147
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,960
test process trying to understand what's

148
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,550
going on using scientific method so I

149
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,950
have a hypothesis we run experiments

150
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:31,820
collected see if that validates your

151
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:33,229
approach and then try to abstract that

152
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,409
data out to touch something that's

153
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,410
useful

154
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,940
that's all so I won't say if anyone has

155
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:41,250
questions please jump in while I'm

156
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,479
talking Caesar to do that now then go to

157
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:46,790
the end and go backwards

158
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:48,260
so part what's happened in the past so

159
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,630
there's been a ton of work on the tack

160
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:52,940
trees as many of you probably know by

161
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:55,340
going back 10 or 15 years lots of work

162
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:57,050
in network routing so predicting if this

163
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,989
packet will arrive from here to there

164
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:01,130
there's a lot of good models for that

165
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,880
system complexity theory is kind of a

166
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:06,440
new area where people are trying to

167
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,580
bound for example if you want to know

168
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,139
how many vulnerabilities are in a piece

169
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,449
of code you might look at the complexity

170
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:13,940
of the code base and try to infer from

171
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:17,030
that something about number of bugs that

172
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,350
might exist in that code base obviously

173
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,090
there's been a ton of work on specific

174
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:22,220
types of attacks and specific defenses

175
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:23,989
against those attacks popular built

176
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,060
planning systems you could say

177
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,979
everything from like core impact to the

178
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:33,710
penetration testing frameworks like war

179
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:36,199
impact and Metasploit and canvas skybox

180
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,940
is like a simulated red teaming tool

181
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:39,940
where you could try to plan how to

182
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,580
attack and see what would happen

183
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:46,460
accuses attack trees in a fairly

184
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:48,460
simplistic propagation model plan axe is

185
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,650
a big thing doc was doing on kind of

186
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:53,989
visualizing attacks isn't one of working

187
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:55,789
qualification though in any of those a

188
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:59,000
lot of test beds have been built to

189
00:06:55,789 --> 00:07:00,860
automate testing and collecting data

190
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,630
enterprise metrics have been dimetric on

191
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,770
a couple times again the metrics that

192
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:06,740
they look at there are things like

193
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:10,030
number of helpdesk tickets number of

194
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:12,920
hours spent number of patches deployed

195
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:14,450
not a lot of research and I would love

196
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,000
to if anyone has anything that I'm

197
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:20,300
missing I have seen very very little on

198
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,120
actually quantifying probability of

199
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,310
success of an attack or how to quantify

200
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,770
your defensive posture against different

201
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:30,080
types of attacks

202
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:31,580
all right so we're we quantified so this

203
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,680
is what we started with again I said

204
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,030
I'll talk about the top will transition

205
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,129
just like our research did

206
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:39,378
starting with quantifying it offensive

207
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:40,669
attacks and moving to what does that

208
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:43,129
mean for defense how do you quantify the

209
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:45,830
defense so some of the things we would

210
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,849
like to quantify on the celeste the ones

211
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,620
in blue of the things we've actually

212
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:51,050
spent quite a bit of time actually have

213
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:53,090
built models that have data for how do

214
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:56,440
you measure covertness how to measure

215
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:58,698
speed attribution forensics footprint

216
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,620
collateral damage and probability

217
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:02,650
successful deployment and then the other

218
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,650
ones are kind of more notional

219
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,650
conceptual

220
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:10,260
what is the process so we start off with

221
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:13,320
whatever things we want to measure those

222
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:16,260
are the i/o attributes we have models

223
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:19,080
for the environment and those are

224
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,520
simulation test beds representing those

225
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:24,210
top potential targets and various

226
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:26,219
configurations moving to actually

227
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:29,130
testing those out in range type

228
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,780
environment thankfully I've lost ten

229
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:33,409
years virtualizations come a long way so

230
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:35,850
that testbed automation is significantly

231
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:37,819
faster or many orders of magnitude

232
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:40,740
probably faster than we were originally

233
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:43,260
take some sort of a tool or weapon or

234
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:46,230
whatever you're using and and then out

235
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:49,200
of that come out with models kind of

236
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:51,240
more specifically so we've developed an

237
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,800
automated framework that we use to run

238
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,360
the tests lots of people have test beds

239
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,699
it doesn't matter what one you're using

240
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,160
the goal is that you want lots of data

241
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,200
right so you want to be able to take

242
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,360
these different tools run them against

243
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,610
various systems measure their

244
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,200
performance at a low level and then

245
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:10,850
actually from that you can start to

246
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,850
derive their performance

247
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,899
we've also done some work in how to

248
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:16,910
measure statistically significant sample

249
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:18,110
sizes and a point I'm going to talk

250
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,339
about later but just in case I forget

251
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,579
because I don't think it's on our slides

252
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:24,470
a huge driver for us is understanding

253
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:26,719
the confidence of the predictions and

254
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:28,939
the data that were colliding so we may

255
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,619
have an answer for some tool and say hey

256
00:09:28,939 --> 00:09:33,679
this tool work against this target

257
00:09:30,619 --> 00:09:35,480
system with 95 percent and 10 percent

258
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:37,759
confidence you're right

259
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,709
that pack is that useful for now we only

260
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:41,239
have 10 percent confidence because we've

261
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:43,309
never tested this tool against that type

262
00:09:41,239 --> 00:09:45,110
of target or you don't know if it's

263
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:46,368
Windows XP so it's back to your three or

264
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:48,319
four you just know it's a Windows

265
00:09:46,369 --> 00:09:50,839
machine ok so that's not super helpful

266
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:52,910
so what that does that would actually

267
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:54,619
drive what sort of intelligence you

268
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:57,499
might need to match this tool against

269
00:09:54,619 --> 00:09:58,730
that target to make better decisions and

270
00:09:57,499 --> 00:10:00,559
again of course on the defensive side

271
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:02,959
flipping everything around because we

272
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:05,988
think you have to do both sides if you

273
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,399
know this attack tool this apt framework

274
00:10:05,989 --> 00:10:10,100
that you're using or Metasploit or

275
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,569
whatever works against this tool they

276
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,069
have the same problem about what if they

277
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:16,399
think you're running so if you can

278
00:10:13,069 --> 00:10:18,259
change that information and provide some

279
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,230
level of ambiguity about what you're

280
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:22,369
running or live system there's obviously

281
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,259
a lot of work in moving target defense

282
00:10:22,369 --> 00:10:26,209
where you're trying to flip what system

283
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:27,919
you're running you can see what kind of

284
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:30,880
an impact that has to the attacker tool

285
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:33,699
attacker model

286
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,470
so what is a tool so these are some of

287
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,930
the things we've tested so far well most

288
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:39,490
of our work so far has been focused on

289
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:41,709
exploits so you're on a machine you're

290
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:43,870
attacking this machine you launch an

291
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:45,160
exploit against a target we've also

292
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,660
looked the payloads which are things

293
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,060
that that exploit we then drop on the

294
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:51,279
target which would have some effect we

295
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:54,219
are starting a new program right now

296
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:57,430
looking at network based attacks so

297
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:59,680
things like fishing campaigns credential

298
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:01,660
grabbing on the network passive

299
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,069
techniques that are so active techniques

300
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,660
like fishing right you're sending emails

301
00:11:03,069 --> 00:11:06,399
to people who's going to click it what

302
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,399
machine you get access to and then

303
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,290
passive techniques looking at

304
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:14,079
intercepting Sam files driving

305
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:15,579
credentials on the wire poisoning would

306
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,310
be a network attack we're trying to

307
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:19,839
reroute traffic and these are just some

308
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:23,258
of the examples we have a long list

309
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:27,550
we've tested north of 30 different types

310
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:28,690
of tools so we started with 4 5 15 20

311
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,729
different tools and we're trying to get

312
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:33,069
to the next level of more atomic tools

313
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:35,170
so instead of viewing as a tool can be

314
00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:37,089
many things many steps right and we're

315
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,860
running in different configurations we

316
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:40,959
would like to get to a more atomic level

317
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:44,769
where you're actually looking at open

318
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:48,369
file write to memory open socket you

319
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:50,139
know run this password cracking module

320
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:51,880
and break those down into smaller pieces

321
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:52,930
and each step would be smaller and

322
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,949
smaller pieces they're actually

323
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:56,380
measuring things that are more of an

324
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:59,139
atomic level as opposed to a lot too

325
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:02,140
which comprise is comprised of a bunch

326
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:04,090
of smaller operations

327
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:09,819
all right so here's a chart with lots of

328
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:11,200
pretty pictures talking about so on the

329
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,550
top left we have some of the ways we

330
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,370
divisional I should have a better chart

331
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:17,709
later on which I'll show you you can use

332
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:19,180
that data for making decisions and where

333
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:21,070
the scores compose to see a little pie

334
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,020
chart which again you can't read right

335
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,760
now the basically it shows you where a

336
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:26,710
score how that score is calculated

337
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,960
because of the different element so it

338
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:31,480
has this many packets per second it like

339
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,250
through unique port it uses this a

340
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,860
particular signature that you could

341
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:37,760
detect and that's what's driving those

342
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,760
scores

343
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,470
mission planning so also not on this

344
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,420
chart I have visualization charts that

345
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,830
are on different tools can be compared

346
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,410
so you can try to decide which tool is

347
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:50,120
more effective for different operation

348
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:52,640
one tool might work great but take a

349
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,140
long time so a loading slow model

350
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,840
another one might you want to go full

351
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,800
speed but it has a higher probability

352
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,550
there's a lot more noisy so you're

353
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,550
trying to make those trade-offs

354
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:06,579
all right so this is a graphic kind of

355
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:08,800
talking to our test process so on the

356
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:11,760
left hand side you'll see a graphic and

357
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,500
it's kind of hard to see here the fees

358
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,390
up here actually this is all like a drag

359
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:20,110
and drop this we wrote a meta overlay on

360
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:24,160
top of the VMware management or

361
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:25,930
deployment GUI so what we do is you can

362
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,370
drag on you want in a bunch of machine

363
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,349
you want Windows 7 you want some

364
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:31,510
browsers you're on a Windows XP machine

365
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,970
you can say how many of those you want

366
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:36,640
you can say we want 50 of these ten of

367
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:38,530
those five of those ten of those drag

368
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,350
and drop you pick what applications you

369
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:43,420
want on each target what if you've got a

370
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:45,370
network card or what kind of router is a

371
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:47,620
static or dynamic what IP address you

372
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:49,540
want and basically you can do that let's

373
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,910
drag and drop from the GUI this is again

374
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:54,189
evolution over you know a decade of

375
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:56,380
testing or it used to be manually guys

376
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:58,570
sitting there and going out to the range

377
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:01,300
plugging things in now we've pushed it

378
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:03,460
all so it always done and vSphere and

379
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,949
then we put this overlay on top so we

380
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:07,390
can build the images we want hit the Go

381
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:09,550
button and it'll actually push and it'll

382
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:11,380
have our sensors automatically deploy it

383
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:13,329
on each machine to be test at the

384
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:16,030
network and the host level so we have

385
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:17,110
sensors we used to run inside the

386
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:19,000
operating system we've now pushed

387
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:21,490
everything into VMware so we actually

388
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,440
use their native API calls so we can do

389
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:25,510
VM introspection into the hosts so that

390
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,160
where we're trying to not make sure we

391
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:29,890
provide any artifacts inside the host

392
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:32,140
image so all the sensors are on their

393
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:33,819
different attacks can be deployed and

394
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:36,160
this is all pushed now downside is is

395
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,630
this is still done by somebody dragging

396
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,150
and dropping and then hitting the button

397
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:42,160
but you can build it run the test in 20

398
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:43,270
minutes potentially unless of course you

399
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,329
have a longer attack you're trying to

400
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:48,430
model the goal is in the future that

401
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:50,200
will actually have a kind of a meta test

402
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:53,290
tool on top of that where you can say

403
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:56,050
either propagating one so give me

404
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:58,900
something with 25 subnets and static and

405
00:14:56,050 --> 00:15:00,939
dynamic IP ranges non-routable address

406
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,380
ranges perimeter defenses or whatever

407
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,900
and it will actually build the network

408
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,950
for you in different permutations rez

409
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,020
right now you've got

410
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:09,340
we do I can draw figure out what your

411
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,500
network diagram looks like and build

412
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,990
those networks yourself what you're

413
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,430
doing it all graphically and this was a

414
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:18,580
much simpler process than it was

415
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:21,910
historically and then how the test

416
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:25,090
process works this is all done again

417
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:26,800
automatically from this interface so it

418
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:30,190
will transfer the tools for the client

419
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,540
set up their sensors a Windows

420
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,820
performance monitor on are something we

421
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:35,110
used to use with like a sis internals

422
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:38,560
processor and that's all been pushed

423
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:40,360
down to the down to VMware so that's

424
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,339
actually out of date and then start the

425
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,130
data collection run the tool on whatever

426
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:46,330
system or tools that you're running

427
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:48,490
monitor that at the network and the host

428
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:49,770
level stop the data collection convert

429
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:52,030
the data pull all the data is over

430
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:54,040
identify was over we collect gigabytes

431
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:56,319
of data in a single tasks obviously

432
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,780
those get compressed and then you run it

433
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,970
through the computational engine and

434
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:02,199
I've got some sample times and again

435
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:03,790
these are out-of-date when the engineers

436
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,380
like oh we've got master times we've

437
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:08,400
compressed it but it gives you an idea

438
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:11,860
it could take 20 minutes to run the tool

439
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:15,360
70 minutes depending on what how long

440
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,360
your test is and how much data you have

441
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,759
okay so talking about hypervisor sensors

442
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:24,550
we actually build our own hypervisor for

443
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,319
security applications but we actually

444
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,449
aren't using our hypervisor because it's

445
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:30,160
all built into VMware currently we might

446
00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:34,420
push it in if that makes sense down the

447
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,889
road but for now we're just using VMware

448
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:38,860
for their introspection calls we'll look

449
00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:43,689
at memory port access about register

450
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:46,500
access interrupts and any hooking that

451
00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:46,500
goes on as well

452
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:54,220
okay so what do we so once we have that

453
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:56,379
information we want to run our

454
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,629
experiment we'll do our set assignment

455
00:16:56,379 --> 00:17:01,149
engine which is basically matching a

456
00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:02,649
tool against the target and try to make

457
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:04,269
those predictive claims say does this

458
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:06,309
tool work against this target and with

459
00:17:04,269 --> 00:17:08,919
what probability of success what

460
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:12,129
collateral damages occur against these

461
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:14,169
types of target tool target matches make

462
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:16,029
predictions about future systems and say

463
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:17,350
ok for an arbitrary system who do we

464
00:17:16,029 --> 00:17:19,000
think would happen against the system we

465
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:20,708
haven't tested against what kind of

466
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,359
confidence do we have of those claims

467
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:24,370
and then we'll run experiment since

468
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:26,079
actually say ok we thought it would work

469
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:28,928
this well we tested Windows XP service

470
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,070
pack 2 & 3 but not four we know these

471
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:31,240
are the changes what do we think would

472
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,168
happen then we can actually run those

473
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,730
and say ok

474
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:35,620
our prediction was actually it was

475
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:37,990
pretty good or we missed it because we

476
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:40,360
didn't incorporate you know changes in

477
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:42,750
you know SLR depth that were added now

478
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,370
that effect these this class of tools

479
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:48,129
and then run our final results and that

480
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:50,199
actually helps modify the accuracy of

481
00:17:48,129 --> 00:17:52,559
our prediction and wait our accuracy

482
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,559
claims

483
00:17:54,390 --> 00:18:01,440
so this is an example of decision trees

484
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:03,090
for the decision-making process so you

485
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,320
can say okay what service pack is it

486
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,929
running

487
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,070
mean squared error calculations and this

488
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,390
is something that's all generated

489
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:11,010
automatically we did a lot of machine

490
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,630
learning posted a bunch of different

491
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:14,640
approaches to this actually and the

492
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:17,670
passes though is ongoing every time we

493
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,830
start a new section of research one of

494
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:21,720
our goals is to break the model right we

495
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,610
start off saying okay how can we break

496
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,710
the model that we have now because what

497
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:27,360
does it not do so one thing we added and

498
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:29,070
we're doing right now is we're adding a

499
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,300
whole suite of defensive tools so we

500
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:33,450
were testing with fairly simplistic

501
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:36,030
defenses how we had a simple Navy

502
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:38,700
package like snort for intrusion

503
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,990
detection and maybe a couple of network

504
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,000
defenses as well the next version we're

505
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:44,430
adding tons of network defenses and like

506
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,740
the top 10 or 12 AV packages to make

507
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:48,330
sure we're testing all a battery of

508
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,190
those for every single task to make sure

509
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:52,889
that the test is more comprehensive and

510
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:54,930
more realistic of who might find against

511
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:56,670
the target and again as a defender

512
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:58,680
saying okay what are my options what

513
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,910
might I run for my enterprise to secure

514
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,590
my network and how is it going to

515
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:03,710
perform against the real-world kinds of

516
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:05,720
threats you might encounter

517
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:07,370
so this is an eye chart just showing you

518
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:10,640
the different types of representation we

519
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:13,669
have on the top right you see an example

520
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:16,010
of to its performance some sensor data

521
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:17,630
over time so you can see activity by

522
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:19,040
that tool when we booked and will

523
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:20,360
actually go through and break down okay

524
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,490
what was the tool doing at this given

525
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,719
point in time what was happening on the

526
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:26,210
network what was happening on the host

527
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,550
and and then see we can actually

528
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:30,580
calculate things like how covert it was

529
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:33,440
over time what activity was occurring

530
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:35,090
this is kind of a trade you can't read

531
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,430
these but it says Friends of Discovery

532
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:39,530
collateral damage attribution so

533
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:41,630
basically this is a metric for trying to

534
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:43,100
say how well does the tool perform in

535
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:46,160
these various dimensions at the same

536
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,899
time the same thing here is a different

537
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,260
way of representing the pie chart versus

538
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:53,480
a bar chart and a little GUI for picking

539
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:55,940
different tools against you can see the

540
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:59,240
test run data well you can't really read

541
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:00,530
it here with this resolution but these

542
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,000
are the different dimensions you might

543
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:04,600
be you might care about in terms of how

544
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,280
spell Theo tool is or how noisy it is

545
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,050
probably of success and then different

546
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,200
test runs you can actually see the raw

547
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:13,700
data as well as the roll-up and then up

548
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,010
here is another example of that again I

549
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,230
mentioned the pie charts would show you

550
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:20,060
these show right here over test runs

551
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,920
against various images how they

552
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,940
performed and so you can actually drill

553
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,950
down into the data if you want to

554
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:28,649
understand what the numbers came from

555
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:30,419
all right so now I'm going to turn to

556
00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:32,309
talking about the defensive side so

557
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:34,350
again we started building taking these

558
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:36,510
penetration testing tools attack tools

559
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:39,059
measuring their performance building

560
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:40,529
tables to analyze how they behave let me

561
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:43,168
turn the start saying okay what can you

562
00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:44,549
do against on the defensive side so

563
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:48,990
first thing we did was started to

564
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:51,360
represent the network as a software kind

565
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:54,299
of a software program level and then try

566
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,279
to predict an attractiveness score so

567
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:58,200
these look like very simplistic networks

568
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:01,019
the reality is networks look more like

569
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,389
that so we have very complex network

570
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:05,760
laydowns that we're loading in from

571
00:21:03,389 --> 00:21:07,709
real-world enterprise networks from some

572
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,470
of our customers and they pull that data

573
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:14,100
in and and will include everything from

574
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:16,230
firewalls routers encrypt errs intrusion

575
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,449
detection systems Windows Linux systems

576
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:21,389
and then actually put those into a

577
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:23,850
connection graph showing what's going on

578
00:21:21,389 --> 00:21:26,559
in the network which is of course very

579
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:30,860
easy to read as you can see

580
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:34,789
so right now our network attractiveness

581
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:36,769
score isn't based on the work we've done

582
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:38,230
on the offensive side directly so the

583
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:41,059
goal is eventually we can take

584
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:43,279
abstracted attack tool classes so you

585
00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:46,370
can say nation state versus organized

586
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:48,769
crime versus you know pen testing team

587
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:50,899
versus a script Kitty versus an insider

588
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:52,370
we understand we've characterized the

589
00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:53,899
types of tools that those organizations

590
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:55,549
would have and type of tradecraft how

591
00:21:53,899 --> 00:21:57,500
they combine those and you would use

592
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:59,658
those against your your target Network

593
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,340
right now we're kind of coming out of

594
00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:03,049
the other way on the defensive side

595
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:05,178
saying okay there are some of the things

596
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:07,269
that we know from our testing might

597
00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:10,490
matter so how permissive is our firewall

598
00:22:07,269 --> 00:22:13,580
what ports are open what can be reached

599
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:17,210
from what node what kind of diversity do

600
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:18,710
you have in terms in terms of variety in

601
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:21,350
the network if you can hit one systems I

602
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:24,889
mean you get all of them I was kind of

603
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:26,689
dangers a point about network diversity

604
00:22:24,889 --> 00:22:28,428
and then what countermeasures are there

605
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:31,630
which is basically a summarized version

606
00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:31,630
at the number of Defense's

607
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,679
so we'll have an attractiveness

608
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:40,350
framework where you can look at score

609
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,389
requests so this is a network layer

610
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:47,580
where you can actually query the system

611
00:22:42,389 --> 00:22:50,729
GlassFish is a java service and then a

612
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,840
visualization engine an HTML alright so

613
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:53,700
why do you care what would you use this

614
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,369
for so the goal would be that you can

615
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,899
look at a network in near real time to

616
00:22:56,369 --> 00:22:58,678
see what changing in your network life

617
00:22:57,899 --> 00:23:01,168
there's a lot of tools out there

618
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:03,239
probably far better than what research

619
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:05,129
we've been doing that you can actually

620
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:07,230
monitor changes valdes between your

621
00:23:05,129 --> 00:23:09,119
system but then the goal would be

622
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:11,519
actually ranking those and trying to say

623
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:13,799
okay what is the quantitative impact how

624
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:15,179
do you actually predict the performance

625
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:16,859
of this configuration versus this

626
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:18,109
configuration for various types of

627
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:21,299
attack tools

628
00:23:18,109 --> 00:23:22,859
is it better to and could you say you

629
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:24,929
liked well run what-if scenarios say

630
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:27,559
okay if I crank the sensitivity on my

631
00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:29,909
intrusion detection system from 3 to a 5

632
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:31,859
my false positive rate went up

633
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:33,330
significantly after a whole other

634
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:36,658
analysts to sit there and prune to all

635
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:39,418
this data and it changed the probability

636
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:41,609
of detecting attacks by 2 percent ok

637
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:43,289
they're not a good investment right do I

638
00:23:41,609 --> 00:23:45,149
have all the things where if I switch so

639
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:47,129
I just shut down this service that's

640
00:23:45,149 --> 00:23:49,080
running and expose them a network or

641
00:23:47,129 --> 00:23:51,209
maybe I sat in this other product that

642
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,639
I'm completely considering I might have

643
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:55,409
a massive impact on this attack to a

644
00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:56,789
probability of success now I can

645
00:23:55,409 --> 00:23:58,139
actually make that quantified decision

646
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:59,639
say ok that's an investment that I want

647
00:23:58,139 --> 00:24:01,678
to make as opposed to making it because

648
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:03,449
they're the guys telling me this you

649
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,739
know product is really nice he's a buddy

650
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,970
of mine he says it's gonna be great so

651
00:24:04,739 --> 00:24:07,799
I'm gonna buy it and blow up my network

652
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:11,029
which is kind of the current model and

653
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:11,029
very qualitatively driven

654
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,720
all right and the future of data-driven

655
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,020
and security qualification so I've got

656
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:22,730
some more points on this I could add but

657
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:24,170
so I mentioned the GUI used to build and

658
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,940
run tests in the future I think you're

659
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:28,580
gonna have an automated test network

660
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,900
generation doc I had this program called

661
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,820
the National Cyber range that was

662
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:34,100
supposed to develop a lot of technology

663
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:35,510
to automate the test process it didn't

664
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,669
quite achieve the vision that they were

665
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:39,320
hoping for but that work is still

666
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:42,170
happening at a number of places there's

667
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:43,850
labs academic organizations and

668
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:46,100
commercial groups like ours that are

669
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:49,480
building that process and I think in the

670
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:51,800
next five years maybe less maybe more

671
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,600
you'll actually see automated tests for

672
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,820
network generation that you can specify

673
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,709
what you're trying to test that a build

674
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,750
those networks out on a virtualized

675
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:02,780
environment with some bare metal systems

676
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:04,160
as well based on your test criteria so

677
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:07,408
then you can run the test in a nearly

678
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:09,850
fully autonomous fashion

679
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:13,059
also talking about tool and

680
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:14,620
configurations I mentioned our very tool

681
00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:16,629
centric so we'll test tools and we have

682
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:22,209
some smaller tools that are kind of like

683
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:23,860
level tools or things that are like file

684
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:25,659
read and write but you'd like to get

685
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,889
lower and lower and our goal is I mean

686
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:31,000
it's probably not gonna get down to like

687
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:34,149
the assembly level instruction level but

688
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,250
you'd like to get down to the lowest

689
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:37,959
level that makes sense for testing tool

690
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,039
performance so that way the goal would

691
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,899
be that you could take a new tool that

692
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,870
you haven't analyzed before or a new

693
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:47,020
defense and then say ok this like that

694
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:49,539
Kaspersky antivirus replaces the tcp/ip

695
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:51,039
stack in Windows so because it does that

696
00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:52,629
we know it will break these types of

697
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,890
attacks and have this type of

698
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:55,390
performance against tools it maybe

699
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:56,649
you've never even tested before but just

700
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:58,990
because you understand things at that

701
00:25:56,649 --> 00:26:01,389
level of granularity you can use a

702
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:03,490
taxonomy and characterize the tool scan

703
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:04,990
the scanner tools performance and say ok

704
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:07,000
I know this would break this whole

705
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,899
category of attack tools just because of

706
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,840
this one technique that they're

707
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:13,510
employing as opposed to I tested these

708
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,500
25 versions of the tool here's a 26 I

709
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:16,240
don't really know what that's going to

710
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,399
do you'd like to understand that as a

711
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,210
more atomic level but that takes time

712
00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:23,590
obviously and significant data analysis

713
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:25,419
as i mentioning environment so right now

714
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:27,399
we want to test the network that you're

715
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:29,710
targeting doesn't change so as a

716
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:31,570
defender was an attacker on this side

717
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:33,100
you want to understand what happens if

718
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:35,020
there are real-time changes going on in

719
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,699
the middle of the test right in the real

720
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:38,408
world when you're running an attack you

721
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,970
don't just run that one tool stop and

722
00:26:38,409 --> 00:26:41,559
then the whole thing is over there's a

723
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:42,940
give-and-take that happens where all

724
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:44,980
this phishing campaign didn't work so

725
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:47,169
you try changing some commands maybe you

726
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:48,429
got a presence on one system and pivot

727
00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:50,350
and you're on another system and then

728
00:26:48,429 --> 00:26:51,909
you might go stealthy for a while and

729
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:54,610
then they're extolling date over time

730
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:56,289
something else might happen so we'd like

731
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:58,750
to do is be able to model those changes

732
00:26:56,289 --> 00:27:01,419
over time but for now we're just trying

733
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:03,669
to get to kind of that individual tool

734
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:05,150
target pairing and making decisions

735
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:07,520
there

736
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:08,900
and then finally another point is humans

737
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,460
I was mentioning the research to someone

738
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,350
yesterday he said what do you do about

739
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:13,820
the human right so your intrusion

740
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:15,620
detection system right you saw that

741
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,970
would target nodes other attacks it

742
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:19,280
might be lighting up like a Christmas

743
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:20,870
tree flagging the attack is going on but

744
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,000
if the operator is not sitting there and

745
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:24,800
doesn't do anything with the data

746
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,930
doesn't matter so the answer is we're

747
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,970
gonna do anything with that right now

748
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:30,920
we're trying to say ok what what is the

749
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:32,450
surface area of your network how

750
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,710
vulnerable is it potentially to attack

751
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,820
what are the tools caching what are they

752
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:36,110
not caching

753
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:38,360
but the goal would be eventually you

754
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:40,040
could have kind of human factor

755
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:42,469
representation both for the attacker I

756
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,330
mentioned the attacker potential classes

757
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:46,220
like script kiddie versus nation-state

758
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:48,559
how well do they combine the tools that

759
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:51,080
they're using how well do they write

760
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,910
those phishing emails and also on the

761
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,590
defensive side saying ok how well do you

762
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,730
think your team is going to perform and

763
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,678
you can actually get real data if you

764
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:59,000
run red team operations you might have

765
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,410
some data that you collect in your

766
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,750
individual enterprise network that you

767
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:05,390
could feed into this tool to predict ok

768
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:06,620
even prior exercises we know they caught

769
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,970
these kinds of things they did

770
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:09,860
understand what was happening in the

771
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:11,179
alert log as opposed to now they

772
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,770
actually missed everything in there was

773
00:28:11,179 --> 00:28:14,480
tons of data pointing to the attack and

774
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:16,340
they missed all of them but you can

775
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,740
incorporate that into a future model and

776
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:20,600
say ok this is actually our environment

777
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:22,760
or you could have representative cases

778
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,949
if you have enough data but again so

779
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:26,780
much of this is about data I think

780
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:29,480
there's a huge need for publicly

781
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:30,678
available data for test networks and

782
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,390
absolutely most people don't want to

783
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:34,520
share that yeah we have restrictions

784
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:36,650
from our sponsors who are funding the

785
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,610
research or things we do internally and

786
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:39,679
the more data you have the more

787
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:42,309
realistic you can make these and the

788
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,309
less abstract

789
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:49,409
so just to wrap up significant advances

790
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:51,179
have been made in measuring and

791
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:53,930
quantifying the effectiveness of attack

792
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:57,750
tools like I said this research started

793
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:59,310
2004 probably 2005 and it's still not

794
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:01,110
done yet it I wouldn't say this is

795
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:03,000
something you can deploy tomorrow and

796
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:05,399
it's gonna solve all your problems

797
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,490
but I do you think I know for a fact we

798
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:10,410
can predict exploit tools against

799
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:12,960
particular targets and actually tell you

800
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:14,430
with real confidence in probability of

801
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,800
success of this exploit against that

802
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:18,870
system in this configuration with

803
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,040
certain defenses right and the goal is

804
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:21,419
we're gonna start adding more and more

805
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,320
complexity of that over the next few

806
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,850
years to the point where you actually

807
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,649
could start using it in a penetration

808
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:27,330
testing engagement you might say okay

809
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:30,030
which tool that I want to use against

810
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:31,679
the system or as a defender say okay wow

811
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:34,200
if they're using this tool they could

812
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:36,950
actually hit all these boxes and you can

813
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,420
actually incorporate more kind of a

814
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:42,780
probabilistic understanding as opposed

815
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:44,460
to a boolean well there's a CVE and this

816
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,750
systems not patched so therefore they

817
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:49,040
can reach this target which is kind of

818
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:51,600
the current model that people use

819
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:53,180
complete automation of the testing

820
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,129
process I think is gonna be possible

821
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:57,570
again to mention there they've got the

822
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:59,630
the cyber grand challenge where they're

823
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:03,090
actually trying to do fully autonomous

824
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:04,830
attacking and patching of binaries I

825
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:07,110
think that's an example of the movement

826
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:08,490
towards automation we're big fans of

827
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:10,379
machine learning and artificial

828
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:12,270
intelligence being applied to the

829
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:14,490
computer security problem to help make

830
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:17,490
things less manual and kind of more

831
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:19,080
autonomous and I think moving it towards

832
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:21,930
real-time monitoring of the network

833
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,370
state and both planning for your

834
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:25,290
defensive posture and also real-time

835
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:26,760
monitoring it's kind of where this is

836
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,649
going to end up moving as this kind of

837
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,570
technology moves out of the lab I moves

838
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:33,070
and kind of fuses more with the applied

839
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:36,159
products you see out there now

840
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:41,330
that's all the material I had any

841
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:43,830
questions comments Tomatoes

842
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:46,908
that's it

843
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:46,908
all right thanks
