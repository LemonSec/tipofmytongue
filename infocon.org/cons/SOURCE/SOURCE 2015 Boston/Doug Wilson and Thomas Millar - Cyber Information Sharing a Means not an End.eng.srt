1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,640
[Applause]

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,119
oh it's a leader so uh yeah I'm Tom

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,269
alarm

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,849
I'm from us-cert I've been there for

5
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:15,240
about seven years all told at this point

6
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:18,119
all of this current administration and a

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,680
little bit of the preceding one I have

8
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,710
been described as a force for continuity

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,590
because us surveys kind of infamous for

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,990
its turnover rate I'm the chief of

11
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,490
communications there and before I get

12
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,570
too heavy to my introduction l-let me

13
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,360
explain a little bit about the talk

14
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:36,270
actually what we decided to do was we're

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,519
gonna try and do this um somewhere in

16
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,530
between a presentation and a panel where

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,710
Doug and I are both modest I am I'm the

18
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,090
moderator for Doug and his one-man panel

19
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,550
and doug is the moderator for Tom's

20
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,010
one-man panel so we have a series of

21
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,288
topics that we think are salient for

22
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,699
information-sharing and the problem is

23
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:55,410
we've observed it over the years and

24
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:57,329
we're gonna basically going to ping-pong

25
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,788
back and forth as we go through each

26
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:02,820
topic you'll hear my side of the story

27
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:04,820
you'll hear Doug's perspective initially

28
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,170
I think we were going to be much more

29
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:08,610
choreographed and try and do this that's

30
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,250
me on the left

31
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,229
Doug is on the right much more

32
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,880
choreographed and the plank sort of

33
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:17,400
good-cop bad-cop about information

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,548
sharing then we realized that sometimes

35
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,549
we basically both you know sometimes we

36
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:25,170
agree for different reasons on various

37
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,720
issues we see with the state of practice

38
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,780
and you'll get to hear from us as we go

39
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,850
through the various pieces yeah so in

40
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,560
historic context tom is usually the

41
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,298
curmudgeon and I've been the idealist

42
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,799
and it's funny though because when Josh

43
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,590
asked me to give this talk I realized

44
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,210
that um my idealism is somewhere on the

45
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,939
floor having been trampled with cleats

46
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,798
and limping towards the hospital room at

47
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:48,000
this point in time at the same time

48
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,549
though I'm still doing this and I'm

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,979
still trying to do this as Josh

50
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,530
mentioned I was the open IOC guy I still

51
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:58,619
am the open IOC guy for fire I now

52
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:01,500
previously mandiant but it's interesting

53
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,430
because you know I came out in 2011 with

54
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,320
yeah let's do this

55
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,439
awesome sharing thing it was wonderful

56
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,038
and it's very interesting because at

57
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,510
that time I had great expectations

58
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:13,579
and the community kind of threw it under

59
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:17,298
a bus and I think over time that's kind

60
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:19,489
of swapped I think now having fought the

61
00:02:17,299 --> 00:02:21,019
Battle of sharing and trying to get

62
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:23,390
threat intelligence and other stuff

63
00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:25,069
shared and again so you're going to hear

64
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,220
us use terms interchangeably er in here

65
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:31,190
threat intelligence threat information

66
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:32,780
it just Intel in general I knew there

67
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,790
are fine points and people might want to

68
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,709
quibble about those save that till the

69
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,328
QA there are definite distinctions we'll

70
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:39,680
probably use them interchangeably just

71
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:40,400
because we're up here being glib

72
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,000
smartasses

73
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,519
but yeah so I mean I spend a lot of time

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,900
lobbying for this and took a lot of you

75
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:49,819
know bruising to the ego because

76
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,739
initially everyone's like so what and

77
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:53,690
what's interesting is sharing has now

78
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:55,430
morphed into an overloaded buzzword to

79
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,780
the point that everybody at RSA thinks

80
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,459
that hey this is gonna solve all the

81
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,590
problems and I'm the guys that are going

82
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:03,799
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa sharing it's

83
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,819
it's got some it's got some issues so we

84
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:07,459
will see some interesting counterpoint

85
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:09,170
here hopefully because traditionally a

86
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:11,299
couple years ago I was the guy going yes

87
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:13,010
then tom was a guy going wait and now

88
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:14,030
we've sort of switched roles on some

89
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,929
issues and it's funny though because

90
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,639
there's one thing later in the

91
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,169
presentation I'm like and here's exactly

92
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,840
how it works and Tom's like and that's

93
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:22,419
what's wrong with things today so so

94
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,449
yeah we're here to talk about sharing

95
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:29,120
and it's interesting because I think

96
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:31,280
what people mean when they say sharing

97
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,290
is very different things and I think

98
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,470
that that is one of the problems that we

99
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:38,209
have is that a lot of terms in this

100
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,459
industry like share and get really

101
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:42,199
overloaded somebody has a specific

102
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:43,639
meeting they have for it and then they

103
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:45,230
want to improve on it and then

104
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:47,109
everybody's like hey this sells products

105
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:49,129
and they start using it and everything

106
00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:51,620
so as I mentioned I'm a little bit on

107
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:53,629
the bitter side I think that honestly a

108
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,909
lot of people when they say sharing

109
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:57,980
right now they really want a free threat

110
00:03:55,909 --> 00:03:59,298
until fee they're like yeah I like Intel

111
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,940
sharing that means I get free threat

112
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:04,010
Intel right I think then there's a

113
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,750
slightly smaller group of people that

114
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,510
don't actually mean sharing they mean

115
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:10,190
very tightly controlled dissemination of

116
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,239
information and so like well share but

117
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,799
I'm only going to share with these three

118
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:14,599
people if I can make sure this

119
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,010
information only goes two steps that

120
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:18,469
this person can't use this information

121
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,880
for that and this particular package is

122
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:21,880
only seen by these five organizations

123
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:25,360
and then I think

124
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,710
there's a much smaller herb who are the

125
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,800
group who I think have kind of got it

126
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:31,630
right where basically what they want is

127
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,970
they want an ecosystem or a feedback

128
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:35,980
loop where you have a set of resources

129
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,210
ideally threat intelligence but there's

130
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:40,000
also going to be data and other pieces

131
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,650
involved which does have controlled

132
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,090
dissemination but it also has this

133
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,130
important distinction of having a

134
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:47,260
feedback loop so that when you're giving

135
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:49,030
the information out you're also hearing

136
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,380
back from other people and that's one of

137
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,599
the reasons it's made me kind of bitter

138
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,469
is you know I am biased I've been

139
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,150
working with the people who've been

140
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,650
putting a lot of effort into getting the

141
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,620
larger systems with the feedback loops

142
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:01,510
out and when we go to try and get other

143
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,100
people to participate a lot of times

144
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,360
what we go is people going hey what are

145
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,340
you gonna give us for free this is

146
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,900
really cool so I developed this view

147
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,090
that there's a lot of people out there

148
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,440
who want a free lunch there's a media

149
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,729
media group of people who have been

150
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,810
switching stuff around for years and

151
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,550
it's kind of work for them but they

152
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,530
don't see a reason to change and then

153
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,870
there's a small group that is really

154
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:22,239
trying to build a relatively complex

155
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:24,880
solution that everybody benefits in a

156
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,750
sort of weird balance of power but it's

157
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,520
really hard to stand up so I think

158
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,500
everybody actually wants the right thing

159
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,599
so when Doug characterizes these sort of

160
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,540
like these three tranches of cyber

161
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,400
information sharing practitioners or one

162
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:43,780
of these or what have you

163
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:46,030
he's actually he's actually like this

164
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,530
forensic man he's kind of describing a

165
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:49,239
customer demographic that I think is

166
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,919
colored by maybe hanging a little bit of

167
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,860
around a little bit too much it you know

168
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:56,440
cynicism generating trade shows and I

169
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,360
totally see that that from certain

170
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,920
vendor communities who you know are in

171
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,690
the business of selling subscriptions to

172
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,390
threat intelligence services and threat

173
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:06,280
intelligence feeds that giving people

174
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:08,020
some sort of like simple indicators to

175
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,960
compromise fee and charging them an

176
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:14,799
annual fee means they exactly think that

177
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,909
people want either free lunch and people

178
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,620
are not going to be part of you know

179
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:20,110
people are not interested in being part

180
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:22,390
of this ecosystem with the feedback loop

181
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:24,070
and all the other good stuff what I see

182
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:26,050
when I talk to people who are in the

183
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:27,370
field and they once you know like get

184
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,820
involved in a sharing community whether

185
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,740
it be one facilitated by my parents

186
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,330
see or another one that's facilitated by

187
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,700
an industry or sector group or even a

188
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:37,650
regional community is that they do all

189
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:40,110
want that feedback loop and people do

190
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:42,690
want to sort of DIY and fend for

191
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:45,630
themselves amongst their trust community

192
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:47,640
what I feel like the gap is is that that

193
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:50,340
kind of trust community the technologies

194
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:53,760
that underpin it the relationships

195
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:56,190
between people that underpin it and and

196
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,599
any sort of like mutual agreements or

197
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,680
other you know paperwork that has to be

198
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,180
signed to make sure that the legal

199
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,800
frameworks are there that can underpin

200
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,990
it and strengthen it those things are

201
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,710
what takes a long time to build even if

202
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:09,750
you for example in you know soulja you

203
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:11,640
know gave their you know their taxi

204
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,290
server to the health care or ice act

205
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,240
whatever right there will be people who

206
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:17,310
have things and they can give them to

207
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,230
you but actually implementing them kind

208
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,120
of like implementing it sim you have to

209
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,710
put some time in some elbow grease and

210
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,690
actually do it right and that takes

211
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,549
effort but it's not that people just

212
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:33,240
want the really simple free stuff people

213
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:35,820
do want the right things okay off the

214
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,830
rails meeting with if you don't know

215
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,780
sticks and taxi are a couple of

216
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:43,260
technical specifications that Homeland

217
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:45,000
Security has invested in their community

218
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,849
lead so there's been a tremendous amount

219
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,030
of private sector input including prone

220
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:52,830
Doug's parent and and they're going to

221
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,059
be going into an actual international

222
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,810
standards body soon which is really

223
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,680
exciting we'll get to that later but

224
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,420
basically their ways of saying like

225
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,340
here's some syntax here's some you know

226
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,980
basic message handling pumpkin functions

227
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,510
here's a way to start building your

228
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,940
automated information sharing and data

229
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:11,900
structures without having to just start

230
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:14,610
from scratch and the financial sector

231
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:16,349
actually saw so much value in this and

232
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:20,820
has been a major driver from the get-go

233
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:22,440
they wrote a server that supports these

234
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,810
technical specifications it's called Sol

235
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,550
truck and actually spun that off from

236
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,440
one of the payment clearing corporations

237
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,960
so soldier is like it's now its own

238
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:34,200
concerned separate from the bank that

239
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,968
birthday so that was actually that the

240
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,150
intellectual property there that taxi

241
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:39,969
sir taxi compatible server that shifts

242
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,909
around cool

243
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:44,769
telogen two things I was provided

244
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:46,689
garroted to the national healthcare

245
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:47,740
Ishak as they were standing up and if

246
00:08:46,689 --> 00:08:49,240
you don't know what I sac is an

247
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,579
information sharing and analysis Center

248
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,709
and we'll get to that as well later yeah

249
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:55,359
and if it's some if it's another clear

250
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:57,758
distinction because a lot of people here

251
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,860
sticks and taxi sticks is how you

252
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,480
describe the threat intelligence taxi is

253
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,269
the suggestion as to how you move that

254
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,399
around so you put something into sticks

255
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:08,379
format and then use taxi to share sticks

256
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,089
with other people so some people think

257
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:11,410
the two are interchangeable they're

258
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:12,879
tightly coupled but they're not

259
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,649
interchangeable you can use sticks

260
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:16,569
without using taxi you use tacks without

261
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:19,120
using sticks but if you hear them use

262
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:21,040
taxis and the transport mechanism sticks

263
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:28,899
is the way of describing fredita

264
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:30,399
so yeah so tom yeah we did so that's

265
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:31,870
another thing too if people do have

266
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,959
questions again we're doing this

267
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:36,519
relatively free form so we do intend to

268
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,229
have some time for Q&A at the end but we

269
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:39,579
also do tend to ramble on so if you want

270
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:42,339
to throw something in there ask feel

271
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:45,750
free so one of the other things in my

272
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:48,069
mind the dark age of my bitterness is is

273
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,809
and this is I think I have this about

274
00:09:48,069 --> 00:09:51,519
pretty much the entire security industry

275
00:09:49,809 --> 00:09:53,589
now not just threat intelligence is the

276
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,529
fact though that when you do go out and

277
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:58,930
you see the places at the field where

278
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:00,309
people are selling things a lot of the

279
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:01,899
selling is going around the fact that

280
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:04,269
most of the people out there want to buy

281
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:06,759
a really simple solution to a complex

282
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:08,649
problem and instead of railing on about

283
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:10,240
vendors and other stuff like that for a

284
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:13,600
long period of time as a reminder I work

285
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,680
for a vendor I just I see that as one of

286
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,089
the problems and I think that's one of

287
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,149
the other fundamental differences that

288
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:20,949
Tom and I have right now is that when

289
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:23,199
you start talking about sharing most

290
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:24,790
people I feel are looking for a very

291
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:27,430
simple solution to a very complex

292
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:29,319
problem and that's one of the

293
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:31,089
fundamental imbalances is we need to get

294
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:33,790
past is especially now that it's being

295
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:34,959
pushed so much you know basically you're

296
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,189
getting pressure from the current

297
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,359
administration you're getting pressure

298
00:10:36,189 --> 00:10:39,219
from vendors who want to make sales

299
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,680
everybody's telling you sharing is the

300
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:44,170
way to go and one of the reasons that I

301
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,849
say whoa now is I a couple years ago was

302
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:47,019
like this is awesome and it's so easy

303
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,149
coming from a fairly complicated

304
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:52,040
technical and organizational standpoint

305
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:54,890
and I found that even starting there

306
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,959
really difficult so I just have this

307
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:58,250
built-in thing which I'm hoping Tom will

308
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,870
help me be bunk during the course of

309
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:02,840
this that the barrier to sharing is

310
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:04,400
often really really high and that's one

311
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,020
of the reasons that I feel it's not as

312
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,060
simple as a lot of people make it out to

313
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,170
be and that's why I'm really wary of the

314
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:18,349
fact that everybody comes out and says

315
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:20,240
the answer to your problem sharing yes

316
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:23,480
this is your this is your DVR comment

317
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:31,580
though if you want that and if not oh

318
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:33,800
well I feel like everybody has to start

319
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,660
somewhere right a lot of conversations

320
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:51,229
especially this time sorry inline

321
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:53,360
heckling exactly so everybody has to

322
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:56,060
start somewhere and what I'd like to see

323
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,340
people get to is sharing the good the

324
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:00,319
good hard stuff right the policies the

325
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,490
processes the mitigations or courses of

326
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,590
action that actually work to protect

327
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:05,150
their network or like you know the type

328
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,530
of the types of ideas we talk about at

329
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:08,449
this conference right like sir here's a

330
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:10,520
better metric than CBS s right share

331
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:12,580
that right I would love for communities

332
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,600
to have those kinds of great

333
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:17,480
conversations that really advance the

334
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,070
state of practice to get there though

335
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,960
and this is where Doug and I were also

336
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:23,990
differing was basically unlike start

337
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,490
with some IPS man right let's here look

338
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,810
here's my black list can you show me

339
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:28,100
your black list great let's make the

340
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,479
black this together look we found out

341
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,490
where there's a major overlap or there's

342
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,620
hardly any overlap we learned something

343
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:34,850
it was something trivial at something

344
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,110
time-sensitive it's something that

345
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:38,540
doesn't maybe have a greatest you know

346
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:40,730
shelf-life and isn't you know edifying

347
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,170
but it is you know hey we were actually

348
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,490
able to email each other some

349
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:45,949
information about our cyber security

350
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:48,080
posture and glean about a tiny nugget

351
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:49,940
from it that's how all of these things

352
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,320
have to begin everything about the

353
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,720
sharing programs that Homeland Security

354
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,430
is pursuing from my perspective is about

355
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,900
giving people in the on-ramp we're

356
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:58,969
trying to facilitate people like sort of

357
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:01,630
having a training wheels etc etc etc and

358
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:04,360
in some cases people do want a simple

359
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:07,150
Ellucian I'm like right because the

360
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,650
point of our special and give them

361
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,910
simple solutions when they want them I'm

362
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,530
not gonna stand in your way and say that

363
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,000
you're not allowed to rewind your

364
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:15,670
television until you can build your own

365
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,410
DVR that was the comment dog with the

366
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,120
frame to use I'm like no but I'm going

367
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,800
to tell you the specifications for the

368
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,420
encoding and all the other different

369
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,579
things that make your DVR work I'm just

370
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:26,439
gonna sell you a DVR let's give you that

371
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:29,080
box and then you can do what you want

372
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,940
with it right the whole idea with sticks

373
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,250
and taxi came from my history with the

374
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,600
miserable information sharing experience

375
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,340
which was that I tried to get the whole

376
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,840
US government to start shipping incident

377
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,540
reports and indicators around in an old

378
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:43,030
older specification called IO death and

379
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:46,030
in my naivete I looked at IO death and I

380
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:47,740
said hey got an RFC number like its RFC

381
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:49,240
fifty seventy it's like on the standards

382
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,460
track that means it must be in all kinds

383
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,780
of products everywhere right I mean the

384
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,220
internet Engineering Task Force doesn't

385
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,319
just publish stuff and nobody's gonna

386
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,370
build running code well yeah somebody

387
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,450
built some running code that actually

388
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:03,070
had ioad up in it in 2003 and asked

389
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:06,130
arcsight where that running code is now

390
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:08,560
so I went around trying to you know

391
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,790
really caning this eyelid F idea to like

392
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,989
a hundred different departments and

393
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,370
agencies all over the government said

394
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,450
this is what we're going to do and we're

395
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,930
all gonna do it together and it'll be

396
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:15,610
great

397
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:17,109
because I'm thinking this is a simple

398
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:19,090
like sort of like leg let's plug in this

399
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,560
X SD and yeah these products are already

400
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:22,650
probably compatible with it because it's

401
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,880
a standards track RFC I mean gosh and

402
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:26,490
all of all my hopes and dreams were

403
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,050
thoroughly crushed into a fine powder

404
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:30,700
because it's nowhere right literally I

405
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:32,140
found the two operational running

406
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,060
instances in the world that regularly

407
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:37,449
used I owed us to ship things around and

408
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,859
this is like circa 2011 and they were

409
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,970
both private sector and both of them

410
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,100
weren't really doing standards-compliant

411
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:43,690
io def they were literally like I needed

412
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:46,210
a shortcut to build my table structures

413
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:48,400
so I just ran like datastore dot py on

414
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:51,310
the XS D from the RFC and then I was

415
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,750
done right like oh so it wasn't about

416
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:54,010
interoperability it was about a shortcut

417
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,910
to a table structure so you could store

418
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:58,780
IP some domains

419
00:14:54,910 --> 00:15:01,750
yeah that's what I did so our idea was

420
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:03,010
sticks in taxi and is built on some of

421
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,320
my lessons and the lessons I learned

422
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:08,230
from that IO def experience which was

423
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,550
let's write some specs and then let's

424
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,990
you know go around to the vendor

425
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:13,859
community and say hey you should support

426
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:15,570
this and then let's recruit people with

427
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,550
your pockets in bigger pocketbooks than

428
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:19,290
even the US government itself from a

429
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,459
cybersecurity investment standpoint and

430
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:23,370
that would be the financial sector the

431
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:25,349
oil sector energy natural gas and get

432
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:27,000
them to say they want sticks and taxi

433
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:29,130
support and cronic lines and you

434
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,480
wouldn't believe how fast big red big

435
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:32,579
yellow and some of the other major

436
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,470
vendors started to pivot and figure this

437
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:35,760
out which is also kind of when Doug got

438
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:37,230
a little bit cynical with us because

439
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,029
it's like you've got all these people

440
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,220
saying yes we support sticks and taxi

441
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:42,689
and nobody really knows what that means

442
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,070
yeah from my point of view we're still

443
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:46,140
in the process of learning how to build

444
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:48,360
a DVR and people are passing around

445
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,769
fifth generation VHS tapes and you can

446
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,190
kind of see the picture if you look

447
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:54,899
carefully so alright so one of the

448
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:56,370
things I found again in the security

449
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:57,750
industry there's a lot of terms I get a

450
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,610
lot of buzz and that often meets that

451
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,079
term gets really really overloaded so I

452
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:02,579
opened up before by saying that a lot of

453
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:04,709
people mean different things by sharing

454
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:06,719
I often find it's useful to go back to

455
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:07,949
what a word actually means by looking it

456
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,050
up in this old fashioned thing called

457
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:12,540
the dictionary although I think use the

458
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:15,479
merriam-webster posed to a brick and

459
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:17,130
mortar book but what's interesting is

460
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,380
again a lot of people think seem to

461
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:21,660
think that sharing connotates you take

462
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:23,910
something from entity X and you give

463
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,589
something to enter to you I and if you

464
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:27,390
look at the definition here or at least

465
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:30,000
the initial definitions here is

466
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:33,000
realistically it's not about transfer

467
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,470
it's about common usage it's about the

468
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,930
fact that you're talking about something

469
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:38,339
that I have instead of me taking it and

470
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,939
giving it at home and I don't have it

471
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:40,709
anymore

472
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,019
I'm actually taking the thing I have and

473
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:44,609
making it so Tom can use part of it so

474
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:47,190
I'm either dividing it or we're both

475
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:49,829
using that same piece of information and

476
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:50,940
I think that's a real subtle distinction

477
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:52,439
but I think that's very important

478
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,930
because it changes how you look at

479
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,670
sharing overall to realize it's not me

480
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,140
giving something it's me taking

481
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:59,910
something I have and making it available

482
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:02,459
for you to use it but that means I still

483
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:05,149
have it I still have buy-in and it is

484
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:11,698
still also partially my responsibility

485
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:13,860
so well so I think it's the it's the

486
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:15,720
fact that it's not something you can

487
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:18,030
just push from one entity to the other

488
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,410
so I think what you're going to hear me

489
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:22,199
say over time as I go through more of

490
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:25,980
these sizes it's bi-directional and it's

491
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:27,870
also asymmetrical but if both parties

492
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,809
are not invested it's not working

493
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:32,549
like if I if us-cert is just pushing

494
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:34,529
information out to constituents that's

495
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:37,260
not sharing that's broadcasting if

496
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:39,960
fireEye is just shipping indicators out

497
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:41,610
to its customers and you know the

498
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,320
customers just kind of take them and

499
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,809
walk off and they never talk again

500
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,960
that's that's publishing that's not

501
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:51,240
sharing so I think that the thing that

502
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,289
really makes this stuff work is you have

503
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,779
to realize if you have a sharing

504
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:56,580
relationship all the parties need to be

505
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:57,600
invested they may be invested for

506
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,779
different reasons and different

507
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,939
motivating factors but the sharing

508
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:04,500
platform content whatever it needs to be

509
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,169
something that both sides are invested

510
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,669
in or it doesn't work I don't think Tom

511
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:13,350
had any real hard arguments against this

512
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:15,210
one don't yes sorry I keep I keep

513
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:19,320
forgetting to get to the good parts so I

514
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:21,690
um we need every scrap yeah and I mean

515
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,760
again so I think that right now what you

516
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:25,470
have is you have a situation those

517
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,490
levels of strata that I described before

518
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:28,919
where you have people who are really

519
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:30,659
interested these complex ecosystems we

520
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:32,730
need to figure out ways to convince the

521
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:34,890
people who want a three fred free threat

522
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:36,120
Intel feed that they should play along

523
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:38,039
with us and that they should do

524
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,330
something compelling the problem is a

525
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,710
lot of times coming from somebody who

526
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:43,379
works for a vendor people like oh you

527
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:44,880
just want to sell your products and I

528
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,730
mean obviously I do because that's how I

529
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,770
make my living but realistically the

530
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:52,440
reason I promote sharing has not ever

531
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:54,418
been for a profit motive it's because we

532
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,120
could get better collectively by doing

533
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:59,640
sharing whereas if we're just looking at

534
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,199
things from profit and sales and silos

535
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,929
the way people have been historically we

536
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,000
don't necessarily get any further so

537
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:07,350
anyhow I think that sharing is going to

538
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,419
have to involve everybody having a

539
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:11,789
vested interest it's good at the

540
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:13,679
asymmetrical you're gonna have different

541
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:15,840
motivating factors but if you can work

542
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,460
those all together it's going to be okay

543
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,049
with that expectation needs to be in

544
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,929
there so many people just think sharing

545
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:23,190
is transfer from A to B or you know

546
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:25,500
something where it's given from one

547
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:30,029
entity to the other and then you walk

548
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:31,770
away so and I think again though I still

549
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:35,210
think that the nature of that

550
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:36,440
conversation is colored because you know

551
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:39,080
few people who are in the room who are

552
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,179
basically selling something as you know

553
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,139
like at the intelligence speed right and

554
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:43,370
there's nothing wrong with selling

555
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,870
threat intelligence means I don't mean

556
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:47,510
to denigrate that business model one bit

557
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:49,729
but the idea is that other people's idea

558
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:51,500
because of various heuristics and biases

559
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,480
and things like that others people's

560
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,640
idea of what information sharing is is

561
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,260
it's like oh it's like a free version of

562
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,419
that thing that guys the booth was

563
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:01,129
telling me about it's not that right

564
00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:02,120
we're trying to get people to understand

565
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:04,970
that it is a different type of

566
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:08,949
relationship that your investment is

567
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:12,260
what matters most and hence this slide

568
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:13,700
is like basically pointing out making

569
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,830
fun a little bit of the government's

570
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,090
position on information sharing or at

571
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,740
least the way people have characterized

572
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,059
it which is not entirely false it's like

573
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:23,630
a private sector give us all your

574
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:26,960
indicators oh you wanted something back

575
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:28,789
hang on for a second now I would say

576
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,020
like we we've done much better in sort

577
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:32,240
of fulfilling our ended a value

578
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:34,600
proposition over over the years but

579
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,190
initially it is very much sort of like a

580
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,199
little bit of an attitude that some

581
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:40,730
people some colleagues of mine will take

582
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,049
which is that we should just get our

583
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:43,220
indicators from everybody or will

584
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:44,629
regulate them giving all their

585
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,799
indicators to us or something like that

586
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:51,260
which i think is a complete non-starter

587
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:52,389
for various reasons all right so what

588
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,820
are the things I think that we've

589
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:57,830
disagreed about is what's involved to

590
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,570
get started in threat information

591
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:01,908
sharing and I don't know that

592
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:03,678
necessarily degree it disagree with Tom

593
00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:05,570
that it's easy to get started it's a

594
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,330
really simple level I just don't know

595
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:11,200
that it really helps very much if you do

596
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:14,809
that and so that's my my bit of cynicism

597
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,309
so I think it was first at there's a ton

598
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:17,330
of maturity models in security field

599
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:19,059
I've heard some people say oh we don't

600
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:21,260
need them for threat intelligence I

601
00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:24,770
apologize if anyone has like the perfect

602
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:26,330
one I know that at the San cyber threat

603
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:27,799
intelligence summit in 2013

604
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:30,500
Lockheed Martin had one that they'll

605
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:32,450
probably copyright I know that Forrester

606
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:35,090
is making one right now and was talking

607
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:37,820
about that at RSA but assume a

608
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:38,928
theoretical threat intelligence maturity

609
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:42,860
model I wasn't going to take the time to

610
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:46,100
do that I think one exists and my

611
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:48,110
concern is that any maturity model you

612
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,010
make for threat intelligence relies on

613
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:50,899
being

614
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:52,879
pretty high along the other maturity

615
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,050
models for your security posture you

616
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,880
have to have insight what's going on

617
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:57,350
your organization gifting the ability to

618
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,790
do something about what's going on

619
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,929
organization all these other things

620
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,940
where if you look at like you don't say

621
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:03,980
it's a scale of zero to five you need to

622
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:06,230
be like a three or a four on all the

623
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,760
other security stuff in my opinion

624
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:11,090
before threat until actually really

625
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:14,780
starts helping you out so I gave a talk

626
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:17,090
a few years back at a forum and in

627
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:19,940
McLean Virginia with a lot of private

628
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:24,169
sector folks there as well and that's

629
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:26,120
how all you have to be and that was a I

630
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:27,440
started the whole thing recently like

631
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,850
all right so you know who in the room

632
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,670
has some threat intelligence that they

633
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:35,230
could share and nobody raised their hand

634
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:37,400
then I said who has a free email account

635
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:39,020
everybody raises their hand like great

636
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,550
you have threat intelligence to share

637
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,379
that's what's a little like red bang

638
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:44,780
button that lets you mark email is

639
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:46,640
phishing is for you know you sharing

640
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:49,399
your threat intelligence with whoever

641
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,170
your email provider is and I'd like

642
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,090
everybody has to start somewhere you

643
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:54,470
can't go up to somebody and tell them

644
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:55,939
like whoa you're only in the seventh

645
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:59,480
grade you're never gonna make it in

646
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:00,920
college you know the maturity model does

647
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,600
exist and I think everything you know

648
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,670
everybody starts at zero and that's fine

649
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,929
and I think you can be at zero and start

650
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:08,150
getting involved in a sharing community

651
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:09,980
and you'll find your way to turn into a

652
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:11,840
contributor or a producer of your own

653
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:13,940
threat intelligence the first step as

654
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,470
Doug put it's really basically hey I

655
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:17,810
think I could glean something from this

656
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:21,590
maybe I should go find some people in a

657
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:22,940
community that I can learn from and you

658
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:25,490
know and I can get started figuring out

659
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:27,920
how I can contribute again if you run a

660
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:29,750
network you probably have some logs you

661
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:32,570
probably have an IDs like some other

662
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:34,430
talks like Mike was talking about before

663
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,980
lunch right isn't fifty thousand IDs

664
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:38,420
feeds from all over the place and

665
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:40,310
because that's what people do you invest

666
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:43,490
in an IDs the IDS produces some kind of

667
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:45,169
output and that is the beginning of some

668
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:46,610
sort of valuable threat intelligence or

669
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,810
maybe threat intelligence isn't the word

670
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:50,479
for that but some kind of valuable

671
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:52,029
information that could be you know

672
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,559
contributed into the pool

673
00:23:52,029 --> 00:23:55,739
the communities collected knowledge and

674
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:57,369
then benefited from so I do

675
00:23:55,739 --> 00:23:58,869
fundamentally disagree with the idea

676
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:00,609
that you have to be like pretty dang

677
00:23:58,869 --> 00:24:03,728
good at cybersecurity before you start

678
00:24:00,609 --> 00:24:05,109
sharing information do I believe that

679
00:24:03,729 --> 00:24:07,119
you should probably be making a lot of

680
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:08,649
other defensive investments before you

681
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:10,779
get you know a threat intelligence feed

682
00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:13,718
from you know you know highfalutin

683
00:24:10,779 --> 00:24:14,710
threat intelligence service vendor yeah

684
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:16,029
there's absolutely a bunch of other

685
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:18,399
stuff you need to make sure you know

686
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:20,379
like I hate this term - but cyber

687
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:21,428
hygiene right those are the types of

688
00:24:20,379 --> 00:24:23,199
things you need to take care of first

689
00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:25,809
then you can you know start making you

690
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,359
know paying in to that threat

691
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:30,879
intelligence kitty but there's no like

692
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:31,899
minimum required awesome risk posture

693
00:24:30,879 --> 00:24:34,748
before you get into an

694
00:24:31,899 --> 00:24:37,718
information-sharing relationship nothing

695
00:24:34,749 --> 00:24:39,929
inside just you're creating tension my

696
00:24:37,719 --> 00:24:39,929
brain

697
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:27,780
it's more about order of operations so I

698
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:29,520
think one might be jumping ahead in

699
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,930
response to your to your argument might

700
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,360
be jumping ahead of myself a little bit

701
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:35,880
in their nose but it's okay - my point

702
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,649
is basically like maybe the way somebody

703
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,690
finds out that like they have a bunch of

704
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:41,790
shadow on shadow IP that is you know

705
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:44,370
like now attack surfaces it's affecting

706
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:45,990
everybody else you know like oh those

707
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,159
unmanaged devices on my network are a

708
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:49,470
real problem for the rest of the

709
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,300
internet and I am you know like I am

710
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:54,240
hosting a bunch of spawn of the devil

711
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:55,830
inside my own you know network maybe

712
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,180
they find out about that because first

713
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:58,500
they decide like hey I heard about this

714
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,820
threat intelligence information sharing

715
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,440
thing that's really cool I'm gonna go to

716
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,570
this big meeting that online security is

717
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,070
facilitating and and find out more about

718
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:06,840
it and they get there and they see

719
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:10,110
somebody give a talk where they say

720
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:12,840
these CBE's are really old and terrible

721
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:14,550
what is wrong with people and they say I

722
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,320
don't know if I have any of those CDs

723
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:18,030
and they go back and they find out so

724
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,980
this is an on-ramp to all kinds of

725
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:21,480
knowledge right if this is what it takes

726
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,490
to get you in the room is to say like

727
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:27,240
hey three three threatened tell then

728
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:29,520
I'll post that on the door wherever so

729
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,050
part of my journey for this because I

730
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,790
mean then realistically doing this talk

731
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:33,990
was that I don't mean to get all

732
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:35,280
philosophical but it's funny because

733
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:37,200
initially when Josh was like hey would

734
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,060
you do this my response was no because

735
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,530
it's you depressing and as time has gone

736
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:42,000
on it's made me think about it

737
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:43,560
differently which is hopefully what I'm

738
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,700
here sharing today and will help you

739
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,610
guys think about it differently as well

740
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,950
but so going back to the idea that it's

741
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:52,409
an asymmetrical relationship my thought

742
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:53,220
is that and again I mean I hate to sound

743
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,840
elitist but

744
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,210
there are a lot of people who don't

745
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:59,280
really contribute threat Intel but

746
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:03,419
pretty much everybody can contribute

747
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:04,408
data that can become threat Intel and to

748
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:06,120
me that's that's an important

749
00:27:04,409 --> 00:27:07,799
distinction and it's hard to say that

750
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,539
politely though and somebody's like oh I

751
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:11,908
what did you threaten tell sharing and

752
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:13,799
you're kind of like well you know that's

753
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:15,390
nice but I'm not going to trust anything

754
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,799
you send me we get into trust that's a

755
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:18,240
very important part of it later but

756
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,280
there'll be some great data points for

757
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,200
my people analyzed who I do trust and do

758
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,428
something with and again so the trick

759
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,380
then becomes trying to figure out the

760
00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:27,030
proper motivating factors to get the

761
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,770
different parties at the different

762
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:30,270
maturity and trust levels to the table

763
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:34,440
so that they can all contribute at the

764
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:36,990
same time so so one of the things that

765
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,700
also bobble up in this though is that we

766
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:40,770
you know people are coming to this with

767
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,530
different expectations we have to look

768
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:46,559
at what problem we're trying to solve

769
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:47,970
and one of the things that you know much

770
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:51,330
as we talk about high maturity low

771
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:54,150
maturity I think even a lot of the

772
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:56,730
mature organizations aside from a very

773
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:58,730
elite few are still having a really hard

774
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:01,110
time with this this is one thing where

775
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:02,580
Tom and I initially completely disagree

776
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:05,010
that over time how like holy crap we are

777
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:06,960
totally saying the same thing because

778
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:08,908
realistically I think the problem

779
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,780
everyone's trying to solve is not really

780
00:28:08,909 --> 00:28:11,070
anything great with threat intelligence

781
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,580
they want to stop being punched in the

782
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:13,980
face

783
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:16,230
which is why my generic quote here I

784
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:17,730
mean basically you have this huge scrum

785
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:20,760
going on in the internet with everybody

786
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:22,169
duking it out and realistically and

787
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,120
again this goes back to my critique of

788
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:25,440
the overall industry but not just threat

789
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:28,678
intelligence but it comes back to that

790
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,000
is most people don't want to do threat

791
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:31,289
intelligence they don't want to have an

792
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,080
Intel group they want to have a socket

793
00:28:31,289 --> 00:28:35,549
analyst they want to mitigate risk by

794
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,510
spending some money and having a problem

795
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:41,700
go away and a lot of people see this as

796
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:44,789
this is the new hotness they've been

797
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:46,230
going to things you know the big

798
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:48,240
nameless trade show I'll stop picking on

799
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:49,679
it by name or other things like that and

800
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,789
they keep being told hey this box will

801
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,640
solve all your problems but you buy it

802
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:55,289
this year and it keeps not happening and

803
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,880
so this is a new thing it doesn't

804
00:28:55,289 --> 00:28:58,830
necessarily fit in the box but people

805
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,140
are like hey I want to get on this it's

806
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:04,639
new it's hot it's wonderful because it

807
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:04,640
will make my problem go away and

808
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,970
you know that that's one of the things

809
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,539
we realized is even examining people at

810
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:14,840
relatively high levels of maturity we

811
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:16,850
don't necessarily have a clearly defined

812
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,620
set of what we're trying to do with this

813
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:21,019
and that's I did like the metrics thing

814
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:22,758
earlier where I mean I think metrics is

815
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:24,440
still metrics was a very well-defined

816
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:25,940
field a lot of other areas and security

817
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,590
it's really horrible because we try to

818
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,990
measure everything and we don't know how

819
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:31,340
to measure anything but I really

820
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:33,830
appreciated the fact that you stated

821
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:35,539
that basically needed to have threat

822
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:37,158
intelligence applied against a lot of

823
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:38,600
these other things because a lot of

824
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:40,159
cases we're just grabbing this and we

825
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,019
don't necessarily know what we're trying

826
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,549
to do with it sorry I'm probably

827
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:49,009
wondering off script here with my things

828
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:51,740
um yeah scripts such as it is but I mean

829
00:29:49,009 --> 00:29:53,000
to me like I think a lot of people are

830
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:54,169
just they want to pay money to make

831
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,700
things stop and they don't know how to

832
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:57,259
make the transition but like this is a

833
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,919
new thing which theoretically stops the

834
00:29:57,259 --> 00:30:04,700
problem how do we transition that um

835
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:06,470
sorry right and you know this what I'm

836
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,480
saying like people know that they have a

837
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:10,700
problem right more and more people are

838
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,960
like oh I've you know I've you know I

839
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,370
probably need to find out you know if

840
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,990
there's a breach in my network or if I'm

841
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:16,758
exposed to compromise or something like

842
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:17,629
that so people are coming to the table

843
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:20,000
more than they used to

844
00:30:17,629 --> 00:30:21,678
I trade all the way back to like 2009

845
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,570
and operation Aurora and things like

846
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,059
that I think when you know that the big

847
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:28,519
search company that everybody knows

848
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:31,100
publishes a blog post saying like you

849
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:32,809
know sign it took my pants then

850
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:36,259
everybody else gets automatically a

851
00:30:32,809 --> 00:30:38,149
tremendous degree more comfortable sort

852
00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:40,009
of sharing their dirty linen right there

853
00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:42,559
like they even got Google those guys are

854
00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:43,970
this artist so everybody got and also

855
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,408
they didn't go out of business right

856
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:46,789
that was the other key which was that

857
00:30:45,409 --> 00:30:47,960
everybody was sort of waiting who's

858
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:49,399
going to be the first person that makes

859
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,230
the news and what's gonna happen to

860
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:52,518
their stock price and how hard are they

861
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:56,809
going to get hit with shareholder

862
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:58,820
lawsuits that didn't happen after all

863
00:30:56,809 --> 00:31:00,110
for hemming things like that have

864
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:02,120
started to burble up because I think

865
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:06,019
there's a little bit of impatience with

866
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:07,070
other people and customers but it's one

867
00:31:06,019 --> 00:31:08,360
of those things where people are now

868
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,740
really cognizant of the fact that

869
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,209
they've made that there is this threat

870
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,950
intelligence thing maybe it won't make

871
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:15,140
the pain go away I'm not as cynical

872
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:16,940
about sort of the average cybersecurity

873
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:18,560
consumer if you will I think they think

874
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:21,050
this will tell me more how much pain I'm

875
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:24,020
in right this will more accurately let

876
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:26,690
me assess you know the degree and type

877
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:28,340
of problems that I have and that's the

878
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:29,870
that's like sort of the the first step

879
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:31,429
is sort of like scoping out sort of like

880
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:33,010
how you how you're impacted by these

881
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:36,560
threats they keep reading about the news

882
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:38,270
and then you know then I can make better

883
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,830
decisions about how to invest to address

884
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:41,930
it that was one of the other things that

885
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:43,399
I've seen value in as much as it annoys

886
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:44,750
me because I think all the stuff where

887
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,010
you talk about attribution and get

888
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:48,110
really cute names to these various

889
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:49,129
campaign actors all that stuff to me

890
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:50,629
just kind of reads like one of those

891
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:52,460
Hollywood gossip columns like just

892
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:54,050
imagine that you like dancing panda

893
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:56,540
isn't fold italics every time it appears

894
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:59,060
but you'll never believe who is inside

895
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:02,540
the federal you know Communications

896
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:04,190
Commission's networks last night and but

897
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:06,649
the thing is there's value in that

898
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:08,390
because and again this is the classic

899
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:11,270
Tom jumps way ahead of himself in the

900
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:13,340
notes there's value in that because a

901
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:14,600
label as silly as it might seem to those

902
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:18,470
of us who have more experience in the

903
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:20,840
profession the chocolate warm cakes it's

904
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:22,610
great spread proof by the way yes aware

905
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:28,129
of chocolate warm cakes they come in

906
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:30,770
various sizes so the value in these

907
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:32,990
labels is that they give like a hook for

908
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:35,780
you know you're a stakeholder

909
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:37,220
decision-maker boss etc to hang on to

910
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:38,899
and they be like Oh are we affected by

911
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,970
you know like chocolate warm cakes and

912
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,200
you say like actually based on all the

913
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:43,490
information sharing we've been doing

914
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,840
with the other people in our sector and

915
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:46,340
region we know that chocolate warm cakes

916
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,590
are not currently affecting us and not

917
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:51,470
targeting our sector great I love that

918
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:53,090
report right don't have to explain how

919
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,680
heartbleed works you just say heartbleed

920
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:58,070
people are like Oh at that thing it gets

921
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:59,840
headline so you skip the more cynical

922
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:01,159
point that you brought up earlier in our

923
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,879
discussions on this I'm going to drag

924
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:06,110
you back to it

925
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:07,610
um so another thing though is that and

926
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:09,379
I'd be curious to see the sort of rooms

927
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:13,219
consensus because we have our own views

928
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:15,950
on these two things one of which is is

929
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:17,480
it easier to go to somebody who controls

930
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:18,800
your purse strings and say hey we're

931
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,320
being attacked by chocolate worm cakes

932
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:23,540
give me some money versus we're being

933
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:26,210
attacked by unknown threat exploiting VC

934
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:28,519
ves and these CB SS score things and you

935
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:30,559
know it insert all the acronyms but

936
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:33,139
you can say the country of chocolate

937
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:34,999
worm cakes is after us and out to get us

938
00:33:33,139 --> 00:33:36,080
is that going to get you your budget and

939
00:33:34,999 --> 00:33:37,909
your funding and is that going to enable

940
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,009
you security program and is that

941
00:33:37,909 --> 00:33:40,399
unethical to do where is that just smart

942
00:33:40,009 --> 00:33:44,450
business

943
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:49,178
it addresses it takes a really long time

944
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:51,769
to put a you know a good mental model

945
00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:54,739
into a novice right if you have an

946
00:33:51,769 --> 00:33:56,809
executive you know who is a you know

947
00:33:54,739 --> 00:33:58,429
your main investment decision maker or

948
00:33:56,809 --> 00:34:00,259
you know somebody in that sort of at

949
00:33:58,429 --> 00:34:02,749
that type of position the c-suite folks

950
00:34:00,259 --> 00:34:04,909
right who don't do security most of the

951
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:07,129
time their mental models of things are

952
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:09,619
based on humans and transactions and you

953
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:11,389
know like I pax and you know words like

954
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:13,039
that and if you can put it in that

955
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:14,359
language and sort of make it fit that

956
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:16,099
mental model with just sort of like the

957
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:17,509
chocolate worm cakes have destroyed in a

958
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:18,950
significant part of our you know in our

959
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:21,559
value today or something whatever you

960
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:23,509
have to say then that translation effort

961
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:25,490
makes you know the rest go down easier

962
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:26,960
right that's what I've learned over

963
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:28,250
years especially dealing with like

964
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,929
government folks these are you know

965
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:32,779
politically appointed officials who

966
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:34,909
really do not care about a CBE and what

967
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:36,829
it does right they're starting to get

968
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:38,510
wise that they should care because it

969
00:34:36,829 --> 00:34:39,710
keeps making headlines but at the same

970
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,329
time they're just they're political

971
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:43,699
science majors I work for a lot of

972
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:46,279
political science graduate students and

973
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:50,589
they all want to know are we getting hit

974
00:34:46,279 --> 00:34:53,690
by chocolate worm cakes yes or no right

975
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:55,788
so that's there is value in the labels

976
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:57,079
but yes I am consistently as I was

977
00:34:55,789 --> 00:34:58,910
comparing them to the Hollywood gossip

978
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:00,619
column I personally am totally cynical

979
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:03,049
about labels because I know that the

980
00:35:00,619 --> 00:35:05,270
devil is in the detail so another thing

981
00:35:03,049 --> 00:35:06,950
I've observed that seems in a way

982
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,240
cynical and when I initially thought of

983
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:10,609
this I was like wow you're a horrible

984
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,020
person and then as time has gone on I

985
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:13,848
realize actually know this could be a

986
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:17,200
valuable tool in a sort of intangible

987
00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:19,640
way is um there's that whole concept of

988
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,799
maybe something gives you power over it

989
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:24,710
and in a way I've seen organizations

990
00:35:21,799 --> 00:35:26,960
where I'm like why are you worrying

991
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:30,500
about attribution there is nothing you

992
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,029
can do about it so it's good to quantify

993
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,710
the threat up to a certain point that

994
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:34,970
the extra work going into attribution is

995
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:37,099
really not going to change how you

996
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:38,990
approach this at all because you're at

997
00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:40,490
this level of the maturity model you

998
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:41,868
only have the resources of you certain

999
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:42,109
things you're not going to be doing a

1000
00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:43,849
drone

1001
00:35:42,109 --> 00:35:46,640
strike on somebody so why does it matter

1002
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:48,380
and the real answer is honestly it

1003
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,519
builds morale for a lot of people if

1004
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:52,940
you're just going in every day and

1005
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:55,160
constantly being slaughtered by machines

1006
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:56,989
that are being compromised by you know

1007
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,578
just looking at the ridiculous amount of

1008
00:35:56,989 --> 00:36:00,319
inbound alerts you've got having your

1009
00:35:58,579 --> 00:36:01,880
sock guys go we need better product

1010
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:04,730
stuff because we can't realize the

1011
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,890
12,000 alerts every day it can be pretty

1012
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:08,900
depressing if you can rally around the

1013
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:10,160
fact that you can define here our threat

1014
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,230
actors and not only of those threat

1015
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,089
actors but they're these particular

1016
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:16,369
entities are causes that are trying to

1017
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:19,609
do harm to my brand my reputation my

1018
00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:22,160
little actual property my country um to

1019
00:36:19,609 --> 00:36:23,930
me initially I was like all this is just

1020
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,038
totally like who would do that the more

1021
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:27,348
I thought about the more I realized that

1022
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:30,170
that has an intangible value to probably

1023
00:36:27,349 --> 00:36:32,180
keep some shops going and initially my

1024
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:33,200
thought was like ah I I mock you people

1025
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,910
for doing this attribution because

1026
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,319
you're wasting resources this is one of

1027
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:38,569
the few times I think I've convinced

1028
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:39,890
myself over time that I'll let you waste

1029
00:36:38,569 --> 00:36:41,480
that resource because it has an

1030
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:43,339
intangible benefit that I didn't even

1031
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:45,440
think of in the first place that's

1032
00:36:43,339 --> 00:36:47,269
probably more valuable than I ever gave

1033
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,609
it credit for I know if anybody has seen

1034
00:36:47,269 --> 00:36:51,140
that in their shops or not but um you

1035
00:36:49,609 --> 00:36:52,730
know I mean I just knew that there was

1036
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:54,980
sort of a real sea change once people

1037
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:58,430
started talking about threats and yes

1038
00:36:54,980 --> 00:37:00,200
there have been some overemphasis in the

1039
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:02,269
marketing arena to put it nicely about

1040
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:04,189
some of the threat groups but I think in

1041
00:37:02,269 --> 00:37:05,930
a way it does make people feel a little

1042
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:07,099
bit more in control of the circumstances

1043
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:08,690
anyone ever heard this story about the

1044
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:09,980
kids with yo-yos like there's this

1045
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:12,170
thirty years ago of showing that if you

1046
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:13,460
have underprivileged kids and you give

1047
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:16,670
them a yo-yo and you show them how to

1048
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:18,440
use it like they're arguably their

1049
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:21,259
quality of life gets better and the

1050
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,940
theory behind this was that if you give

1051
00:37:21,259 --> 00:37:24,619
someone who doesn't have a lot of

1052
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:28,880
control over their environment

1053
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:29,720
a system where they can exert control in

1054
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,519
a small space

1055
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,769
they realize it is possible and they and

1056
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:35,660
start inserting control in larger and

1057
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:36,859
larger areas because Polly was

1058
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:38,328
previously they believed it was hopeless

1059
00:37:36,859 --> 00:37:39,589
they were just like I have no control

1060
00:37:38,329 --> 00:37:41,569
everything's horrible bad things are

1061
00:37:39,589 --> 00:37:44,480
happening to me every day but by showing

1062
00:37:41,569 --> 00:37:46,819
them in this limited subset you now have

1063
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,349
some control they realize that they can

1064
00:37:46,819 --> 00:37:50,180
actually control bigger things and over

1065
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:52,519
time they start extrapolating that out I

1066
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:55,308
don't remember the exact paper but I see

1067
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:55,910
this looking at it optimistically as a

1068
00:37:55,309 --> 00:37:57,920
sort of

1069
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:59,839
similar model you have you know groups

1070
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,670
that are basically completely overrun

1071
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,680
with all the stuff they have to do with

1072
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:05,030
the security lack of resources this is

1073
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,169
one way it starts a little light at the

1074
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:07,700
end of the tunnel I don't know if that's

1075
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:08,930
a false hope but it's one way I've

1076
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,490
actually felt a little bit better about

1077
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:11,990
this over time is realizing there are a

1078
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:13,939
lot of people who get very excited and

1079
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:15,348
suddenly feel they're doing something

1080
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:16,789
that matters because they know who

1081
00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:22,130
they're fighting against now as opposed

1082
00:38:16,789 --> 00:38:23,660
to just oh my god for act so so yeah one

1083
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:25,250
of the things we've kind of covered a

1084
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:26,529
little bit of those already

1085
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:28,910
but there's the fact that basically

1086
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:30,980
there's a lot of complexity in here I

1087
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:35,029
think Tom jumped ahead with his I think

1088
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:39,230
this was the eighth grade comment but so

1089
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:40,760
I I still feel though and maybe this is

1090
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:42,920
a good point for discussion since we or

1091
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,500
we could skip over this that I do feel

1092
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,480
that

1093
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:49,849
conversely like the attribution thing if

1094
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,619
your org is not mature enough and you

1095
00:38:49,849 --> 00:38:53,210
start spending a lot of resources on

1096
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:55,579
trying to threaten Intel you're doing

1097
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:57,380
yourself a disservice not because threat

1098
00:38:55,579 --> 00:38:58,730
Intel's not important not because I

1099
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:01,220
don't want you sharing information with

1100
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:03,950
me or with Tom or somebody else or we

1101
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:05,808
can make you better but frankly you're

1102
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:07,339
spending a resource spinning about

1103
00:39:05,809 --> 00:39:08,539
threat Intel and if you got that good

1104
00:39:07,339 --> 00:39:11,150
data you're going to turn around and go

1105
00:39:08,539 --> 00:39:12,559
I'm gonna plug it into my oh wait I

1106
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:14,869
don't have that system built or I don't

1107
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:17,900
have this system built and again so I

1108
00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:20,690
think that we have an incredibly complex

1109
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:22,549
set up right now I I think that

1110
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:24,799
basically you have like so many levels

1111
00:39:22,549 --> 00:39:27,650
of maturity that you need to achieve

1112
00:39:24,799 --> 00:39:29,180
first before you can get anything else

1113
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:30,349
done I think we have rehash this one but

1114
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,578
does anybody else want to comments on

1115
00:39:30,349 --> 00:39:33,470
that the fact that like you know if you

1116
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:35,119
haven't established a monitoring program

1117
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:37,339
and a way to implement changes in your

1118
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,390
environment being told information you

1119
00:39:37,339 --> 00:39:41,779
should look for and implement your

1120
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:45,609
environments not gonna help you or

1121
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:48,289
should we just we know because right so

1122
00:39:45,609 --> 00:39:52,279
at the research and education networks I

1123
00:39:48,289 --> 00:39:53,900
say there's lots of moving parts the

1124
00:39:52,279 --> 00:39:55,670
research and education networking I sac

1125
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:58,099
stood up their collective intelligence

1126
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:59,390
framework on their security event system

1127
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:01,789
and this was their job this was their

1128
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:03,410
blacklist school right I talked earlier

1129
00:40:01,789 --> 00:40:05,150
about like one of the two places in the

1130
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:06,470
world I've seen an operational running

1131
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:09,160
implementation of the IO

1132
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:09,160
spec this was
