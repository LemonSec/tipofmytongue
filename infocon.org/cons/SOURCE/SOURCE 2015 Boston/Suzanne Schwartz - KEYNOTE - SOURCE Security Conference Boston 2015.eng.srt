1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,329
good morning everyone can you hear me

2
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:09,360
okay so it's truly a pleasure to be here

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,099
at source Boston and to engage with all

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,590
of you on behalf of the Food and Drug

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,179
Administration specifically the center

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,520
where I come from which is the Center

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:20,550
for Devices and Radiological health I

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,130
want to especially thank Josh Corman for

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,830
inviting me to participate today Josh

10
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:28,470
and I have now had several opportunities

11
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,939
to discuss some of the challenges some

12
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,488
of the pain points that the healthcare

13
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,890
sector is facing with respect to

14
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:36,959
cybersecurity whether it's serving on a

15
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:40,230
panel together which we did this past

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,690
winter as well as connecting by phone I

17
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:45,000
get the sense that we are both very

18
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:48,718
like-minded and are very passionate

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,239
about these concerns and are avidly

20
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,879
seeking approaches to address this

21
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:57,360
multifaceted problem one thing's for

22
00:00:53,879 --> 00:01:00,059
sure there is no single solution and

23
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,269
there's no single responsible party and

24
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,850
so the upside here spoken as a true

25
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:09,990
optimist which I am is that this space

26
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:12,649
is abounding with opportunity to do

27
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:16,048
better through innovation through

28
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:18,299
collaboration and even at it's very core

29
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:21,479
by demonstrating a willingness and

30
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:25,140
openness to consider a shift in

31
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:27,990
perspective so last week I had the

32
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,640
opportunity to participate in a meeting

33
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,039
that's part of an initiative a

34
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,700
government initiative known as the

35
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:39,060
cybersecurity forum for independent and

36
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:43,290
executive branch regulators and as each

37
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:45,240
of us went around the table briefing our

38
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,329
counterparts from different departments

39
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:51,390
different agencies within government on

40
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:53,929
what we're doing on our different

41
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:58,040
efforts on cyber the

42
00:01:53,930 --> 00:02:00,710
thread that I'm emerged amongst all of

43
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:03,770
us was that you know we need to shift

44
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:07,759
this conversation we need to pivot from

45
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:10,549
if something were to happen to when

46
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:14,240
something happens and we have to ask

47
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:17,360
ourselves and I ask you how prepared are

48
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,850
we to respond to a breach and exploit

49
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,600
and attack and let's take that even a

50
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:27,140
step further how resilient are we will

51
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:30,260
operations grind to a halt in the face

52
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:32,179
of an attack or a breach or are there

53
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,579
measures and mitigations that are

54
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,190
already in place to enable the

55
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:39,230
continuity of operations continuity of

56
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:41,420
critical services and you can imagine

57
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:43,700
how important that is within the

58
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:46,488
healthcare and the sector and within the

59
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:49,700
hospitals so health care and public

60
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:52,910
health as a sector has seen a ramping up

61
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:55,579
of activities over the past year I know

62
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:58,370
Jim Ralph spoke yesterday it's a good

63
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,830
colleague of mine data breaches started

64
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:03,610
last year around this time with

65
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:05,840
community health services anthem

66
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:08,510
primaries been in the news and most

67
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,030
recently announced as of last week care

68
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:13,870
first and when we look at these efforts

69
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:18,530
at these events excuse me and recognize

70
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:20,930
how large the attack surface is across

71
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:23,480
our sector of health care Public Health

72
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:26,660
we understand that the sectors of ulnar

73
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:29,690
abilities are not confined to health

74
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:32,660
insurance claims databases or electronic

75
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:35,690
health records but rather they could

76
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:38,420
potentially affect the larger system of

77
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:44,019
systems if you will and they can go

78
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:44,018
across entire care delivery networks

79
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:51,540
so in fact medical devices have been no

80
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,219
stranger to media attention right there

81
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,500
have been highlights over the past 10

82
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:57,510
days alone which demonstrate the

83
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,189
momentum that's been building and

84
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,620
ramping up around medical device

85
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:04,290
cybersecurity concern and I've

86
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:08,000
highlighted on this slide a few again

87
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:08,000
just within the recent 10 days

88
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:14,609
why does FDA care about cybersecurity

89
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:18,019
well the answer lies within the scope of

90
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:21,509
the public health concern as you know

91
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:26,460
fewer and fewer medical devices are

92
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:30,060
standalone boxes network medical devices

93
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:33,359
are ubiquitous today they facilitate

94
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:36,000
patient care in hospitals in outpatient

95
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,430
or ambulatory centers in skilled nursing

96
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,460
and rehab facilities to name a few and

97
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:44,130
of course there are many others and at

98
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:47,969
the same time they also introduce new

99
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:50,250
risks so as an agency that's concerned

100
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:53,550
first and foremost with our patient

101
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:56,010
safety its balancing those benefits

102
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:58,349
against risks that gets at the very

103
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:04,620
essence of what we do of what FDA is

104
00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:07,169
charged with and notwithstanding FDA's

105
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,570
public health mission presidential

106
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:12,448
policy directives and executive orders

107
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:15,210
over recent years have underscored the

108
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:16,830
need to improve cybersecurity of

109
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,799
critical infrastructure across the

110
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:23,099
sector's most recently I'm not sure if

111
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:26,580
you're all aware of executive order 136

112
00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:29,099
91 that was issued this past February to

113
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,680
promote private-sector cybersecurity

114
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:35,389
information sharing as a means of

115
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,389
strengthening critical infrastructure

116
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:42,400
so over the past two years we've come to

117
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:44,229
learn a lot at CDRH at fda about medical

118
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,659
device cybersecurity particularly

119
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:50,740
through the lens of total product

120
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:53,080
lifecycle and yet and yet it should be

121
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:57,070
told we're barely scratching the surface

122
00:05:53,080 --> 00:06:00,008
so how would I characterize our medical

123
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:02,289
device ecosystem within the context of

124
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:04,750
cybersecurity well these are some of the

125
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:08,889
descriptors that come to mind it's

126
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:11,710
complex evolving highly diverse players

127
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:14,650
and stakeholders that have competing

128
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:17,880
needs it's very tense volatile

129
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:21,070
unpredictable uncertain there is nothing

130
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:24,310
nothing that is static about this space

131
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:26,080
you've got multiple moving parts and we

132
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:29,139
have to keep in mind that there are

133
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,359
areas that are well outside of the

134
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:34,539
medical device or healthcare ecosystem

135
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,500
in the broader universe that are well

136
00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:40,840
beyond our control and that are

137
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:43,270
continuously shifting and these exert

138
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:46,960
further influence and impact on this

139
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:49,150
ecosystem at FDA we're constantly

140
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,219
uncovering more of the unknown that

141
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:53,830
needs to be incorporated in our thinking

142
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:55,659
as we formulate what is a strategic

143
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:58,240
approach to medical device cybersecurity

144
00:06:55,659 --> 00:07:01,030
this is a strategy that knits together

145
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:04,449
the capabilities that that government

146
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:06,309
that FDA holds within its toolbox so it

147
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:08,940
includes the ability to articulate

148
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:11,800
policy through guidance documents

149
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:15,460
educating increasing awareness via

150
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:18,190
outreach and communication so now that

151
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:21,789
I've characterized excuse me now that I

152
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:24,130
have characterized the ecosystem who are

153
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:27,099
the players within it so we have the

154
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:30,190
medical device manufacturers and that's

155
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:31,490
whom we at FDA have regulatory authority

156
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:33,350
over

157
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:35,930
and then you have the owners and

158
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:39,050
operators and end users of medical

159
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:41,650
devices that FDA does not regulate we do

160
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:44,810
not have oversight over that piece as

161
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:46,698
shown here there are many parties with a

162
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:50,740
stake in this space whether it's our

163
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:53,740
patients professional societies industry

164
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:58,130
researchers health care providers payers

165
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:59,870
VCS within the healthcare delivery

166
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:02,870
organization within the healthcare

167
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:05,240
facility bubble alone you can peel that

168
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:08,630
back further and we've got hospital

169
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:12,530
administrators IT personnel biomed

170
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:15,380
engineers clinicians so one need not be

171
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:19,219
labor the point that the varied and what

172
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:21,949
are often competing needs and pain

173
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:24,310
points among these stakeholders can

174
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:27,409
present a significant challenge a

175
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:30,590
fundamental step would therefore be to

176
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:33,140
identify the common interests that folks

177
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:35,390
can rally around towards a shared

178
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:38,689
purpose that purpose being to better

179
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:41,659
secure devices and their connected

180
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:44,110
systems the critical message here though

181
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:46,939
is that there's no one organization

182
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:50,480
there's no single government agency

183
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:53,350
there's no soul stakeholder manufacturer

184
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,180
health care facility provider

185
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:59,300
information security firm that is going

186
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:02,719
to be able to solve these issues on

187
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:05,479
their own this requires what we call a

188
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,529
whole of community approach and note

189
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,480
they didn't say here a

190
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:10,700
whole-of-government approach because

191
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,310
this is far more expansive than what

192
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,990
government is capable of doing and so

193
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:16,760
understanding the challenges

194
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:19,940
understanding again what those pain

195
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:22,670
points are the hurdles and yes the

196
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:26,120
opportunities to build creative

197
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:28,790
solutions requires mobilizing the

198
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,640
community the entire medical device

199
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,819
ecosystem

200
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,040
[Music]

201
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:37,589
if you remember anything from this

202
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,439
morning's talk these are going to be my

203
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:42,839
key takeaways it's about establishing a

204
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,959
cybersecurity risk management program

205
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:48,600
it's about making cyber hygiene

206
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:51,839
paramount it's about creating a trusted

207
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:56,790
environment for information sharing its

208
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:58,740
FDA's desire and its interest in seeking

209
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:03,149
to foster this whole of community

210
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:04,560
approach key point number five bullet

211
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:06,630
here that I'm going to continue to

212
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,380
emphasize periodically throughout my

213
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:14,279
talk to break certain myths that are out

214
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:17,370
there FDA does not require new

215
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:21,209
submissions for software updates or

216
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:24,570
patches for cyber security and this is a

217
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:26,550
critical aspect for folks to really

218
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:29,310
understand true there are some

219
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:30,930
exceptions those exceptions are when

220
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,819
there's a safety or functionality

221
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:36,479
concern of the device but when we're

222
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:40,339
talking about by and large enhancement a

223
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:43,620
cyber security routine servicing

224
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:46,800
manufacturers do not need to submit an

225
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:49,890
application or a new notification to the

226
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,199
FDA and then the last point we're not

227
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:54,120
prescriptive with risk analyses many

228
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,089
folks will ask with respect to guidance

229
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,070
documents why we don't get further into

230
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:01,709
the weeds why we're not more granular

231
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:04,260
because there is an opportunity here for

232
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:07,529
manufacturers and for the community to

233
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:10,020
develop the appropriate type of analysis

234
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:13,010
that fits within the framework of the

235
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:18,220
specific device and the environment

236
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:18,220
[Music]

237
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:27,069
so we roadmap for today's discussion

238
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:28,929
let's start with understanding the

239
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:31,118
current threat landscape what are the

240
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:33,220
recognized challenges for enhancing

241
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:35,709
security of critical infrastructure in

242
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:37,199
healthcare and public health secondly

243
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:39,729
it'll be about informing you

244
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:43,508
specifically of what our program looks

245
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:46,660
like and third about providing a glimpse

246
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:48,819
into that vision ahead so what are the

247
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,969
considerations and challenges faced with

248
00:11:48,819 --> 00:11:55,059
regard to medical device cybersecurity

249
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:58,240
for simplicity there really are two

250
00:11:55,059 --> 00:12:00,790
components to think about here first

251
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,129
there are the characteristics of the

252
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:06,459
devices themselves these are more or

253
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:08,889
less the intrinsic elements such as the

254
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:11,258
notion that they contain configurable

255
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:13,529
embedded computer systems that they are

256
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:16,209
increasingly being interconnected

257
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:19,959
wirelessly connected and then the last

258
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:22,839
point here of legacy devices legacy

259
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:24,878
devices present a youth challenge for

260
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:29,170
the medical device community and for

261
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:32,980
healthcare today and then there's the

262
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:35,589
use environment in which the device is

263
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:37,299
recited a and these are the extrinsic

264
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:39,879
factors for which medical device

265
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:42,069
manufacturers have really little if any

266
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:43,689
control so what are some of the key

267
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:46,509
learnings that we know about the use

268
00:12:43,689 --> 00:12:49,230
environment well number one there are

269
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:51,579
varied responsibilities for procurement

270
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:54,670
installation and maintenance of devices

271
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:56,829
these are often siloed efforts within

272
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:59,290
different organizations there is

273
00:12:56,829 --> 00:13:01,979
variable control over what's placed on

274
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:04,420
the network and we've heard a lot about

275
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:07,769
inconsistent training education on

276
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,769
security risks

277
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:13,140
when we talk about medical device

278
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:15,240
vulnerabilities the first thing to point

279
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:17,100
out here again is that they are

280
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,460
overwhelming and they're ubiquitous

281
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:22,560
and they will continue to manifest

282
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:26,370
themselves they're not going away

283
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,410
one cannot entirely eliminate them yet

284
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:31,290
we can educate and we have a

285
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:34,380
responsibility to educate and we can

286
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:35,939
increase awareness and vigilance among

287
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,670
our stakeholders and we have a

288
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:42,120
responsibility to do that as well so

289
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:44,699
that our stakeholders understand what

290
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,730
the common vulnerabilities are and what

291
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:50,910
they should be doing to introduce

292
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:53,190
protective measures we have in fact

293
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:55,680
included some of these examples that are

294
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:58,110
on this slide in a safety communication

295
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:02,069
that FDA issued back a couple of years

296
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:03,810
ago in June 2013 and reiterated some of

297
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:06,090
these key features in a safety

298
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:09,630
communication that FDA issued just two

299
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:13,140
weeks ago with respect to a specific

300
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:15,030
infusion pumping hospira pump that is

301
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:17,760
used for patient controlled and ascend

302
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:19,800
analgesia so I think just some examples

303
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,110
here to highlight the uncontrolled

304
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,870
distribution of passwords the failure to

305
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:29,190
provide timely security software updates

306
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:32,190
and patches in our present landscape

307
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:34,500
there have been known incidents reported

308
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:39,230
in the news for example there was a cath

309
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:41,550
lab a VA cath lab closure in June in

310
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:43,920
2010 and that was due to malware

311
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:46,380
infecting computers that are used for a

312
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,689
cardiac interventional procedure and

313
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:51,000
we've also been presented in yeastier

314
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:54,210
recent years as well as in recent months

315
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,240
with findings of vulnerability

316
00:14:54,210 --> 00:15:00,090
researchers who have demonstrated in a

317
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,880
controlled setting a non hospital

318
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:04,740
setting the capability to exploit

319
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,649
medical device vulnerability

320
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,960
and they've included the very famous

321
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:14,000
hacking of an implantable insulin pump

322
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:17,160
by J Radcliffe as well as two years ago

323
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,050
Billy Rios and McCorkle brought to our

324
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:22,770
attention in to Department of Homeland

325
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:26,040
Security's attention a package of nearly

326
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:29,699
300 or so medical devices that had

327
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:32,219
hard-coded passwords and over the past

328
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:34,950
12 months we continue to hear about

329
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:37,740
further vulnerabilities again most

330
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:40,770
recently the hospira pompom ability that

331
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:43,230
has gotten a fair amount of attention

332
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:48,209
it's important to note here so why don't

333
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:53,100
I make a very intentional statement here

334
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:57,109
that FDA is not aware of any intentional

335
00:15:53,100 --> 00:16:00,209
or unintentional exploit of any existing

336
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:02,820
vulnerability that has resulted in a

337
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:07,380
patient or patients being harmed or

338
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:11,240
injured however however that is not a

339
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:14,580
reason to relax with respect to cyber

340
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:16,920
security practices so remember what I

341
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:19,620
said at the onset of my talk it's not a

342
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:22,469
matter of if it's a concern as to when

343
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:24,540
something could occur and the fact that

344
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:29,100
we need to be prepared and that we need

345
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:31,500
to be resilient so this kind of ends the

346
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,750
initial background landscape of medical

347
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,150
device cybersecurity in the remaining

348
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:38,820
time I'm going to share with you or the

349
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:41,130
diverse cross-cutting activities that

350
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,900
we've been involved with at FDA at

351
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:45,029
Center for Devices and Radiological

352
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:48,510
health as we've been building out this

353
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:50,610
more strategic program on medical device

354
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:53,730
cybersecurity I'm also going to spend

355
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:56,520
some time on FDA's expectations

356
00:16:53,730 --> 00:17:00,959
regarding medical device cyber security

357
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:03,209
risk management so what are our

358
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,188
overarching goals well first and

359
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:08,139
foremost we have to meet our public

360
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:11,199
health mission which is that patient

361
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:14,650
should have access to safe and effective

362
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:17,799
devices it's about raising cybersecurity

363
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:21,160
awareness and we ought to be leveraging

364
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:23,859
knowledge that presently exists within

365
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,319
other critical infrastructure sectors

366
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:30,100
across industry it's about promoting

367
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:32,110
safety and security by design by being

368
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,540
able to articulate clear regulatory

369
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:36,820
expectations through guidance documents

370
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,649
it's about promoting proactive

371
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:42,129
vulnerability management and not having

372
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:44,919
to be in this position of defensive or

373
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:47,530
reactive posture and once more it's

374
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:54,340
about fostering that whole of community

375
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:56,200
approach so our cybersecurity program

376
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:59,350
has included multiple efforts in

377
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,809
parallel we continue to articulate our

378
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:04,120
thinking for expectations through

379
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:07,530
guidance documents and our final

380
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:09,879
guidance for content of pre market

381
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:12,549
submissions for managing cybersecurity

382
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,650
medical devices was published last

383
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:17,470
October we'll talk a little bit more

384
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:22,750
about the pearls out of that guidance

385
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:25,929
later in 2013 we recognized 25 standards

386
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:27,910
that included both cybersecurity and the

387
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:32,890
other side of that coin interoperability

388
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:35,679
we continue to work on evaluating later

389
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:37,720
or newer standards for purposes of FDA

390
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,299
recognition that will be applicable to

391
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,520
cyber security as well we've issued

392
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:44,410
public communications on the importance

393
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:47,110
of shared responsibility within this

394
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:48,700
space that was in 2009

395
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:50,199
and then there have been two more recent

396
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,950
safety communications to our

397
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:56,429
stakeholders one which I referenced in

398
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:59,529
2013 and a more recent one two weeks ago

399
00:18:56,429 --> 00:19:02,260
and organizationally what have we done

400
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:05,080
well we've done two things established a

401
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:07,269
cybersecurity working group of subject

402
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,158
matter experts that represent really

403
00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:12,669
every aspect of the total product

404
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:14,320
lifecycle for medical devices and we

405
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:16,929
have stood up a cyber Incident Response

406
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,490
Team under my programmatic portfolio the

407
00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:22,809
emergency medical countermeasures

408
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:25,149
program a few words about our CE swg so

409
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:27,450
this is really an opportunity for

410
00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:31,629
bi-directional flow of information

411
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:34,269
members of our CE swg such as myself I

412
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:36,250
chair the CSTO bujji have been involved

413
00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:39,340
in outreach and education building

414
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:41,139
awareness by speaking to different parts

415
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:44,439
of the healthcare public health sector

416
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:46,779
but it's also about our opportunity to

417
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:50,490
become increasingly educated and we

418
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:54,130
encourage that opportunity we welcome

419
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:56,620
others to come and educate our subject

420
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:58,779
matter experts by we do this by bringing

421
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:01,209
in security researchers bringing in

422
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:03,970
security firms who have presented to us

423
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:05,590
their approaches and potential solutions

424
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:09,039
to some of the challenges that we all

425
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:12,340
face in this arena importantly it's the

426
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:15,789
CSW G within the Center for devices that

427
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:18,519
is tasked with evolving the agency's

428
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:21,070
thinking with respect to policy and

429
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:24,549
guidance for the entire medical device

430
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:27,580
product lifecycle and so therefore over

431
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:30,010
the past year well not only had we

432
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:32,769
published the pre-market guidance but we

433
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:34,750
have shifted our focus in working on the

434
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:37,149
agency's approach to post market

435
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:38,679
expectations and the considerations that

436
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:41,320
are needed for strengthening cyber

437
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:44,559
security of medical devices that are out

438
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:48,668
there in the field in use and as one

439
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:50,190
might imagine it's these devices that

440
00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:52,710
are currently in use

441
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:54,630
in healthcare facilities that really

442
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:56,940
present the greatest challenges for

443
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:59,520
manufacturers and for health care

444
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:01,400
delivery organizations with respect to

445
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,740
vulnerability mitigation and

446
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:07,830
vulnerability remediation and protection

447
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:10,470
so this is in fact a very tangible

448
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:13,490
example of where the complexity of this

449
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:16,750
issue demands a whole of community

450
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:19,839
multifaceted type of an approach

451
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,839
[Music]

452
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:27,710
so to address medical device

453
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:29,540
cybersecurity we've also engaged in a

454
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:31,550
fair amount and will continue to engage

455
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:33,649
in a lot of collaborative activities

456
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:36,020
some of which have been with us several

457
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:38,450
of our federal partners we've built a

458
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,860
relationship with DHS within their

459
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:41,840
office of cybersecurity and

460
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:44,270
communications specifically a team

461
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:48,409
that's called the ICS serve the

462
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:50,990
industrial control systems cert team we

463
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:53,840
initially engaged with the ICS sir team

464
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:56,030
back in 2013 through Incident Response

465
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,429
when we were first handed over that

466
00:21:56,030 --> 00:22:02,000
package of nearly 300 medical devices

467
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:04,040
that had hard-coded passwords but since

468
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,300
that time we have really built a

469
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:10,370
foundation and a bridge in communicating

470
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:12,620
and in coordinating with weekly

471
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:15,169
conference calls with the ICS search

472
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:18,080
team so that number one we maintain

473
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:20,780
situational awareness on newly reported

474
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,300
vulnerabilities revolvers that are often

475
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:26,960
reported by vulnerability researchers in

476
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:32,960
the field about potential threats and

477
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:35,930
about exploits we've also partnered with

478
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,740
the nhi sach I own do people know what

479
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:42,200
the nhi sach is here show of hands

480
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:43,580
not many okay so nhi sach national

481
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,070
healthcare information sharing and

482
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:48,020
analysis centre as every critical

483
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:50,330
infrastructure sector has either an eye

484
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:53,690
sack or an ISA o information sharing and

485
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:56,870
analysis organization so FDA partnered

486
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:58,910
with nhi sach through an MoU and

487
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:02,000
memorandum of understanding that we

488
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:05,240
executed last August the purpose of this

489
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,310
was to develop a trusted environment for

490
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:10,400
information sharing on medical device

491
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:13,550
vulnerabilities this collaboration also

492
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,850
aims to undertake adapting the NIST

493
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:18,770
framework the voluntary framework for

494
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:22,219
improving critical infrastructure cyber

495
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:25,910
security to the medical device realm and

496
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:28,880
so it would include the concept of cyber

497
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:29,430
incident response planning recovery and

498
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,000
resume

499
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:35,130
as well so in the past few months we've

500
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,560
had the privilege of skiing some of the

501
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:41,310
early work that's being borne out by the

502
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:44,310
NH I sac this work is being done also in

503
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:47,280
collaboration with another entity entity

504
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:49,800
known as MDS the medical device

505
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,860
innovation safety and security

506
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:55,440
consortium what's the end if the end s

507
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:59,129
is a collective of medical device

508
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,820
manufacturers hospital ceases Biomet

509
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:04,590
engineers security research firms and

510
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:07,889
vulnerability ulnar ability researchers

511
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:10,860
as they begin to set up what will be a

512
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:12,920
feasibility small-scale pilot for

513
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:16,290
medical device vulnerability

514
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:18,930
identification analysis or assessment

515
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:23,010
and information sharing in a trusted

516
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:24,990
space we look forward to seeing how this

517
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:27,420
particular effort will take further

518
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:30,150
shape over the next months and in the

519
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:32,100
next year so at this point this is a

520
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:34,440
great time for me to transition it's a

521
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:36,870
perfect segue to discuss the exciting

522
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,030
work that we have ongoing with miter

523
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:41,899
miter is a federally funded research

524
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,899
center

525
00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:52,570
okay and CDRH FDA and mitre have been

526
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:57,040
working together to advance our CDRH

527
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:59,230
medical device cure vision how so it's

528
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:02,230
by evolving a medical device of

529
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:04,299
vulnerability ecosystem for sharing

530
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:06,580
device vulnerability and other relevant

531
00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:09,040
cybersecurity information that can be

532
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:10,990
done in a more effective and efficient

533
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,580
way whether it's through various

534
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:15,820
government as well as industry

535
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:17,799
stakeholders how are we doing this well

536
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:19,990
to start with through various

537
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:22,299
stakeholder engagement and in-depth

538
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:25,059
interviews that really span across the

539
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:28,049
again and the entire ecosystem within

540
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:32,160
the public health and healthcare space

541
00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:34,870
our goal is to develop a roadmap a

542
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,120
roadmap for implementing the medical

543
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:39,850
device vulnerability ecosystem that can

544
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,280
reflect the agreed upon stakeholders

545
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:45,070
roles and responsibilities and through

546
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:48,280
this effort the objective is to design

547
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:51,370
that trusted environment for collecting

548
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:53,980
analyzing and sharing information about

549
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:57,399
medical device vulnerabilities there are

550
00:25:53,980 --> 00:26:01,240
security risks and mitigations in order

551
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:04,210
to advance device security so I've

552
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,710
covered a fair share of FDA's activities

553
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:09,610
and medical device cyber security

554
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:12,070
leaving for last what has been arguably

555
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:16,629
probably the most significant inflection

556
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:19,418
point for the ecosystem mainly this is

557
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:22,260
the workshop the FDA workshop that was

558
00:26:19,419 --> 00:26:24,370
convened back in October of last year

559
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:27,330
collaborative approaches for medical

560
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:30,280
device and healthcare cybersecurity

561
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:34,600
anybody here aware of this workshop

562
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:37,270
having taken place other than Josh and

563
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,770
mitre okay so so this is important for

564
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:41,080
us to know because obviously we're not

565
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:43,120
getting our word out sufficiently and I

566
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:45,460
think it's great to have this audience

567
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,770
that you understand where there's

568
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:51,340
opportunity to work together with us

569
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:53,980
in this whole of community approach all

570
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:56,020
right so what was the purpose of this

571
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:57,640
workshop well first let me also just say

572
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,860
we did this workshop together with

573
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,540
government partners with the Department

574
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:04,209
of Health and Human Services of which we

575
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:06,460
are you know an agency and the

576
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:08,890
Department of Homeland Security we were

577
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:11,410
amazed by the number of participants

578
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:14,320
that signed up and that attended this

579
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:16,930
workshop both on-site as well as remote

580
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,720
both within the US as well as globally

581
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:22,480
there were 1,300 participants that

582
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:25,059
represented a very broad range of

583
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,760
stakeholders the goals were number one

584
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:31,059
to catalyze collaboration among all

585
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:33,040
stakeholders within healthcare secondly

586
00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:35,470
to identify those barriers that impede

587
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:38,530
efforts towards promoting cyber security

588
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:41,200
and third let's advance the discussion

589
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:45,639
on innovative approaches for building

590
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:48,010
securable medical devices what were the

591
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,570
workshop sessions focus areas it was

592
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:52,030
about increasing situational awareness

593
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:53,678
on cyber threats it's understanding what

594
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:56,139
are the gaps and challenges I

595
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,059
highlighted here legacy devices because

596
00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:00,730
that again remains it to be a very

597
00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:02,820
complex area and area that we really

598
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:05,410
need to pay a lot of attention to that

599
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:09,070
exploring tools and standards that can

600
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:11,590
be applied to medical devices it's about

601
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:14,169
leveraging expertise that's well within

602
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:16,389
that resides within the sector as well

603
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:18,670
as what can we borrow and translate from

604
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:20,950
other sectors that have proven to be

605
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:22,809
much more mature and it's about

606
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:24,550
establishing a collaborative model for

607
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:28,330
information sharing and a shared risk

608
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:30,550
assessment framework we took what we

609
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:33,070
heard and what we learned at this

610
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:35,678
workshop and we split it into really two

611
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:37,720
bins we called one of them systemic

612
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,360
challenges and parenthetically it's

613
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:42,550
important to recognize that most of the

614
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:45,040
themes within systemic challenges

615
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:47,740
they're not unique to healthcare and

616
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,480
public health rather they're universal

617
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:51,070
to all sectors of critical

618
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,169
infrastructure

619
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:55,029
the second bin of the stakeholder

620
00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:57,970
challenges and those that are more

621
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:59,830
characteristic they characterize better

622
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:02,350
the culture and some of the entrenched

623
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:06,149
behavior that we've seen within the

624
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:09,370
healthcare community and its members

625
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:11,110
systemic challenges again I'm not going

626
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:12,189
to read through all of these with many

627
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:14,649
of them you're probably very familiar

628
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:16,149
with the growing cyber threat the fact

629
00:29:14,649 --> 00:29:18,879
that and we hear this all the time

630
00:29:16,149 --> 00:29:22,570
across all sectors cyber security it

631
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,639
doesn't appear to be on the radar of the

632
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:26,289
c-suite

633
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:28,620
where's that safe space for information

634
00:29:26,289 --> 00:29:33,070
sharing there is no common vernacular

635
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:35,219
taxonomy to talk this language there's

636
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:38,350
no one-size-fits-all solution and

637
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:40,899
cybersecurity it's not just a design

638
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:42,399
issue it is a lifecycle issue I'm going

639
00:29:40,899 --> 00:29:45,070
to say this several times through the

640
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:47,379
talk it's not just at the inception or

641
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:51,000
the design phase it's got to continue

642
00:29:47,379 --> 00:29:51,000
throughout the entire product lifecycle

643
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:55,950
stakeholder challenges well many of them

644
00:29:53,919 --> 00:30:00,250
are very similar it's the lack of trust

645
00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:03,039
it's about stakeholders addressing cyber

646
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:04,840
security in these different silos and

647
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:07,240
some of those silos they really don't

648
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:09,759
even get the clinical environment it's

649
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:13,299
really important to understand context

650
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:15,730
here cyber security researchers bring

651
00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:18,429
disruption to the community disruption

652
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:20,230
in a positive way this is not meant to

653
00:30:18,429 --> 00:30:22,330
be pejorative but the whole idea of

654
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:24,610
disruptive innovation and thinking about

655
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:26,740
things differently and it's the fact

656
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:28,959
that whether it's on the healthcare

657
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:31,409
delivery side or on the manufacturing

658
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,639
side smaller organizations don't

659
00:30:31,409 --> 00:30:35,350
necessarily have the resources or the

660
00:30:33,639 --> 00:30:37,860
expertise to really even understand

661
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,860
where to begin

662
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:43,000
on that note they often don't know how

663
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:45,040
to prioritize vulnerabilities you know

664
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,660
you've got a list of hundreds of

665
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,240
vulnerabilities where should I pay

666
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:53,950
attention first what's most important to

667
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:56,050
correct or to remediate and finally

668
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:58,059
what's the value proposition so this

669
00:30:56,050 --> 00:31:01,059
gets back to the executive or C suite

670
00:30:58,059 --> 00:31:02,350
why should I be investing in

671
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:04,270
cybersecurity

672
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:06,580
well that point is becoming clearer and

673
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:08,920
clearer as we see all the breaches that

674
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:12,159
are taking place and the astronomical

675
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:18,780
costs to an organization associated with

676
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:21,670
that one of the most compelling and

677
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:24,309
unanimous sentiments that was expressed

678
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:27,100
at the workshop by close of day two was

679
00:31:24,309 --> 00:31:29,530
the desire to have a place to continue

680
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:31,780
these important conversations how can we

681
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:35,350
take them to the next level how do we

682
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:37,510
use them as those springboards so that

683
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:40,059
we can formulate actual tangible or

684
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:43,059
concrete next steps and it was important

685
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:45,460
for us at FDA to be able to commit to

686
00:31:43,059 --> 00:31:47,440
our stakeholders and to all of the

687
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:49,420
participants in the workshop that this

688
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,970
was going to be different these two days

689
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:53,500
and wasn't gonna be merely a gathering

690
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:54,970
of folks and then everybody would

691
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,340
disperse everybody would go back to

692
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:59,890
their own organization and business we

693
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:02,199
carry on as usual because there was this

694
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:04,600
palpable energy in the room during that

695
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:08,200
workshop and everybody wants it it's

696
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:10,330
sustained so we knew we had to build on

697
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,820
that momentum we indicated at the

698
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:15,428
workshop that we'd have to find a way to

699
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:18,220
create a space for continuing these

700
00:32:15,429 --> 00:32:20,110
important conversations recognizing this

701
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:22,540
gets to the at the very core of

702
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:25,409
fostering collaboration fostering

703
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,409
engagement

704
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:32,440
the handshake virtual collaboration tool

705
00:32:29,649 --> 00:32:35,469
which is administered by mitre has been

706
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:37,600
an enabling platform for ongoing

707
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:40,120
discussion of topics topics that were

708
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,070
covered during the workshop plus much

709
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:44,110
newer topics that have been emerging

710
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:47,168
that can be brought forward by anyone

711
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:50,709
who is signed up to the handshake site

712
00:32:47,169 --> 00:32:53,559
on mitre we are very interested in

713
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:56,980
growing the number of participants in

714
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:59,918
these dialogues in these conversations

715
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:02,940
and one can easily join anybody can join

716
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:06,130
handshake the public healthcare

717
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:08,320
collaboration site by reaching out to

718
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:11,380
myself we have an email address we have

719
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,270
minor folks here as well who are happy

720
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,740
to sign people off just to give you an

721
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:16,990
example of some of the recent topic

722
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:20,140
areas where there has been some really

723
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:22,840
good conversation mobile medical devices

724
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:24,940
how are those being secured the new

725
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,379
executive order information sharing and

726
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:28,980
analysis organizations and what does

727
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:32,260
that mean and how do we engage in that

728
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:35,020
cyber storm five and a an exercise

729
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:37,390
that's going to be that's going to take

730
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:39,520
place in February 2016 while you know

731
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:41,950
the planning for that exercise across

732
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:44,789
the entire United States is happening

733
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:47,409
right now and we are engaging

734
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:49,720
manufacturers industry healthcare

735
00:33:47,409 --> 00:33:51,970
organizations all parties to participate

736
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,950
in both the planning and the playing of

737
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:56,080
the exercise because that's going to be

738
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:58,929
the opportunity for us to understand

739
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:03,330
where the gaps are for response and for

740
00:33:58,929 --> 00:34:03,330
recovery and what we should be expecting

741
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:09,629
I'd like to now pivot for a few moments

742
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:12,659
to underscore some of the key principles

743
00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:15,149
that were included in the final guidance

744
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:18,500
on pre market submissions that was

745
00:34:15,149 --> 00:34:18,500
issued last October

746
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:27,570
okay so FDA recognizes medical device

747
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:30,899
security shared responsibility shared

748
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:33,270
ownership among stakeholders including

749
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:37,138
healthcare facilities patients providers

750
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:39,149
manufacturers cyber security should be

751
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:42,300
addressed during the design phase and

752
00:34:39,149 --> 00:34:45,330
development it's that concept of baking

753
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:48,720
it in not bolting it on secure design

754
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:49,949
starts with a good process design inputs

755
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,980
that are related to cyber security

756
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:55,199
should be established and the

757
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:57,720
vulnerability and management approach

758
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:00,270
has to be part of software validation

759
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:02,970
and risk analysis this is part of our

760
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:05,940
regulation it's part of design controls

761
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:08,939
and the quality system regulation from

762
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:10,859
medical devices this guidance was

763
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,420
written so that it would align with the

764
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:15,569
NIST of voluntary cybersecurity

765
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:20,000
frameworks five core functions identify

766
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:23,100
protect detect respond and recover

767
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,310
important point here it's important that

768
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:28,770
manufacturers carefully consider the

769
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:32,520
balance between cyber security

770
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:35,130
safeguards and the usability of the

771
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:38,430
device within its intended environment

772
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:41,220
of use why because we need to ensure

773
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:42,779
that the security controls match shot

774
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:46,529
that they're appropriate for the

775
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:47,390
intended use environment after all no

776
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:50,210
one

777
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:52,940
no one wants an outcome where security

778
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:55,760
controls actually hinder access to a

779
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:59,539
device that needs to be deployed during

780
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:03,109
a patient emergency and then again to

781
00:35:59,539 --> 00:36:04,130
highlight here in bold okay point that I

782
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:08,960
made earlier

783
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:11,900
FDA typically does not need to review or

784
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,150
approve medical device software changes

785
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:19,010
that are made solely to strengthen

786
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:21,529
cybersecurity so finally what does

787
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:23,450
acting expect in establishing a

788
00:36:21,529 --> 00:36:26,269
cybersecurity risk management program

789
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:30,109
first and foremost it's about adopting a

790
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:32,808
cybersecurity culture and this is again

791
00:36:30,109 --> 00:36:35,299
in keeping with the theme of total

792
00:36:32,809 --> 00:36:37,849
product lifecycle approach we've talked

793
00:36:35,299 --> 00:36:40,759
a bit about the pre-market side and the

794
00:36:37,849 --> 00:36:41,599
list on the left-hand portion of this

795
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,930
slide

796
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:46,970
really comes out of language in our pre

797
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:49,190
market guidance so I'd like to really

798
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:51,200
focus or draw your attention to the

799
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:55,339
right hand part of the slide the post

800
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:57,890
market one which highlights this dynamic

801
00:36:55,339 --> 00:37:01,788
and very iterative nature of cyber risk

802
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:03,650
assessment I'm probably preaching to the

803
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:06,140
choir here but I'm going to say this and

804
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:08,990
I'll say it twice new vulnerabilities

805
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:11,720
will become identified throughout the

806
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:14,629
lifespan of the product again new

807
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:17,419
vulnerabilities emerge and become

808
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:20,569
identified throughout the lifespan in

809
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:25,279
spite of irrespective of the best

810
00:37:20,569 --> 00:37:27,769
attempts to get that security built into

811
00:37:25,279 --> 00:37:29,900
the initial design so what does that

812
00:37:27,769 --> 00:37:34,069
mean it means that these vulnerabilities

813
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:36,829
are going to warrant new analyses for

814
00:37:34,069 --> 00:37:39,130
clinical impact as well as the need to

815
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:43,450
engage in post market surveillance and

816
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:43,450
information sharing analysis

817
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:50,098
what does it mean to adopt a

818
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:53,040
cybersecurity culture well one place to

819
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:54,720
start is with the NIST voluntary

820
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,240
framework for improving critical

821
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:59,009
infrastructure cybersecurity I talked

822
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:02,580
about the five core functions that are

823
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:05,820
identified in this framework there are

824
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:07,980
experiences that ought to be gleaned and

825
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:10,080
lessons learned from across other

826
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:12,450
sectors where best practices have

827
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:15,029
already been put in place and many of

828
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:18,629
these can and should be adopted by

829
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:21,480
health care public health again risk

830
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:23,910
mitigation has to be addressed on a

831
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:27,000
continuum of the total product life

832
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:29,730
cycle from the concept and design phase

833
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,820
all the way through the obsolescence of

834
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:35,010
a device this means what this means

835
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:37,250
thinking ahead for healthcare delivery

836
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:40,320
organizations as well as manufacturers

837
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:43,050
during the procurement activities to

838
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,240
what the future foreseen as well as

839
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:47,869
potentially the unforeseen needs are

840
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:51,029
going to be and introducing them into

841
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:51,990
contract language when purchasing

842
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:55,290
devices

843
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:58,140
it means vendors working with their

844
00:38:55,290 --> 00:39:00,830
customers to develop more securable

845
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:03,480
devices how so through both

846
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:06,359
implementation of design features as

847
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:09,630
well as understanding what the

848
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:12,839
compensating controls are within that

849
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:16,980
unique use environment and finally by

850
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:19,440
putting in place cyber hygiene so what

851
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:21,750
do we mean by cyber hygiene cyber

852
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,200
hygiene is that state of diligent

853
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:27,089
control of a devices operation it's

854
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:29,819
exercise in the use environment and it's

855
00:39:27,089 --> 00:39:32,640
considered best practice by the security

856
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:34,740
community we're defining cyber hygiene a

857
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,589
year as being comprised of three major

858
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:40,410
categories its number one the safe and

859
00:39:37,589 --> 00:39:43,440
proper configuration of available

860
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:46,259
features number two it's about least

861
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,360
privileged access to control functions

862
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:52,120
and

863
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:55,700
it's about upholding cybersecurity

864
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:57,980
routine servicing now what should be

865
00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:00,649
fairly obvious about these three

866
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:03,410
categories is that ownership and

867
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:06,830
responsibility for cybersecurity is

868
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:08,180
shared cyber hygiene is not solely in

869
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:12,069
the hands of the medical device

870
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:15,350
manufacturers but it resides well within

871
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:18,770
the controls and the execution of the

872
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:21,020
end-user facility and it's universally

873
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:23,870
shared perspective by security

874
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:27,140
researchers by firms by government that

875
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:29,540
undertaking simply undertaking best

876
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:32,240
practices of cyber hygiene is going to

877
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:36,350
reduce the potential for exploit and

878
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:38,750
attack by a significant percentage so

879
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:41,450
healthcare in public health as a sector

880
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:45,170
it has a huge opportunity here to put

881
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:47,899
these practices in place as very basic

882
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:52,580
fundamental measures to decrease the

883
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:54,170
risk of vulnerability exploit in summary

884
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:56,600
we talked about the following key

885
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:59,330
takeaways establishing cybersecurity

886
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:02,240
risk management programs making cyber

887
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:04,150
hygiene paramount creating that trusted

888
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,439
environment for information sharing

889
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:08,630
seeking to foster this whole of

890
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:12,020
community approach and I'm talking to

891
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:15,140
this community as well software update

892
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:18,440
updates again they do not by and large

893
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:20,990
require new submissions - or

894
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:23,510
notifications to the FDA if they're part

895
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:25,669
of routine servicing and FDA is not

896
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:30,770
going to be prescriptive with respect to

897
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:34,010
risk analyses as we look forward towards

898
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:36,280
the future we envision this continuous

899
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:40,340
cycle that really draws upon information

900
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:43,460
from all of the incoming feeds here that

901
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:44,750
further drive or inform action so

902
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:48,410
there's the

903
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:50,240
stakeholder collaboration peace industry

904
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:53,750
healthcare organizations partners

905
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:55,970
researchers and experts it's about being

906
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:57,500
able to enable this platform for

907
00:41:55,970 --> 00:42:00,470
maintaining awareness whether it's

908
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:04,880
intentional or unintentional threats its

909
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:07,220
FDA's responsibility to define clearly

910
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,650
what our regulatory expectations are

911
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:12,950
total product life cycle here again on

912
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:16,250
the pre-market side as new products come

913
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:20,810
in as well as the entire life span of

914
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:22,849
that product and then engaging in post

915
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:24,340
market surveillance for which we need

916
00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:27,260
the entire community's involvement

917
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:30,770
because this is going to feed upon and

918
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:34,820
iterate the ability to address

919
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:37,460
vulnerabilities that are out there and

920
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:39,140
with that I just want to thank Josh and

921
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:41,090
thank the entire audience for this

922
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:43,609
opportunity to speak to you on behalf of

923
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:45,220
FDA and I'm happy if there's time to

924
00:42:43,609 --> 00:42:48,430
address any questions that you have

925
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:48,430
thank you

926
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:03,300
maybe a

927
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:12,120
thanks a lot dr. Schwartz presentation

928
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:13,580
wonder it seems to me like the FDA would

929
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:19,720
be

930
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:19,720
we suffer a prescriptive requirement

931
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:27,950
but it seems to me like they're not they

932
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:31,300
are be required to say we are doing like

933
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:34,250
not not just recommended but require

934
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:36,829
plants or how they rescue me over did

935
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:40,470
like sacrificing and one who would

936
00:43:36,829 --> 00:43:45,310
affect that change where

937
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:47,799
so great question and we do address that

938
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:50,970
so you know to mention a couple of

939
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:53,410
things generally what the FDA does is

940
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:55,209
obviously there are regulations and then

941
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:58,240
there's guidance guidance is often

942
00:43:55,210 --> 00:44:00,369
articulate off it articulates policy and

943
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:02,910
guidance would often also say that these

944
00:44:00,369 --> 00:44:05,859
are non-binding recommendations

945
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:08,440
recommendations however are fairly

946
00:44:05,859 --> 00:44:10,869
understood to be this is really the way

947
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:13,119
you should go industry however if you

948
00:44:10,869 --> 00:44:16,570
can provide another alternative means

949
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:19,150
and justify it the FDA is certainly

950
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:22,349
willing and open to hearing what that

951
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:25,210
alternate path is with respect to a

952
00:44:22,349 --> 00:44:28,380
requirement a regulation is a

953
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:31,390
requirement we consider cybersecurity

954
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:34,359
under the Quality Systems regulation

955
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:36,700
when we do not need to seek out new

956
00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:38,980
regulations specific to cybersecurity

957
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:42,399
because we consider that to be embedded

958
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:45,400
within what we want is part of quality

959
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:48,099
systems so yes it is a requirement to

960
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:50,170
address cybersecurity and you'll hear

961
00:44:48,099 --> 00:44:52,900
more and more about our talking about

962
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:55,569
this aspect that safety and

963
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:57,910
effectiveness of medical devices means

964
00:44:55,569 --> 00:45:00,700
that they need to be secured as well

965
00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:02,410
it's part of that picture now I will

966
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:04,868
grant you that there are vulnerabilities

967
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:08,109
out there with respect to devices that

968
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:10,569
may not have a safety concern a patient

969
00:45:08,109 --> 00:45:13,420
safety concern associated with them that

970
00:45:10,569 --> 00:45:15,790
does not mean that we do not want to see

971
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:18,310
those vulnerabilities addressed they

972
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:20,349
should be as part of again reaching

973
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:23,020
servicing and making enhancements

974
00:45:20,349 --> 00:45:26,550
especially because we're looking at this

975
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:29,290
in that proactive and in that

976
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:31,359
preventative manner you don't want to

977
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:34,329
see a vulnerability that may not have

978
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:37,839
today a patient's safety or public

979
00:45:34,329 --> 00:45:40,000
health concern evolve into something in

980
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:42,460
five months or a year or two years later

981
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:46,299
that does trip the wire and

982
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:48,490
have a patient safety concern so being

983
00:45:46,299 --> 00:45:51,130
proactive being forward-leaning in that

984
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:55,270
regard is something that we are you know

985
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:56,680
strongly encouraging and as we look to

986
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:59,220
one of the things I mentioned is our

987
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:02,980
working group that's responsible for

988
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:05,049
defining policy and define and and

989
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:06,910
writing new guidance is working on this

990
00:46:05,049 --> 00:46:10,270
post-market piece the post-market piece

991
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:12,788
again is really where the bulk of the of

992
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:15,069
the issues lie rather than then on on

993
00:46:12,789 --> 00:46:17,200
the pre-market side so I hope that that

994
00:46:15,069 --> 00:46:25,210
kind of addresses both what guidance

995
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:26,230
does and then the regulatory nature one

996
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:29,650
of the things we talked about this

997
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:33,549
morning is some of the really well

998
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:35,140
intentions security researchers be

999
00:46:33,549 --> 00:46:37,210
readily useful and helpful to this

1000
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:38,980
process and some of them even with the

1001
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:41,109
best of intentions have been very very

1002
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:43,619
harmful to building trust and rapport

1003
00:46:41,109 --> 00:46:46,990
with the multiple stakeholders can you

1004
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:49,180
contrast the things that have maybe been

1005
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:51,520
less helpful and the things that have

1006
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:53,848
been more helpful so that this talent

1007
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:57,538
pool can be their best contributors

1008
00:46:53,849 --> 00:46:57,539
absolutely so

1009
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:04,940
our our need our mission again is you

1010
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:08,240
know to protect and to advance the

1011
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:09,770
public health and how as an agency we do

1012
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,899
that at large not just the Center for

1013
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:14,960
Devices but across all of the product

1014
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:17,300
centers is looking at benefit risk

1015
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:20,619
correct we always have to weigh out what

1016
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:20,619
benefit and risks are

1017
00:47:21,069 --> 00:47:28,130
when disclosures are made in the public

1018
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:30,160
domain whether it's through media or

1019
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:33,980
other means without providing

1020
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:36,950
necessarily an understanding of context

1021
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:40,400
and what first of all mitigations may

1022
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:42,618
actually exist in in that environment of

1023
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:46,790
use already what the compensating

1024
00:47:42,619 --> 00:47:52,040
controls are or what the potential is

1025
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:55,220
for that disclosure creating hysteria

1026
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:58,130
among among the public or anxiety so

1027
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:59,899
much so that individuals that patients

1028
00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:03,109
and their families become concerned

1029
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:05,359
about the safety and effectiveness of

1030
00:48:03,109 --> 00:48:07,910
devices that are in current use that

1031
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:10,460
becomes problematic to the public trusts

1032
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:12,500
that can become very damaging and again

1033
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:14,809
you know as Josh pointed out we

1034
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:18,740
recognize that the passion and the

1035
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:21,049
mission of the researcher is in the you

1036
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:24,140
know with his or her heart in the right

1037
00:48:21,049 --> 00:48:26,480
place to protect the public but what we

1038
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:28,819
need to make sure with the understanding

1039
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:31,220
especially with so many devices out

1040
00:48:28,819 --> 00:48:35,000
there that have vulnerabilities present

1041
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:37,549
that there needs to be a systematic way

1042
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,059
of dealing with these types of

1043
00:48:37,549 --> 00:48:43,790
vulnerabilities and appropriately

1044
00:48:40,059 --> 00:48:45,619
analyzing mitigating or remediating them

1045
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:47,359
or taking if FDA needs to take that

1046
00:48:45,619 --> 00:48:49,609
appropriate action by understanding

1047
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:51,380
again the entire landscape of what the

1048
00:48:49,609 --> 00:48:54,529
impact is going to be on public health

1049
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:57,220
that is the better route to take it's

1050
00:48:54,530 --> 00:49:00,200
the better route to take because again

1051
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:04,220
lots of devices out there that serve

1052
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:07,980
critical sometimes life-saving functions

1053
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:11,549
taking those devices off the market is

1054
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:13,890
not an easy is not you know a quick and

1055
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:16,860
easy solution to a problem when those

1056
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:19,529
devices are delivering a critical care

1057
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:22,020
and again this comes back to measuring

1058
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:24,000
the benefit versus risk on a patient to

1059
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:26,520
patient basis as well as on the public

1060
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,820
health at large we certainly do not want

1061
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:33,360
to induce what becomes quote-unquote a

1062
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:35,730
critical shortage of particular types of

1063
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:38,340
devices and then patients don't have the

1064
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:43,760
means of receiving the type of necessary

1065
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:46,410
care that they have to receive because

1066
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:48,960
vulnerabilities have been identified in

1067
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:50,970
a public domain in a way that does not

1068
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,760
allow for court first of all that

1069
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:56,569
coordinated disclosure in a responsible

1070
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,740
manner and in a means where the

1071
00:49:56,570 --> 00:50:02,510
vulnerabilities understood the

1072
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:05,160
mitigations have already been identified

1073
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:08,130
whatever remediation needs to occur or

1074
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:10,799
again if the FDA needs to take an action

1075
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:14,070
with a manufacturer that we can do so so

1076
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:17,400
the contrast there is one where you can

1077
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:18,870
work with ICS search and ics-cert often

1078
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:21,150
works with directly with with the

1079
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:24,000
research community as do we

1080
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:27,030
and with the manufacturers to understand

1081
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,890
excuse me to understand there is

1082
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:32,400
vulnerabilities and to make that

1083
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:34,980
assessment contextualizing it within the

1084
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:37,440
clinical environment and working to see

1085
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:39,750
what can be done to put in the

1086
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:42,600
appropriate controls so that it's no

1087
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:44,640
longer an uncontrolled vulnerability

1088
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:47,549
it's a controlled vulnerability and one

1089
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:49,710
that can be overcome but when a

1090
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:52,050
disclosure is put out in the public

1091
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:55,370
space that we consider to be

1092
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:59,279
uncontrolled and that attracts attention

1093
00:50:55,370 --> 00:51:01,259
attention by others that may have

1094
00:50:59,279 --> 00:51:03,089
that intent or maybe they don't have

1095
00:51:01,259 --> 00:51:05,130
that intent but they they don't

1096
00:51:03,089 --> 00:51:07,229
understand they may not have the

1097
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:08,819
maturity especially on the younger age

1098
00:51:07,229 --> 00:51:11,218
to understand what the downstream

1099
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:12,959
consequences are of trying something out

1100
00:51:11,219 --> 00:51:15,329
because it's out there because the codes

1101
00:51:12,959 --> 00:51:17,428
out there and now this looks quite cool

1102
00:51:15,329 --> 00:51:20,039
look I can do the following without

1103
00:51:17,429 --> 00:51:23,339
thinking about what might be the impact

1104
00:51:20,039 --> 00:51:25,529
on patients on public health so what we

1105
00:51:23,339 --> 00:51:27,419
asked for and what we would like to see

1106
00:51:25,529 --> 00:51:32,309
happen and we're starting to see that

1107
00:51:27,419 --> 00:51:35,669
wonderful shift is in really leveraging

1108
00:51:32,309 --> 00:51:40,679
capital capitalizing upon the expertise

1109
00:51:35,669 --> 00:51:42,989
that the research community has to

1110
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:45,599
educate us and for us to be able to

1111
00:51:42,989 --> 00:51:48,569
educate the research community in

1112
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:51,150
understanding what our you know the

1113
00:51:48,569 --> 00:51:53,609
constraints that we have to be mindful

1114
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:55,019
of and it's more than constraints it's

1115
00:51:53,609 --> 00:51:56,759
really the concerns that we have to be

1116
00:51:55,019 --> 00:51:59,058
mindful of within the you know

1117
00:51:56,759 --> 00:52:02,309
healthcare and public health sector I

1118
00:51:59,059 --> 00:52:04,459
hope that that maybe gets added a little

1119
00:52:02,309 --> 00:52:04,459
bit
