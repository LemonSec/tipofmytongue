1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:05,279
okay all right we're gonna change all

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,120
that

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:11,280
yeah wait wait I'm the keynote shouldn't

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,440
come out on stage or something all right

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,619
so let's introduce we opened the day

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,600
with a CIS Oh a practitioner who's

7
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,539
trying to take the best talent from the

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,029
financial services world which is a

9
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:26,220
well-funded very mature security rigger

10
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:27,029
and he's trying to suggest that we

11
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,890
should take some of our best and

12
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:30,330
brightest and move them to areas where

13
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,668
they need it most particularly in health

14
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,230
care some of you guys know that I think

15
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:36,589
there's several motivations to why

16
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,910
people do hacking or do cyber security

17
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,920
some of us do it for curiosity and the

18
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,078
challenge some of us do it - to win the

19
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,510
white jacket at pwned the own and the

20
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,980
fame and the glory some do it to get

21
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,690
filthy rich some do it to make the world

22
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,309
a safer place maybe it's a political

23
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:54,390
reason regardless of your motivations

24
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:57,300
quite a few people in the last couple

25
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,340
years have made very significant changes

26
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,530
to ask themselves where can I have the

27
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,140
most impact and where can I be my best

28
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:07,170
self and our next keynote our closing

29
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,689
keynote is from our tribe and he

30
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,810
abandoned his own company had started at

31
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:15,449
Med security a fairly abandoned sounds

32
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,979
so how I'll get there but you know it's

33
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,820
gotta take a lot of driving they're

34
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,729
doing really great

35
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,008
it's got take a lot of courage to to do

36
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:26,280
that right so he built a very good in

37
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,479
vibrant company but his heart wanted to

38
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,310
try something new it wouldn't be his

39
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,780
best self somewhere else and when he

40
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,420
asked herself where can I have the most

41
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,549
impact and the greatest challenge he

42
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,530
decided rather than finding a single bug

43
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:39,869
and a single develop medical device from

44
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:44,670
a single manufacturer perhaps he could

45
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:46,799
go into GE healthcare and changed within

46
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,990
and also set the standard for everyone

47
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,490
else in the space and I have a

48
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,669
tremendous amount of admiration for that

49
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:56,490
courageous choice to take the next step

50
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,320
and I asked you as a lingering question

51
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,600
the answer throughout today and tomorrow

52
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,490
is where can you have the greatest

53
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,990
impact and the greatest challenge and

54
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,280
what is your next step and let's take

55
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,530
some inspiration from our closing

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,399
keynote Brown applause for Mike Murray

57
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,399
thanks Jeff

58
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:21,090
man that was a lot to live up to yeah

59
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:23,459
and and Josh now why I left Madden why I

60
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:27,510
went to GE I usually say it a little

61
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:30,109
more flippantly but to go to a massive

62
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,578
company with with huge scope and scale

63
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:34,469
was an opportunity that we don't get

64
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:36,659
very often in our security careers and

65
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:39,030
you guys it's funny the last time I was

66
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:40,349
on the source Boston stage I was talking

67
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,959
about careers I was doing a career

68
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:46,290
workshop here probably five years ago

69
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,359
with Lee Kushner and so my career has

70
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,298
changed a lot since I was doing that and

71
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:53,700
what I want to talk about today is how

72
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:58,919
do you guys stop all asourian's talk

73
00:02:53,700 --> 00:03:01,108
earlier I'd be interested because I

74
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:04,409
missed it because I was on calls pretty

75
00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:05,790
much all day but I have a feeling we're

76
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:08,548
gonna say a lot of the same things just

77
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,950
in different ways and I think the place

78
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:13,200
I want to start is I don't want to set

79
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,418
the standard for medical devices I'll be

80
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,209
honest I don't think medical devices are

81
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:21,510
necessarily that that interesting by

82
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:24,440
themselves I care about things and if

83
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:27,269
you talk to anyone at GE healthcare

84
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:30,239
specifically the health care piece we

85
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:33,090
consider ourselves an IOT company GE

86
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,220
considers itself an IOT company in fact

87
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:39,000
we've coined a term the industrial

88
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:40,620
Internet and if you read the G's the GE

89
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,150
marketing material there's all kinds of

90
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,090
stuff about the industrial Internet and

91
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:48,359
what is that it's basically IOT for

92
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:52,290
industry it is IOT at a much higher

93
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:54,989
level and we tend to get up and talk a

94
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,578
lot about IOT like it's the future and

95
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:59,970
I've been having fun with this for the

96
00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:02,009
last little while because IOT I don't

97
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:04,199
really think is the future how many of

98
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:06,760
you guys are wearing a Fitbit or some

99
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:10,600
sort of fitness band right now

100
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:14,049
mmm 25% of the room how many guys have

101
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,049
at home

102
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:21,130
hold on RescueTime just interrupted me

103
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:21,130
too

104
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:31,650
annoy my slide deck and powerpoints now

105
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:31,650
stop working I love being on a match

106
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:38,400
how many you guys have devices at home

107
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:42,820
like this nest thermostat I've you know

108
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,380
the sleep monitoring thing the broke you

109
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,370
know blood pressure medications Wi-Fi

110
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:50,350
scale all that kind of stuff

111
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:53,110
about another 20 percent of you how many

112
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:57,490
of you guys came in a train an airplane

113
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:59,380
or have been to a hospital recently and

114
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:01,690
how many of you guys can are carrying a

115
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,599
smartphone actually who's not carrying a

116
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:06,270
smartphone

117
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:07,770
is there anyone anyone in this audience

118
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:10,139
that doesn't have a smartphone as I'm

119
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:12,719
sorry every one of those things is

120
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:17,369
internet connected and every one of

121
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:20,610
those things is now online transmitting

122
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:23,429
data 24 hours a day and you might think

123
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,539
an airplane engine yeah an airplane

124
00:05:23,429 --> 00:05:26,909
engine

125
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:29,729
I remember the stat right our airplane

126
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:35,459
engines generate about a terabyte of

127
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:37,558
data for every hour of flight time you

128
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:39,389
don't think of that as a thing in the

129
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:42,719
Internet of Things sense you think of

130
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:47,459
the nest thermostat but what we're

131
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:48,930
seeing is really a sea change in and we

132
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:51,899
haven't even begun to see what this

133
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:55,080
waves gonna look like when you think

134
00:05:51,899 --> 00:06:00,209
back to what happened 10 years ago when

135
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:04,529
people connected online we saw network

136
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:07,199
effects throughout society that have

137
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:09,808
changed so much I mean the idea that the

138
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:13,319
president is tweeting which happened

139
00:06:09,809 --> 00:06:14,580
last week is really interesting if you

140
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:16,649
thought about if you think back to like

141
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,318
2000 what was it 2009 when Twitter came

142
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:21,899
out and I had to be earlier than that

143
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:23,669
maybe 2007 and everybody was like I

144
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:27,419
don't want to put on Twitter what I had

145
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:30,769
for breakfast and now everyone's doing

146
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:33,269
every how many people aren't on Facebook

147
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:37,199
how many of you aren't on Facebook for

148
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:40,680
security reasons how many of you aren't

149
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,869
on Facebook because it's not useful like

150
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,699
five you know five percent of the room

151
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:48,599
and I think you guys are laggards I

152
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:51,330
think you guys are Reddick's because

153
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:55,680
frankly Facebook is incredibly useful

154
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:57,870
and the things that happen to us when we

155
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,819
connected ourselves when a certain

156
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:02,250
number of us got online and connected

157
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:05,970
our social graphs in the internet world

158
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:09,180
is exactly what's about to happen with

159
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:10,650
machines except it's not going to be a

160
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:13,650
billion machines we probably already

161
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:15,870
have that in fact we definitely do if

162
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:18,719
you count smartphones it's going to be

163
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,550
50 billion you know the old joke about

164
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,780
your toaster eventually having an IP

165
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:29,940
address is about to happen it's always

166
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:32,128
the toaster and and when that happens

167
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,090
the world is going to change and it's

168
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:36,449
happening already

169
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:39,090
this is a GE slide for it's one of the

170
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:40,669
healthcare slides that we talk about the

171
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:43,789
forces shaping the healthcare industry

172
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:46,378
that I actually stole the slide and

173
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:49,590
because I actually think that's forces

174
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:52,620
shaping insert industry here that

175
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:54,000
literally Internet of Things intelligent

176
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,250
machines machine learning and

177
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,039
classification big data and analytics

178
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,360
are not just annoying buzz words that

179
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,699
VC's like to throw around

180
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,069
I missed the VC panel that was just

181
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:08,120
before this I bet they said all four of

182
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:08,120
those things at one point

183
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:14,189
that's why they're investing in them how

184
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:18,180
many of you guys have noticed the

185
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:20,430
harvard business reviews current topic

186
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:23,629
anybody read it we read this month of

187
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:27,389
Harvard Business Review that's the cover

188
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:28,979
and there is there's an article in there

189
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:30,389
called and I'm going to screw up the

190
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:32,880
title but it's something to the effect

191
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:37,979
of how to deal with your boss when he's

192
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:39,539
made of metal machines are moving up the

193
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:41,430
stack in terms of intelligence and

194
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:43,500
they're they're going to be everywhere I

195
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:46,170
know I'm preaching Skynet but it's

196
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:49,740
changing work it's changing industry

197
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:53,219
it's changing everything and what it's

198
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:55,740
changing most is the way that we think

199
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,450
about hardware and software and the way

200
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,940
that we think about the way products are

201
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:02,579
built this is all preamble to talk about

202
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:06,029
how things are built because when we

203
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:09,089
build things in the old way nobody

204
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:12,329
accepts that anymore you would you it

205
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:14,570
will blow your mind to talk to to be

206
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:17,130
inside a medical device manufacturer

207
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,899
where we're still used to building

208
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:21,120
things in the way we always did if

209
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:24,149
you're building a CT scanner for example

210
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,589
it's like a two-ton magnet you build it

211
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:27,089
like you would build a two-ton magnet

212
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:28,260
it's got it's got a long product

213
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:32,459
development lifecycle because these

214
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:35,819
things are hard to get right right that

215
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:37,979
what's the customer used to now they're

216
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:41,130
used to their iPhone updating with the

217
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:44,660
newest app every 10 minutes what why

218
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:47,500
can't your medical devices do that

219
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:50,679
recently overheard term

220
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,679
[Music]

221
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:58,630
and that's going to be a reality within

222
00:09:54,520 --> 00:10:01,170
five years I will guarantee that that

223
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:04,180
will be a reality within five years

224
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:06,360
so when Josh said that I came here I

225
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:09,489
picked this job because it was hard

226
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,780
think about it you guys actually I can

227
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,480
say this in this room because you guys

228
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:20,170
get it think about if we screw that up

229
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:23,680
as a society right you guys have lived

230
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:27,010
the the pain of insecure devices you

231
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:30,520
know of insecure systems that's a system

232
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:33,069
I often make a joke when people ask me

233
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:35,079
what I do you know and I say oh I'm in

234
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:38,860
security at GE and their eyes glaze over

235
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:41,770
I say here's here's my job never had a

236
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:44,680
cat scan or an MRI where you inside the

237
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:47,610
metal tube do you want a hacker playing

238
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,609
around with that while you're in there

239
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:54,250
that's my job and the stakes are that

240
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:57,370
and the states are really interesting

241
00:10:54,250 --> 00:11:00,010
because technology is not moving fast

242
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:01,900
enough to keep up with what business

243
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:04,990
needs especially in critical

244
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:08,170
infrastructure and by the way

245
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:12,130
interesting tidbit GE itself not health

246
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:13,420
care is if somebody told me I don't know

247
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,950
that this is a hundred percent true but

248
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,390
somebody told me that we're the only

249
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:19,180
company in the world that's in all of

250
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:21,040
those domains it has industry in every

251
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:24,370
one of them it's really kind of cool

252
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,920
that the technology across the board in

253
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:29,500
those industries is not keeping up the

254
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:34,390
technology that we're trying to smart

255
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:36,580
enable cars you know power grids you

256
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:39,860
know power smart meters all that kind of

257
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:44,480
stuff is not keeping up

258
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:46,519
and so what we're seeing is this race to

259
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,600
try and Internet enable any everything

260
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:54,440
and what we're ending up with as I'm

261
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:57,260
sure you guys are aware is that over the

262
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,820
last 10 years our critical

263
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,620
infrastructure domains have not done a

264
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:03,440
good job from a cyber perspective I was

265
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:05,120
trying to set up this talk and I was

266
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,160
looking when I was on the plane the

267
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,769
other day I went to Google for a couple

268
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,560
of those headlines and I said I don't

269
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:14,320
know if you you can't really see the

270
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:18,229
this the search settings across the top

271
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,450
that's past month and it was like the

272
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:22,730
past month Google search for hospital

273
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:26,060
data breach was just like line after

274
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:28,519
line after line after line and then the

275
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:30,859
IRS got on yesterday like we're innocent

276
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:32,269
we're in we're in a time where we're

277
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,459
trying to move everything to be the

278
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:35,870
internet of things and we're not even

279
00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:40,899
doing the traditional like tea right yet

280
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:43,490
and it's going to be a problem

281
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:46,820
it's it's going to be a problem of

282
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:52,330
almost Dilbert Ian's proportions if we

283
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:55,010
do it wrong now here's the problem

284
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:56,630
if you work in a business the business

285
00:12:55,010 --> 00:13:00,890
has goals right the business is trying

286
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:03,620
to get some way and I'm gonna divert for

287
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:05,030
a second and and go down a bit of a bit

288
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:07,010
of an alley to talk about something

289
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:09,800
really important within software in tech

290
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:12,410
in technology you guys have ever been

291
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,390
into product built a product especially

292
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:16,520
in an agile shop you'll you'll be aware

293
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:19,340
of this but if you weren't and I hadn't

294
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:21,280
until I sat down with one of our agile

295
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,420
coaches to to learn some of these things

296
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,760
I'd never heard of the concept of cost

297
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:27,290
of delay but basically the idea being

298
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,040
that the longer you wait to get out of

299
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:34,189
product the more money you've spent and

300
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,010
if it takes you you know if it takes you

301
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:38,330
a month to get a product out well you

302
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:42,740
only paid for your development team for

303
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:44,330
that month and you are you know you are

304
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,130
spending money while all those people

305
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:48,130
are sitting around this is important

306
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:50,270
when you realize what we do

307
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:53,960
what is Security's function within

308
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:57,800
product development most of the time we

309
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:59,000
slow everything down right so I don't

310
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,160
you guys the back definitely can't read

311
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,200
the slides but in the bottom corner I

312
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,339
have a simple example suppose your

313
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,590
products going to make you twenty

314
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:11,600
million dollars a year how much does one

315
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:12,920
week cost you if you delay that product

316
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,250
a week how much does it actually cost

317
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,250
you

318
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:22,720
roughly half a million dollars how

319
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,720
long's your average penetration test

320
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:32,210
for none for any reasonable product two

321
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:37,250
weeks my ass that's if they don't find

322
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:40,700
anything this is how the business sees

323
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:43,970
us by the way this is why we don't get

324
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:46,910
what we want is because we the business

325
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:49,400
is already the business is already ten

326
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,900
steps down the road from technology the

327
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,189
executives thought it up and as far as

328
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:55,520
they're concerned the product should be

329
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:58,310
released tomorrow and then security

330
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:00,699
comes along and we cost them five

331
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:03,619
hundred grand a week with all of our

332
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:08,240
pain-in-the-ass process steps with all

333
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:11,680
of our you know SDL and all of our fancy

334
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,600
stuff is meat we spend all this time

335
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,130
driving them to be more secure and all

336
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:23,450
they see is the dollar signs that were

337
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:26,480
costing them so we need to get faster

338
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:27,980
but how do we do that well everybody

339
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,890
everybody I talked to says security

340
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:33,670
needs to be more agile which is very

341
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:36,380
true I agree with the statement but then

342
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:37,699
the the best of the best and the

343
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,890
brightest come up with the idea for

344
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,960
making security agile in terms of

345
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:44,569
product development is we're just going

346
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:48,400
to take that and we're just gonna throw

347
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,400
in some of that every sprint

348
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:57,250
literally that's what they said and so

349
00:15:54,130 --> 00:16:00,150
you end up with this situation where

350
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:02,800
security where do we do all the security

351
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:04,290
90% of the security activities right at

352
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,380
the end of most development life cycles

353
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:10,329
right and you know you you you give some

354
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:12,010
lip service to secure design you a

355
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:14,200
little bit you talk about some secure

356
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:16,270
design stuff up front you do some stuff

357
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,760
once in a while and then you do all the

358
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:20,819
security stuff at the end you know how

359
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:23,830
much that costs

360
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:26,200
we released anybody not seen this chart

361
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:28,270
this is an ancient chart of how much a

362
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,550
bug costs to fix in various development

363
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:37,810
phases its exponential the longer you

364
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:40,479
wait so we need to be more agile because

365
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:42,400
in this world of internet of things in

366
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,860
this world of software-defined devices

367
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:50,140
in this world of you know DevOps and

368
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:52,750
companies releasing 20 30 40 times a day

369
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:56,040
the idea of a 6-week penetration test or

370
00:16:52,750 --> 00:17:01,800
even a two-week penetration test Jeff

371
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:04,260
it doesn't work it can't work and you

372
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:08,010
know you expect traditionally you're

373
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:10,010
developers our waterfall model you know

374
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:14,280
and they go along with sort of that

375
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:17,040
methodological thing this is the process

376
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,449
map for our development it's called the

377
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,010
it's called the scaled agile framework

378
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:23,130
you can go to scale valve your agile

379
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:26,160
framework and get that it's unbelievably

380
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:33,240
complex but it's designed to move really

381
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:35,970
really really fast it's designed and you

382
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:39,890
don't think about a company like the one

383
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:44,640
I work at as moving at startup speed

384
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:46,440
I've seen more DevOps and agile inside

385
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,570
this company than I've seen anywhere

386
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,360
else I ran a consulting company we had

387
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:54,418
hundreds of clients I've never seen

388
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,370
anybody that can move the way this the

389
00:17:54,419 --> 00:18:02,790
company I work at now does now does and

390
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:07,020
we have to do it securely so how do we

391
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:09,059
go about getting security and how do we

392
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,679
get there I'll come back to what we're

393
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:12,510
doing and the things that we do as far

394
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:13,890
as Josh said we're trying to set the bar

395
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,570
we are trying to set the bar

396
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,220
it doesn't mean we've done it yet

397
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:19,439
believe me I've only been there eighteen

398
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:23,040
months this is not a ship you turn

399
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:25,890
around that quickly but the most

400
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:28,700
important thing actually comes from you

401
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:32,040
guys the most important thing about

402
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:34,679
getting security is not what any of the

403
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:37,440
device manufacturers can do it's not

404
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:39,210
about what any of the you know airplane

405
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,030
manufacturers can do they don't get to

406
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:44,700
solve the problem not really because

407
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:46,710
here's how it's supposed to work who

408
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,750
takes all the risk you know in this

409
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,440
situation who actually takes the risk if

410
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:53,029
you think about it

411
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:56,630
Jeff pointed at himself I think Josh

412
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:59,809
takes all the risk no we do right you

413
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:00,799
know if if you get yeah you know your

414
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:03,678
data breached

415
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,809
who's the consequent who ultimately is

416
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,000
the consequence hitting it's you

417
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:09,678
I had my identity stolen a couple years

418
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,409
ago I'm expecting it to happen again now

419
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:15,049
that the IRS contact somebody filed a

420
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:15,289
false extra turn in my name he's in jail

421
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:19,279
now

422
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:21,620
and it took me two years to clean that

423
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:23,049
up I take the risk and I had like all

424
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:27,500
that identity theft insurance and stuff

425
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:29,090
I take the risk on that regardless of

426
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:32,240
whether somebody gets fined or breached

427
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:34,100
or whatever so how should this work the

428
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,580
person who takes the risk should

429
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:39,469
ultimately make a smart decision and not

430
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:41,539
purchase the things that are causing

431
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:45,010
them risk really it should work like

432
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:49,250
this you take the risk by you know by

433
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:51,379
like giving your data to whoever and

434
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:53,059
they're holding on to it what you're

435
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:55,100
hoping is that they're doing a good job

436
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:56,570
of securing you know if some Hospital

437
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:59,090
somewhere is doing a good job securing

438
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:01,309
their stuff the decision process you're

439
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:04,010
hoping is if they experience more risk

440
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:05,418
well you know because some vendor is

441
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,649
hurting them or if you're experiencing

442
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:08,210
more risk because some vendors hurting

443
00:20:06,649 --> 00:20:12,020
you you buy something different you

444
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:15,710
won't use that vendor right that's how

445
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:17,539
that process should work but

446
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:20,779
unfortunately what we're not doing well

447
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:23,120
on the customer and IT side yet and this

448
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:24,830
is what we have to do well across the

449
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,918
board I don't know I don't know if you

450
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:30,320
said this but to me accurate assessment

451
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,149
of risk is going to be the most

452
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,460
important thing we figure out over the

453
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:35,320
next five years because we don't figure

454
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,690
that out

455
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:40,810
this breaks

456
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:44,350
pretty much right here and how do you

457
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:48,070
buy products you just buy whatever you

458
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:49,810
buy whatever it takes you know you but

459
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:53,260
nobody ever gets fired for buying Cisco

460
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:57,610
right you you end up buying either

461
00:20:53,260 --> 00:21:00,220
through loyalty or because it's cool I

462
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:01,570
will tell you most Apple fanboys

463
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,360
wouldn't have cared if all of their

464
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:05,950
private data ended up like on in the

465
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,979
Wall Street Journal the first time the

466
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:10,810
iPhone came out right nobody cared about

467
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:13,780
security they just wanted the cool thing

468
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:15,610
that happens in corporations to usually

469
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:18,040
has some executive going to a conference

470
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:19,780
seeing some talk by some vendor and

471
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,580
coming back and saying hey you got to

472
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,899
talk to these guys which of course I'm

473
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,929
gonna do you're my team three times

474
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:32,710
since I've been here that though

475
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:37,660
Pelletier is not in the room good so the

476
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:40,540
point is it's it's on everyone to make

477
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:43,650
this decision right it's on everyone to

478
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:45,940
drive their vendors to have better

479
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:49,000
better products it's on everyone to

480
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:51,880
drive towards more effective security

481
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,560
and you guys specifically how many of

482
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,030
you how many of you guys you know I

483
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,409
don't know what your businesses are most

484
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:58,030
of you are probably on the IT side of

485
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:59,110
the world but in the IT side of the

486
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:01,060
world how many of you guys are actually

487
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:03,799
involved in buying decisions that aren't

488
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:06,658
about security

489
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:12,899
that terrifies me

490
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:14,339
I literally six hands right and so why

491
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:17,099
do we think that any of those decisions

492
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:20,700
will have any security impact or any

493
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:22,979
security you know a consideration at all

494
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:25,079
well you'll probably get to make that

495
00:22:22,979 --> 00:22:26,399
decision sometime after they buy it and

496
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:31,109
they go hey security person make this

497
00:22:26,399 --> 00:22:33,539
secure will yeah that is one of the

498
00:22:31,109 --> 00:22:37,079
biggest problems we're having right

499
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:39,419
because we have to be able to do that

500
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:41,399
and unfortunately where this gets really

501
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:42,959
where this gets really tricky is it

502
00:22:41,399 --> 00:22:45,809
makes for difficult decisions on both

503
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:46,950
sides first of all if you're a product

504
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:49,829
manufacturer if you're building

505
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:52,039
something you have to drive towards you

506
00:22:49,829 --> 00:22:55,099
know it's sort of a catch-22 right now

507
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:58,139
if there's no customer asking for a fee

508
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:59,700
how do you convince the business that

509
00:22:58,139 --> 00:23:03,779
it's a good idea the business has to

510
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:06,179
take a risk to build security right so

511
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:07,679
you have the product vendors who have to

512
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:10,950
take a risk to build to something to

513
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:13,409
build something securely so they're kind

514
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:16,409
of not sure because no customer said so

515
00:23:13,409 --> 00:23:18,749
and then the customers aren't involving

516
00:23:16,409 --> 00:23:21,809
the security people at all and so

517
00:23:18,749 --> 00:23:23,519
there's this loop somebody has to be the

518
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:25,289
first this is you know this is the

519
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:26,770
eighth grade dance of cyber security

520
00:23:25,289 --> 00:23:29,330
right now

521
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:32,510
right somebody has to walk across the

522
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:34,100
floor now I I happen to be lucky to work

523
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:37,780
at a company that that already happened

524
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:39,949
right and so we spend a lot of time

525
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:41,770
overcoming you know we don't have to

526
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:44,870
overcome denial anymore

527
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:47,000
you know and that is actually the nicest

528
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:48,979
thing when I say denial there it's hey

529
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,990
you guys have all heard this well we've

530
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:59,060
never been breached before right that

531
00:23:53,990 --> 00:24:00,650
you know of exactly right that that

532
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:03,919
denial is usually the hardest thing to

533
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:04,910
overcome then actually after that it

534
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,730
goes back to what I said a minute ago

535
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:09,740
now our job and one of the things were

536
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:11,060
really good at that I'm not showing in

537
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:15,610
this presentation but it's actually

538
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:19,490
really cool is that assessment of risk

539
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:21,439
because you can't be if you're during

540
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:23,630
that the vendor side of this you can't

541
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:27,440
be that security person that

542
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:31,880
overestimates costs I worked at a

543
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:34,940
company a long time ago and the seaso

544
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:38,690
ended up not being there for very long

545
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:39,680
once while I was there and one of the

546
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:41,810
fun

547
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:44,660
the final nails in his coffin this was a

548
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:47,870
you know 2005-2006 right when Mac came

549
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:50,330
out when the final nails in his coffin

550
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:53,000
was to to go to the executives of this

551
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:55,970
company and propose that we roll out

552
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:01,790
knack at the cost of replacing almost

553
00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:03,020
every switch in a fortune 500 you can't

554
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:05,300
do that when you're selling a product

555
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:06,530
that because it comes out of the actual

556
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:09,050
bottom line of the product and it's

557
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:12,080
direct and you see it very clearly so

558
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:13,669
you have to be able to assess risk you

559
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,860
have to be able to assess actually what

560
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:18,950
the potential losses and you have to do

561
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:21,260
it and not be wrong because if you're

562
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:24,470
wrong it cost the business more money

563
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:26,360
than then you did before right and and

564
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:29,450
believe me they won't make the mistake

565
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:32,389
next time smart business people get that

566
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:34,520
way you know they get promoted by making

567
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:36,530
decisions that make the company money

568
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,660
if we're losing the company money we

569
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:40,610
won't be around very long that's that's

570
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:44,780
really if you if you hear one thing I

571
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:47,030
said today that's it you have to find a

572
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:50,360
way to make the company money and on the

573
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:52,370
other side we had the same problem as a

574
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:57,649
customer you have to determine the

575
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:59,060
discount rate for security so imagine

576
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:01,790
you have a product that has perfect

577
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:03,770
security and one with exactly the same

578
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:07,460
features it has less than perfect

579
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:10,129
security how much more would you be

580
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:14,110
willing to pay for the first one is it

581
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:16,340
5% is it 10% is it a hundred percent

582
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:18,260
because I'll tell you if you say a

583
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:20,899
hundred percent to your business you're

584
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:23,480
not in healthcare right now or the

585
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:25,270
financial services sector you're

586
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:28,610
probably not long for this world

587
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:32,180
but there's a price and that risk

588
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:35,060
assessment and understanding what that

589
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:38,000
cost value is is incredibly important

590
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:40,399
it's vital if you if if the vendors do

591
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,220
that well and the customers do that well

592
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:49,930
ultimately we're all going to be better

593
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:52,640
off and you have to be able to do it I I

594
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:54,740
have a really simple one but I'm gonna

595
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,880
give away a couple of the a couple of

596
00:26:54,740 --> 00:27:00,080
ways that I would overcome those the

597
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,350
first one is there's my favorite

598
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,909
objection security you know one of the

599
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:07,639
first things that that I always tell

600
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:09,530
people is that literally every product

601
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,960
development team should have an embedded

602
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:14,240
security person they should have a

603
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,850
security person not not like you know

604
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,010
somebody who wears a hat that says

605
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:21,350
security like the hall monitor but like

606
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:24,010
a real badass like each of you should be

607
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:26,889
on every development team

608
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:29,530
and people look at me like I'm nuts and

609
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:31,090
it's really a simple conversation we're

610
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:33,129
gonna make you have at least one pen

611
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:35,860
test you know you're gonna have a pen

612
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:37,660
test every release right there's a

613
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:39,370
really simple set of math this is why I

614
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:42,250
talk across the delay earlier think

615
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:45,520
about cost of delay that person sits on

616
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:49,390
there but the 52 weeks a year but if

617
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:52,840
they save you one week of development

618
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:55,660
time in that pen test every year they

619
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:59,169
have more than doubled their salary in

620
00:27:55,660 --> 00:28:01,540
your value there is no justification

621
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:05,440
we're not having a security person on

622
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:07,180
literally every development team and if

623
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,660
you can make that argument and you think

624
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:12,720
about it just think about if all of your

625
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:16,510
products get to market one week faster

626
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:18,610
because your security folks you guys all

627
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:19,990
stop being that person that's holding up

628
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:22,810
the delay you know are holding up the

629
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:25,300
release by the way one of the first

630
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:26,980
things that I you know you how to win

631
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:30,070
friends and influence people one of the

632
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:32,260
first things that happen when when you

633
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:35,050
when I start forming my team at GE was I

634
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:37,450
stopped a major product release you know

635
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:43,780
stopped I delayed a major product

636
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:46,300
release a lot and I got commitment to

637
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:48,370
security because not one person said

638
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,790
anything bad about it it was the right

639
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:52,060
decision

640
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:53,860
everybody knew it and it worked and if

641
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:57,070
you're committed like that and you can

642
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:58,990
have those people around frankly if if

643
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:00,149
the folks on my team had been embedded

644
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:04,390
with that product from the beginning

645
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:06,790
date a man out the door last March they

646
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:09,059
you know instead they were out the door

647
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:11,620
many months later

648
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:14,559
that would that would have justified

649
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:18,219
frankly the cost of my entire team in

650
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:19,840
terms of cost of delay and if you think

651
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:22,110
about that argument that's an argument

652
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:25,059
you guys can all take that even an IT

653
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:28,059
how much is this system worth to you to

654
00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:29,440
be online you know you guys are building

655
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:34,899
this system how how much does it worth

656
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:36,580
to you for that ERP system to be up if

657
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:38,080
security keeps it from being up because

658
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:40,449
you've been you know because it's not

659
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,059
ready for primetime or if security keeps

660
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:44,500
you from having your newest widget on

661
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:48,639
your website or whatever that happens to

662
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:50,799
be you have a cost of delay issue as

663
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,750
well it doesn't work nearly as well an

664
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,908
IT is it does when you're developing

665
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:57,279
products but it's a useful one the one

666
00:29:54,909 --> 00:30:00,399
that the one that really has been rating

667
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:05,260
me lately is the idea of vendor

668
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:07,178
selection you know often what I see is

669
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:09,059
that the lesser known vendors are the

670
00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:11,559
ones that invest in security first

671
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:14,879
luckily I doesn't happen to be the case

672
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:18,789
with where with what I'm doing but

673
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:22,659
ultimately what you guys really have to

674
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:25,289
do is vote with your dollars you you

675
00:30:22,659 --> 00:30:28,289
have to learn to make the argument that

676
00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:31,120
buying Cisco will get you fired

677
00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:33,279
if Cisco and not Cisco I'm not ripping

678
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,590
on any vendor specifically you know

679
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:38,590
buying insert vendor here because that's

680
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:40,389
what we've always bought is not

681
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:42,309
necessarily you know if we have an

682
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:43,480
accurate risk calculation we know how

683
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:46,270
much it's going to cost if that gets

684
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:48,340
owned then we can start making smart

685
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:50,889
decisions all right couple quick things

686
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:52,600
on how it's supposed to look

687
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:56,320
how many people know the definition of

688
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,790
ready and a definition of done are not a

689
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,280
whole lot of agile developers in this

690
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:01,540
room definition of done basically means

691
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:04,810
how do you know when something's

692
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:06,820
finished you know within within an agile

693
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:08,260
team it's basically the DNA it's the

694
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:11,320
rule it's the rules of engagement for

695
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:15,280
how you build software this is actually

696
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:18,129
stuff that's in the definition of done

697
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:20,710
for one of our products literally every

698
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:22,990
time they finish a feature they have to

699
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:24,730
do security steps they have to do

700
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:27,850
security things they have to update the

701
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:29,860
threat model keep an accurate up-to-date

702
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:31,810
threat model with every feature they do

703
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:35,260
and then they have to run it through

704
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:36,700
security skin that's actually to of a

705
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,720
bunch of steps I just didn't want it to

706
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:42,220
be a total i shart when I put the slide

707
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,560
that's how you that's how you're doing

708
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:47,080
it right you're literally building it at

709
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:48,790
every step every time they check in code

710
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:52,360
pretty much you're actually building

711
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:54,580
secure things and you think about what

712
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:58,510
what does that really do what does that

713
00:31:54,580 --> 00:32:00,520
do in terms of cost of delay in Product

714
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:02,650
Lifecycle well it takes security from

715
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:05,080
right before the release and it

716
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:08,350
literally puts it as the products being

717
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:10,659
developed suddenly we're making money

718
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:13,360
right there's not a there's not a

719
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:15,730
two-week pen test in Jeff's world right

720
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,530
there's there's a actually no actually

721
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:22,030
most of our pen sets now are two weeks

722
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:24,430
you know I've seen I've seen some you

723
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:25,870
know some amazingly cool pen test

724
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:28,270
results where the pen test team comes

725
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:30,929
back if we didn't find anything and it's

726
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:33,960
not like I hired joe bob's pen test shop

727
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:35,850
I had total aside I had a friend once

728
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,140
who always claimed that a pen test was

729
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:38,699
more an evaluation that tested

730
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,680
themselves than it was an evaluation of

731
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:45,780
the product they were testing I don't

732
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:48,930
disagree with that statement and and so

733
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:50,340
I I just want you guys to really

734
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:52,140
understand what this is supposed to look

735
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:57,840
like in an agile world that's the scaled

736
00:32:52,140 --> 00:33:01,950
agile framework that's our SDL our SDL

737
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:05,129
is decomposed into agile the steps are

738
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:07,050
many pieces they don't look like what

739
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:08,310
you would do in a waterfall shop don't

740
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:10,710
get me wrong we have a lot of waterfall

741
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:11,940
products though you you don't

742
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:14,910
necessarily devops

743
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:20,850
you know a nuclear reactor or a CT

744
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:22,890
scanner but those things get traditional

745
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:25,080
SDL's the things that are moving at

746
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:26,640
internet-of-things speed have to have

747
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,470
security internet-of-things speed too

748
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,850
and and I'm very you know it's one of

749
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:32,520
the things that I get really frustrated

750
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:34,679
by in this industry and when I go see

751
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:37,530
talks and sorryi ministers again because

752
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,850
I was really excited about it but I get

753
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:40,350
really frustrated because we're still

754
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,899
talking about security the way we talked

755
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:45,600
about it 10 years ago and the world has

756
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:48,870
changed it's changing faster it's going

757
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,250
to continue to change faster and if we

758
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:52,800
don't keep up all we're gonna do is cost

759
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:55,680
our companies money and we can't be we

760
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:57,990
can't be those people because those

761
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:02,909
people get those people get replaced

762
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:08,340
probably by machines alright questions

763
00:34:02,909 --> 00:34:08,340
that's comments things to throw at me

764
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:11,860
[Music]

765
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:27,490
yeah absolutely

766
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:30,040
developer yeah no it's a totally

767
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:32,259
different thought process right it's so

768
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:34,000
Paul asked for those who couldn't hear

769
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:35,679
him he asked if we had the developers do

770
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,949
the threat modeling or if we have you

771
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:41,020
know security people do it so I'll hedge

772
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:42,609
my my answer if we find someone on a

773
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:45,609
team who happens to be a you know

774
00:34:42,609 --> 00:34:47,710
burgeoning security awesomeness they can

775
00:34:45,609 --> 00:34:49,810
take it over after we've you know done

776
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:51,339
it and trained them up and we like

777
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:53,500
finding those champions out there

778
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:56,529
because then we have two voices when we

779
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:58,270
show up rather than one right but what

780
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:00,670
our real goal is is to have real

781
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:02,020
security folks do that because it's you

782
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:06,190
know people who look at things and take

783
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:08,320
them apart it's funny and so Josh asked

784
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:11,770
a bunch of people came in right before

785
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,780
this and Joshua that Josh ratta asked a

786
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:15,190
survey question about something from

787
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:17,200
earlier and what people thought of it

788
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:18,910
and every one of the people at the table

789
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,770
were like this sucks and this sucks and

790
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:22,029
this sucks he's like yes typical

791
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:23,290
security folks you want for the negative

792
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:25,170
first he said three positives three

793
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:27,339
negatives and all negatives right

794
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:29,859
because that's because that's us we're

795
00:35:27,339 --> 00:35:31,150
really good at picking things apart most

796
00:35:29,859 --> 00:35:33,009
developers don't have that skillset

797
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:35,619
they're not thinking like that it most

798
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:36,880
architects most IT people most product

799
00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:39,609
managers they're just not they're

800
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:42,609
thinking right but it goes back to cost

801
00:35:39,609 --> 00:35:45,009
of delay because that your question came

802
00:35:42,609 --> 00:35:46,540
from that same thing of like you can't

803
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:49,480
have a security person everywhere it's

804
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:51,460
so expensive right but if you actually

805
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:54,010
think about if it's delaying the product

806
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:55,990
and and nobody thinks in the terms of

807
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:57,580
the holistic actual product development

808
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:59,259
lifecycle we think about okay

809
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:00,848
development scheduled to end this day

810
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:02,170
you know and there's gonna be two days

811
00:36:00,849 --> 00:36:04,660
of testing and then we're gonna release

812
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:05,710
the product well so that they're just

813
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,368
you know the developers are just trying

814
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,750
to get to the end of the development

815
00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:09,820
lifecycle they're not thinking about the

816
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:12,099
whole thing the security stuff impacts

817
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,940
the release date it doesn't necessarily

818
00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:15,070
impact code

819
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:16,300
so the development managers going oh why

820
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:20,620
would I have a security person around

821
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:24,130
I'll be done on time but in terms of the

822
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:27,250
whole project lifecycle if you can strip

823
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:28,390
out the delay at the end by basically

824
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:30,310
spreading it out through the lifecycle

825
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:31,750
or eliminating it completely because you

826
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:34,870
fix those things before they get to the

827
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:37,090
pen test then you basically save the

828
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:38,859
whole project you know this huge amount

829
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:41,740
of work even if that security person

830
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:44,110
most of the time does nothing right and

831
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:46,509
we don't have we actually currently are

832
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:49,810
not even trying to have one security

833
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:51,100
person for every product because they

834
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:56,049
would sit around most of the time and do

835
00:36:51,100 --> 00:37:00,580
nothing but we have a ratio that is

836
00:36:56,050 --> 00:37:03,090
better than anywhere I've seen do that I

837
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:07,140
sort of I sort of rambled a little bit

838
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:10,350
but hopefully that was that was good

839
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:13,350
other questions

840
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:13,350
yeah

841
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:20,950
here

842
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:36,580
[Music]

843
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:37,899
now so it's only easier if you're doing

844
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,790
the same thing that I was just saying

845
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:43,750
about the development manager you're a

846
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:46,450
small company you have you know you have

847
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:49,900
a massive risk of security like breach

848
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:51,910
suppose you're some small SAS vendor

849
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:54,400
just for the sake of right you smoke

850
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:58,029
some small SAS vendor you have a massive

851
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:00,100
risk of security breach if and that

852
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:01,450
breach probably at your size especially

853
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,890
if you're an enterprise security you

854
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:04,919
know an enterprise SAS vendor who has

855
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:09,160
you know customers with big pockets and

856
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:11,830
many lawyers your risk of security

857
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:14,799
breach is your potential loss in that

858
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:16,630
scenario is company ending I I would

859
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:20,290
articulate in that scenario you have

860
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:22,480
absolutely zero justification for saving

861
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:24,100
that you know for saving on that because

862
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,940
it's literally the life of your company

863
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:29,830
is in that person's hands and nobody

864
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:31,750
thinks about that cost right you go oh

865
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:33,819
well you know a breach costs this much

866
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:36,550
or whatever the breach costs somebody

867
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:38,380
who can survive it that much you

868
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:42,490
actually if you make the choice to avoid

869
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:43,450
that you you are literally you know

870
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:46,810
playing Russian roulette

871
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:49,299
I would articulate that and as somebody

872
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:50,860
who's been there I mean you know when we

873
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,180
started mad there was three of us and we

874
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:54,070
didn't pay ourselves for six months I

875
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:57,460
know what it means to spend money on a

876
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:59,290
person right and it's terrifying to

877
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:02,620
increase base cost in a company like

878
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:04,120
that because because every dollar you

879
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:08,140
spend is like that much closer to

880
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:10,420
oblivion but every day you don't

881
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:14,170
actually do the security thing you are

882
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:15,970
literally loading the chamber right and

883
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:17,470
so I would articulate that I would spend

884
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:20,290
on that before I'd spend on some

885
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:21,700
administrative function but nobody

886
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:23,470
thinks about you know it's like the is

887
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:25,120
that it's the same reason that people

888
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:26,470
smoke even though they you know the

889
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:31,060
cancer statistics are what they are

890
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:32,980
right is that no one thinks about we're

891
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,960
mentally programmed like our brains just

892
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:36,420
cannot

893
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,490
process catastrophic event and potential

894
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,320
of it it's not something that we

895
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:41,700
naturally think about you know you don't

896
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,839
naturally every day you're walking down

897
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,129
the street think about the fact that

898
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:45,089
you're like you know you could be hit by

899
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:47,130
a car at any moment or you'd be

900
00:39:45,089 --> 00:39:49,009
paralyzed with fear if you actually had

901
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:51,890
to think about that all the time right

902
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:54,720
we do this we make the same mistake in

903
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:57,270
resourcing our companies in doing you

904
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:01,169
know in doing anything it's a very risky

905
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:02,910
decision to not have security in the

906
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:04,920
product or building as a small company

907
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:06,839
it's probably a lot more risky for a

908
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,560
small company than it is for somebody

909
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:13,589
ourselves in somebody our size I mean

910
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:15,630
you know I can imagine a company ending

911
00:40:13,589 --> 00:40:17,700
event for a company I mean we saw Lehman

912
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:19,500
Brothers and stuff like that right that

913
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:22,950
we've seen those kinds of things in the

914
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:24,420
past but there you got it it's got to be

915
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:27,629
really bad before that happens

916
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:28,650
somebody small I mean there was there

917
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:30,510
were those companies that just went

918
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:32,130
under when their Amazon accounts got

919
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:36,690
owned and they you know they had their

920
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:40,020
databases delete it I would argue that

921
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:41,339
they they are the exact example that you

922
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:45,030
know I wish I thought about earlier in

923
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:47,490
the in the answer but they're the

924
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:48,630
perfect example how much how much do you

925
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:49,859
think they would have spent on security

926
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:54,950
if they had known that was going to

927
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:54,950
happen I think they'd had done it

928
00:40:56,590 --> 00:41:01,220
crying

929
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,220
I

930
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,339
[Music]

931
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:12,339
yes but in her

932
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:26,170
it it is and that's so this slide that

933
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:29,740
is really you know it part of a lot

934
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:31,390
longer discussion there's there's an

935
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:33,279
important the important thing that I

936
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:34,810
didn't even mention because I wanted to

937
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,470
you know save time and keep the flow

938
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:41,590
it's the bottom two two bullets in that

939
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:43,390
situation as that small company you have

940
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:45,160
to have the courage to be willing to

941
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:47,980
forego building certain things in order

942
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:49,870
to build security and that is the

943
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:52,300
hardest decision that is like the

944
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:54,100
definition of courage in business when

945
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:56,110
customers are screaming for features and

946
00:41:54,100 --> 00:42:00,420
salespeople are saying I won't buy this

947
00:41:56,110 --> 00:42:03,520
until you have X in this product and

948
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:06,310
saying no we're not gonna build that yet

949
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:08,470
we've got to do this first is a very

950
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:10,450
hard decision to make but I go back to

951
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:13,270
that Amazon example if you were that

952
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:15,460
company and you thought your company

953
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:17,500
would be ended by this would you have

954
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:18,790
done it absolutely they would have would

955
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:21,450
have they would have put off whatever

956
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:26,500
they were working on to fix that problem

957
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:27,669
right I would argue that if you're not

958
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,480
thinking about that risk as a

959
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,970
possibility

960
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:34,150
and assessing it appropriately how

961
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:36,569
likely is it to happen I don't know you

962
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:40,150
know that was news because it was unique

963
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:41,530
but how many other small companies have

964
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:43,930
gone under because of things like that I

965
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:45,760
don't know we don't have good we don't

966
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:51,009
have good autopsy results on company

967
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:53,680
debts right so I and but you're right

968
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:55,810
it's an incredibly hard decision to not

969
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,339
do one thing in the name of something

970
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:59,320
that doesn't seem like it's actually

971
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:00,940
getting you you know it you're

972
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:03,310
increasing base cost and you're

973
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:06,340
decreasing potential top line that is a

974
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:08,440
difficult argument to make unless you

975
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:10,360
can actually assess the risk accurately

976
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,640
and say look we're not actually we're

977
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:15,100
not actually decreasing top line if the

978
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,499
lines all end right here because we

979
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:20,949
didn't do this

980
00:43:16,499 --> 00:43:22,660
right if we you know if the if the like

981
00:43:20,949 --> 00:43:24,640
the the profit goes the negative

982
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:26,469
infinity because literally we have not

983
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,959
we have cost and zero dollars coming in

984
00:43:26,469 --> 00:43:31,569
because our we're out of business so I

985
00:43:28,959 --> 00:43:35,279
and and that's the hardest argument to

986
00:43:31,569 --> 00:43:35,279
make did that make sense

987
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:44,950
yeah you know what if you guys hold up

988
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:47,440
before I got your kid and back there too

989
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:48,939
but if if you guys make that argument

990
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,500
send me an email or Twitter or something

991
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:52,540
because I want to know I want to know

992
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,770
what people are objecting to if people

993
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:55,570
you know if you're talking to senior

994
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:57,070
executives and they don't get that and

995
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:59,680
they don't buy it

996
00:43:57,070 --> 00:44:02,170
ii-i've Ahlan tear a half-hour anytime

997
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:04,299
that happens to get on the phone I want

998
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:05,950
to hear why I want to hear what's

999
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:10,530
happening you know and I want to hear

1000
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:10,529
why they're not believing it okay

1001
00:44:16,589 --> 00:44:27,849
yeah yeah it absolutely does it comes

1002
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:30,160
down to knowing you know it's the old

1003
00:44:27,849 --> 00:44:31,390
it's the old statement and we all know

1004
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,930
this because we used Windows for a lot

1005
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:34,839
of years

1006
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:36,549
you don't ever release a product that

1007
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:42,759
doesn't have bugs in it right you have

1008
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:44,288
to know you know a little thingy key

1009
00:44:42,759 --> 00:44:45,880
barriers determining the right level of

1010
00:44:44,289 --> 00:44:47,619
investment you have to know when to not

1011
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,470
build it too right you have to be

1012
00:44:47,619 --> 00:44:53,079
willing to say that's enough for now

1013
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:55,089
right this is good enough we we as an

1014
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:59,619
industry by the way we suck it good

1015
00:44:55,089 --> 00:45:02,470
enough right we we want every last thing

1016
00:44:59,619 --> 00:45:04,569
fixed you know I I want the right

1017
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:08,169
ciphers on that on that web server

1018
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:12,700
before it goes out the door really I

1019
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:15,099
mean okay James blonde like you know

1020
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:17,489
nine times out of ten half the things on

1021
00:45:15,099 --> 00:45:19,960
your meses report of that box are like

1022
00:45:17,489 --> 00:45:22,989
if I make them fix this they're going to

1023
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:24,369
kill me but most of us make him fix it

1024
00:45:22,989 --> 00:45:26,259
anyway I used to be like that too I

1025
00:45:24,369 --> 00:45:28,509
would I would make you know early in my

1026
00:45:26,259 --> 00:45:29,920
career I wanted everybody to fix

1027
00:45:28,509 --> 00:45:31,809
everything I wanted I thought every

1028
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,479
vulnerability was a problem not every

1029
00:45:31,809 --> 00:45:35,710
vulnerability is a problem I found in

1030
00:45:34,479 --> 00:45:37,390
this conversation this morning about

1031
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:39,359
like some of the vulnerabilities that

1032
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:44,288
made the news lately I'm just like

1033
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:45,940
really actually I think it's just the

1034
00:45:44,289 --> 00:45:49,119
cool names it was really what it's about

1035
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:50,799
but but yeah you got anyone to stop you

1036
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:52,029
got a no-win not to build security I

1037
00:45:50,799 --> 00:45:53,859
mean ultimately it's the same

1038
00:45:52,029 --> 00:45:55,059
prioritization thing right how much

1039
00:45:53,859 --> 00:45:56,890
we're gonna lose if we don't build this

1040
00:45:55,059 --> 00:45:59,200
other feature instead of security if if

1041
00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:00,670
you have a ten million dollar deal on

1042
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,779
the plate and you're a hundred thousand

1043
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:03,609
dollar a year company because you're

1044
00:46:01,779 --> 00:46:04,960
just getting off the ground I would drop

1045
00:46:03,609 --> 00:46:07,690
everything to build that ten million

1046
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,770
dollar feature right whatever that thing

1047
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:10,600
is

1048
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:12,190
but I wouldn't wait too long to build

1049
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:14,170
the security thing because it's then

1050
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:18,100
worth 10 million dollars if I get it

1051
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:19,690
wrong right so so there's a you know

1052
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:23,589
there's a balance and there has to be we

1053
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:25,210
have to be Jeff Immelt I've turned into

1054
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:27,610
a G fanboy it's really funny actually

1055
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:29,980
something that nobody knows I was I was

1056
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:31,750
a G fanboy long before I went to GE like

1057
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:33,940
I read all of Jack Welch's books like

1058
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:35,140
you know way before so it's actually

1059
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:37,240
kind of cool that I worked there but

1060
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:39,250
something I heard Jeff ml say recently

1061
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:42,549
is we need to be risk managers not

1062
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:44,680
control freaks right and that applies to

1063
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:46,660
security better than anywhere else I've

1064
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:48,970
ever been in terms of industry you know

1065
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:51,240
like we are control freaks just I mean a

1066
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:54,160
lot of us are just like that by Nature

1067
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:56,290
and and that's why we like security is

1068
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,350
it lets us build control into things we

1069
00:46:56,290 --> 00:47:00,759
even even talk about building controls

1070
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:01,930
but that's not the way we have to think

1071
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,330
about this we have to think about risk

1072
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:06,430
and we have to think about you know it's

1073
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:08,200
the detritus right CISSP example you

1074
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:10,470
don't spend ten you know a million

1075
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:12,640
dollars to protect ten dollars in assets

1076
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:16,290
you have to do the same thing with with

1077
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,290
your security features we're gonna

1078
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:25,040
there is yeah

1079
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:30,220
[Music]

1080
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:31,990
the assessment but there's a smaller

1081
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:36,180
section of the

1082
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:36,180
right you can't assume that most

1083
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:54,598
I think we don't I honestly don't think

1084
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:58,770
we do I mean and this is where this is

1085
00:47:54,599 --> 00:48:00,750
where it's on us you know to steal to

1086
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:02,820
steal a phrase from mr. Korman we're the

1087
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:06,420
cavalry right we're the people that are

1088
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:08,820
going to to actually be able to assess

1089
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:11,010
that for the world and and make that

1090
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:13,160
clear because you know I would argue

1091
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:13,160
that

1092
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:21,529
you know what not sort so sort of

1093
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:23,300
responsibly yes you know if if a vendor

1094
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:26,510
doesn't do their job and doesn't respond

1095
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:27,890
you know I understand now if it's a

1096
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:31,160
critical infrastructure vendor and you

1097
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:32,359
give them you know 30 days to fix a

1098
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:35,720
vulnerability that's been in their

1099
00:48:32,359 --> 00:48:38,180
product since 1974 that's not reasonable

1100
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:40,069
and I you know what I'm gonna coin a new

1101
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:42,080
term I'm not for responsible disclosure

1102
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:44,060
I'm for reasonable responsible

1103
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:46,340
disclosure which is different than being

1104
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:47,450
the kind of vulnerability researcher who

1105
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:49,670
wants to publish things so they get

1106
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:51,649
famous and there's we all know there's

1107
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:53,450
lots of those right you can't be that

1108
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:54,740
person yeah I'm absolutely for

1109
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:59,000
responsible disclosure if somebody's not

1110
00:48:54,740 --> 00:49:02,299
doing their job that said I think it's

1111
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:05,930
our job you know within within our own

1112
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:09,200
context to advocate for the customer

1113
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:11,319
I tell everyone on my team this is this

1114
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:14,720
is sort of what I charge my folks with

1115
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:16,040
so there's two security you know say it

1116
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,689
this way of it pretty much every time

1117
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:20,119
it's two security organizations at GE

1118
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:22,550
healthcare there's the CISOs org that

1119
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:26,260
protects GE healthcare and there's our

1120
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:28,010
org that protects our customers that's

1121
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:30,070
that's how you do it

1122
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:33,200
you become the advocate for the customer

1123
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:34,940
does that does that give a kind of

1124
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:37,580
reasonable you know it's never gonna be

1125
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:40,550
perfect but here's the one thing I'll

1126
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:44,359
say how well do you assess the safety of

1127
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:45,920
your auto of your car you don't you have

1128
00:49:44,359 --> 00:49:48,500
no idea if your car is going to blow up

1129
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:50,420
like a Ford Pinto but somebody had Ford

1130
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:52,190
better right and they better be

1131
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:55,750
advocating for you not to end up blown

1132
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:58,190
up and you trust that that's happening

1133
00:49:55,750 --> 00:50:00,050
now if a few Ford pintos start blowing

1134
00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:01,400
up people are going to start publicizing

1135
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:04,130
that people are gonna get it on the news

1136
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:07,070
and then my mom will know not to drive

1137
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:10,100
that car but the same thing has to be us

1138
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:11,540
we have to be the same kind of same kind

1139
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:13,759
of world and we have to advocate for our

1140
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:15,020
customers within our within our

1141
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,010
functions all right I've been told

1142
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:20,550
there's a party upstairs

1143
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:22,350
upstairs yeah upstairs so I vote that we
