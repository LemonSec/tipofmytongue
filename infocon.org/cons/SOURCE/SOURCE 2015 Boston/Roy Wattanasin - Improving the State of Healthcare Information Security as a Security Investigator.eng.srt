17
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:45,030
right legal professional ethical way as

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:47,160
well alright so who am i I'm again

19
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,660
healthcare information I work in health

20
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,510
care I've been working for healthcare

21
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,968
for about ten plus years now and I

22
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:57,059
actually worked for academic medical

23
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:59,280
center that's also education as well so

24
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:02,430
it's really interesting and it also

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,010
worked part-time I teach healthcare

26
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:08,729
information security at Brandeis

27
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:11,280
University as well and I'm also I've

28
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:14,189
done some conferences in the past I used

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,659
to do security besides Boston and yeah

30
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:17,369
basically it's been really interesting I

31
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,110
also do a Boston application security

32
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:21,060
conference and some of many other

33
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,100
conferences as well I'm very interested

34
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,530
in Internet of Things medical device

35
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:29,070
security and application security as

36
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:31,740
well and I also do 200 US Boston

37
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:36,229
meetings as well and you can find me on

38
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:39,960
Twitter wr0 or website car at gmail.com

39
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:41,820
so the agenda agenda for today is really

40
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,699
to talk about kind of like a give an

41
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,008
overview for people that that's are

42
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,140
currently in healthcare and also are not

43
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,990
currently in healthcare talk about the

44
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,210
difference the the landscape right and

45
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,219
then also talk about what are the some

46
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,380
of the laws and regulations and

47
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:00,658
standards that apply to healthcare and

48
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,969
also talk about some of the threats and

49
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,009
the threat actors right I basically I've

50
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:07,079
I've done some research looking on the

51
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,878
web this is all public information but I

52
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,949
tried to kind of confine it into this

53
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,590
presentation this working presentation

54
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:17,459
and also talk about some of the attacker

55
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:20,099
tools as well that right these attackers

56
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:22,379
are using and also some information that

57
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:25,640
I found from the research that I've done

58
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:28,829
on going through this public information

59
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:31,260
then then I'll be talking about all the

60
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:34,470
I guess the top three I should say top

61
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:37,920
four healthcare security breaches that

62
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:40,769
have happened in 2015 and then that are

63
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,048
over 1 million that have breaches that

64
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:45,209
are over 1 million customers and more

65
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:47,610
and then I'll give some recommendations

66
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:50,220
and I also want to hear some thoughts

67
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:54,120
and feedback from the the audience as

68
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:57,150
well so I actually I went on the web and

69
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,549
I tried to look for a kind of like a

70
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,560
healthcare landscape typical healthcare

71
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:03,450
organization landscape and I couldn't

72
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,310
find any because it's so many it's so

73
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,920
diverse it's so right it's so

74
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,450
complicated right but here you have to

75
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,429
remember that health care is all about

76
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,319
patients right all about patient centric

77
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:15,360
it's all about the patients so anytime

78
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:18,208
you do security you have to make sure

79
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,100
that you know number one that people

80
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:23,250
will actually use it for example you

81
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:25,620
can't create or use a two-factor

82
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,450
authentication on a medical record for

83
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,630
example when dealing with patient care

84
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:32,130
when the provider let's say the security

85
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,540
team is not available and there's

86
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,359
something wrong with the two-factor

87
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:39,120
authentication for example you have to

88
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:42,000
kind of like a cost-benefit analysis so

89
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,430
for example healthcare landscape is very

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,169
complex there's so many different

91
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:48,599
devices so many different legacy

92
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:51,810
machines so many differents new machines

93
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:54,030
as well and so many different interfaces

94
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,549
as well that are interfacing with with

95
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:58,739
the healthcare in the hospital for

96
00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:00,269
example and you have to also have to

97
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,359
remember that when you take a look at

98
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:05,040
healthcare now right information is

99
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:06,959
trying to be portable you think that

100
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,459
take a look at all the providers all of

101
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,919
the healthcare professionals they're

102
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:12,930
trying to have their medical record on

103
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:15,450
the iPad on different mobile devices

104
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,579
right and how do you secure that and

105
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,589
before remember the murderer used to be

106
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,870
just just in the building around the

107
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:23,820
building but now in any typically in

108
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:26,350
healthcare or any industry right all the

109
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:29,590
information now is all all overall

110
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,990
thus so here looking at this diagram

111
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,099
right patient right there maybe there's

112
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,350
a laboratory system

113
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,360
maybe there's a radiology PACs system

114
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:39,100
for example there's usually some

115
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,980
appointment scheduling billing software

116
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,770
attributed to that major may read some

117
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:47,230
orthopedics pediatric surgery software

118
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:48,700
and I didn't even put in here the kind

119
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,830
of like electronic medical record right

120
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:55,060
trying the reportable trying to be

121
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:58,150
electronic as well so electronic health

122
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:00,850
care record or EMR for example again it

123
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:02,979
provides complete you know patients

124
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:05,230
history again you want to have like some

125
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:08,110
kind of patient history in there it also

126
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:10,540
improves on the reduction and hospitals

127
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,130
costs for example and also provides

128
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,070
providers so that healthcare

129
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:17,290
professionals can collaborate with with

130
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,930
each other right in real time as well

131
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:22,960
and of course it Courage's right faster

132
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,250
decision-making in addition as well also

133
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,380
there's a lot of health information

134
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:29,380
exchanges right how do you deal with

135
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:32,200
data and how do you how do you securely

136
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:34,600
and effectively share data right and

137
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,430
when you take thing about healthcare all

138
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,090
the different healthcare organizations

139
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:41,170
hospitals they're all using a different

140
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:43,060
electronic medical record electronic

141
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,290
health care record for example and how

142
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,180
do you kind of combine everything

143
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:49,150
everyone's using a different technology

144
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,950
for example and also with the healthcare

145
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,929
information exchange there's a lot of

146
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,909
different research that can be used for

147
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:56,950
good at this regular used for bad as

148
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,690
well but we'll talk about the good so a

149
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:01,030
lot of interesting things with the

150
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:04,840
electronic health care record and the

151
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:07,690
EMR protect protected health information

152
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,369
right protect pH I personally

153
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,930
identifiable information this one I

154
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:13,030
actually want to focus on protected

155
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:15,400
health information so usually it's it's

156
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:17,109
a name and any of these right any of

157
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,539
these additionally to a name so for

158
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:21,520
example member name city state zip code

159
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:25,180
right social security number medical

160
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,070
record numbers email you URL address

161
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,900
address date of birth all of this right

162
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:31,599
this is all protected health information

163
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:33,849
so just think about all the difference

164
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,600
landscape of health care and think about

165
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:39,070
all the difference you know all the

166
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,390
different information that you're trying

167
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:43,890
to

168
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:45,539
protect so I also wanted to mention even

169
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:47,719
before I talk about the laws and

170
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:53,130
standards I forgot to mention that in

171
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:55,110
yeah in 2014 the FBI they mentioned they

172
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:57,120
actually issued a like a warning right

173
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:59,730
it was actually if your how many people

174
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,470
are InfraGard members yeah they okay

175
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,820
they sent kind of like a letter a

176
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:07,200
warning and actually they've been

177
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:10,469
sending it but 2014 they sense a kind of

178
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,760
like an email a letter to notifying that

179
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:14,010
all of the health care information

180
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,810
health care organizations they're going

181
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:18,120
to be attacked there right they're going

182
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,520
to be breached just be just be very

183
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,350
careful right I think we've even before

184
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,450
the FBI mentioned this I think that as

185
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:26,010
secure professionals as technology

186
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,719
professionals in any industry I think

187
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:31,020
we've known right there's going to be a

188
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,390
breach the bad guys are already winning

189
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,180
so there's going to be a breach and I'll

190
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,990
talk about that later as well but

191
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,450
regarding the laws and standards

192
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,800
regulations right Massachusetts has one

193
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,690
of the strictest laws regarding

194
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,640
protecting protective health information

195
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:49,170
and personally identifiable information

196
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:50,219
right HIPAA there's HIPPA health health

197
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:53,190
information Portability and

198
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,870
Accountability Act there's the right it

199
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:57,360
regulates and use the disclosure of

200
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:59,480
protected pH I and also that is

201
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,710
protected right by covered entities

202
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,540
generally like healthcare organizations

203
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,820
Clearing House employer sponsored health

204
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:09,180
plans and health insurers for example

205
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:12,000
and again right they by regulation the

206
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,040
Department of Health and Human Services

207
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,070
they extended the Privacy Rule to

208
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:20,070
basically independent contractors to

209
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:22,080
kind of like covered entities who fit

210
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:24,450
the definition of business associate

211
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,340
agreements so for example for any of you

212
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:28,110
that deal with business associate

213
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:31,109
agreements anytime that you are working

214
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:34,650
with like a third party or another

215
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:36,479
organization right you want to be ensure

216
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:38,610
that you are protecting this pH I so

217
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,530
what what usually happens is that there

218
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:42,180
is a business associate agreement signs

219
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,978
that is signed either by your

220
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:46,349
organization and the other third party

221
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:50,040
usually it comes from your organization

222
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:51,870
or there is another the company that

223
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,980
you're working with a third party also

224
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,930
has like a

225
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,329
as well but really it's just kind of

226
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:59,239
like a thing of it as the agreement to

227
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:02,989
make sure that there are difference

228
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:05,010
procedures in place if this right thi

229
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:07,079
something were to happen and things like

230
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:09,899
that so pretty interesting there of

231
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:11,638
course in January 2013 HIPAA also

232
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:14,699
updated right they called it the fine

233
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:16,440
final omnibus rule basically and of

234
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:18,839
course there were changes that were

235
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,449
updated in the Security Rule and also

236
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:24,420
the breach notifications due to the high

237
00:09:21,449 --> 00:09:26,130
tech acts as well and of course high

238
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,050
tech act right that stands for the

239
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:31,410
health information technology for

240
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:33,389
economic and clinical Health and again

241
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:36,569
this this was enacted as part of the

242
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:40,410
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act

243
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:42,600
of 2009 and this one's lost 2009 to

244
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:45,089
promote the adoption and meaningful use

245
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,829
so remember in health care Meaningful

246
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:48,959
Use there's three stages of meaningful

247
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:51,888
use so now probably cover them in the

248
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:55,290
next few slides but I mean in a nutshell

249
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:57,029
Meaningful Use is to basically get your

250
00:09:55,290 --> 00:10:00,360
health care organization in your

251
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:02,459
hospital using a medical record or some

252
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,870
kind of electronic health care record

253
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:07,380
and I'll talk about that more in the

254
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:08,880
next few slides as well after this right

255
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,069
I already mentioned about this but this

256
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,010
is just UPS excerpt from the warning

257
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:15,599
that FBI mentioned from the recording

258
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:17,189
healthcare they observed malicious

259
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,290
actors targeting healthcare related

260
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:21,990
systems right for the purpose of

261
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:24,089
attaining PhIP III all that and actors

262
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,620
also have been searching have been

263
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:27,690
targeting multiple companies on

264
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,740
healthcare we've seen that and I'll talk

265
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:32,399
about the next that the next few

266
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,760
organizations that have been targeted

267
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:38,130
that we've seen in the news as well so I

268
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,260
think the great I was trying to look for

269
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:42,300
something that I could reuse because I

270
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:44,790
hate to create new things so I like to

271
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:47,459
reusing but me and ian's really put it

272
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:49,529
well regarding the difference threats

273
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:52,170
the threat vectors right or breaking

274
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:53,850
down the threats or the threat actors so

275
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:56,279
number one if you go from left to right

276
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:59,130
the first one is nuisance right these

277
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:01,380
are like right spam botnets right

278
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:02,939
maybe the now service right and of

279
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,680
course you can see right I have

280
00:11:02,939 --> 00:11:06,870
basically this is from minions but

281
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,209
objective example targeted

282
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:11,250
and the character right so for example a

283
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,900
nuisance isn't a target it usually

284
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:15,300
happens like for example a good example

285
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:18,300
of this is like getting all the spam

286
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:20,640
emails in your in your organization that

287
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,510
would be a nuisance for example next one

288
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,029
is data theft

289
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:26,339
these are objective right is to really

290
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:29,040
have a political advantage right they're

291
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:31,670
all in empty to make money economic it's

292
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,199
the apt I think we've heard a lot of

293
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:35,670
advanced persistent threats it's usually

294
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,550
targeted and then again it's always

295
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:40,620
persistent right cyber crimes again

296
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:44,490
financial financial gain trying to get

297
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:46,260
money right targeted at credit card thi

298
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:48,589
personal identifiable information and

299
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:51,410
that and again their financial motivated

300
00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:53,820
activism right we've seen this from the

301
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:56,579
anti SEC loss tack all these different

302
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:59,070
groups anonymous deformation press and

303
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:02,400
policy and again they're doing website

304
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:08,010
defacements but you know again maybe the

305
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:10,560
the the breach or the the attack is not

306
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:13,920
as as long-standing for example and

307
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,339
again last one is network attacks again

308
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,449
it's this escalation destruction

309
00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:21,900
destroying critical infrastructure and

310
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:24,540
then you can see right out of these five

311
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:26,790
right four out of five are targeted and

312
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:29,040
then all the other ones are right either

313
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:30,900
automated or persistent financially

314
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,969
that's just suspicious and all of that

315
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,060
so this is pretty interesting and I have

316
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:38,610
the information there for minions right

317
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:40,529
so these are the ones I think from what

318
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:44,670
we've seen from the 2015 breaches right

319
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:47,130
that that is that actually that these

320
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:49,229
are the threat actors impacting health

321
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:51,720
care organizations number one is the

322
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:53,640
theta theft right the EPT is the target

323
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,230
attacks is going to happen even if it

324
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,779
hasn't happened already or is already on

325
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:59,820
your network and then there's also the

326
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:02,610
financial gain we've seen this from then

327
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,630
the the different breaches that I'll be

328
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:06,240
talking about in the next few slides

329
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:08,250
credit-card pH I financially motivated

330
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,430
so remember it's advanced persistent

331
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:13,440
threats and also the financial liability

332
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:16,670
of all this Phin personally personally

333
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,670
identifiable information

334
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:21,949
okay so yep so cyber criminals they

335
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:24,020
write they target all that and again

336
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:26,030
right for the apts there's gonna be a

337
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:28,819
target there's gonna be targeting

338
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:30,949
technologies processes expertise they're

339
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,720
trying to write trying to focus on

340
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:34,550
improving domestic industries abilities

341
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,850
and then there they're focusing on

342
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:40,160
targeting PII right for insider threats

343
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:43,100
also so in addition to those two there's

344
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,839
also insider threats right typical

345
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:48,050
healthcare organization typical Hospital

346
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,610
there's different patients that are that

347
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:52,280
come into the hospital or healthcare

348
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:55,130
system so sometimes they might be really

349
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:58,819
well-known celebrities for example so

350
00:13:55,130 --> 00:14:00,590
sometimes there are some you right the

351
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:04,070
hospitals health care organizations they

352
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:07,640
have a very very strict policy regarding

353
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:09,770
using your health care using the access

354
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,140
that you have and reviewing and looking

355
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:14,780
at different medical records for example

356
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:16,610
right it's it's really only needed for

357
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,319
your job and if you don't use it you

358
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:20,390
it's no you don't need that you don't

359
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,620
need to do that but on the health care

360
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:25,130
organizations they have a very strict

361
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:27,200
policy regarding that and and again the

362
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:30,890
insider threats right a lot of a lot of

363
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,090
different additional threat vectors in

364
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:34,790
addition to the two died already

365
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:36,620
mentioned these are the threat actors

366
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:39,230
right I think that a lot of the

367
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,030
organizations not only healthcare are

368
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:43,130
coming right it's all about fishing I

369
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:45,130
think we've seen so much fishing we can

370
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:47,810
keep doing education education education

371
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:51,590
but we still have to keep educating

372
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:54,619
people example of fishing right again

373
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:56,450
baiting the user there's a there's

374
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:59,540
exploit there's maybe some vulnerability

375
00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:01,850
again maybe there's a Adobe Adobe

376
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:04,610
vulnerability or maybe there's a another

377
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:07,150
Oracle vulnerability again it's beating

378
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:09,650
the user exploiting that vulnerability

379
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:12,560
having a backdoor so great basically it

380
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:15,230
doesn't even have to the user does not

381
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,579
even have to be logged in right maybe

382
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,650
they can be logged in or they lock the

383
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,960
screen so there's a secondary payload

384
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:24,140
that happens in the backend and also

385
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:27,620
when the user is no longer here there's

386
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:29,250
a back backdoor or like a back channel

387
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,800
that happens right and in the

388
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:34,800
on their computer and then there's a way

389
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,000
to steal all this information as well so

390
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,420
it's pretty interesting regarding that

391
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,220
they're fishing as well these are some

392
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:43,019
of the attacker tools I also found this

393
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:46,620
from fire I mandaeans

394
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:49,470
these are from actually 2014 but these

395
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:51,750
are some common backdoors and some crack

396
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:54,029
some common crime where they might be

397
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:56,699
disguised as difference names they're

398
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:58,410
probably probably be different names in

399
00:15:56,699 --> 00:16:02,160
the future as well but like for example

400
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:03,899
so go plug X right these are all

401
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,639
backdoors I won't go into specific

402
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:07,800
detail on all of them but take a look at

403
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:09,839
my photo which is like a dll that

404
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,639
injects in vol and kind of like there's

405
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,759
a key log of everything and installs on

406
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:17,009
the service on a typical endpoints home

407
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:18,689
UNIX generic launcher for plugins and

408
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:20,430
different things like that as well so

409
00:16:18,689 --> 00:16:23,670
it's pretty interesting some of the

410
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:26,279
crimeware right they can be Zeus right

411
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:27,719
Zeus remember many years ago or maybe a

412
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:29,939
couple years ago serious the banking

413
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,879
Trojan looking at all this confidential

414
00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:34,709
financial information right just as you

415
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,779
know right Zeus can be programs there's

416
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:38,459
a manual there's kind of like a whole

417
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:41,490
actually it's a whole business with the

418
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:43,079
Zeus right but pretty much Zeus can be

419
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:44,879
designed to look for any kind of

420
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:46,829
information that you program it so it's

421
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:49,379
really interesting even though it was

422
00:16:46,829 --> 00:16:51,089
used initially for financial right

423
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:53,040
information now it's been looking for

424
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:55,050
healthcare may be looking for other

425
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,790
information as well social net social

426
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:59,639
networking Facebook credentials things

427
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:01,129
like that the other one I wanted to

428
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:03,480
mention was kind of like the flashback

429
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:05,579
IRC BOTS so pretty pretty interesting

430
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,919
and as you can see right here there's

431
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:10,230
some information there about remote

432
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,260
access tools right again taking

433
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:15,110
advantage of the information and again

434
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:18,150
really recording stuff in the back end

435
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:19,948
okay so these this was just down I think

436
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,600
I think most of you have seen this but

437
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:24,870
um there's Citadel right these are

438
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:27,539
priced on with it from 2014 2013 Citadel

439
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:30,330
the black hole wrap remote access tool

440
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:33,360
and then also I think on the back there

441
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:37,860
was the I think that was the Zeus one of

442
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,510
the Zeus Georgian banking Trojans so

443
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,668
so this this was some interesting

444
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,240
information regarding healthcare again

445
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:44,130
right

446
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,440
I think credit cards now right being

447
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:48,510
stolen it's the the the value of it is

448
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,360
this not as much anymore because so many

449
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:53,129
right we've we've had breeches who we've

450
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,080
got notification email notifications

451
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:57,149
from different organizations right

452
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,439
whether it be health care or not and you

453
00:17:57,149 --> 00:18:00,090
can take a look right Social Security

454
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,980
number now is about a dollar right

455
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:03,570
because there's so many of them and the

456
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,340
medical information now is about fifty

457
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:08,389
fifty dollars right but think about all

458
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:11,580
the packaged information including PII

459
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:14,549
social the whole package of a human

460
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:17,250
being is about 5500 to three you know

461
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:19,320
through 1300 that's a lot that's why the

462
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:21,269
FBI mentioned this and I think people in

463
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,918
health care and do outside of health

464
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:25,380
care we know that we've been breached

465
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:28,289
and it there's so much time right for

466
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:30,899
example on 78% of the phishing email

467
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:33,240
were actually IT or security related and

468
00:18:30,899 --> 00:18:35,610
also they attempted like the targeted

469
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,769
companies antivirus right you've seen it

470
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:39,600
anti fake antivirus all of these

471
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:41,490
difference weird things coming in and

472
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,080
it's really interesting here I wanted to

473
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:45,299
mention this real strong Union as well

474
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,820
these are a typical days of when

475
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:49,408
phishing emails come in right so you can

476
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,450
see maybe Monday maybe people really

477
00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:53,010
just coming from the weekend so they

478
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:54,809
don't really take a look at the emails

479
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,970
but these are some of the emails you can

480
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:59,309
see like right Wednesday and Saturday or

481
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:03,149
some of the a lot of the phishing emails

482
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:06,408
come in so and also a 72% come in during

483
00:19:03,149 --> 00:19:09,899
the weekdays interesting thing here

484
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:11,880
we've seen this but 205 is the medium

485
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:13,559
amount of days that a threat groups are

486
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,389
present on the on the on the network

487
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:19,620
right it's not only specific to health

488
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:22,799
care but um and also from 2013 about 24

489
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:26,250
days less than 2013 right so maybe again

490
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:28,918
I guess it varies and then 31 percent of

491
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:30,690
the victims actually you know discovered

492
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:32,909
the breach manually right sometimes it's

493
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:35,490
coming from a third party again they

494
00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:38,159
it's really interesting and 69 were

495
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:39,720
notified by external entity right it's

496
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:41,460
probably going to even be more in the

497
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,620
future as well so these are really

498
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,120
interesting on statistics yes no I'm

499
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,800
sorry is that specific to the healthcare

500
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,750
industry

501
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:52,110
this I actually got from the help from

502
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:55,540
the engines we stepped way they did a

503
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:57,189
presentation in I think early actually

504
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,990
this year so they actually mentioning

505
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:00,910
they mentioned about that good quick the

506
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:04,240
question was is this specific to health

507
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:07,180
care yes it is and basically Amanda and

508
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,920
took a look at all the different

509
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,750
breeches that they looked in health care

510
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,210
so it's really interesting there and you

511
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:15,160
can take a look at that big head like a

512
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,990
health care in intelligence brief as

513
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,340
well so really interesting of the data

514
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:20,830
that they found it'd be really

515
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:23,020
interesting to see how specifically what

516
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:26,649
what additional data can be found from

517
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:28,810
this as well so case one anthem so again

518
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:31,150
remember this is a work in progress but

519
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:33,250
case when I'm looking at any of these

520
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:36,820
health care breaches that have affected

521
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:39,130
1 million people or more during this

522
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:41,110
year so we've heard about anthem right I

523
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,400
took this from the website and there

524
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:44,800
believes that this suspicious suspicious

525
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,900
activity may have occurred over the

526
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,030
course of several weeks right early in

527
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,950
December 2014 I actually should have put

528
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:53,379
a tilde there but that is from their

529
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:55,690
website so I got that it actually was

530
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:58,870
discovered by discovered by anthem on

531
00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:01,630
January 29 2015 right and it points to a

532
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:04,449
database administrator credential being

533
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:05,920
used right and I think a lot of people

534
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:08,350
mentioned that but right some of the

535
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,930
problems and really there were some near

536
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:13,780
point eight million customers and

537
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:15,790
patients are actually customers and you

538
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,260
can go to anthem FAQs calm to get more

539
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:20,040
information but it's really really

540
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:22,360
interesting I mean in terms of this

541
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:24,580
again this is all public information I'm

542
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,229
actually working this on this to give

543
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:29,290
more information but you know some of

544
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:30,370
the solutions include and now in my last

545
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:32,500
slide I'll talk about some of the

546
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:35,020
recommendations but really really having

547
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,610
the not only having executives

548
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:38,620
accountable but also having the

549
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:40,240
organization as a whole right it depends

550
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,909
on your culture as well but try to

551
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,340
implement controls over a privileged use

552
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:46,600
accounts for example especially right

553
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,120
having like a two-factor authentication

554
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,490
this may have at least brought the risk

555
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,020
much much lower and having doing some

556
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:55,240
due diligence right on on their

557
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:57,100
organization as well right this was

558
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,510
encrypted right maybe this database if

559
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,439
it was encrypted maybe there would have

560
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:01,658
been

561
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,059
another alternative or another way of

562
00:22:01,659 --> 00:22:06,129
having it right now encrypting data is a

563
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:08,019
clear violation of the high tech tact as

564
00:22:06,129 --> 00:22:11,049
well right now encrypting data at rest

565
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:14,169
so you just some things to learn right I

566
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:15,759
think that for people that are in

567
00:22:14,169 --> 00:22:17,590
healthcare and also I'll the hell out of

568
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:19,149
healthcare a lot of good things that we

569
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:21,428
can learn about this and hopefully we

570
00:22:19,149 --> 00:22:24,879
can get a larger security budget with

571
00:22:21,429 --> 00:22:27,700
all these breaches k-stew primeira blue

572
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:29,799
cross was believed as early was actually

573
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:32,370
they believed that the attackers were on

574
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:35,620
the system probably as early as December

575
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:38,139
2013 so and then they probably scared

576
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:40,268
around I think in 2015 some time and

577
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:41,979
again it points to user credentials

578
00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:44,830
being used so probably again probably

579
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,750
like a phishing email and again user

580
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:49,840
account management and this one did

581
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:51,399
about 11 million customers so again I

582
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,490
think I would say for some of their

583
00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:57,850
solutions very similar to to what was

584
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:59,519
the proof in the previous case care care

585
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:02,889
first right recently very recent

586
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:06,190
believes as early as June 19th 2014 and

587
00:23:02,889 --> 00:23:08,080
I discovered in May 20th 2015 right last

588
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:10,990
week right there again it points to

589
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,820
database credentials being used and also

590
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,409
right some of the issues or the

591
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:18,039
solutions might be user account

592
00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:20,950
management encryption all that but this

593
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:22,899
this one affected 1.1 million customers

594
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:24,549
so it's really really interesting and as

595
00:23:22,899 --> 00:23:27,789
you can see like if you go down all

596
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:29,289
these cases right looks clear the

597
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:32,139
attackers have been on the network right

598
00:23:29,289 --> 00:23:34,029
over a year maybe even longer but or

599
00:23:32,139 --> 00:23:35,590
actually six months or longer and you

600
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:37,059
can see from the kind of the

601
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:39,340
relationship what I'll have in the next

602
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:40,990
in a future presentations is kind of

603
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:43,059
like have the analysis of like how long

604
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:45,759
and show the data points which would be

605
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:50,740
really interesting for executives as

606
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:52,870
well okay and to be case for I I'm still

607
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:54,789
working on that but basically I wanted

608
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:58,570
to I didn't want to just pinpoint like

609
00:23:54,789 --> 00:24:00,250
specific you know specific health care

610
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,960
organizations that have been breached I

611
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:04,299
wanted to actually do like from 1

612
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,759
million customers and more and actually

613
00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:07,860
I don't know if actually I wanted to go

614
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:10,150
back here

615
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:11,949
regarding primeira BlueCross BlueShield

616
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:14,860
how many people here are actually

617
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:17,410
BlueCross BlueShield massachusetts

618
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:19,479
members here right so okay so really

619
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,960
interesting right so regarding where the

620
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,960
primeira

621
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:24,640
blue cross is really interesting because

622
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,549
number one even though right there

623
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:30,970
they're mostly on the west coast but a

624
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:32,799
lot of there's a lot of talk about some

625
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,270
of the customers here actually looked

626
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,190
looking through threat intelligence i

627
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:38,350
saw some customers and in that

628
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:40,720
connecticut as well and massachusetts

629
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:43,750
and and really interesting and if you go

630
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,240
to primera i think there's a website but

631
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:47,799
you can kind of take a look and so some

632
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,240
of you that that use the BlueCross

633
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:51,010
BlueShield of massachusetts might be

634
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,870
impacted as well so it's good to

635
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:56,190
actually sign up for like that I think

636
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:58,629
that are all clear ID kind of like a

637
00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:00,190
identity theft identity credit

638
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:02,200
monitoring for example it's pretty

639
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:05,799
interesting so just be be be aware of

640
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:08,049
that okay and then next one this was

641
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:11,320
actually from the Verizon data breach or

642
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:13,929
an instant response they have a yearly

643
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:17,260
survey of all the difference you know

644
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:20,620
different incidents over the past year

645
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:22,929
in different verticals in different

646
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:24,689
industries and for example these were

647
00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:26,830
some of the recommendations for

648
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:28,120
healthcare organizations not only health

649
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:30,370
care organizations but other

650
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:33,489
organizations as well so for example

651
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:35,549
right if you if you go down and take a

652
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:39,010
look right two-factor authentication

653
00:25:35,549 --> 00:25:40,270
right some of these are like from the I

654
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:43,360
think the sans there's some other stuff

655
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:46,000
too but it's the category percentage 24%

656
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,979
but the category the category is you

657
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,080
know visibility right there so maybe you

658
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:53,320
can't do two-factor authentication at

659
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,090
first but some of these you can do like

660
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,649
a quick win so the next one is they

661
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:59,168
write patching the web services I think

662
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:00,760
we've known that sometimes very tough to

663
00:25:59,169 --> 00:26:02,830
patch as well right it's all about

664
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:05,799
patient care but it's a quick win as

665
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:07,840
well but if I need for interface

666
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:08,980
internet facing devices so again think

667
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,110
about all these Internet of Things

668
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:13,450
devices right whether it be I'll have a

669
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:15,280
next slide about that too but right you

670
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:18,730
can have the visibility when you are

671
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:21,040
tracking that outbound traffic we have

672
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:23,050
application testing right I won't go

673
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,730
to all these but take a look at all the

674
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:27,550
ones that are quick win versus all the

675
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:29,620
ones that kind of like you can you can

676
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:31,930
actually improve your your organization

677
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,520
whether it be health care or not and

678
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:35,260
then these these were some

679
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:38,650
recommendations that I had just looking

680
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:41,820
through all different stuff on the web

681
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:44,440
and different the web cast and different

682
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:47,530
different reports as well so again I

683
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:50,980
think like Eric mentioned from his talk

684
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:53,230
yesterday you you really want to have a

685
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:55,630
kind of like some kind of vulnerability

686
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,900
management some kind of model whether it

687
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:59,710
be

688
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:01,480
I trust iso nist i for my organization i

689
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:04,210
really enjoy using high trust as well

690
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:07,060
it's a combination of everything this i

691
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:09,610
so try to be secure don't only just

692
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:11,409
follow like HIPAA privacy HIPAA Security

693
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:24,490
and think that you're you're still

694
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:28,750
secure yes yes regulation contention

695
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:31,810
that HIPAA but is the mindset yeah

696
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:33,820
that's so the question was right is the

697
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:36,129
mindset changing for the healthcare

698
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:38,200
organizations regarding no different

699
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:39,970
different breaches and all that right or

700
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,120
different security things I would say

701
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:45,730
that it it depends on the culture right

702
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:47,860
cost benefit as well sometimes it's

703
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:50,290
really very important to get in front of

704
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:53,560
the board to basically you know kind of

705
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:55,750
like let the board know what's going on

706
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:59,200
in security right make it very simple

707
00:27:55,750 --> 00:28:01,030
easy to understand but try to so I would

708
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,800
say in response to your question and it

709
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:05,200
really depends it depends on the culture

710
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:07,780
depends on how many users depending on

711
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,150
and then sometimes sometimes the

712
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:12,370
providers or the providers have a lot of

713
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:15,040
say so trying to get security champions

714
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:17,110
from all different in this department

715
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:19,570
levels as well not only working with

716
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:22,179
management to try and do like it like

717
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:25,540
what I try to say is try to give them

718
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:27,550
guidance on how they can be safe in the

719
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:30,370
organization and be safe at home as well

720
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:32,050
try to be not only just security

721
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:34,649
security security but try to weigh that

722
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:37,260
as well so I would say that that's um

723
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:39,570
the answer that one recommendations

724
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:42,360
there's uh again try to follow a model

725
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:44,460
right whether it be I trust I trust ISO

726
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,409
NIST whatever my Beach would follow that

727
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,750
and make sure Eric mentioned from the

728
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:50,340
vulnerability vulnerability maturity

729
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:52,760
model right maybe you can follow that

730
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:56,250
and you want to continually continually

731
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:58,980
continuously measure and improve your

732
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:01,680
your vulnerability management and and

733
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:03,450
and your processes for example data

734
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,580
classification right I think we all know

735
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:07,230
we want to ensure that you know where

736
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,790
all the crown jewels are right I'll

737
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:10,560
scale organizations it's a data right

738
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:12,030
you you saw on the previous slide it's

739
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:14,399
five hundred to thirteen hundred per

740
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:15,930
record that's just like a tilde that's

741
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,090
just little bit how much it costs but

742
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:20,700
think about all the miners all the

743
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:22,949
different children that were impacted

744
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,560
right from the anthem from the primeira

745
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:27,750
from all the difference health care

746
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:30,270
breaches as well use two-factor

747
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:32,790
authentication I think that again maybe

748
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:34,920
you want to segregate and look and use

749
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:36,840
two-factor authentication on the really

750
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:40,260
critical assets on your crown jewels

751
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:41,760
first maybe on your IT all the people

752
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:44,100
that have administrative access for

753
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,200
example maybe your IT personnel try to

754
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:49,110
use that first and then try to slowly

755
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,820
slowly move it into like the workforce

756
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:52,530
as well but again it takes a lot of time

757
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:54,870
takes a lot of patience as well and

758
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:56,639
again a lot of third parties I think

759
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:59,100
you've seen from the Verizon data breach

760
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,280
is there the Dvir

761
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:04,350
2015 you want to secure take a look at

762
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:06,060
the remote access third parties right a

763
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:08,070
lot of breaches are also happening not

764
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:09,600
only from the fishing but also from the

765
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:11,700
third parties for example your

766
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,889
organization's really secure but all of

767
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,390
a sudden there is a third party where

768
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:17,250
you have a bi a business associate

769
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:19,220
agreements but they install some kind of

770
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:21,480
open source or a very vulnerable

771
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:23,670
application and you don't see it right

772
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,690
so kind of have the logs have the video

773
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:27,540
whatever it might be

774
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:29,280
take a look at that application

775
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:32,340
whitelisting sometimes really tough

776
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:34,110
right but try to know I think a lot of

777
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:36,810
the organizations here a lot of the

778
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:39,120
presentations now are aimed at the

779
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:40,080
behavior analysis right it's not going

780
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,439
to be working all the time

781
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:45,750
but it's starting it's starting right

782
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:47,970
antivirus is pretty much works by about

783
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:50,370
50% of the time right but

784
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:52,230
you want to know what is on your systems

785
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:53,790
you want to know what is what should be

786
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:55,770
running what should not be running and

787
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:59,159
you also want to manage and monitor

788
00:30:55,770 --> 00:31:00,720
privilege usage privileges privileged

789
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,950
accounts versus other accounts as well

790
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,470
right

791
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:06,720
the encryption remove the data if it's

792
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:07,740
not it not needed right you of course

793
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,720
you're getting [ __ ] the data but

794
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:11,730
sometimes is much more much more

795
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,220
complicated maybe you want you want to

796
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:15,630
de-identify the data and also maybe you

797
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:18,210
want to remove the data if it's if it's

798
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:20,670
not needed an education education

799
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:23,160
education you can keep educating people

800
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:25,980
and I run to mention also attend the

801
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:28,320
access management and then the access

802
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:30,180
management as well and here are some

803
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,300
other recommendations regarding hiring

804
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:35,130
the right making sure that empowering

805
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,710
all of your executives not only

806
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:40,050
executives but also all of your

807
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:42,630
workforce as well to make sure that they

808
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:44,930
understand different security practices

809
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:47,430
so for example when they are or a

810
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:50,670
question to make a secure decision

811
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:52,220
whether at innovation or at home they

812
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:55,170
can make the right decision

813
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:56,130
improve board and stakeholder oversight

814
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:58,050
right

815
00:31:56,130 --> 00:32:00,420
be proactive I think we've seen a lot of

816
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:02,220
the difference presentations mentioning

817
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,270
be proactive there's no more being

818
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,130
reactive anymore

819
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:07,020
probably the healthcare organization is

820
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:08,670
already has a breach or the attacker is

821
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:11,520
already on the or attacker or attackers

822
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:13,980
are already on the on the on the network

823
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,520
so is your job to kind of be really

824
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:19,470
ready for all if when this happens

825
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:20,670
there's difference you know different

826
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:24,090
organizations that you would work with

827
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:25,470
as well but how many people I think dr.

828
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:27,240
Schwartz mentioned this as well with

829
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:28,770
national health information sharing and

830
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,780
analysis center we need to work with

831
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:32,280
more of these Isaac's as well there's

832
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,570
different Isaac's and different

833
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,820
organizations not only healthcare

834
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:38,310
there's a financial one there's many

835
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:40,860
ones so we need to kind of participate

836
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:44,010
in trusted entities as well so it's

837
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:46,320
really interesting there and that was

838
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:51,830
all for that yep the shows off that's

839
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,830
all any questions yes

840
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:59,310

to gather the right Cir for example

846
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:25,920
rushing last year and they sort of work

847
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:30,129

848
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:41,740
kind of get where you're most likely

849
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:45,580
please dad help my art auction loss

850
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:50,320
right right like the other source of

851
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:55,149
data from HHS Walsh yes

852
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:57,480
no I say right yeah spread sheet

853
00:33:55,150 --> 00:34:00,640
protection help on that they look bad

854
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:03,520
about that what you know basically the

855
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,890
data wanted free what lvl art for spices

856
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:08,259
and stuff distance walked on I have my

857
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:11,100
archive what need to worry most about in

858
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,100
fact the matter is that

859
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:21,020
a lot of these ones would be rare right

860
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:23,030
yeah exactly and then to add to your

861
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:24,889
points um one of the things that I've

862
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:27,349
been doing also is looking at a lot of

863
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:28,669
the the threat intelligence feeds it's

864
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:30,919
kind of like trusted right there's so

865
00:34:28,668 --> 00:34:32,808
much different data that's coming in and

866
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:34,848
I'm actually looking at different feeds

867
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:36,230
and the hard part is there's so much

868
00:34:34,849 --> 00:34:38,000
right it's keep following Pauline

869
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:40,129
Pauline and how do they relate to health

870
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,440
care as well and how can I use that or

871
00:34:40,129 --> 00:34:44,989
actually I actually probably mentioned

872
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,760
that but um automate how do I automate a

873
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:49,569
lot of different things as well in there

874
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:52,940
and so yeah really interested to talk

875
00:34:49,569 --> 00:34:54,529
health care trusted as well and it will

876
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:56,740
be really interesting because it's kind

877
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:59,599
of like a call to action we need more

878
00:34:56,739 --> 00:35:02,390
the bad guys right the attackers they

879
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,099
they're so well so good and conversing

880
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:06,890
right whether it be underground or

881
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:09,260
wherever it might be and us as the good

882
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:13,400
guys we need to really communicate more

883
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:15,829
and also kind of I think share some of

884
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:18,740
the data right in in a trusted entity or

885
00:35:15,829 --> 00:35:21,980
model as well so and any other questions

886
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:23,990
