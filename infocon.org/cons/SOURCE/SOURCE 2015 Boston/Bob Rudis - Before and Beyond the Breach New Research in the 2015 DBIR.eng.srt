1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,200
thank you everyone for joining this 3:15

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:09,929
session and source Boston a lot of

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,269
familiar faces thank you I think a lot

4
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,910
of you know Bob Bob Brutus has been in

5
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:17,400
InfoSec industry for many many years he

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:22,490
told me not to read this whole long bio

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:27,240
here which really the guy's wicked smaht

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:30,150
right put my Boston accent on so listen

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,780
to what he has to say Bob do you prefer

10
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:36,420
questions I will be getting questions

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:43,050
okay great so feel free to interrupt him

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:44,930
and we're here to yeah so be as

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,370
interactive as you want to with this one

14
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:49,079
I've got some basic set up stuff about

15
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,660
some of the cool new things we've done

16
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,370
with the dir but if you have questions

17
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,959
do not hesitate to throw them on I may

18
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,370
not have a slider a graphic I can throw

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,109
up I do have the report handy I can

20
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,870
bring it up but I can probably answer

21
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,550
virtually any question from it it's just

22
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,289
a little bit tiny little bit more about

23
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,210
me than since I didn't they can't read

24
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,070
the bio I usually do this presentation

25
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,140
with jr. one of the other folks on there

26
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,750
but along with the DBA I've got a book

27
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,970
with J James in red red you can find us

28
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,310
there straight too interestingly enough

29
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,939
we actually did this we had this slide

30
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,500
up on at RSA and we a nail kit as a joke

31
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:24,089
and like no one really got it cause like

32
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,380
they don't really slide but now it's

33
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,880
like even funnier because like now we

34
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,899
actually take the blame for verizon

35
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,899
buying AOL so

36
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,530
yeah so yes actually I'm gonna leave

37
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,060
this up there for a second how do people

38
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,240
to know what the Verizon data breach

39
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,670
investigations report is hey hands done

40
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,780
I ever this is now I'm asking you guys

41
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,590
are security people how many people

42
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,090
actually how many B or C has this piece

43
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,470
this is really good because now now I've

44
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,820
got it now I've got yeah I wish the

45
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,890
camera was pointing that way so as the

46
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,720
CISSP you're suppose to be honest so

47
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,950
this is a question that i have found

48
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,720
that i should not ask but I'm asking

49
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:03,120
anyway how many people have read the TBI

50
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:04,650
our cover to cover and that's ten feet

51
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,970
would thank you for it and actually I

52
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,560
think rusty for your honesty and there's

53
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,359
no disparagement for you guys in this

54
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,330
one it's a sixty issue page document

55
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,920
it's a lot to take in and and we have

56
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,840
found that most people skim through the

57
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,280
documents or read through it and and

58
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,570
actually I found that more this year as

59
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,680
I've been talking to folks about that so

60
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,750
it's gonna change it may be a little bit

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,920
of how we do the report next year but

62
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,330
the reports been out for about eight

63
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,250
years and that we've got about ten

64
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,380
eleven years of much total data for this

65
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,210
thing and I we have a gallon of covers

66
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,710
up here that you can see you know

67
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,330
starting from way back when all the way

68
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:35,160
up till now and the last two covers are

69
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,290
really important and I'll talk about the

70
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,180
bar graph in a minute because folks may

71
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,010
not may not know from last year's cover

72
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,190
but last year's cover was entirely made

73
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,299
from the data within the dbi are

74
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,890
everything actually there's a there's

75
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,270
knots on the covers of you go again that

76
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,100
you can actually break it down to PDF

77
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,480
and see it every dot is one of the

78
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,890
breaches that are in the DVI are it's

79
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,480
like literally every breach we had last

80
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,220
year was on the cover and we did that

81
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,350
because we used a machine learning

82
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,670
algorithm to figure out how to cluster

83
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,840
and organize what the breaches are I'll

84
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,059
talk about that in a little bit but not

85
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,980
much and this year it's the same thing

86
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,959
so this year it is just a pretty picture

87
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,090
it actually is made from the data within

88
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,230
the breaches as well too and I'll talk a

89
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,060
little bit about that a little bit later

90
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:14,070
on but what's kind of cool about the DVI

91
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,380
are this is my first year working on it

92
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:18,410
formally is that we've really done a

93
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,280
great job getting more partners and

94
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:22,200
especially over the last couple years

95
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,489
we've really jumped more partners than

96
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,500
like even the share week we did more and

97
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:29,190
they jump from here to here this year

98
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,680
from 50 to 70 it wasn't just normal

99
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,750
breach data we actually people knocking

100
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,350
down our door you know a virtual door

101
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:39,390
literally saying hey we have this data

102
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,859
will you analyze it we put in the eBay

103
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,850
are we one actually give people a

104
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,790
picture that they haven't seen before

105
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:46,500
you guys asking questions please please

106
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:49,079
do stuff with this and it wasn't breach

107
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,870
data and I'll cover that a little bit

108
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,390
too so because it wasn't breached data

109
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,310
we had to go what we thought was beyond

110
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:58,290
the breach we'd be like if you read the

111
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,760
report at all actually for a 60 page

112
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,959
report it's kind of readable but I'm

113
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,350
gonna talk about that readability thing

114
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:06,210
in a little bit too so with this before

115
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:08,160
we enter it's like we caught beyond the

116
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,990
breach because we had 12 terabytes of

117
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,310
extraordinarily different data and I'll

118
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:13,650
cover sewing to cover most of the

119
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,150
sections in this one folks may not

120
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,579
realize this but our normal breach

121
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,289
corpus which is almost 200,000 breaches

122
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:22,320
right now in the breach purpose is just

123
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:24,030
shy of 200,000 is about 15 mega tits on

124
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,229
one of the crappy thumb drives that ya

125
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,539
vendors and are as they give out of the

126
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:28,830
boots and you can actually have

127
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:30,659
redundancy yeah put on a couple of them

128
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,740
right to have them around just it just

129
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,760
encrypt them kids it does have some

130
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,200
interesting stuff even though it's

131
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,610
actually like somewhat amount of Mines

132
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,440
it's got some finnish news so we went

133
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,990
from working with a really well-known

134
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,020
data set for eight years to working with

135
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,760
a bunch of stuff that well as folks in

136
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,070
the team have worked with maybe a little

137
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,539
bit here and there 12 terabytes of data

138
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:50,070
of different kinds of data we've never

139
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:51,960
really seen before as part of this whole

140
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:53,700
thing so we had to come up with some

141
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,320
underlying principles for how we were

142
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,890
gonna work out this new section in the

143
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,620
Dvir

144
00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:02,370
so one of the principles was avoid

145
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,870
simple accounting I am NOT here to speak

146
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,450
disparagingly about anybody else's

147
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,580
report I do see a lot of just simple

148
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:10,020
counting and InfoSec reports and their

149
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,130
report and then doing you know showing

150
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,409
the counts every years there's nothing

151
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,820
really wrong with that but that kind of

152
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,740
doesn't give you a good statistical

153
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,360
picture of where things are and it may

154
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,800
not be helping you know move the ball

155
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,790
forward a little bit so we wanted to try

156
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,460
to shy away from that

157
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:25,830
we also wanted to not duplicate anything

158
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,299
that our partners were doing I am so

159
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:30,180
glad Steve is here because I really was

160
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,520
counting on him being here so thank you

161
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,140
ever come see don't duplicate their

162
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,359
report content so we had great partners

163
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,409
who produce their own reports and that

164
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,050
whether it was the breach theater or

165
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,910
whether it was this new data it's not my

166
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:44,190
job it wasn't my team's job to actually

167
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,840
go duplicate their efforts why would I

168
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,540
do that you can read the report most of

169
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,010
them are actually pretty good to read we

170
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,150
have that we got data from a lot of

171
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,409
different sources for some of the

172
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,929
different sections and it was really

173
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:56,640
well it was the same kind of data it was

174
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,140
in a weird different formats any one

175
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,789
that you heard me talk about data before

176
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,800
this was kind of the whole data

177
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:03,330
cleansing data aggregation so we had to

178
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,620
cleanse it normalize it get everything

179
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,080
together it kind of did do all that

180
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,150
stuff and we had to come up with

181
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,830
interesting questions so we just don't

182
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,929
like to report stuff that's one reason

183
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:14,640
why in the non non new section in the

184
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,590
regular will breach section that we have

185
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,210
we didn't just regurgitate the same

186
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,919
stats from previous years or show some

187
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:22,229
of the same graphics from previous years

188
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,180
because honestly we respect you too much

189
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:25,800
to do that and while we may be coming to

190
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,330
the point where there breach component

191
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,190
of our report is like the beige book in

192
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,450
economics where you will have like a

193
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,580
broken out section or something like

194
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:34,050
that next year the reality is is for

195
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,219
this new stuff we wanted to ask some

196
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,510
questions that we weren't seeing

197
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,610
answered in other reports or other

198
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:40,440
places we had a unique opportunity with

199
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,030
the data that we have and literally

200
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,890
scramble to answer them because by the

201
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:45,179
time it all kind of came together we had

202
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,740
like three weeks that write the thing

203
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,270
like and this is like three look through

204
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,500
three weeks to go through 12 terabytes a

205
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,240
day that we've never seen before and

206
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,380
come up with cool questions answer them

207
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,730
along with the other stuff that would

208
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,890
normally do because it was a compressed

209
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:58,530
schedule this year for a whole host of

210
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:00,150
reasons so one of the new sections that

211
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:01,739
we actually got to do that we broke out

212
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,179
from a smaller section that we would

213
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,350
normally do is phishing so we talked

214
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,350
about fishing in the previous couple

215
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:08,760
reports and you know this year we got to

216
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,320
work with a couple more partners then

217
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,969
usually the single one that that we got

218
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,890
to work with so we got data from like a

219
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,870
couple hundred thousand you know

220
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,979
basically people a couple thousand

221
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:19,680
people that were fished over with

222
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,180
multiple campaigns over time and we

223
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,680
wanted ad we asked a bunch of questions

224
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,000
for this particular thing but the

225
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,070
question I'm going to talk to you about

226
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,930
here though

227
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:29,960
that we asked and that we answered it

228
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:34,130
with this data is how long do you have

229
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:35,750
as an organization when if when fishing

230
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:37,580
first like campaigns being launched

231
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:40,010
against you how quickly do you think you

232
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,359
have before someone actually responds to

233
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:43,310
that fishing event so I'm willing to

234
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,720
take a couple so the ones that read that

235
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,860
please don't answer this - you know what

236
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:51,560
the answer is there everyone else that

237
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:56,540
didn't read it what is the answer two

238
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:58,520
minutes that's 120 seconds yeah okay

239
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:01,160
does anybody else want if I take a stab

240
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:04,340
at this we have two minutes to tell the

241
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:07,040
first bite from a phishing campaign got

242
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,359
one hour so - two minutes one hour if I

243
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,240
does want to go for a third one come on

244
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,640
somebody all right five five seconds so

245
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,130
we got we have a pessimist a slightly

246
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,960
with a really bad pessimist a pessimist

247
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:21,950
and an optimist okay that's bull so the

248
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,359
answer is 82 seconds this and so and

249
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,860
just to give you a bit of background is

250
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,850
that this and I could just walk away

251
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,080
with this number and we could go to the

252
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:28,400
next section we asked a couple other

253
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,620
questions you can read the report for

254
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,209
them but I found this one to be kind of

255
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,470
the coolest one that that's out there

256
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:35,540
and if you promise not to tweet

257
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:36,770
something like which is a yeah yeah go

258
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:37,610
ask that right beekeeper my guy will

259
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:40,340
tell you something else if you don't

260
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:42,229
promise me not to eat something so for

261
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,450
this 82 seconds one if we wanted to know

262
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:46,310
how how how fast people respond to these

263
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:49,160
and it didn't matter the campaign size

264
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:51,170
and it didn't matter what levels the

265
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,370
campaigns were going to and didn't

266
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,959
matter what department that the

267
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,730
campaigns are going to I didn't matter

268
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,810
what devices that it's like we actually

269
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,670
went through this whole series of

270
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,469
iteration so this isn't just a really

271
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,180
basic you know naive analysis we looked

272
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:04,400
at all sorts of combinations for this

273
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:06,949
thing and from the campaign launch till

274
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,630
the first person opens and then does

275
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:10,190
whatever the insight is whether they

276
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,390
open up the attachment or click on the

277
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:13,520
link and go do whatever it's like

278
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:16,400
basically initiates the thing that could

279
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:18,850
cause the endpoint compromise was 82

280
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,850
seconds

281
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:28,040
[Music]

282
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,360
so so I bought one stuff so we have a

283
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,519
question so I could talk about the other

284
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,870
staff so we asked that question too and

285
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,910
we wanted to know how many people also

286
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:36,439
okay out of all these things like how

287
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,480
many people in an organization are gonna

288
00:09:36,439 --> 00:09:39,800
open a first thing message opens aren't

289
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,430
really that bad by the way

290
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,810
selling huh well I'll do that with you

291
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:48,079
but since you since you started this I

292
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:50,239
will go down so so opens aren't bad so

293
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:51,800
how about when a campaigns launch the

294
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,689
average organization this is across

295
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,189
average like was how many what

296
00:09:53,689 --> 00:09:56,709
percentage of an organization is

297
00:09:55,189 --> 00:10:04,480
actually gonna open a phishing email

298
00:09:56,709 --> 00:10:06,529
campaign anyway else take one more

299
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,290
twenty percent so the answer is

300
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:11,600
twenty-three and change twenty-three

301
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:13,040
percent are gonna open it now before I

302
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,470
actually go do what you want me to do an

303
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,750
answer your question the reality is is

304
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,860
why why opens aren't bad so I still love

305
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,180
security awareness is something that

306
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,769
it's all my passion I still serve on the

307
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,388
board first hands for security partners

308
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:25,069
so I still do a lot of that stuff and

309
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,899
people have to open email you all you

310
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:27,860
all I guarantee have to open emails part

311
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:29,389
of your deal like I've been trying not

312
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,730
to for the best it is but I have to open

313
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:33,529
email to and so there's a lot of a lot

314
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,329
of jobs were like communications or HR

315
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:37,339
legally you have to open email so like

316
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:38,300
the opens really aren't so bad most of

317
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:39,769
the stuff is locked down enough that

318
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,930
opens aren't gonna be a big deal from

319
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:45,559
from a mail client perspective however

320
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:47,059
11 percent actually do the clicks opens

321
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:48,920
whatever you want to call the the actual

322
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:52,969
thing that causes them our event to be

323
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,990
successful no it's 11 percent

324
00:10:52,970 --> 00:11:03,480
it's a representative poll

325
00:10:54,990 --> 00:11:05,370
yeah it's actually really depressing we

326
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,570
took risk so do we have any stats on

327
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,190
whether people contacted orgs or

328
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,560
whatever we didn't get that data I'm

329
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:12,900
sorry so I know we don't have that we

330
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,040
get the DIA that we work with and we try

331
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,470
to ask questions for and that's one of

332
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,300
the ones and if you read the rest of the

333
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:20,550
report we have a section on malware and

334
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,589
you'll see how this ties in today read

335
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:24,900
some other parts of the report this is a

336
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:26,820
really bad thing like actually this is

337
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,050
the 82 seconds is bad enough the fact

338
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,250
that 11% we're gonna actually do

339
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,870
something with it and cause the

340
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:34,320
potential malware event to occur is

341
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:36,480
really really bad because really that's

342
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,460
how everyone got in last year if your

343
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,960
every news throw you read was some third

344
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,700
party getting fished and then getting

345
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,960
credentials because they got malware and

346
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,160
sought the blah blah but you saw

347
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,170
headlines that you've heard the report

348
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,699
you see the report so this is really bad

349
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,439
and this is basically you know one thing

350
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,630
to talk about the report is we talked to

351
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,560
two minor so minor was great they were

352
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,630
nice folks over there

353
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,489
and we talked a couple of folks as well

354
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,530
to that basically said looking an

355
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,760
awareness program is key a really great

356
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:01,020
awareness program I talked about that a

357
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,300
source a couple years ago too

358
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:05,699
I also say you need technical controls

359
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:08,790
well I am NOT going to proselytize any

360
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:10,920
particular company if I say fire I like

361
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:12,449
device would be something that I would

362
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,650
absolutely invest in if I was still

363
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,940
running a security program somewhere

364
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:17,370
because you're you probably you're

365
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:19,890
almost a fool not not to run towards

366
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:21,120
awareness so we go from fishing to

367
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:22,380
malware because that's kind of what

368
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,310
happens where you go from fishing to

369
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,250
malware wondering what something

370
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:27,479
actually happens and we wanted to one of

371
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,710
one of the questions we asked a couple

372
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,930
questions but one of the questions we

373
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:33,240
wanted to know is are the malware attack

374
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:35,040
profiles against different types of

375
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,080
organizations so if you read the DBR we

376
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,510
actually group organizations by their

377
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,130
Naik's code North America entry code so

378
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:43,620
we grew to at a high level that way and

379
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:44,640
our are these organizations targeted in

380
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,230
different ways like do they see

381
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,340
different amounts of malware we wanted

382
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,230
to know if there was if there was

383
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,580
something along those lines so I'm just

384
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,590
giving you a snippet because I still

385
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:54,300
want you to report good I want to say my

386
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,890
report there's like 10 authors but it's

387
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,199
not my report so I want you to read my

388
00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:00,180
report so the answer is yes right so if

389
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,110
you're a retail organization you're

390
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,140
seeing on average

391
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:06,660
of 801 Mao or events a week and if

392
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:08,610
you're an edgy you especially a college

393
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,020
you're seeing like so like you're

394
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:12,390
screwed over there basically what you

395
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,800
are and over here like you're not so bad

396
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:15,420
we have we have some profiles for a

397
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,150
financial and some other ones in the

398
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:21,540
actual report itself too now we got data

399
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:22,860
from five different places here and so I

400
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,930
mentioned fire and fire air was one

401
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,310
Colorado was another one we have a bunch

402
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:29,400
of other ones too where I got a year's

403
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:31,319
worth of malware event data across tens

404
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,280
of thousands of organizations I can't

405
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,750
tell you how many because then you know

406
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,740
what the actual customer base for most

407
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,030
of these places are so we actually

408
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,610
limited the number in the report on

409
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:39,780
purpose it's a lot of places and we got

410
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,520
data we looked at all these Mauer

411
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:43,140
capture events from all these different

412
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,660
places and aggregated together and did

413
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:47,520
all this stuff and did this here so and

414
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,870
I think what's also important on here is

415
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,160
like you'll actually see that every so

416
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,750
often there's like a little spike there

417
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,670
there's like a little peaking spike here

418
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,680
and we talked in the report about this

419
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:57,240
where you have to not only watch what's

420
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,709
happening normal in your environment and

421
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,090
you're all capable of capturing the same

422
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:02,280
information if you've got this kind of

423
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,750
device in your hand we actually

424
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,370
encourage most of the sections was

425
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,570
repeat what we did and then learn from

426
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,830
what your own environment looks like

427
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:10,260
more than care about what was in the

428
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:12,090
actual report itself but so you have the

429
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,470
normal average everyday stuff that your

430
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,760
help desk is probably dealing with which

431
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,140
I would suggest getting that out of your

432
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,150
help desk and maybe talking about it

433
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,410
more of the security level but then also

434
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,730
deal with these floods that happen

435
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,810
because these are malware floods that

436
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,130
actually occur and a lot of

437
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,810
organizations like in some of these

438
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:26,130
cases it was a single or getting some of

439
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:28,349
these actual floods that was going on

440
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:29,520
here so that's really important from a

441
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,290
malware side it's like and this was a

442
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,819
cross vendor so this is the cool part

443
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:34,860
about the report this year right this

444
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,540
wasn't one vendors myopic view in one

445
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,460
one little industries and whatever a

446
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,380
niche thing doing over here this was

447
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,000
every single possible industry every

448
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:45,420
single size and global this actually

449
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,040
stay in global as well um if I think

450
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,300
hopefully fire is not learn when Paulo

451
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,439
does not in the room so the other thing

452
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,270
is for all you that work at an

453
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,280
enterprise read your contracts because

454
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:54,630
like this is your data and you may not

455
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,850
know that this is your data it's

456
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:58,260
anonymize I don't know who you are but I

457
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,610
probably knew enough to figure out what

458
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,020
most of you are far from this thing

459
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:02,250
because we're pretty smart back back

460
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,350
- so I probably couldn't figure it out

461
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,490
but it basically this is data from a ton

462
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,320
of people so this is actually pretty

463
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:08,370
representative so the other question we

464
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,380
want to know what's okay fine they're

465
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:12,360
all getting hit with malware and you

466
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,010
can't actually flip open like anything

467
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,780
like you newsreader these days at all

468
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,980
without actually seeing that someone was

469
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,660
breached with super sophisticated

470
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,790
advanced targeted malware for that

471
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,410
particular organization well it turns

472
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:24,209
out that seventy to ninety percent of

473
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:25,020
this is actually super unique and

474
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:27,060
separate for that particular

475
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:28,439
organization and what we described it is

476
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,349
like a special snowflakes fall

477
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,150
everywhere and and the reality is is

478
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,320
this is the automated infrastructure

479
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,850
that Michael Wortmann was talking about

480
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,140
a little while ago just in this room and

481
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:39,390
he was talking about it from a

482
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:41,370
vulnerability perspective and a scanning

483
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:43,260
perspective and this is their automated

484
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:44,340
infrastructure for doing getting malware

485
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,810
onto your environment right they're

486
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,190
tweaking things because if you're still

487
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,359
investing in plain old signature

488
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,950
antivirus and you're not doing much

489
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,570
beyond that they're gonna get by you

490
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,860
like they actually this worked this

491
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:54,660
worked everywhere last year it worked

492
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,280
everywhere this year so far I mean this

493
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,780
is the modus operandi and this is we're

494
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,310
still using 10 year old 20 year old

495
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:01,319
technology and thinking to protect our

496
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:03,089
stuff they're doing this to get by the

497
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,590
simple stuff that we've all got in place

498
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,550
because we checked enough boxes to

499
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:11,670
actually go do it

500
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:13,680
so yeah yeah so this idea so these are

501
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,900
the Decrypter got the cache for all

502
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,609
these particular ones right yet so this

503
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,199
is gonna get by the majority of stuff if

504
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,850
you don't have the advanced capability

505
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,380
so every single air I won't say every

506
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:25,260
but the majority of good vendors out

507
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:27,030
there Brandi virus have options to like

508
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,080
tell you at least not have some of this

509
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,160
stuff happen to you like they're a

510
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,480
little smarter than that you've no

511
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,520
devices there are few smarter than that

512
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,500
to to go do it so you can't just rely on

513
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,850
the simple basic stuff to get by anymore

514
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,170
because they know it works and they're

515
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,730
getting by and they're doing it this is

516
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:40,469
why it works they're doing it at scale

517
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:42,930
like like I actually have a little bit

518
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:44,700
of respect for them a little bit I mean

519
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:46,199
it's a weird kind of respect for them

520
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,250
you have to you have to do something

521
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,320
when you're studying breaches all the

522
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,790
time it's kind of depressing work so the

523
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,740
the next question that we have for this

524
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:55,560
particular section is yeah we wanted to

525
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:57,480
know what's changed so thankfully Wade

526
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,099
kept all of his notes from when he was

527
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,870
doing stuff back at I even forget the

528
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,800
name of the company

529
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:04,910
way back before verizon bottom I

530
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,959
actually forget who they are so so I

531
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,670
keep a he kept thought because they were

532
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,079
actually do an internal type stuff wait

533
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:11,089
wait wait a day to freak just like the

534
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:12,530
rest of us are and he kept all of his

535
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:17,419
notes and all that kind of stuff so back

536
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:19,069
in 2005 7 families for all of us that

537
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:21,439
are old enough we actually remember most

538
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:22,819
of those names and even some of them

539
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,050
slowed this today too but like they

540
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:26,379
should bring back very horrible scary

541
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:28,669
Mary's first memories what about us

542
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:31,400
accounted for 70% of the mail cut

543
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:32,840
activity back then and so we said okay

544
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,820
we have a lot of data from a lot of

545
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,199
places and before I actually mean you

546
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,970
can read what's up there but I mean if

547
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,770
you if any of you work for an antivirus

548
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:41,150
company or one of these network

549
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:43,160
appliance vendors that actually do this

550
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:44,150
kind of stuff in stream whatever I kind

551
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,280
of don't like you right now

552
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:48,050
cuz you made it really impossible to

553
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,730
actually do this analysis because you

554
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:51,350
got these stupid separators and these

555
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:52,730
stupid names and the things don't match

556
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:54,290
and they don't cuff that it was a

557
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:56,390
horrible pain in the neck to analyze

558
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:58,010
this across five different vendors could

559
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:59,570
not actually it was the hardest thing

560
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,250
ever Jake Jay and I actually spent two

561
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,720
and a half days writing a special custom

562
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,580
you think that actually does a bunch of

563
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,870
stuff and some fancy stuff to try to

564
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,250
make this stuff work right and we still

565
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:09,860
couldn't do it really well but we got

566
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:11,510
like sixty percent of the way there so

567
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,399
but so basically to do that we got to

568
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:15,350
this next step which is there's about 20

569
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,850
families and so there's the sinister

570
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,559
seven up here so this is the center's

571
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:20,928
just a top seven you have got here as

572
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,550
well to you know they've changed because

573
00:18:20,929 --> 00:18:24,170
in the old days the good old days the

574
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:25,850
simple days it was just people trying to

575
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,230
be jerks and stupid and kind of get

576
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,178
their name out there and do all sorts of

577
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,260
whatever some of it was a little bad but

578
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:32,450
the Rumia for the most part it wasn't

579
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:34,040
horrible now like these things are

580
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,870
terrible like zero access is terrible

581
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,280
ZBOX horrible and drama is not great act

582
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:39,620
like these guys these things are nasty

583
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,510
horrible things that you really evil

584
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,939
things and like it's really bad so the

585
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:45,679
landscape has changed a lot and there's

586
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:47,510
actually more diversity because again it

587
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,100
was 20 families versus seven but the

588
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:50,600
reality is even this top seven it's kind

589
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,100
of scary so we got a chance to see just

590
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,260
you know at the level across vendors

591
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,459
across different across different

592
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,800
organizations and this is actually

593
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:59,059
interesting too I should say we actually

594
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,500
tried to run this analysis across

595
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:00,810
different types of orbit again so the

596
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,220
name

597
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,899
so it really didn't change a whole lot

598
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,400
like finance had some different ones and

599
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,200
whatever but that top 20 was a top 20

600
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,030
across them all so the top seven floated

601
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,280
differently but the top 20 were the same

602
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:13,170
ones so the attackers are doing great

603
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,120
stuff at scale and doing stuff you know

604
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:16,260
pretty pretty amazing cool stuff at

605
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,090
scale that we're not defending will

606
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,410
against again so you know basically

607
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,480
start recording some of the stuff on

608
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:22,890
your own take the data from your devices

609
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,300
since they're doing it once you get your

610
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,620
own data to and start working with some

611
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:29,639
of the stuff like we actually did up

612
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:31,169
there one of them so this is this is the

613
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,760
beginning of the what I would call

614
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,650
controversial sections we have a couple

615
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,420
controversial sections in the DBR this

616
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:37,500
year and the one the first one is this

617
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,790
one there's generated a call a little

618
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,340
bit of a buzz because we worked with

619
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:42,930
actual micro workman's org where if you

620
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:45,060
saw us talked earlier a lot of the same

621
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:46,320
day that he used for the stats for what

622
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,580
he was showing earlier the same stuff

623
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,850
that we use to kind of calculate this

624
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:52,080
stuff here so now I'm gonna set this up

625
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,939
in that you know they are an interesting

626
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,310
company they they actually work with a

627
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,360
ton of actual org is like Dell is a huge

628
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:59,070
customer there's and all there am

629
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,290
assessed folks so it's like you know

630
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:02,730
tons and tons of machines but they also

631
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:04,500
work with alienvault and there's a lot

632
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:06,030
of crud in the alienvault data set and

633
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,230
how they do their stuff and the whole

634
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,430
way that they connect people in the

635
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,780
threat to exchange like there's some

636
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:11,550
crud in there so it's hard to do stuff

637
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,750
and the idea stuff that they work with

638
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:14,190
sometimes and things don't you know

639
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,690
don't flip right and they don't detect

640
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,520
the thing as well but there's a lot of

641
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:19,230
caveats and we caveat it everything like

642
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,520
if you read the back of the report we

643
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,990
talked about all the things that are

644
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,520
possibly wrong with the report we have

645
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,960
the footnotes that talk about that too

646
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,820
we talked about the biases and the data

647
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,020
very well in the report I think so you

648
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,730
set their goal look good looking for me

649
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:32,010
to kind of read them on there so for

650
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:33,210
this one here we actually looked at data

651
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,800
from all the orgs that Michael was

652
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,970
talking about before and I think I think

653
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,379
was even bigger because we actually got

654
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:39,660
a larger dataset too so this is like a

655
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,880
couple hundred million successfully

656
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,380
according to IDs hits primarily four

657
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,240
million well but a bunch but from down a

658
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,980
couple other companies what what were

659
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,560
the actual things that were hit and we

660
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:51,270
wanted to ask a question so how old are

661
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:53,250
some of these vulnerabilities that are

662
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:54,540
out there you know because we we keep

663
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,770
getting told by all the compliance so

664
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,730
it's patch patch patch right we gotta

665
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,320
patch everything right away

666
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,370
so we want to know like what was being

667
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,679
done out there and this was an

668
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:03,080
interesting chart that we put the

669
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,880
it's basically you know if you would

670
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,530
take what the popular culture thinks

671
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,670
everything is you'd be seeing okay well

672
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:08,810
the past couple years should be where

673
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:10,460
we're seeing all the exploits happen

674
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:13,730
especially in 2014 because earlier for

675
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:15,080
2014 data and you got like you know 2007

676
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,610
we're like that's like the biggest spike

677
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,139
then you've got stuff going back to like

678
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,909
we said their report they're partying

679
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,950
like it's 1999 now these these are kind

680
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:23,960
of SNMP things back here so it's the

681
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:25,040
it's the look of a low hanging fruit but

682
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,200
the attackers are looking for

683
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,580
low-hanging fruit like seriously like

684
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,440
there's a bunch of old bones that are

685
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,790
really easy to wrap up in to exploit

686
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,140
kits that they're looking for cuz

687
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:35,030
they're doing automated scans across the

688
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,170
entire internet and if you're not taking

689
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:38,090
care of some of this stuff on the

690
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:40,100
perimeter this is what they're gonna go

691
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:41,600
after i we're not saying yeah i can't

692
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,770
talk to you about targeted attacks i

693
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,520
don't know your organization i don't

694
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:45,080
know what the threats that you

695
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,700
particularly face as a particular board

696
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,110
but i can tell you that if you're

697
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,820
leaving stop hanging out there that's

698
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:51,620
publicly available or if they get in

699
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:53,090
with that malware and they're actually

700
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,409
trying to get through and do lateral

701
00:21:53,090 --> 00:22:04,250
movement within your environment they're

702
00:21:54,410 --> 00:22:05,990
going after the easy stuff yes so this

703
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,280
is that this is the idea say farther

704
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:09,110
from the perimeter or from wherever the

705
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,180
stuck with stage internally as well so

706
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:13,550
so just like with the other data it's

707
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:15,560
like the thin like the like of the the

708
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:17,720
Mauer data if those appliances were

709
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,710
placed weirdly and stupidly improperly

710
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,940
and we cover those in their port we

711
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:21,170
actually talked about that we cited that

712
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:23,990
as one of the biases we don't know how

713
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:25,310
those appliances replaced michael has no

714
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,360
idea where all the positioning from

715
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:28,040
those those but he does know that

716
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,179
there's a mix it makes of interactional

717
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,590
for these things so we actually didn't

718
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,910
get that so this isn't just perimeter

719
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:34,740
this is both lateral movement and

720
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:36,510
actually perimeter stuff coming at you

721
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:42,809
ask yourself the question what are the

722
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:45,090
typical CVS essence so yes and I'm so

723
00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:56,550
actually don't make me put up that slide

724
00:22:45,090 --> 00:23:01,260
hold on one second this is looking at

725
00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:07,200
the exa this is we took yes sure answer

726
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:08,460
yes oh so this is anonymous so just like

727
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,230
Michael said earlier this is completely

728
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,030
anonymous data so I don't know the

729
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:13,380
actual breaches like we don't even know

730
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:20,460
if this led to an actual breach of an

731
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:22,200
organization we just so yeah I mean if

732
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,970
everybody was really good about felon

733
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,650
and breach saving gave us the cbss is

734
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:27,720
that actually did that that's sure yeah

735
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:29,130
so if you just volunteered to work for

736
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,070
me and do that I'll be you've all said

737
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:33,390
yeah that's totally cool yeah so our

738
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,770
breach date is some of the ugliest thing

739
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:36,150
you have ever seen and I will show if

740
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:37,980
anyone that wants to see it you hit me

741
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,510
up and I'll do it look at Wow Google

742
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,820
hangout what the illustrate just how for

743
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:43,559
we did it's terrible like people don't

744
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,419
fill it in we have cbss if we actually

745
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:47,220
shared our cbss dated with michael and

746
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,540
he laughed hysterically over hangout

747
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,220
like you could not believe just how

748
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,990
pathetic our CDSs data would because we

749
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:54,150
just don't get that level of detail like

750
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:55,860
we get barely what's barely what you see

751
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:57,090
in the news actually some of the news is

752
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,860
better than what we get for some of the

753
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:02,220
stuff that we get in there so we tried

754
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:03,479
it's a great question we did try so fire

755
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,980
everything it's really old and this is

756
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,910
both nickel I don't want external so

757
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,290
this is the thing we're like start

758
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:09,390
cleaning up your house and like let go

759
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:10,678
download Michaels thing like after it's

760
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:12,390
up for the source recordings and stuff

761
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:13,860
and see the stuff is there we know this

762
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:15,270
isn't perfect we want to work with Steve

763
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,979
and others to make this a better thing

764
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,120
and understand things better we know the

765
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,340
IDS's aren't perfect and how they

766
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,020
trigger our perfect CVS s3 has the whole

767
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,730
ball chaining which is huge and that's

768
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,110
gonna play a huge factor on this and so

769
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:26,490
there's a lot of stuff going our that we

770
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,750
know but this is a great baseline to

771
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,950
start with and we knif we want to work

772
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,510
from here and kind of bring as many

773
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:33,270
people into the fold to kind of do this

774
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:35,250
and you don't have a lot of time right

775
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:36,590
so there's not a lot of time to do this

776
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,510
right so

777
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:40,250
if you start from here to the weakest

778
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,900
this is a weak exploit occurred after

779
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,760
cb8 publishing it's a cumulative thing

780
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:46,210
for a hundred percent afterwards so this

781
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,410
like after four weeks like fifty percent

782
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:50,540
are a car actually going out there like

783
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:52,160
you don't have a lot of time like and

784
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:54,139
actually there's probably a delay here

785
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,460
with Michael's data capture too and it's

786
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,110
a lot of its relying on good time

787
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,850
settings for the actual organizations

788
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:00,080
and we all know how great you keep NTP

789
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:02,419
in your own organizations up to date

790
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,379
reconciling so the reality here is like

791
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:06,500
this could have to be a lot worse than

792
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:08,000
it really is and we and because of some

793
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,230
of the time-related dated we didn't show

794
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,340
things like heart we actually had some

795
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,960
data on heartbleed all that kind of

796
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,189
stuff the hit last year we didn't want

797
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,240
to show it because it really was skewed

798
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,740
because it was like because there was

799
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,940
timing or zabun here but after going

800
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:19,280
through and cleaning up a bunch of stuff

801
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:20,690
you really the exploits begin like and

802
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,520
these are actual again come from yet

803
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:24,680
compromises known because it triggers

804
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,850
within like literally right after the

805
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,230
things out there so these guys are right

806
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:28,540
on top of it so you can read Michael's

807
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:30,530
talk for some of the other cool stuff

808
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:32,450
but again this was this was some

809
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:33,920
controversy right so like the

810
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:35,180
Twitterverse knee I blew up a little bit

811
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,650
and like people were a little bit yeah

812
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:38,990
hatin on this particular thing I get it

813
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:40,940
so the reality is is we want to work so

814
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:41,840
I we we are not saying we are perfect

815
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,920
we're not saying we're always right

816
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,330
we're not saying we did they did a

817
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,430
hundred percent that this is the best

818
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:47,870
data but we will take more data so if

819
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:49,670
you work for a vendor you work for an

820
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:51,439
organization that give us this data we

821
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,700
treat it really well we deleted

822
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,160
everything we were supposed to believe I

823
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,540
can provide can actually prove it and we

824
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,740
actually have a lot of stuff so we will

825
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,000
work with a member but this is one of

826
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,290
those kind of like challenges there so

827
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,610
there's another section I'm gonna breeze

828
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,810
through this one because like this is

829
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:05,629
been in the news a lot it's gonna be in

830
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:06,620
the news more unfortunately so like how

831
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,000
many people have heard of the pone

832
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,620
amount cost of a data breach average

833
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,850
thing he just released it this week okay

834
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,229
yeah so I'm not gonna say anything more

835
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:14,689
about that except his word his name's in

836
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:16,670
one more section on here so we actually

837
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:18,980
worked with actual cyber insurance

838
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:20,690
breach day that's like the cost of cyber

839
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,370
insurance so it's not perfect right so

840
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:23,840
this isn't like the actual cost of the

841
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:26,060
total or this was how much an insurer

842
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,409
paid out but it's actually honest data

843
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,820
like I can call you up on the phone and

844
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:29,930
ask how much your breach cost you you're

845
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,889
gonna tell me ten billion dollars

846
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:32,810
because you want to look like it was

847
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:34,670
impressive or whatever so I don't know

848
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:35,870
if you're lying to me when it's a survey

849
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:37,190
and I could call twelve people in your

850
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:38,449
Oregon you could get maybe fifteen

851
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:40,240
different answer than I could average it

852
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:42,140
out I just don't trust surveys period

853
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,730
it's just to me because I've actually

854
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,160
deliberately lied on surveys to prove

855
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:48,810
that sorry

856
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:50,130
kind of bad so just throw an opera so so

857
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:51,720
we actually plotted this date so we

858
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:53,370
actually got this data for about 200

859
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,890
actual cyber insurance claims over the

860
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:57,570
past couple years and we plugged them up

861
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:59,400
here so these there's a log scale so

862
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:01,020
there's actually log this is a log log

863
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,970
scale so automatically it's not linear

864
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,170
stuff don't make me tell you about this

865
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:05,310
there's no there isn't it may look like

866
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:07,290
nice straight lines what we just did

867
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:09,270
that cuz it's log log there's so it's

868
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:11,100
average is already stupid because we're

869
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:13,290
already talking log scale just be just

870
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:15,030
because of that right here 30 down you

871
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:16,770
can take a look at something I actually

872
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,879
regret this this wasn't missile wasn't

873
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:20,910
my ID I would blame day because he's not

874
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,380
here these we actually did this thing

875
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:24,180
where we calculated our own average cost

876
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:25,560
of David we did 58 cents which is where

877
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:27,360
that line is kind of hits up right there

878
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,830
we never said it then that is like no

879
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,020
one read the report you guys prove me I

880
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:32,550
read the report and and they just honed

881
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,960
in on the headline and now that's been

882
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:36,810
the thing and even IBM quoted this

883
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:39,180
because it was kind of horrible so it's

884
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:41,070
like that's what ours is this is Hanuman

885
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:42,750
zijn it's like there are average we know

886
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:44,550
is stupid we actually said it was stupid

887
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:46,380
in the report and this is the actual

888
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:47,790
thing which we used with we actually is

889
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:50,220
a linear regression model I'll give you

890
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:52,500
a prettier picture of that so when we do

891
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,630
the linear regression model we actually

892
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,950
it's and you can see so anyone knows a

893
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:58,560
little bit about stack I'm not going

894
00:27:55,950 --> 00:28:00,120
heavy into that the the fact that there

895
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:02,639
is this great thing that stands out

896
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:04,139
really wide is that so this is the

897
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,130
actual thing that fits like kind of

898
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,840
right in the middle and like so that's

899
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:09,480
like the the pinpoint thing I have a

900
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:11,250
chart for that in a second the graer so

901
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,260
the wider the gray area is the less

902
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:14,880
confidence we X like basically like the

903
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,620
range basically gets larger it's best

904
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,420
way to phrase that there's a range

905
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:21,419
associated with this stuff and I'll give

906
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:22,560
you the range right here so so Brad so

907
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,270
this is the expected value in that

908
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,740
middle and like as you know depending on

909
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,850
if you want to be a fun guy you can

910
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,650
actually go over here and tell people

911
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:30,149
like you know the world is ending if you

912
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,890
want to be way too conservative and look

913
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:32,480
good you know

914
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:34,220
they may not be too ugly to go over here

915
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,900
the truth is somewhere in like the

916
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:38,150
middle here like so if you have this

917
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:39,170
many records it's gonna cost kind of

918
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,520
roughly in between these numbers

919
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:42,260
together do that this is what people are

920
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:44,060
used to from real financial loss models

921
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:45,440
like at the executive level when they're

922
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,790
looking at financial loss they don't

923
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,960
look at it in average terms they

924
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:49,220
actually look at it in a range terms

925
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,890
they look at in distributions like we

926
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:53,450
just put here our model is horrible we

927
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:54,860
say that in the report our model still

928
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:57,050
isn't perfect one reason why it's still

929
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:59,270
based on records I can show you a bunch

930
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:00,980
of other charts that show why we have

931
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:03,110
like a ton of enumerations in our

932
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:04,190
various framework we analyze over 300 of

933
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:06,199
them to kind of go do this

934
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:08,000
and the reality is is nothing actually

935
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,160
helped describe it better than records

936
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,930
so far there's about half of this half

937
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,760
the half the cost of Reach is not

938
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:15,800
described by what we have available even

939
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,330
what Poneman has available it's really

940
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,700
there's a bunch of unknown stuff in

941
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:21,230
there so we're trying to work with cyber

942
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,210
insurers and other organizations and

943
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:24,530
even po naman to try to make this better

944
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:26,810
and tighten up the model have a better

945
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:29,210
picture for folks that are out there but

946
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:30,409
the reality is is like you I'm gonna go

947
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:31,700
a little quicker so the reality is you

948
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,990
really just can't go by the simple

949
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,940
average but you also can't just trust

950
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:36,260
our model completely either but you need

951
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,580
to if you want to start working with us

952
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,780
let me know we will work with anybody

953
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,100
that wants to talk to us about this kind

954
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,420
of stuff but we've got a lot of you're

955
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:45,230
doing it wrong stuff on this one too

956
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:46,760
just as an aside in the cover stuff

957
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:49,010
because we're actually able to do that

958
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,510
cost of a breach thing yeah we did we

959
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:51,920
did come up with way of doing it the

960
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:53,750
cover is actually based upon that so

961
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,950
those waveforms are actually the actual

962
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,320
cost of a breach of the particular

963
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:58,850
industries we actually have a whole

964
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,050
paragraph and a half on the back of time

965
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,639
what that is I'm gonna go into it here

966
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:04,520
but is anyone recognize what this with

967
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:05,900
what we're ripping off of here anyone

968
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:09,680
recognize it although we're riffing off

969
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:11,210
of do a division cover wow I wish I had

970
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,580
one of my t-shirts actually keep give me

971
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:13,760
your name let I'll give you a book

972
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,439
seriously

973
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,640
one of our other sections that was

974
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,380
looking for problematic and I'll kind of

975
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,910
go this really quickly we talked about

976
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:21,380
mobile right so everyone's about mobile

977
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:23,000
breaches bubble security every year we

978
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:24,740
get asked about it and we go we got

979
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,360
nothing our actual data set has very

980
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,710
very little related to mobile like it's

981
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,780
like two records I think last time I

982
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:31,700
looked so we got nothing about mobile

983
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:33,410
being a cause of actual breach that we

984
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,450
have in our 200,000 corporate

985
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:37,190
so how am I gonna talk about breach how

986
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:39,530
am i tell about mobile when I don't have

987
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:41,000
any thought about mul about so what we

988
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:42,980
did is we got Verizon Wireless to give

989
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,790
us six months of all of their equivalent

990
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:49,070
of on device if it's Android AV data the

991
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:50,480
end there's IDs data that we have from

992
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:51,950
them that's on the entire verizon

993
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,420
wireless network and we have some

994
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,740
advanced detection stuff that I can't

995
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,760
talk about that's also on the rise and

996
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,680
while there's Network to so we have a

997
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,150
ton of trigger data that we can go

998
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,970
through but it's six months of this for

999
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:03,830
the entire verizon wireless network tens

1000
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:04,880
of millions of customers I can't I can't

1001
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,770
tell you that I'm actually I tried

1002
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,070
saying it once and I got yelled as I I'm

1003
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:11,000
actually smacked down for that number I

1004
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:13,760
know I have no idea why that

1005
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,500
super-secret but anyway so we actually

1006
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,240
we have to broke the malware up into two

1007
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,560
categories this is the entire category

1008
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,320
we came up with above all explained in a

1009
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:23,540
minute so this is over time the number

1010
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:26,750
of unique devices viewing my work per

1011
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:28,340
week and actually we talked to a couple

1012
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,900
organizations outside of us and we

1013
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:31,699
confirmed that there was actually the

1014
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,870
decrease that we saw Verizon relish was

1015
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,540
actually something we saw everywhere

1016
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:37,100
that they saw everywhere so this is

1017
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,300
actually what you see there that spy can

1018
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,610
happen though that was actually stuff

1019
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:42,110
that was very well it wasn't exactly it

1020
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:43,370
was very similar in other people's

1021
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,600
networks that are queuing out there when

1022
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:47,090
the Bell Canada guys saw this he was

1023
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:49,219
like whoa how'd you get our data so it's

1024
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:50,870
kind of cool so but that's everything so

1025
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,790
we actually coined what we call a

1026
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:54,320
diluent where so at annoyance where is

1027
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:56,300
any you know anything you've installed

1028
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,370
or something that might get on your

1029
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:00,260
device for whatever reason that that is

1030
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:02,239
basically showing you abb's you don't

1031
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:04,460
want to see maybe stealing your IMEI

1032
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,660
like really low great like doing your

1033
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:08,390
grade stuff that almost anyone could

1034
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:09,950
write there's none I'd know it's where

1035
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:11,510
which becomes C to things that actually

1036
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:12,740
become a denial of service agents that

1037
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:14,300
basically they're really nasty stuff

1038
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,460
that your pcs get right the same

1039
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,510
horrible stuff that exists out there and

1040
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:19,940
I should take a moment to basic

1041
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:21,230
basically say oh by the way there's

1042
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,880
virtually nothing on me

1043
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,590
like literally virtually nothing on the

1044
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,080
rise and wireless network iOS Y that's

1045
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:29,720
compromised like this it was literally

1046
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,370
all Android like it was so bad that we

1047
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,110
really couldn't even talk about iOS and

1048
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:34,939
like we couldn't even dedicate time to

1049
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:36,530
it because there was so little iOS on

1050
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,960
the actual thing so Android really wins

1051
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,520
this

1052
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,460
pretty pretty well the horrible about a

1053
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:43,950
bloomin what they win it this is not a

1054
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:45,510
data clinch and an autumn anomaly we

1055
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:47,250
actually looked we asked we asked a

1056
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:48,658
they're changing is around there for

1057
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:50,700
that particular week there actually

1058
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:52,380
wasn't any significant activity of this

1059
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,820
particular type going on there so when

1060
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,919
we actually filtered out and separate

1061
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:58,080
the grades yeah this is what comes there

1062
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,490
we may have made a mistake I can't ask

1063
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,840
you to look at that data for me but we

1064
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:02,130
have their own Verizon Wireless guys

1065
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,879
look at what we did and they said no

1066
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:05,159
that wasn't a mistake

1067
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,080
so you can take my word for you take

1068
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:08,460
their word for it is just our data we

1069
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,928
are trying to solicit more things about

1070
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,130
Canada might be helping us out next year

1071
00:33:09,929 --> 00:33:12,899
to a couple other ones might so we might

1072
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:14,220
see different things but you can see

1073
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:16,020
that you know the numbers go way way

1074
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,520
down a little more consistent with when

1075
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:19,950
you get further out for for the actual

1076
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:22,559
higher grade stuff but they're really

1077
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:24,720
interesting for me here was it lasts

1078
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,850
about two days and some of that's

1079
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,710
because Verizon actually stops it but

1080
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:30,539
some of its also like the phones that

1081
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:32,549
people delete the app the phone to get

1082
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:35,309
rebooted like these are really unstable

1083
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:36,870
devices for malware to try to live it's

1084
00:33:35,309 --> 00:33:38,070
a very very difficult it's a very

1085
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:40,350
challenging environment them to work

1086
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:41,879
with so the timing there is like in it

1087
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:43,649
goes way out it's a pretty long tail

1088
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,179
thing but we got a lot of this from all

1089
00:33:43,649 --> 00:33:47,549
the people that make the money scaring

1090
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:48,960
people into thinking that they need to

1091
00:33:47,549 --> 00:33:50,490
have very expensive systems to do

1092
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,720
malware secure now we want people to do

1093
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:53,820
better with malware we actually say in

1094
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:55,380
the report do better with your stuff on

1095
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,789
mobile right you know you have an

1096
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:58,140
opportunity now you've never had before

1097
00:33:56,789 --> 00:34:00,090
to secure this environments of the

1098
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,500
attackers don't get there so this is one

1099
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:04,830
thing you actually really gonna need to

1100
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:06,630
do really quickly industry patterns

1101
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:08,069
you've seen this chart last year it's

1102
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:09,510
the same team map as last year the only

1103
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:10,770
thing we did is we added a little bit of

1104
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:12,000
a three-year history and bar charts

1105
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:14,089
below it so you can actually get an idea

1106
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,889
at a glance looked at what's there I

1107
00:34:14,089 --> 00:34:18,750
have this up there primarily for you to

1108
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:19,800
go and like take a picture this URL but

1109
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,060
you can either on the be put up the

1110
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,409
source for our there there's an

1111
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:25,290
interactive version of this particular

1112
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:26,639
chart online that we actually made this

1113
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:28,469
kind of shows we actually broke the

1114
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,419
industry's down to one more an Xcode

1115
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:32,580
level down so like the high level stuff

1116
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:34,859
is busy is very very high like finances

1117
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:36,509
like everything of Finance you break it

1118
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:38,020
down you could actually have more things

1119
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:39,669
like central banks and

1120
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:41,500
yeah insurance companies and things like

1121
00:34:39,668 --> 00:34:43,658
that so very diverse when you get even

1122
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:45,580
from what one further down and we wanted

1123
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:47,800
to show what this one is you know just

1124
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:49,659
because you may be under the same high

1125
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,070
level vertical we looked at all the

1126
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:53,320
various enumerations around threats

1127
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:54,669
related to this stuff and group them and

1128
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,080
clustered them by that in here so I

1129
00:34:54,668 --> 00:34:57,609
encourage you rather than we talked

1130
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,140
about this I wanted to just call it out

1131
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:00,280
let's go here and plate this is a home

1132
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,750
they're devout there and there's five

1133
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,280
five or six scenarios that we put up

1134
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:05,380
there for you to walk through but this

1135
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,990
is to get you thinking outside your I

1136
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:09,430
sac box right basically

1137
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:10,899
it's great that you're part of a nice

1138
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:12,069
act if you are if you aren't maybe you

1139
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,780
should be and maybe you shouldn't be

1140
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:16,240
part of an I sect that is just like and

1141
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:18,190
your vertical this means that like on

1142
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,600
here these guys which are all different

1143
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:21,280
colors should probably start sharing

1144
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,540
information with each other like

1145
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,880
indicator to compromise and all the

1146
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:26,410
other good stuff if you're if you're not

1147
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,490
if you don't see your industry all kind

1148
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:29,529
of leveled in the same place about

1149
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:30,930
thankfully like you know red is kind of

1150
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:33,100
up here and I think that's management

1151
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:34,180
might be information on come on forget

1152
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,290
right now but like we have to think

1153
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,759
that's one of the scenarios that we have

1154
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:39,250
in the actual report and also in the

1155
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,360
online thing this is one thing we're

1156
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,980
used to take a look at and try to

1157
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,810
understand where you're you know

1158
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:45,550
threaten brethren are and be working

1159
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:46,990
with them and now you know you're

1160
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:48,760
relying on us to tell you this from our

1161
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:50,109
breach corporates that we have this also

1162
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,430
means you might be wanted to talk to

1163
00:35:50,109 --> 00:35:53,290
more people outside your particular I

1164
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:55,868
sect for the folks that actually in the

1165
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:57,130
area the a CSC advances cybersecurity

1166
00:35:55,869 --> 00:35:59,890
Center which I used to be a part of

1167
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:01,030
those guys actually are they they're not

1168
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:02,799
just vertical they actually go

1169
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:03,880
regionally they won't take anybody in

1170
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,230
because they want to work with everybody

1171
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,540
they might not be a bad place start

1172
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:11,590
sharing information with and then

1173
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:13,509
finally we just talk about controversy

1174
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:14,920
one more time for the folks that have

1175
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:16,810
her at the report this this has been

1176
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,900
described as the snarky astre port ever

1177
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:19,040
or

1178
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:21,530
I would like probably call it the most

1179
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,820
irreverent report ever but the reality

1180
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:25,070
is it because we tried to cover a lot of

1181
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:26,810
stuff that was too like statistically

1182
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:28,700
hard for people to understand that that

1183
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:31,060
don't do that normally and also because

1184
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:33,799
it's really just depressing breach data

1185
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:35,390
we we actually include all of the

1186
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,650
irreverence in there and all the pop

1187
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:38,120
references and all the other stuff that

1188
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:39,860
we do primarily to make it easier for

1189
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,359
folks that just to read so if the length

1190
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,840
of it is actually causing you to stay

1191
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,730
away

1192
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,320
I really encouraging not to do that

1193
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:48,050
because it's pretty readable especially

1194
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:49,640
if you do parts and I think we got a

1195
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:53,180
couple good one I think I got I got a

1196
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:56,029
couple go on lines anyway but so I think

1197
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:57,109
and so the I asked you a bit like two

1198
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:59,840
minutes left

1199
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:01,490
yeah if you hit me up later if you think

1200
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,360
there was too much snark I really want

1201
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:03,830
to know that because we're actually

1202
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,600
working on like how we're doing next

1203
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:06,799
year's report like right now so if you

1204
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,720
want to talk to me about like what you

1205
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,850
feel though the casual tone the report

1206
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,319
is will let me know that but I am now

1207
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:13,580
got two minutes for whatever remaining

1208
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,880
questions you might actually have from

1209
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:23,170
this one or any section in their report

1210
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:23,170
besides this one more stock ok back

1211
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:36,229
yes so there is a so the multi-state I

1212
00:37:34,939 --> 00:37:38,089
stack is probably one more like they

1213
00:37:36,229 --> 00:37:39,229
actually go across organizations so you

1214
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,179
can take a look at the model that they

1215
00:37:39,229 --> 00:37:42,769
have the advanced cyber security center

1216
00:37:41,179 --> 00:37:44,509
I'm no Jonathan you don't know if you're

1217
00:37:42,769 --> 00:37:45,979
doing stuff with those guys now John

1218
00:37:44,509 --> 00:37:47,839
forest from Liberty Mutual's you're like

1219
00:37:45,979 --> 00:37:49,189
the Liberty folks are a pretty major

1220
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:53,479
folks that I haven't started there with

1221
00:37:49,189 --> 00:37:55,699
my another the they are a cross industry

1222
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:58,098
group regional here to Massachusetts but

1223
00:37:55,699 --> 00:38:01,219
and and and Maine and New Hampshire and

1224
00:37:58,099 --> 00:38:02,329
Vermont probably it's mostly I think

1225
00:38:01,219 --> 00:38:03,499
it's mostly I never I think they got

1226
00:38:02,329 --> 00:38:05,869
something at your folks as a main folks

1227
00:38:03,499 --> 00:38:07,098
they actually are cross everything like

1228
00:38:05,869 --> 00:38:08,869
so they they aren't just aligned

1229
00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:10,489
vertically so they structuring they're

1230
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:12,650
doing anything stuff that they're doing

1231
00:38:10,489 --> 00:38:14,569
it's it's a really cool I sac model to

1232
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:15,979
go do that you've got folks like threat

1233
00:38:14,569 --> 00:38:17,299
stream and threat connect who are also

1234
00:38:15,979 --> 00:38:18,709
bridging some of these threat groups

1235
00:38:17,299 --> 00:38:20,989
together you can form you on on there as

1236
00:38:18,709 --> 00:38:22,549
well - I'm not proselytizing any one

1237
00:38:20,989 --> 00:38:24,049
particular place I'm not here to sell me

1238
00:38:22,549 --> 00:38:25,369
about anything I make not make Nothing

1239
00:38:24,049 --> 00:38:27,829
off of giving these names out but you

1240
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:29,059
can go find others like that too it's

1241
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:30,289
you know you can take a look at what we

1242
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:32,150
did in the report especially with the

1243
00:38:30,289 --> 00:38:33,499
the online wanted to see where you where

1244
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:34,669
you're in the che might be aligned to or

1245
00:38:33,499 --> 00:38:36,948
hit me up and I'll give you a special

1246
00:38:34,669 --> 00:38:38,328
thing if I can for it and basically you

1247
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:39,679
know that's one thing where it's really

1248
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:41,150
important for you to be sharing with the

1249
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:43,900
right people and as fast as you possibly

1250
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:43,900
can to

1251
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:51,350
we're talking about records almost

1252
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:54,480
Rupali is that that being sort of the

1253
00:38:51,350 --> 00:39:05,650
primary unit of measurement

1254
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:08,819
other kinds of things sure so so if you

1255
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:11,170
look at various community met the entire

1256
00:39:08,819 --> 00:39:13,058
enumeration set for what we do we try to

1257
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:14,619
require breaches with is there it's like

1258
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:16,180
literally every sin every detail we

1259
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:17,799
would like to record about an event is

1260
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:19,839
listed there what we know in the in the

1261
00:39:17,799 --> 00:39:21,249
form that would have and we we took

1262
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,599
about 300 of those so it's like

1263
00:39:21,249 --> 00:39:25,058
different kinds of threat actors source

1264
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:27,069
countries target systems like all sorts

1265
00:39:25,059 --> 00:39:29,140
anything you gain any technical way to

1266
00:39:27,069 --> 00:39:30,519
describe a breach and some of the

1267
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,930
records were actually not bad so studies

1268
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:33,308
so of these 200 we actually got a lot

1269
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:34,450
more detail than we usually get about

1270
00:39:33,309 --> 00:39:35,980
some of the other ones too because we

1271
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:37,720
got them from the cyber insurance logs

1272
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:39,279
which is great they actually they they

1273
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,240
care about data because they like

1274
00:39:39,279 --> 00:39:42,849
actually oh it's not that's great

1275
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,169
working with those guys and even with

1276
00:39:42,849 --> 00:39:45,400
that technically so these were pretty

1277
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:47,619
filled in records from across these

1278
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,210
enumerations even when we factored this

1279
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:50,680
in and we tried to run the models in

1280
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:52,720
different ways and do some stuff they

1281
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:55,058
actually didn't move the needle like

1282
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,578
those those basically those were baked

1283
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:59,829
into something related to the breach but

1284
00:39:57,579 --> 00:40:01,239
again about fifty percent is still

1285
00:39:59,829 --> 00:40:03,130
unknown and you can see how that goes

1286
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:04,720
out as the fan big large and larger in

1287
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:08,279
that several by comma several pots the

1288
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:10,839
the the distributions art that you saw

1289
00:40:08,279 --> 00:40:12,400
that's that's huge right we have with

1290
00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:14,710
there's 50 percent of things that are

1291
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,690
unknown besides records about a breach

1292
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:18,099
that may relate to organizational

1293
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:19,690
culture that may be that may relate to

1294
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:21,759
how an org is structured that may relate

1295
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:23,650
to how it work processes like other

1296
00:40:21,759 --> 00:40:26,019
stuff that were that is not related to

1297
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:28,989
the actual details of the breach itself

1298
00:40:26,019 --> 00:40:30,069
and that's actually scary it's also kind

1299
00:40:28,989 --> 00:40:31,480
of exciting if we could get that

1300
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:32,739
information and the insurance companies

1301
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,519
really eager to get that to right now

1302
00:40:32,739 --> 00:40:35,829
they're trying to figure out what to

1303
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:37,930
help us figure out what that is if we

1304
00:40:35,829 --> 00:40:39,489
could do that like it like and it and

1305
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:41,499
that's why I say roof leak is like we

1306
00:40:39,489 --> 00:40:43,869
were hoping that we had like something

1307
00:40:41,499 --> 00:40:45,459
about records and like no we still just

1308
00:40:43,869 --> 00:40:47,619
plug records in you gets I'm not on the

1309
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:49,539
flip side if we want to live with some

1310
00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:51,430
like like wide-ranging confidence

1311
00:40:49,539 --> 00:40:53,230
intervals for your estimates you've not

1312
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:54,399
got a good range to us are working from

1313
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:55,509
when you go back to your organization's

1314
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,799
and you can start having world

1315
00:40:55,509 --> 00:40:58,269
discussions at like

1316
00:40:56,799 --> 00:40:59,710
you know the finance table about things

1317
00:40:58,269 --> 00:41:00,259
and how you should be protecting things

1318
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:01,490
and the best thing

1319
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:04,280
things that you couldn't do before with

1320
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:05,479
multiplication like literally like we

1321
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,250
have this things like division and

1322
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,600
multiplication art models like they are

1323
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,040
involved in models but they themselves

1324
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,180
on our four-legged models you now has

1325
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,830
something that gives you far better than

1326
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:14,660
that and if you want to give me a record

1327
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:16,250
cat and like I will give you the actual

1328
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,480
you know range if you want that or plot

1329
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,830
a chart for you or whatever like we just

1330
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,480
did this for a soccer everything up here

1331
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:21,560
if you want the coarser stuff we'll do

1332
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:31,970
that when we're glad to give you more

1333
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:33,890
data if you want more data um so yeah

1334
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:35,299
actually so that the report actually

1335
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:37,220
when we did this year especially for the

1336
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:40,040
the breach stuff in in the rest of the

1337
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:41,569
report we actually covered that and we

1338
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,490
actually talked about the shifts over

1339
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:45,110
time for for a bunch of things so I

1340
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:47,779
would actually for and I'm not actually

1341
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:49,010
um is I'm not I'm not just saying go

1342
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:51,260
read just to go read though I'm also

1343
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:53,450
saying you could leave a minute like so

1344
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:54,650
like in the point in yeah I know that

1345
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:55,850
like not many of us I could run point of

1346
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:57,110
sale environment but if you run a point

1347
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:58,520
of sale environment read that section

1348
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:00,470
cuz we cover the history of it what

1349
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,730
happened there really really well what I

1350
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:04,459
will tell you is that we have seen a

1351
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:06,950
huge shift into what people are doing

1352
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:09,080
with the use of fishing there's a huge

1353
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:09,649
deck that a huge diminish in the use of

1354
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,060
keyloggers

1355
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:12,710
so like the hold the other holding like

1356
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:14,990
area of digging and everyone's basically

1357
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:16,490
saying I don't need maybe when I could

1358
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:19,399
tell you the shift over time has been I

1359
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:21,470
don't need to be a super smart technical

1360
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,940
criminal anymore you're people are

1361
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:24,439
falling for stuff because you're not

1362
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:26,180
treating them well and you're not the

1363
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:28,010
culture your culture sucks and you don't

1364
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:29,359
rate awareness program you know other

1365
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:31,430
right technical control is a place to do

1366
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:33,530
what you're gonna do so I'm gonna go I'm

1367
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:35,149
gonna fish you or one of the people that

1368
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:36,770
you do business with I'm gonna I'm

1369
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:37,940
definitely gonna get in I just told you

1370
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:39,950
you're almost guaranteed to get out of

1371
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:41,240
these places you're probably running

1372
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:43,220
something that I'm gonna get by with

1373
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,899
really trivial malware and once I'm on

1374
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:46,279
there I can pretty much do or want to do

1375
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,300
with legitimate credentials because

1376
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,470
you're not monitoring validity

1377
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,520
democratically is because you're also

1378
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:51,500
not smart enough to use two-factor

1379
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,060
authentication on your partner like

1380
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,650
literally that was the story of the DB

1381
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:56,299
era this year like we didn't come out

1382
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:58,730
and say it that abruptly in the DB IR

1383
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:00,829
but literally that was the actual story

1384
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:03,200
for so many things

1385
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:04,519
vir and literally if you just patched

1386
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,439
your perimeter stuff you would have

1387
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:08,749
gotten 25% of things that happen less

1388
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:10,789
your wouldn't happen if you did to

1389
00:43:08,749 --> 00:43:13,729
factor 25% of the things last year

1390
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:16,009
wouldn't happen like Syria like this is

1391
00:43:13,729 --> 00:43:18,169
no joke this is like you know and like I

1392
00:43:16,009 --> 00:43:19,519
hate quoting best practices because both

1393
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:21,469
of both of those two things are best

1394
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:22,999
practices but the reality is like that's

1395
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:24,229
all the simple things folks actually had

1396
00:43:22,999 --> 00:43:26,180
to do and I know it's not simple I

1397
00:43:24,229 --> 00:43:27,680
worked in an organ I know I know the the

1398
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:29,868
rocks and mountains you have to move to

1399
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:31,549
get this stuff to work but literally the

1400
00:43:29,869 --> 00:43:33,950
data is here now to go like you're gonna

1401
00:43:31,549 --> 00:43:35,479
be a victim guys you really are gonna be

1402
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:36,649
one because they're just arbitrarily

1403
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:38,269
going after the up this stuff

1404
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:39,859
opportunistically yes they target some

1405
00:43:38,269 --> 00:43:41,839
places obviously we're not talking about

1406
00:43:39,859 --> 00:43:42,589
those but for the majority people that

1407
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:44,779
are out there

1408
00:43:42,589 --> 00:43:46,819
clean up your houses and you're gonna

1409
00:43:44,779 --> 00:43:48,289
actually and this isn't a bear

1410
00:43:46,819 --> 00:43:50,420
conversation either because like at some

1411
00:43:48,289 --> 00:43:52,160
point when I've had this conversation

1412
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,959
with Wade and I actually have a Josh

1413
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,640
couple weeks ago like if we actually

1414
00:43:53,959 --> 00:43:57,140
clean up our houses here and we do a

1415
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:59,029
good job of getting the stuff and making

1416
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:00,979
them have to go more technical maybe

1417
00:43:59,029 --> 00:44:02,239
even having them go to mobile like we

1418
00:44:00,979 --> 00:44:04,038
have just raised the stakes in this

1419
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:05,420
cyber like I'm not gonna use the word

1420
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:06,349
war because you just had a panel think

1421
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:08,449
about that here and I don't wanna talk

1422
00:44:06,349 --> 00:44:09,559
about that but we just raised the stakes

1423
00:44:08,449 --> 00:44:11,359
in this whole battle that we're facing

1424
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:12,829
right like we are basically escalating

1425
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,999
warfare so like right now be a little

1426
00:44:12,829 --> 00:44:14,859
thankful that there's a lot of people

1427
00:44:13,999 --> 00:44:17,390
that haven't cleaned up their acts

1428
00:44:14,859 --> 00:44:18,589
because honestly the ones that are

1429
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:19,609
you're gonna do better because there's

1430
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:21,410
no gonna keep going after the easy

1431
00:44:19,609 --> 00:44:22,759
targets the more we get cleaned up this

1432
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:24,890
escalates to a point where we're not

1433
00:44:22,759 --> 00:44:26,359
ready to handle yet anyway but at least

1434
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:27,558
for me I for probably five years away

1435
00:44:26,359 --> 00:44:29,328
from anyways let's write not too big of

1436
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:30,979
a deal for everybody here but the

1437
00:44:29,329 --> 00:44:33,079
reality is is that really basic stuff

1438
00:44:30,979 --> 00:44:35,118
that the criminals have found the way to

1439
00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:36,499
do things that's working it's like doing

1440
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,269
right almost like half the year gone

1441
00:44:36,499 --> 00:44:40,218
it's working great for them this year so

1442
00:44:38,269 --> 00:44:42,468
far - so we haven't changed a whole lot

1443
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:43,519
since last year anyway so maybe after

1444
00:44:42,469 --> 00:44:44,599
the reports out as more people go

1445
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:45,828
through it and read it you might get

1446
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:47,269
more someone so you have more people

1447
00:44:45,829 --> 00:44:48,589
change in their ways but we're still

1448
00:44:47,269 --> 00:44:50,359
gonna probably see that as a big thing

1449
00:44:48,589 --> 00:44:51,739
next year at least that's what we're

1450
00:44:50,359 --> 00:44:54,140
saying at least we're trying to get

1451
00:44:51,739 --> 00:44:55,549
mid-year data we may not really we may

1452
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:56,900
not release a mid-year report but we're

1453
00:44:55,549 --> 00:44:59,119
trying to get a mid-year view of this

1454
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:00,499
that we may tease some information out

1455
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:02,059
and if you ask me nicely on Twitter I

1456
00:45:00,499 --> 00:45:02,839
may you know give you an off-the-record

1457
00:45:02,059 --> 00:45:06,340
comment about

1458
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:11,210
than in July oh he's not framed so

1459
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:17,420
anything else oh thank you very much one

1460
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:21,170
more oh yeah so didn't visit dessert

1461
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:22,310
actually this is a good cause every year

1462
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:24,350
how many people know we have a puzzle on

1463
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:25,940
there that's easy are we here okay so

1464
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:27,710
every year for those of you don't we

1465
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:29,840
actually encode a puzzle into the Dvir

1466
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:31,490
nor in the past few years it's been on

1467
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:33,260
the back page and printed in the same

1468
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:34,939
color text as the back pages which is

1469
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:36,410
usually black so was it fun

1470
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:38,180
it wasn't really that hard to go get it

1471
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:39,710
last year and the previous year's yeah

1472
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:40,790
duck should do some basic decoding and

1473
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:42,170
then we take you on a wild goose chase

1474
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:47,330
throughout the internet to kind of go do

1475
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:48,860
some things this year this year and yes

1476
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:50,090
I actually didn't put the one up here so

1477
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:51,010
you can't really see it but on the back

1478
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:53,300
cover

1479
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:56,090
there's no printed copies of the DBR

1480
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:57,440
this year we went really cheap but on

1481
00:45:56,090 --> 00:46:00,170
the back cover there's actually a little

1482
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,870
mini waveforms really tiny waveforms

1483
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:05,090
that were actually encoded into each of

1484
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:07,009
the different panels inside here it's a

1485
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:10,700
different stream and you actually this

1486
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:12,290
year had to decode them from the ups and

1487
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:14,029
downs into zeros and ones

1488
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:15,830
you then had to explore them all the way

1489
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:18,500
down and then you had to ASCII decode

1490
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:19,850
them across to get to a bitly link which

1491
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,440
then sent you another wild goose chase

1492
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:25,220
off the United including gopher servers

1493
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:28,270
actually this year it's really kind of

1494
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:28,270
funny awesome

1495
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:38,460
[Music]

1496
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:41,040
so actually I wish I could tell you that

1497
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:42,270
so it turned like like we can probably

1498
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,830
talk to you about the formal records

1499
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:45,480
perspective but that's kind of hokey

1500
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:48,120
because you know an f-15 Strike Fighter

1501
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:51,390
versus you know a couple hundred pans I

1502
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:53,130
don't care about those um the so and we

1503
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:54,450
don't get really good lost data so the

1504
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:56,340
velocity that we have is actually from

1505
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:57,660
the insurance companies so just using

1506
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:58,860
them as a trend is bad because not

1507
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:01,020
everybody has cyber insurance as well

1508
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:03,120
too so we're still in a bad position to

1509
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:05,730
talk about actual cost every breach over

1510
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,779
time port for those kind of things we'd

1511
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:08,400
love to do that but it's not

1512
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:09,660
statistically sound to do that and we

1513
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:16,770
try not to do things that are not

1514
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:18,569
statistically sound anybody else yep mr.

1515
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:23,690
Whitman

1516
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:23,690
oh gosh yes mr. Whitman

1517
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:48,049
yeah actually that's a really great

1518
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:49,129
question so there's other questions I

1519
00:47:48,049 --> 00:47:50,630
know we're running over on I want to

1520
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:52,579
that I want to transcend the actual

1521
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:53,630
anakena because it's gonna be all you

1522
00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:54,289
guys really need a good was being

1523
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:56,089
awesome actually

1524
00:47:54,289 --> 00:47:57,529
I know I I'm part of the organizer so I

1525
00:47:56,089 --> 00:47:59,269
know it's in it do you guys need to go I

1526
00:47:57,529 --> 00:48:01,970
don't really get excited about that but

1527
00:47:59,269 --> 00:48:03,890
it's not Chloe it sort of it so two

1528
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:07,009
things with that so yet we are working

1529
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:09,140
on a data collection platform with

1530
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:11,089
multiple partners including us including

1531
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:13,069
ourselves to enable people to be

1532
00:48:11,089 --> 00:48:14,808
recording these things in in a more

1533
00:48:13,069 --> 00:48:16,430
frequent way so that's the first thing

1534
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:18,470
is key is getting the data from people

1535
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:21,200
so we need that like that's something we

1536
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:22,640
need first of all we are actually at

1537
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,720
least trying to get a mid-year version

1538
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,098
of it so that we can actually update

1539
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,959
these things and the third thing which

1540
00:48:25,099 --> 00:48:28,819
basically is tied to that but I

1541
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,869
mentioned it earlier is the way Jay and

1542
00:48:28,819 --> 00:48:31,609
I've been talking about it is there are

1543
00:48:29,869 --> 00:48:32,960
enough course stats now especially with

1544
00:48:31,609 --> 00:48:34,759
the the stuff that we've done over the

1545
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,349
past couple years that we can actually

1546
00:48:34,759 --> 00:48:39,559
start developing what we would kind of

1547
00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:41,029
call the Beige Book of reaches and have

1548
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:43,009
that be the thing that you you know it's

1549
00:48:41,029 --> 00:48:44,329
a Facebook is not a great read guys if

1550
00:48:43,009 --> 00:48:46,309
you ever seen the Facebook from from the

1551
00:48:44,329 --> 00:48:47,809
government it ain't great it's a really

1552
00:48:46,309 --> 00:48:48,650
boring read unless you're actually into

1553
00:48:47,809 --> 00:48:49,759
that stuff that need to know the

1554
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:52,069
information then it's really awesome

1555
00:48:49,759 --> 00:48:53,960
thing so if we can produce that on a

1556
00:48:52,069 --> 00:48:56,058
more regular basis and have that release

1557
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:57,799
and court least quarterly if not do more

1558
00:48:56,059 --> 00:49:00,049
that can then be the thing that gets

1559
00:48:57,799 --> 00:49:01,309
tracked over time as we find a note and

1560
00:49:00,049 --> 00:49:02,839
then we didn't notice the things coming

1561
00:49:01,309 --> 00:49:03,859
in from there to say yeah that's a

1562
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:05,450
really great question then yeah we're

1563
00:49:03,859 --> 00:49:06,680
really trying to do that it's just a

1564
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:10,249
data collection they're really really

1565
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:12,140
hard as you kind of well know from the

1566
00:49:10,249 --> 00:49:15,160
stuff that you do and your that this is

1567
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:18,319
your scales with a bigger than our Sun

1568
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:20,920
anything else thank you for your time in

1569
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:20,920
your net interaction

1570
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:34,900
all right so okay well heading to let me

1571
00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:34,900
see Empire ballroom first floor
