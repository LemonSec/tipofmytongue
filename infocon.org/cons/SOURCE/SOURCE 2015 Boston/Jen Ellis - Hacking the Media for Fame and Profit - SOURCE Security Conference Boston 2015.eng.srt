1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,089
and put into that so without further ado

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,209
Jen Ellis and her mystery guest will

3
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:16,920
make you better

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:19,740
no clapping they were wondering how much

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,119
I paid you to sit Thank You Josh thank

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:27,119
you very much can you guys actually give

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,509
me I don't know if I'm like you can you

8
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,230
hear me

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,669
good perfect all right so yes as Josh

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:39,540
mentioned I'm gonna have a special guest

11
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:42,089
with me a real-life reporter the agenda

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:46,350
is since this is hacking the media so

13
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:48,719
timing profit the agenda is hackery type

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,070
things so we're gonna talk a little bit

15
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,320
about how you get a foot in the door

16
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,379
infiltration about once you're there

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,039
what you do exploitation and then we're

18
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:01,710
going to talk about how you continue

19
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,960
afterwards to basically create more

20
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,519
opportunity for yourself and then if

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,210
there's time we're getting some Q&A and

22
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:12,119
maybe some practice why am I doing this

23
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:16,979
so as Josh just mentioned one of the

24
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:19,380
things that I sort of believe in a in a

25
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:22,740
very cool way and as just mentioned I'm

26
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:26,119
not at all technical but I work with a

27
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:29,310
lot of really great researchers and I

28
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:30,780
think that this the stuff that we do all

29
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,390
day the stuff that we talk about the

30
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,850
security stuff is really important I

31
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,189
think it's important in a bigger sense

32
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:41,759
than just our ability to sell things to

33
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:44,880
each other and I actually think that you

34
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,040
know we're at the forefront of emerging

35
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,479
threats that affect people's safety in

36
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,899
their lives in a meaningful way that

37
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,869
they don't fully understand and for us

38
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,939
to be able to make a difference we need

39
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:58,229
to not only have the deep sort of

40
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:00,419
technical understanding that many of you

41
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,770
have we need to be able to break that

42
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,119
down in a way that it's simple and

43
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,399
meaningful and impactful to other people

44
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,380
and this is something that is a real

45
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:10,860
challenge for a lot of people to do it's

46
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,950
not straightforward to translate and so

47
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:21,260
that's why I do this

48
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:21,260
so I'm gonna invite pool up hi everybody

49
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:29,880
he's the editor yeah come on clap my

50
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:34,250
name is Paul my name is Paul I'm a

51
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,250
reporter but a reporter for 12 hi Paul

52
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:38,700
yeah he's the editor of security ledger

53
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,319
and he contributes Christian silence a

54
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,230
pasta how long have you been at security

55
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:46,380
like that I've been as I picked up the

56
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:53,100
security beat in 2000 and September of

57
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:54,329
2002 okay so my background real quick is

58
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,700
that I'm the head of communications at

59
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,860

60
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,470
that works on the cavalry as just

61
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,940
mentioned I work with security

62
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,209
researchers across the industry not just

63
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,380
a rapid7 because of meadowsweet

64
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:09,510
there is a sort of running joke among

65
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,650
some of the security press but I am the

66
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,590
PR person for the entire security

67
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:16,859
industry which is not true they don't

68
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:19,530
pay me enough of that okay so we'll get

69
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:20,790
started so when you are launching your

70
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,910
attack and by the way there's gonna be a

71
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:26,420
lot of like pseudo security language in

72
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:28,650
here don't judge me I'm not a security

73
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:33,410
okay so when you're when you're mounting

74
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:38,190
your attack the important thing to do is

75
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:40,380
to begin with the connivance you need to

76
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,760
know your target so oh and by the way

77
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,620

if you're interested in getting involved

104
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,849
in talking to media and when you think

105
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,530
about how to approach them you want to

106
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:05,240
do your recon in the way that you would

107
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,739
when you think about anything else that

108
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,500
you're about to undertake you want

109
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,600
understand you know how who's their

110
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,010
readership what's their title like how

111
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,350
technical are they going to be how long

112
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:17,450
have they covered security what kind of

113
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:19,610
areas of security do they cover like do

114
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,469
they have a pro privacy fan do they not

115
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:24,500
like what are the things that make them

116
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:26,450
unique as a reporter covering this place

117
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,990
that you're gonna be able to tap into to

118
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:31,760
make them most interested in you so with

119
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,560
that said we're gonna do a little bit of

120
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:37,039
a what's it like to be a security

121
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,900
reporter and I have a tame one right

122
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,520
here so can also pull a bunch of

123
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,789
questions about what his average day is

124
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,979
like just to give you a sense of it so

125
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:48,530
hi Paul hi how are you how do you like

126
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:50,430
being interviewed I'm okay being

127
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:56,369
interviewed

128
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:59,470
okay so approximately how many emails

129
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:04,150
you mean just pitches or just in general

130
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:06,550
yeah I mean I probably get around 400

131
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,989
emails a day and of the what percentage

132
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:13,840
of pages press releases exaggerated

133
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:17,080
cetera you know pitches there's got to

134
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,119
be over 150 I mean you know either pitch

135
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,370
or pitch related kind of pre pitch like

136
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,960
would you be interested in or here's an

137
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:28,060
expert that we have I mean a lot of them

138
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:30,909
are not specific to me absolutely right

139
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,890
so PR agencies and in-house PR have been

140
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:35,680
very good about picking up on news

141
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:38,289
stories you know hooking in an expert

142
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,640
that's which is useful to me I I use

143
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,830
those I take those and put them in an

144
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,330
experts folder on occasionally I delve

145
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:46,479
into that folder if I do need to talk to

146
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:54,700
me so of your 400 emails how many do you

147
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:57,520
realistically read I like read read read

148
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:59,800
read the better question is how many do

149
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:05,620
I not delete just out of hand I mean I

150
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:07,540
probably delete 300 or 250 of them just

151
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:11,620
right off okay like read the subject

152
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:13,720
line and just like no and then so that

153
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:16,960
leaves about 150 that I actually go

154
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,360
through some of those might be you know

155
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,989
automated alerts that I'm using for idea

156
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,330
generation and some of those might be

157
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:26,620
you know do you want a briefing are you

158
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,000
interested in this topic would you bench

159
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,070
it in story like this I have my own

160
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,960
publication so we would you been shin

161
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,340
the you know thought leadership or

162
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,130
contributed piece so some of its

163
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:38,260
satisfying and we just buy emails but

164
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:40,030
how many like cool of a similar kind

165
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:42,550
would you get not that many phone calls

166
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:47,049
not that many phone calls that those

167
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:49,660
days are gone yeah it's more it's almost

168
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,550
all email not as much social media and

169
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,840
not as much like picking up the phone

170
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:54,490
and calling me so the first thing that

171
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,739
you guys just learn is if you want to

172
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:59,500
get his attention call him yeah social

173
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,540
media yeah don't use an email it does

174
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,900
what I mean it can work I certainly

175
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:10,010
don't to start getting free

176
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:11,419
holiday but if if you need to I mean the

177
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:13,370
problem is with phone calling is it's

178
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,470
it's hard on its it's time-consuming on

179
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:17,900
your end as well but if you've got

180
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:20,570
something that you think is you know

181
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,820
worthy of my attention it could be

182
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,980
useful to actually try and talk to me by

183
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,960
phone and okay I do pick up my phone and

184
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:29,870
I do have conversations with people so

185
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,580
you get you get all of this in uh-huh

186
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:34,880
how many optical view actually Emmys

187
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:36,799
right today week whatever so my my

188
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,480
energies and attention so I'm a little

189
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:42,229
bit different than most of these people

190
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:44,720
except mr. Krebs in that I have my own

191
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:46,490
publication so I'm a one-person media

192
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,110
and events company in addition to being

193
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,580
a contributor for Christian Science

194
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,900
Monitor in addition to occasionally

195
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,340
writing for some of the other industry

196
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:57,290
publications IT world

197
00:08:52,340 --> 00:09:01,760
InfoWorld economist that you know II I

198
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:03,829
you and places like that so I am writing

199
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,600
every day whether I'm writing for

200
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:07,070
security Ledger and I try and do one to

201
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,800
two posts a day for security ledger

202
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:14,240
usually more one but I try and at least

203
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:16,099
do that and then I am blogging for some

204
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,260
of my underwriters like Digital Guardian

205
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,150
so some of my stuff goes there and then

206
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,040
I'm doing one to two pieces a month for

207
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:26,300
for Christian Science Monitor so at a

208
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:29,300
minimum I'm doing let's say a minimum

209
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:34,250
I'm doing six blog posts a week or

210
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:37,520
articles a week and then one or two or

211
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:40,310
more feature stories so it's a little so

212
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,680
when I started I was a beat reporter for

213
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:45,560
IDG News Service which many of you know

214
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,660
it's just a company-wide news service

215
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:50,569
for IDG it's kind of like a news wire

216
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:53,689
and they populate most of the IDG sites

217
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:56,360
like info world and CIO and CSO and

218
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:59,060
Network world and PC world with most of

219
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,920
their most of their news coverage most

220
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,119
of the sort of low-level tech coverage

221
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,949
is coming out of the news service

222
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,440
they've got reporters in bureaus all

223
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:08,510
over the world and so I was there

224
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,160
security beat reporter so then I was

225
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,850
doing probably two to three stories a

226
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,910
day right

227
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:18,269
anywhere from 400 to you know seven or

228
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:23,459
800 but this group here yeah

229
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:25,350
who's doing that probably right yeah

230
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:28,680
that's probably true out and about Dan

231
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:33,149
Dan writes a lot but they tend to be

232
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:35,489
longer at ARS technica Steve writes a

233
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:39,209
fair amount to so it's but it yeah I

234
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:42,089
write a lot Ames write one the most yeah

235
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:45,899
so the numbers again you're looking at

236
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:47,610
like 400 emails down 250 to get one

237
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:48,630
article and how much fun does that last

238
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,120
collide here actually comes from an

239
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:53,040
email pretty rarely I mean I've been

240
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:57,959
covering to be for like you know 13

241
00:10:53,040 --> 00:11:00,240
years so I you know I see I see stories

242
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:02,880
or I find stories that are interesting

243
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,949
to me and when you've been doing it this

244
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,269
long it's it's like the end of the

245
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:07,800
matrix where you start to see the ones

246
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:09,540
in the zeros you know you start to see

247
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,008
the good stories kind of popping out of

248
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,589
the matrix and being like oh that's

249
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:15,360
that's new where that's different and

250
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,620
when I was younger it was more like oh

251
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,149
you gotta write this or you gotta write

252
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,529
that or we have to respond and also you

253
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:21,000
might have pressure I don't have any

254
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:22,730
editor so you have pressure for Meadors

255
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,279
to be like we need a version of this

256
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:27,959
second day take or get us get that story

257
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:29,519
up on our site too because we're not

258
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:31,138
gonna just repost it from the same

259
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,029
website so of course this is a more

260
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:39,480
likely to be things like Twitter or the

261
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:41,579
wires ap yeah news groups Twitter you

262
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,160
know yeah some site that I'm covering

263
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:46,079
and see sort of an interesting me too or

264
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,019
second day take on so those could all be

265
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,790
sources of him or just talk doing an

266
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:52,860
interview with somebody often on an

267
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,089
unrelated topic and another idea comes

268
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,180
out of that so there's a certain amount

269
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:58,410
of serendipity involved I you know I

270
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,329
would say in the news industry there's a

271
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:04,800
real there's a real divide right now

272
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:07,729
between the traffic based sites and the

273
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:12,269
audience based sites and I think you see

274
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:13,589
a lot of websites whose business model

275
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:17,699
is solely really around display

276
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:22,980
advertising that WOD just max max

277
00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:24,439
pageviews max hits and so they'll do

278
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:28,400
listicles and they'll do

279
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:32,060
really quick hit pieces sensationalized

280
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:33,590
headlines and and then there are sites

281
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,540
that are maybe more trying to cultivate

282
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:37,580
an audience and they're gonna hopefully

283
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:44,630
do a little bit better job a little bit

284
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:48,590
more original reporting their most

285
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:51,770
important a bit so the whole point of

286
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:54,620
that was that you if you want to talk to

287
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:57,079
press have a lot of competition and to

288
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:59,090
make yourself interesting you have to

289
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,470
about what you're doing and how you're

290
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:04,370
doing it you have to like to put your

291
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:08,020
time and effort in please so planning

292
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:10,880
your attack there are two basic types of

293
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:12,920
meteor outreach there is the active

294
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,140
which is where you proactively have

295
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:18,560
something that you want to share for

296
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:19,819
people who work for a vendor this is

297
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,500
often the kind of stuff that they're

298
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,370
focused on it's their vendor news that

299
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,560
they're trying to get out there

300
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:26,300
somewhere so you know core part of my

301
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,949
job a rapid7 is to try and get people to

302
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:33,800
be interested in our specific news and

303
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:35,480
then the other side is reactive so

304
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:39,109
that's there's a breaking story like

305
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:41,080
today there's a story about a an Indian

306
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:44,060
social media company that's been hacked

307
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,440
and so you see the story break like I

308
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:48,170
saw that story on Twitter this morning

309
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,750
at 7 sent it to a PR team and they put

310
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:52,069
out a comment so that if somebody like

311
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,810
Poole has seen that story and is

312
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:55,070
planning on writing we go to the

313
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:57,050
reporters we think are most likely to

314
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,040
write about it and we offer them some

315
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:01,760
sort of commentary on it

316
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:04,760
to include in their piece because when a

317
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,890
reporter is writing an article they

318
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:09,770
can't have the whole thing just be their

319
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:11,420
words they need to have it be from other

320
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:13,460
people and that doesn't mean that they

321
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:15,620
need something super controversial or

322
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,760
earth-shattering but they need to be

323
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,010
able to explain the story in the

324
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,620
simplest terms and the biggest impact

325
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:23,689
for readers with other people like third

326
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:25,970
parties who have credibility in the face

327
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:27,710
to talk about it so those are the two

328
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,270
different types of outreach you're gonna

329
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,560
do and you have to think about them

330
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:32,660
completely differently if you're doing

331
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,189
the reactive side you have a very small

332
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:37,110
window in which to engage

333
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:38,700
your average reporter will look at the

334
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,800
new stories first thing in the morning

335
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,270
they'll have decided by about 9:00 or

336
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,650
10:00 a.m. what their story is gonna be

337
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:47,970
and they'll aim to have it written and

338
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:49,439
filed by news so if you are looking at

339
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,790
it in the afternoon don't bother

340
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,550
like you've totally missed your window

341
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,689
for that if you want to get in you have

342
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:56,329
to try and get in before 10:00 a.m.

343
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:58,800
basically is where you're looking at

344
00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:01,050
whereas if you are looking at pitching

345
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,849
your own news the way to do it is to

346
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:04,949
build in a much longer timeline for

347
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,510
yourself you want to try and give your

348
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:08,670
core press for people that you really

349
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:10,710
really really want to cover it you want

350
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:14,130
to give them a heads up in advance press

351
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:16,410
to focus in the security space will

352
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:18,750
respect an embargo if you go to them and

353
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:20,219
you say clearly we have an announcement

354
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,600
coming up we would like to work with you

355
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,650
on this would you be interested in

356
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,660
hearing about it in advance under

357
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:26,910
embargo they will agree to it

358
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,439
you did say don't want to burn their

359
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:31,110
bridges they want to get exclusive looks

360
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,430
at you so they will agree treat it with

361
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,529
caution and make sure that you say it

362
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:37,109
clearly but you can totally do this so

363
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:39,630
build in the time if it's your news at

364
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:43,830
the same time though be clear on what's

365
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:45,600
newsworthy if you are writing about some

366
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:47,430
new widget in your products the chances

367
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,800
are the press is not going to care about

368
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:52,109
it almost none of the security press

369
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,540
writes about product in detail unless

370
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:56,460
you happen to be an absolutely enormous

371
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,810
company or they're writing something

372
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:00,180
negative in news really don't want to

373
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:02,819
get into that stream so be clear that

374
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,930
like your widget release and this is

375
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,390
this is something I have to tell my own

376
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:07,469
product team on a regular basis actually

377
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:10,230
my product seems quite well trained now

378
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:16,740
for not a regulator but they understand

379
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:19,709
that when we were not coverage for it

380
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:21,930
I'm not actually going because if I kept

381
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:22,699
stuff like that he would stop answering

382
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:25,550
my emails

383
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:29,069
pretty much

384
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:33,599
so now that you understand who you're

385
00:16:29,069 --> 00:16:36,149
and you know what kind of approach

386
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,980
you're making it's time for you to cross

387
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:40,199
the perfect fish and at the end of a

388
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,389
this is social engineering you are

389
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:44,699
trying to effectively trick the press

390
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:47,069
and taking action you want to say be

391
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:48,959
clear though they're doing the same to

392
00:16:47,069 --> 00:16:51,839
you like once you hook them with your

393
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,638
fish the tables are gonna turn they are

394
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,439
going to be full-on trying to push the

395
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:59,040
engineer you will get to that later

396
00:16:55,439 --> 00:17:00,870
so you're building your story you think

397
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,629
about how do you make it as relevant as

398
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:05,880
possible what's the real significance so

399
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:09,120
for example when one of my researchers

400
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,400
comes to me and says I found these

401
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:14,579
vulnerabilities in serial servers and

402
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,860
they're terrible I think wow that sounds

403
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:17,549
super boring I have no idea what you're

404
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:19,708
talking about

405
00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:21,150
so I tell him like hey give me some

406
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:22,319
examples of how this can actually have

407
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:24,659
an impact and then he comes back to me

408
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,649
and he's like well he I don't know

409
00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:26,669
there's this thing that you can do with

410
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,110
the train where you might be able to

411
00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:29,010
derail it and like I don't know it looks

412
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:31,260
like I can blow up some of the Church of

413
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:33,360
England okay well that sounds quite

414
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:35,700
interesting now why didn't you lead with

415
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:40,439
that so you need to think about now the

416
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:42,150
same time those examples buddy thud does

417
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,760
everyone know what butters parents up

418
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:48,480
speed up okay you need to balance your

419
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:50,520
fudge with your so what you always need

420
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,630
to provide us so much but provide us so

421
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,879
what that's realistic

422
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:55,110
you know realistically HD is not gonna

423
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,610
go and blow up churches in England I

424
00:17:55,110 --> 00:18:01,289
hope I don't know what's good against

425
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:04,350
England he's and he's probably not gonna

426
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:05,940
derail a train either so we want to like

427
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,350
talk about those in caps terms as to

428
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,740
like why it's super hard to do that and

429
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:13,020
why that's not really realistic attack

430
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:18,210
vector but we also want to provide the

431
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:19,620
examples so that when Paul is looking he

432
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:23,520
instantly gets why this is gonna be

433
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:25,709
interesting to his readers the third

434
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,570
piece of course is like accuracy is

435
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:29,970
paramount accuracy on a feed

436
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,928
transparency don't try and fudge don't

437
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:33,299
try and lied

438
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:36,740
don't try and misrepresent be very clear

439
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:36,740
on your information before you go in

440
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:44,559
[Music]

441
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:46,658
so once again to recap you need to have

442
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,129
a clear idea on what your role is and

443
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:50,830
what the reporters role is and how the

444
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:53,020
whole story goes together you need to be

445
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,580
timely and understand what the timelines

446
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,770
are going to look like for a bit you

447
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:59,199
need to be relevant and here's the one

448
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:00,789
that's really hard you need to avoid

449
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,860
jargon and industry insider knowledge

450
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:05,289
many of the reporters I showed you

451
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,668
people who work on security all the time

452
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:09,070
and they actually have really good

453
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:11,110
security knowledge but nonetheless

454
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:14,439
they're writing for people who like to

455
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:17,678
speak like human beings if you get

456
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,929
wrapped around the axis on specific

457
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,390
language you will never ever ever

458
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:24,190
succeed in communication because the

459
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:26,110
reality is that the key to communication

460
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,850
is to use the language that people who

461
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:31,510
you're trying to communicate with you

462
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:34,649
and you know I know it's a painful topic

463
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:38,140
for people but let's talk about cyber

464
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:41,380
it's a perfect example of how it's

465
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:44,679
really hard for people who deal with

466
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:47,200
technical accuracy all day to let go of

467
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:49,780
the need for specific accuracy and

468
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,330
language cyber is one of those things

469
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,799
where it kills all of us because we have

470
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:56,080
a totally different mental image when we

471
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:59,200
hear it to what other people hearing and

472
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,760
we just think it's kind of a name like

473
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,559
why can't people get what they're

474
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,020
talking about like it's silly but at the

475
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:08,080
same time it doesn't matter because the

476
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:10,570
reality is that our goal should be to

477
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,309
met as many people know about these

478
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:13,570
security issues as possible in a way

479
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:15,730
that is meaningful and impactful for

480
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:19,990
them if the language they choose to use

481
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:21,549
is language like cyber if they're using

482
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:23,919
the word hacker in a way you don't like

483
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:24,820
whatever whatever it is doesn't matter

484
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,559
get over it

485
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,549
it's like going to France and shouting

486
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,990
at people in English and not

487
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:29,530
understanding why they look at you like

488
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,390
you're an idiot

489
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:34,809
like that's basically what we do as an

490
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:37,480
industry day in day out we need to stop

491
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:39,370
speaking other people's language and I

492
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,610
just really want to make these two user

493
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:47,649
Bill Mary picture

494
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:51,129
okay so when you send your email in as

495
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:53,620
full third of his 400 emails a day he

496
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:55,840
deletes at least 250 of them just from

497
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:59,320
looking at the subject line that's your

498
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,030
tripping his alert so there are certain

499
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,760
words that will trigger alerts I put up

500
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:06,060
a selection here pull till I get some of

501
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,060
them right

502
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,960
ah

503
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:24,990
expert okay I'll swap hard without

504
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:26,790
breakfast okay so you want to just think

505
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:28,110
about like you know in as much as you

506
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:30,389
want to use the language that your

507
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:33,179
audience that his audience is gonna use

508
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:34,350
you also want to avoid and like this is

509
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:41,760
probably not something that many of you

510
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:45,060
in the room and and I they do all the

511
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:48,780
freaking time and this kind of language

512
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:50,310
layered on just is a complete and asked

513
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:53,399
Mercer reporters it like basically

514
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:56,040
creates a filter so okay now we've

515
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,930
figured out how to actually get a

516
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:01,710
briefing we're gonna talk about what you

517
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:03,450
do when you get a briefing so there are

518
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:05,280
basically two types of ways of briefing

519
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:06,660
a report sir one is verbally and the

520
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,120
other is in writing so I'll start with

521
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:12,180
in writing for those of you who have not

522
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:15,209
previously worked with media starting in

523
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:17,960
writing is a really good idea it gives

524
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:21,180
you the ability to get comfortable and

525
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,380
to have that chance to read through it a

526
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,240
couple of times and make sure that

527
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:27,300
you're happy with what you said it's

528
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,640
harder for a comment in a way that you

529
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:34,110
didn't anticipate it still can be but

530
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:35,310
it's what you and at the end of the day

531
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:38,850
it gives you that chance to edit

532
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:41,210
yourself before you send it out so this

533
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,209
is how you

534
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:48,770
a reference although generally I just

535
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:53,030
like to have an arginine in every single

536
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:55,280
slide set I do so generally speaking the

537
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:56,690
tricks for doing written comments are

538
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,330
very very simple

539
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:01,640
you want to take a stance but the status

540
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:03,470
does not have to be controversial you

541
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,180
just need to have our position and you

542
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:07,190
need to go into it clear with like what

543
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:08,660
do you want to be to the breath like do

544
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:10,520
you want to be that guy that comes into

545
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:12,650
cells whatever and Elsa saying do you

546
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,120
guy that talks about what the vendor did

547
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:17,060
wrong do you want to be the guy that

548
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,429
like really focuses on helping the the

549
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:21,169
end user that's impacted understand how

550
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:23,720
to protect themselves like have a clear

551
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:25,820
idea of who you want to be when you

552
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,680
write this stuff that will dictate what

553
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,970
your stance is gonna be do you want to

554
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,790
be the nice guy in the room the most

555
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:33,620
technical person like if so then your

556
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:37,970
response needs to be really focused on

557
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:39,530
finding what that technical knew on once

558
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:41,810
you've done that you want to think about

559
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:43,340
how it's gonna be used a reporter is

560
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:45,080
looking for something they can literally

561
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:48,439
copy and paste and drop into their

562
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:50,600
article so if you sent in 2,000 words of

563
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:53,420
your opinion on something they are not

564
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,429
going to read it again they write their

565
00:23:53,420 --> 00:24:00,890
article in a two-hour window in the

566
00:23:55,430 --> 00:24:02,360
morning they do not have times so you

567
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:04,820
want to think about what is a written

568
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,040
quote in an article look like it's

569
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:09,169
normally a couple of sentences that's

570
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,460
what you should be providing if you have

571
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:13,010
a couple of different points you want to

572
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:15,890
hit then provide a couple of different

573
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:19,360
paragraphs but keep it manageable at the

574
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:23,330
same time do not go the other way

575
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:25,550
monosyllabic is notable so if you are

576
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:27,350
having an email conversation even with a

577
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:29,570
reporter and they ask you a question if

578
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:31,370
you provide a one-word answer they are

579
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:33,080
not gonna be able to quote that so I

580
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:35,570
only ever do it if you're doing it for a

581
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,800
sec if you're doing it because you don't

582
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,990
want to be quoted on that question

583
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,280
that's fine if you're doing it like if

584
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:42,410
they ask you something in your answer is

585
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,970
basically like nope that's fine because

586
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:46,100
they're not probably gonna quote you on

587
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:47,450
it but if you want to see your answer

588
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,679
quoted you need to give them more than

589
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:51,560
one word or they're just not gonna be

590
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,820
able to use it and then my last point is

591
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,830
keep it authentic and this will be like

592
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,580
a recurring you'll hear me talk about is

593
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:58,860
authenticity is really important

594
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:01,230
you need to be you you need to be

595
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,699
comfortable otherwise you're never gonna

596
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,720
get good at this and reporters are never

597
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,700
really gonna want to work with you

598
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,809
because they're always gonna feel like I

599
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,490
don't really know where I stand with

600
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:09,870
this person and they're gonna feel like

601
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:11,519
if they quote you you could turn around

602
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:14,518
and be like I didn't say that

603
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:16,230
so you you need to like really be true

604
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:19,049
to yourself on this and sound like a

605
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:20,640
real person the reality is that nobody

606
00:25:19,049 --> 00:25:23,158
wants to read comment from people that

607
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,840
sound like what's on the tongue and you

608
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:26,580
know we one of the things that I'm lucky

609
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,889
is I work with some people who are

610
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:30,720
incredibly sardonic and very comfortable

611
00:25:28,889 --> 00:25:32,399
putting that into writing and that makes

612
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,779
a really good comment they sound like

613
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:35,100
real people people like to read that

614
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:39,870
comment it's like reading a register

615
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:42,750
article they like it okay so navigating

616
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:44,250
the environment my terrible attempt at

617
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,559
of security term for what to do when

618
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:48,149
you're actually doing a media briefing

619
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:49,620
so we're gonna go through some basic

620
00:25:48,149 --> 00:25:51,000
do's and don'ts and I apologize

621
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,709
typically I don't really like wordy

622
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,669
slides but the whole goal of this is

623
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:55,950
that anyone who wants to slides

624
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:59,669
afterwards can take them in those actual

625
00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:02,610
learnings here so my number one rule for

626
00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:05,309
anybody talking to press ever is be

627
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:07,979
honest if I work with the first person

628
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:10,320
who is intentionally dishonest I will

629
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:13,860
never let them breathe media again it is

630
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:16,740
a recipe for disaster and excuse

631
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:18,990
yourself so be honest the reality is

632
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:21,149
it's way too easy for you to get caught

633
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:23,220
out and you don't want to end up in a

634
00:26:21,149 --> 00:26:24,899
situation where there's speculation over

635
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,850
whether you told the truth on something

636
00:26:24,899 --> 00:26:29,610
it totally derailed the conversation

637
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:31,559
from being a core issue Josh and I have

638
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:32,610
talked about this a lot recently I think

639
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,690
everyone here is probably pretty

640
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:37,019
familiar with the chris roberts

641
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:38,610
situation so you know there's a really

642
00:26:37,019 --> 00:26:41,220
important conversation here to be had

643
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:43,260
about the safety of planes and instead

644
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:45,980
everybody's talking about whether he

645
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:49,379
really did what he said or what the FBI

646
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:52,159
like who cares the point is about the

647
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:55,669
safety of the point don't be dishonest

648
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,669
whether he was or not

649
00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:01,350
so know what your core message is going

650
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:04,980
into it this is something that people

651
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:07,049
forget to do and it's really really

652
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,210
really important it's the secret to a

653
00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:10,769
good briefing and it will make you feel

654
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,480
a little bit like you're that kid in

655
00:27:10,769 --> 00:27:14,909
class who tried too hard but it's

656
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,950
actually really important so you

657
00:27:14,909 --> 00:27:18,690
basically before you do the briefing

658
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:20,850
think about the story in your head and

659
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:22,470
think about what the one thing is that

660
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:23,998
you want to land well maybe it's the two

661
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:27,360
things or three things I wouldn't go

662
00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:29,639
about three three a highly unmanageable

663
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,059
number as it is so like have your core

664
00:27:29,639 --> 00:27:34,590
messages here's the other thing

665
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:38,399
repetition of your core messages is a

666
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:40,619
good thing if you keep banging one point

667
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:42,418
over and over again that's the point the

668
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:44,009
reporter is gonna walk away with so

669
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:45,389
repetition is a really good thing and

670
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:47,820
you'll actually hear me say use

671
00:27:45,389 --> 00:27:49,340
repetition plenty through this tool for

672
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:51,570
exactly the same reason there are

673
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:55,139
messages that I really want to plan with

674
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:59,820
you guys so I will keep using them did I

675
00:27:55,139 --> 00:28:02,449
mention be honest so know what your core

676
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:07,139
messages are and be prepared to all

677
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:08,519
messages on the language things we

678
00:28:07,139 --> 00:28:10,129
talked of a little bit or I thought

679
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:12,929
because you guys are open to that but um

680
00:28:10,129 --> 00:28:14,399
we talked a little bit about you know

681
00:28:12,929 --> 00:28:17,990
the language you use and making it

682
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:20,459
simple and avoiding like buzzword bingo

683
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:22,970
the best way that you can make things

684
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:25,100
relatable is to use analogies and

685
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:27,419
actually the press love analogies

686
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:30,389
particularly media that write for

687
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:31,860
non-technical titles if you're somebody

688
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:35,189
of the New York Times or The Wall Street

689
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:37,439
Journal their audience is not security

690
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:39,450
professionals so if they can have an

691
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,360
analogy that makes this really simple

692
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:45,389
and relatable and any this is really

693
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,889
visual is even better for them they want

694
00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:48,389
something that's gonna create that

695
00:28:46,889 --> 00:28:51,389
mental image for people that they go oh

696
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:53,869
okay get it you're you're basically

697
00:28:51,389 --> 00:28:55,830
thinking as if you're speaking

698
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:57,779
effectively from my mom and none of you

699
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:59,460
know how that's difficult but you just

700
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:03,629
need to like make it as relatable

701
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:05,429
possible so analogies good the other

702
00:29:03,629 --> 00:29:06,780
thing I would say is and this is a hard

703
00:29:05,429 --> 00:29:08,130
one to do in the moment

704
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:10,110
but it's something that you can work on

705
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:16,080
overtime is to focus on positive

706
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:18,540
statements it's very easy when you're

707
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,970
talking about things to get into saying

708
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:22,620
negative statements and particularly

709
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:24,030
security people often will have a

710
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,820
leaning towards that we are breakers

711
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:27,050
after all they say we I mean you

712
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:29,490
[Music]

713
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:30,990
but the reality is that when that comes

714
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:33,390
into print and it's in a different

715
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:36,330
context it looks different to you it

716
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:38,580
will sound totally different if you can

717
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:41,850
turn a statement around to focus on the

718
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:44,040
positive and sort of create white space

719
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:49,850
you know like a vacuum where the

720
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:49,850
negative comment is yeah sure

721
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:59,959
[Music]

722
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:10,669
- tiny examples and you can tell me

723
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:15,200
where I got it wrong

724
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:17,780
BMW had a hack in April and a lot of our

725
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,730
echo chamber started doing the fail wail

726
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:21,110
and all sorts of like mocking them for

727
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:23,000
mistakes

728
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:24,740
the cavalry talked about it briefly and

729
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,200
we decided that we would turn this into

730
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:30,680
a success story and show how their

731
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,510
response to the security finding was

732
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,070
embracing some of the benefits of three

733
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:35,390
or five stars and the five star

734
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,980
automotive cyber safety frame ring they

735
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:39,740
worked with researchers without suing

736
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:40,820
them which is one of them they did an

737
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,590
over-the-air update before their

738
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:45,169
customers even knew they were vulnerable

739
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:46,159
which is another one and in the process

740
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:49,430
of doing so they realized they were

741
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,600
passing updates in the clear so while we

742
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:53,180
could have been one of the voices

743
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:56,000
pointing a finger by amplifying the

744
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:58,400
things they did right we also had a road

745
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:04,970
sign for their competitors - maybe

746
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:08,630
emulate and the second one is more

747
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:12,770
debatable that United put out a bug

748
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:14,570
battery and they specifically excluded

749
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:16,730
the ability to test wireless systems on

750
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:19,220
the plane etc so a lot of people focused

751
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:23,800
on how incomplete the bug bounty was

752
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:26,120
which i think is fair very fair but and

753
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:28,280
we should be really psyched that

754
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:31,189
American aviation companies starting

755
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:33,080
their their growth towards third-party

756
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:36,200
collaboration so I'm not saying these

757
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,790
are all victories but we meet deliberate

758
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,100
choices in both of those cases to say

759
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:42,820
something they're doing right instead of

760
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,820
something they're doing wrong

761
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:50,629
okay so more dues so when you're

762
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:54,500
breathing somebody frequently these days

763
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:58,039
people will record briefings but in many

764
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:59,690
cases they're also taking notes you want

765
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:02,809
to pause and give people a chance to

766
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:04,990
catch up you also want to pause and give

767
00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:07,879
people a chance to ask questions and

768
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:10,340
it's also okay to say things like hey

769
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,870
does that make sense to make sure that

770
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:13,789
your message is actually landing are

771
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:16,129
they getting the key takeaway cuz

772
00:32:13,789 --> 00:32:17,600
otherwise they may seem like they're

773
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,799
getting it or they could've got she just

774
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,658
completely switched off and disengage

775
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,250
and you won't know it unless you're

776
00:32:20,659 --> 00:32:24,559
trying to like actually create some sort

777
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:26,419
of conversation with them be aware of

778
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:28,340
your body language this is one of the

779
00:32:26,419 --> 00:32:31,730
things that I sometimes have a habit of

780
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:33,230
doing is I will tell people something

781
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:35,360
and then I'll do come sort of widdle

782
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:38,299
shrug thing seem as if I'm like there

783
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,549
believe that if you will just be aware

784
00:32:38,299 --> 00:32:42,440
of it try not to you know undermine

785
00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:46,210
yourself don't roll your eyes with

786
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,210
people they generally don't like that

787
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:55,939
and then this is another classic is

788
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:57,500
conversations often will either meander

789
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:00,350
or they'll sort of rabbit hole or

790
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,730
sometimes a reporter will sort of get

791
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:04,399
really interesting something go off on a

792
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:07,340
tangent now there's a couple of things

793
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:09,200
to know here one is that sometimes

794
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:11,059
that's had she valuable like as Paul

795
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,350
mentioned earlier sometimes he has a

796
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:13,730
conversation with somebody on one topic

797
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:15,080
and something completely separate comes

798
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:18,470
up and it gives them an idea of repeat

799
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:20,389
so this can be valuable but in some

800
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:22,549
situations it's also an indication that

801
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:24,860
the reporter isn't written what you're

802
00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:26,900
saying and in that situation like you

803
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:30,729
want to know that that's the case and

804
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:33,770
you want to pull it okay what you do is

805
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:36,679
you basically go a level up in your

806
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:40,309
messaging make it simpler bring them

807
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:43,159
back to that point and then let them

808
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:48,408
drill down into the detail so you start

809
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:49,320
high let them go down okay so some

810
00:33:48,409 --> 00:33:50,460
don'ts now

811
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,530
[Music]

812
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,400
so don't get drawn into sensationalism

813
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,899
or speculation

814
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:58,490
unless that's really what you want to do

815
00:33:54,900 --> 00:34:07,400
in which case that's all you fair enough

816
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:07,400
get some which frankly like as we try to

817
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:14,280
make the world a safer place if you will

818
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:16,168
feeding the speculation and

819
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,659
sensationalism actually doesn't help our

820
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:21,600
case it does completely the opposite it

821
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:23,760
creates a crying wolf sensation and it

822
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:26,668
makes people just filter anything we

823
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:29,330
tell them don't be afraid of silence

824
00:34:26,668 --> 00:34:33,929
we're gonna get to this in a bit but is

825
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:36,870
a reporter's best friend will always try

826
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:38,130
and fill the silence look at me I've

827
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:39,270
just been talking nonstop for

828
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:43,260
possible--you minutes cuz you guys on

829
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:45,300
same thing so don't don't feel pressure

830
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:47,250
to answer questions but be aware like no

831
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:49,440
comment is a statement in its own right

832
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:50,960
and you don't want to create that

833
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,310
statement unless you're doing it very

834
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:57,410
intentionally so you know if somebody

835
00:34:53,310 --> 00:35:00,330
said to me like what's my view on a

836
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:02,220
rapid7 competitor doing X like I might

837
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:04,620
say no comment in a jokey way to them

838
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:07,890
because like if that is a comment in

839
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:09,390
love itself but if it was like a serious

840
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,799
thing where I had a message I wanted to

841
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:12,779
land about that then I would actually

842
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,020
try and give them a real answer it's

843
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:18,600
like you get quoted in article and the

844
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:20,910
last one the last one is don't go off

845
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,710
the record so generally speaking like I

846
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:25,589
go off the record all the time but I

847
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:27,690
also know the press really well so you

848
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:30,780
have to get to a point where you are

849
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:32,940
comfortable and you know that you can

850
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:34,680
count on a relationship with a reporter

851
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:36,810
so I'll tell you the first time I ever

852
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:40,379
did this training at a security

853
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:43,740
conference I had Steve Reagan with me

854
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:45,210
and and Poole came to the session which

855
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:48,180
I thought was hilarious to see all this

856
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:49,260
he doesn't leave me the training and he

857
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,609
just basically came to check out more

858
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:55,830
tricks that was teaching people but yeah

859
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:59,030
so so we got to be done off the record

860
00:35:55,830 --> 00:36:01,009
thing and we have say about weather

861
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:04,430
whether journalists will actually screw

862
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:05,750
you on this and both Steve and Paul just

863
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:07,970
look to each other and they were like oh

864
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:10,430
yeah yes the story is good enough I'm

865
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:12,020
the opportunities good enough totally so

866
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:13,848
you just really need to get to a point

867
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:16,069
where you know that the relationship you

868
00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:18,500
have with them is more valuable to them

869
00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:21,558
than that one story and then you can

870
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,130
apply off-the-record but until then no

871
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:24,260
way

872
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:29,890
don't don't share anything off the

873
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:33,140
record okay lateral movement so

874
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:34,700
basically this is a particular technique

875
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:36,200
where you get asked something and it's a

876
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,910
question you don't want to answer and

877
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:43,069
there are two things that you can do

878
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:46,279
about this one is bridging and the other

879
00:36:43,069 --> 00:36:47,960
is where you actually do want for the

880
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:50,000
question but you just answer it in a

881
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:52,039
totally different way this is what I was

882
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,849
talking about earlier when I said about

883
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:58,250
being positive rather than negative so

884
00:36:54,849 --> 00:37:00,260
has anybody ever done the the game where

885
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:02,240
you have to say yes and ask the things

886
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:05,539
it's really hard to do it's an improv

887
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:08,808
game so this is a good habit to get into

888
00:37:05,539 --> 00:37:10,520
is to try and say and not but it totally

889
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:12,140
totally changes the position of what

890
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:14,299
you're saying you can make the same

891
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:16,879
point but you want to lead in in a

892
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:19,339
positive way it makes your statements

893
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:23,089
seem much stronger and your point of

894
00:37:19,339 --> 00:37:24,799
view way less defensive or evasive there

895
00:37:23,089 --> 00:37:27,200
are other ways that you can take a

896
00:37:24,799 --> 00:37:29,630
question you don't want and you can

897
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,339
still answer it without like completely

898
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:33,770
derail in conversation or getting backed

899
00:37:31,339 --> 00:37:35,230
into a corner so I've included a couple

900
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:37,670
here that I'm not going to go through

901
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:43,010
bridging bridging is basically a

902
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:44,150
technique whereby you get you get you

903
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:46,609
get asked the question you don't want to

904
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:48,799
answer and remember we talked earlier on

905
00:37:46,609 --> 00:37:50,779
about your core messages the key points

906
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:52,069
that you want to learn so when you get

907
00:37:50,779 --> 00:37:54,250
asked that question that you don't want

908
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:57,619
to answer rather than being evasive or

909
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:59,510
giving a half answer you basically are

910
00:37:57,619 --> 00:38:04,940
gonna answer the question in a way that

911
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:07,549
walks the report so a bridging thing is

912
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:09,319
where so we ask you a question and you

913
00:38:07,549 --> 00:38:10,360
lead-in with an answer that addresses

914
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:13,029
that question

915
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:15,550
and then you pivot that point that

916
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:19,180
you're making smoothly into another

917
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:22,180
point that pulls you back to the cool

918
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:23,919
message that you had and and people who

919
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:27,190
talked to the press all the time use

920
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:29,310
bridging a lot josh is like a broken

921
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:32,800
record to users bridging all the time

922
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:34,090
okay so avoiding countermeasures and

923
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,070
honestly I just wanted to give a picture

924
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:37,420
of this creepy guy and I'm gonna pull to

925
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:42,040
come back up now and not that this is a

926
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:46,150
picture for counter measures these are

927
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:48,070
the tricks and there's a bunch of them

928
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:51,010
these are not you know the only ones

929
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:53,620
they use but these are some of the

930
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:55,480
things the reporters might use to try to

931
00:38:53,620 --> 00:39:00,430
get you to say things that they find

932
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:02,080
really usable so I'm gonna basically

933
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:08,350
asked Paul to give some examples of each

934
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:09,940
of them okay yeah I mean there's a very

935
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:13,270
big social engineering component to

936
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:15,670
being a good reporter and the end of the

937
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:17,230
day mmm anything that's gonna make a

938
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:20,050
good story is probably not information

939
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:22,390
that people want out there and in print

940
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:25,030
so you do need to find a way to extract

941
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:28,810
that from people who are sources or

942
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:31,690
either knowing or unknowing and yeah I

943
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:34,390
mean ambushing I think is probably one

944
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:37,000
of the more common techniques and that's

945
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:39,400
basically what the name suggests is

946
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,100
you're getting somebody when they're

947
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,930
unawares that could be you know when

948
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:47,740
they're out drinking at a social event

949
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:50,049
or at a bar and or have their guard down

950
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:54,370
that's a very reliable way to get

951
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:56,170
interesting information and I think use

952
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:58,690
it pretty good I mean it's it's hard in

953
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:59,920
in online journalism with which most

954
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:01,390
people are doing these days because a

955
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:06,250
lot of the work you're doing via email

956
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:08,850
or you know social media of some sort

957
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:10,870
and so it gets harder but certainly in

958
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:13,240
environments such as source conference

959
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:16,299
when everybody gets together goes out

960
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:18,339
socializing that it really works well I

961
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:20,440
was playing pool earlier

962
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:25,780
this was very very reckoning used on me

963
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:28,680
I was at a party in DC and a reporter

964
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:30,790
came up to me and completely ambushed me

965
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:33,299
and there was literally a look at my

966
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:38,529
face of like oh god I've been drinking

967
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:42,640
and it was hilarious because my readable

968
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:44,860
that my CEO and space rogue both kind of

969
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:48,129
like folder shields around me it was

970
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:48,430
amazing so yeah ambushing happens all

971
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:52,180
the time

972
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:54,009
right yeah and and it's just human human

973
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:56,290
contact and looking somebody in the face

974
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:57,760
and asking them a question point-blank

975
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:59,770
you're a lot more likely to get

976
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,930
information out of them than an email

977
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:03,880
that you throw over the transom or even

978
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:06,910
a phone conversation silence as Jen said

979
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:08,680
is a really good technique I must say as

980
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:10,930
a reporter I'm not always as good as it

981
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:12,129
as I should or I don't use it as

982
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:15,190
effectively as I should but it's

983
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:17,740
basically sitting down to do an

984
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:20,380
interview with somebody of either

985
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:22,689
appointed interview or a kind of general

986
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:24,730
briefing and just not saying much and

987
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:27,460
let them fill the space with words and

988
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:31,060
and while you might just get a bunch of

989
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:33,490
words you might also get some you know

990
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:35,230
information divulge that you can then

991
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:37,299
sort of pick up the thread and say oh

992
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:39,520
mmm that's interesting say a little bit

993
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:42,310
more about that or you know kind of get

994
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:46,000
them to pursue a topic that maybe wasn't

995
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:50,049
on the agenda of their PR handler but is

996
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,120
on your agenda so but it's it's sort of

997
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:54,640
a you know you're kind of throwing

998
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:56,950
you're throwing your lot in with chance

999
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:59,980
and and maybe something good comes out

1000
00:41:56,950 --> 00:42:01,480
of it machine gunning yep so wait what I

1001
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:04,060
think I'll do is like as you go through

1002
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:06,580
them I'll just talk about to make them

1003
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:09,100
go forth so with ambushing if you get

1004
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:10,720
ambushed the best thing to do is to just

1005
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:13,270
keep the conversation really shallow and

1006
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,830
if they start trying to into

1007
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:16,360
conversations that you don't want to

1008
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:18,040
have like asking about the thing that

1009
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:20,380
you don't want talk about then you

1010
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:21,700
should just basically be like I would be

1011
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:24,460
really happy to schedule some time to

1012
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:26,379
talk about this let's like circle or

1013
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:28,420
write a new emoji some questions

1014
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:29,210
and that way you're not like telling

1015
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,920
them hey I won't

1016
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:32,240
about I won't address it you're just

1017
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,790
making it very clear you're drawing a

1018
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:37,250
line a boundary of like social

1019
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:39,470
interaction versus work interaction and

1020
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:40,940
ambushes can be phone calls as well you

1021
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:42,439
know you get called out of the blue by a

1022
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:43,820
reporter who's like oh I'm on deadline I

1023
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:46,910
need a quote or I want to ask you about

1024
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:48,740
this and I heard this and you feel a lot

1025
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:51,700
of pressure to have a conversation with

1026
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:53,689
this person you know you can yeah

1027
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:55,730
schmuck for saying this but I mean you

1028
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:56,960
know you can just sort of say you know

1029
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:59,870
it's not a good time for me can I call

1030
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:02,120
you back even 15 minutes I know and then

1031
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:04,190
just make a few calls yourself send an

1032
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,990
email out would be like what should we

1033
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:10,160
say what should we say and I do that all

1034
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:12,589
the time with silence so I see the best

1035
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:17,049
living with violence just to play it

1036
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:21,320
back when they go quite it works a dream

1037
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:22,760
and I've fallen for silence before like

1038
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:25,790
I've had it used to me very effectively

1039
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:28,100
and it is a horrible thing to do to let

1040
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:29,120
that sign of a stretch but you have to

1041
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,860
get to a point where you're comfortable

1042
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:34,910
with it you just have to like know what

1043
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:38,960
it is recognize it be like okay this is

1044
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:40,490
and just stay quiet and if it gets to a

1045
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,990
point where you basically feel like

1046
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:42,950
you're playing chicken and you can't

1047
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:48,410
bear it anymore

1048
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:51,680
then you can just pay and they'll move

1049
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:53,540
on and even if they say oh no I think

1050
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,730
that's about it or they repeat their

1051
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:57,500
last question you can be like well I

1052
00:43:55,730 --> 00:44:01,040
think we've covered it and you can just

1053
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:03,110
say okay thank you yep machine-gunning

1054
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:06,190
as the name suggests asking a whole

1055
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:09,800
bunch of questions in a real rapid-fire

1056
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:12,530
manner kind of get them punchy a little

1057
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:14,300
bit from having to you know switch in so

1058
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:16,720
many different directions all at once

1059
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:19,480
often the you

1060
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:22,689
real question is somewhere in the middle

1061
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:27,000
of that machine-gun barrage and the

1062
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:30,310
other ones are just sort of black really

1063
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,570
thrown up there to make them not realize

1064
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:33,070
that they gave you some information that

1065
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:36,130
you really want frequently what happens

1066
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:37,900
is when people get machine guns they

1067
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:40,480
will answer the one question they least

1068
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:42,160
want to answer because that's the one

1069
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,270
that hits their anxiety and that's the

1070
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,149
one that they were like most stressed

1071
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:48,820
about and so that that's why it's such

1072
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:51,369
an effective technique if you get

1073
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:52,869
machine running again the great you can

1074
00:44:51,369 --> 00:44:56,380
use it to your heart's content so if I

1075
00:44:52,869 --> 00:45:04,990
get machine gunning I stopped and like

1076
00:44:56,380 --> 00:45:07,090
one phase it can be a little bit of a

1077
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:08,470
game of who's who's got control and you

1078
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:10,840
don't want to do it in a way where you

1079
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:12,520
seem like a douchebag right you don't

1080
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:17,260
want to seem like you're being like

1081
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:21,550
aggressive or whatever in time you also

1082
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:24,430
need to like not pressured to like have

1083
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:25,810
your back to the wall and just give them

1084
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:27,609
whatever information they want it's not

1085
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:33,070
an interrogation or at least you

1086
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:35,440
shouldn't be posing as your best friend

1087
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:36,790
I mean what do we really need to say

1088
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,240
about posing as your best friend I mean

1089
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:42,130
I yeah you know again the good reporters

1090
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,549
or good social engineers and to the

1091
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:47,290
extent that they can thank you know Josh

1092
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:54,670
I'm afraid just I'm afraid to tell you

1093
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:56,020
it's all just an illusion you know what

1094
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:58,210
can I say about this I mean some people

1095
00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:00,369
are some people will sort of suck up and

1096
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:02,650
and use that and if you're sort of you

1097
00:46:00,369 --> 00:46:06,040
have a fragile ego and are susceptible

1098
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:08,080
to that type of flattery then that can

1099
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:09,580
work I think it's a little bit of a

1100
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:12,640
double-edged sword because if you even

1101
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:13,990
have a modest sort of social radar then

1102
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,549
you'll immediately see that for what it

1103
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:16,649
is and

1104
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:19,200
and it will you know turn you off as it

1105
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:22,740
should I think in the security industry

1106
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:26,669
a lot it's a still a fairly small

1107
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:29,160
community and a lot of stuff comes down

1108
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:32,550
to relationships and reputation and so

1109
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:34,859
it's I think it's harder to just do that

1110
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:39,240
but you know it's also a bunch of guys

1111
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:41,190
if you're you know you know I mean there

1112
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:43,259
are many different ways to to social

1113
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:45,060
engineer people I think I think this one

1114
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:47,250
is a little tough for people because it

1115
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:49,740
is a small community and relationships

1116
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:52,860
are key familia like you actually want

1117
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:54,479
to build a great relationship and often

1118
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:56,490
what happens is people get together

1119
00:46:54,480 --> 00:47:00,200
security conferences and there's a lot

1120
00:46:56,490 --> 00:47:00,200
of drinks a lot of hanging out and

1121
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:04,950
frequently what happens is the people

1122
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:06,060
think that they're really good friends

1123
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:10,140
with the reporters and I see this all

1124
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:12,110
the time like I see people come over and

1125
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:16,379
I see the nature of the interactions

1126
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:17,940
it's really when a reporter is friendly

1127
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:20,190
to you to get into a situation where you

1128
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:22,050
want to please and you want to keep that

1129
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:22,470
friendliness going you want to be their

1130
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:24,660
friend

1131
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:26,850
so you it's not even though they're

1132
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:30,569
necessarily trying to trick you it's

1133
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:33,810
that like naturally wanna please and so

1134
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:35,700
you kind of overcompensate the best

1135
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:38,549
thing to do is be very wary I mean just

1136
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:40,230
you know not in a like I got kind of a

1137
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:41,850
way you try to make any of you paranoid

1138
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:45,840
you're secure to be bleonard need to

1139
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:47,640
experiment just be aware of it and be

1140
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:52,970
aware of the fact that you know the

1141
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:52,970
nature of relationships they are fairly

1142
00:47:56,369 --> 00:48:03,400
yeah interrupting and paraphrasing both

1143
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:07,900
kind of pretty common techniques in an

1144
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:09,910
interview trying to you know you have

1145
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:12,640
your spiel I mean this is really common

1146
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:14,170
with like you know corporate related

1147
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,600
briefings where you have your spiel you

1148
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:19,510
have your talking points and any good

1149
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:21,250
reporter worth his or her salt is gonna

1150
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:23,560
try really quickly to get you off your

1151
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:24,930
talking points like well first I'm gonna

1152
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:27,279
tell you about it and it's like now

1153
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:29,140
let's talk about this you know either I

1154
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,820
just read this and it happened and I

1155
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:32,500
want your insight on it or what about

1156
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:34,540
this thing that you know you were

1157
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:36,820
talking about six months ago and you

1158
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:41,710
know or here's here's what I'm after

1159
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:43,600
from you and that you know you both need

1160
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:45,730
to I think play with that a little bit

1161
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:47,440
you can't be like I am just going to

1162
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:49,330
stick to my talking points and I don't

1163
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,580
care what you say so you need to respond

1164
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:53,080
to that but also as Jen said try and

1165
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:54,850
bring it back around to what it is see

1166
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:57,750
here they were talking about I have a

1167
00:48:54,850 --> 00:49:01,118
really great example of paraphrasing so

1168
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:04,359
when the home depot breach has that

1169
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:08,350
happened we had a report to reach out to

1170
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:10,090
us and they wanted to speak to one of

1171
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:14,069
our pen testers who used to work at Home

1172
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:14,070
Depot I kind of look

1173
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:23,670
I basically said you know we have this

1174
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:25,380
other pentester who be about pentesting

1175
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:26,690
because that's what the reporter says

1176
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:29,130
they want to still go out with benefit

1177
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:34,049
sorry we scheduled the school with this

1178
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:38,119
other guy and the reporter asked how

1179
00:49:34,049 --> 00:49:42,480
many times a year he would recommend

1180
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:47,430
organizations Pentax and he gave it on

1181
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:49,769
turn it was would you recommend every

1182
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:52,669
organisation vendor but he gave an

1183
00:49:49,769 --> 00:49:55,709
answer and so the reporter then

1184
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:57,150
paraphrase turned around and said so

1185
00:49:55,710 --> 00:50:01,769
you're saying the Home Depot didn't

1186
00:49:57,150 --> 00:50:04,109
pentest no and he was basically like no

1187
00:50:01,769 --> 00:50:05,939
I'm not I didn't say that at all I

1188
00:50:04,109 --> 00:50:08,430
didn't mention Home Depot and so you

1189
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:10,529
just have to be really careful on how if

1190
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:12,509
a reporter has an agenda they have a

1191
00:50:10,529 --> 00:50:15,049
specific quote they want to get into an

1192
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:17,849
article and this does really happen that

1193
00:50:15,049 --> 00:50:19,529
they're not going to walk you like in

1194
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:21,480
the same way that you're walking them to

1195
00:50:19,529 --> 00:50:23,579
the points you want to make that they

1196
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,710
met on at the same time trying to walk

1197
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:27,869
you for the points they want you to make

1198
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:29,970
so they can get that quote and put it in

1199
00:50:27,869 --> 00:50:32,460
their article and if they do try and do

1200
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:36,149
that you have to like be able to keep

1201
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:38,400
calm keep it together be polite but just

1202
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:38,789
very firmly say no that's not what I'm

1203
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,309
saying

1204
00:50:38,789 --> 00:50:43,380
and then clarify yeah I mean I've seen

1205
00:50:41,309 --> 00:50:45,059
reporters do that I hate it I think it's

1206
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:49,190
really skeevy and it's just sort of like

1207
00:50:45,059 --> 00:50:49,190
listen you're trying to what

1208
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:56,380
I don't do it I mean I really don't

1209
00:50:55,690 --> 00:51:01,570
think I do

1210
00:50:56,380 --> 00:51:04,300
I mean you know you know trying to sort

1211
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:06,010
of mash words for that you know for

1212
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:07,780
taking somebody something something

1213
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:10,140
somebody said and either wrapping some

1214
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:12,880
different context around it or

1215
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:15,069
rearranging the what they said to fit

1216
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:18,130
some particular need that you have a

1217
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:20,619
near story yeah it is really really

1218
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:22,630
common it's done all the time you do

1219
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:24,640
need to be cognizant I think when you're

1220
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:26,950
doing an interview that your words may

1221
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:29,799
be twisted twisted and just make very

1222
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:31,089
clear you know what what it is you're

1223
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,740
talking about what you're not talking

1224
00:51:31,089 --> 00:51:37,119
about but I'm not a big fan of the

1225
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:41,200
technique mr. Corman might say start

1226
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:43,240
throwing it kind of I mean I think by

1227
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:45,040
that you just mean kind of just taking a

1228
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:48,160
shot at the dart in the dark at some

1229
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:49,930
particular brewing is when they launch a

1230
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:52,200
controversial statement at you see how

1231
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:54,730
your rep I gave this all the time I get

1232
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:56,368
Metasploit people I get that all the

1233
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:59,890
time

1234
00:51:56,369 --> 00:52:01,960
medically is used by criminal enabling

1235
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:03,970
the bad guy and people will say it to me

1236
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:07,150
or to one of those first people to see

1237
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:10,540
what what we can get back actually

1238
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:12,760
they're in a situation that again yes

1239
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:14,800
calm you have that recognize it for what

1240
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:16,329
it is and if you went into that

1241
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,430
conversation with what your core

1242
00:52:16,329 --> 00:52:20,260
messages were and you knew what they

1243
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:23,649
were and you had them Chris then in that

1244
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:25,420
situation you can respond because you've

1245
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:27,369
got that that safety and security of

1246
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:29,740
knowing your core message so like when

1247
00:52:27,369 --> 00:52:31,930
somebody I don't have to respond to that

1248
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:33,368
because I'm pretty familiar with what

1249
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:35,560
minister is and how to tell the story

1250
00:52:33,369 --> 00:52:37,240
about it so I can be like well actually

1251
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:40,119
this is the logic behind it

1252
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:42,310
and it doesn't it doesn't throw me so

1253
00:52:40,119 --> 00:52:45,890
just be really crisp from where your

1254
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:49,279
core messages are going into it okay

1255
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:50,629
thank you very much so the freebie we

1256
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,730
can talk about chris Roberts to because

1257
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:55,130
I think that's kind of a it's like a

1258
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:56,900
it's like a object lesson it yeah do you

1259
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:59,180
want to sure we can talk about that

1260
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:01,670
Jordan of that now yeah so I mean I

1261
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:04,450
think the chris Roberts case that that

1262
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:06,920
came up with with the hacking the

1263
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:09,950
avionics systems or maybe he didn't or

1264
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:14,300
maybe he did is a really good object

1265
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:16,040
lesson for what you all as security

1266
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:21,620
researchers or people who are working

1267
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:23,330
within security organizations should be

1268
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:26,990
aware of I think you should look at that

1269
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:28,549
probably as a negative example of what

1270
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:30,259
you should do and I must say I was

1271
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:32,240
talking to chris Roberts at the time I

1272
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:36,200
actually have a great text message from

1273
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:39,259
him said can you talk now nope enough

1274
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:41,149
custody so I was talking with him

1275
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:45,140
regarding another story somewhat related

1276
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:47,810
story at the time he was arrested in

1277
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:51,290
Syracuse and interview with him

1278
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:55,580
they after he got out of jail sorry out

1279
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:56,990
of FBI custody and wrote about up for

1280
00:53:55,580 --> 00:54:00,620
security ledger I wrote about it for a

1281
00:53:56,990 --> 00:54:07,689
passcode so I think Chris is a really

1282
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:11,930
gifted engineer and security expert and

1283
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:14,420
he I don't know that I would recommend

1284
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:18,410
that particular course of action and in

1285
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:20,330
the future both on the social media side

1286
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:22,819
given the context of what he was writing

1287
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:25,360
on and just I think when you're dealing

1288
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:28,130
with media you do need to be aware that

1289
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:29,870
and in his case it would be way before

1290
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:32,630
he was talking to me he was doing stuff

1291
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:40,310
with Fox News

1292
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:43,010
Greta sundström and others and you know

1293
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:44,509
I think in the context that we're

1294
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:46,160
talking about now or the these are

1295
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:50,000
matters of life and limb with these are

1296
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:52,270
matters of federal law being broken and

1297
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,710
and real potentially criminal actions

1298
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:58,530
you do need to be very cognizant

1299
00:54:55,710 --> 00:55:00,450
of the fact that just because you gave a

1300
00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:03,830
presentation on a security conference

1301
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:06,830
doesn't absolve you of any liability or

1302
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:08,490
doesn't mean that the police are or

1303
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:10,980
authorities you're not going to take an

1304
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:14,669
interest in what you're doing and so

1305
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:18,270
that's that's I think a object lesson

1306
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:19,680
for having a game plan as to okay where

1307
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:24,380
we've got this information we've done

1308
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:27,810
this research both what are our legal

1309
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:30,210
exposures around this to the extent that

1310
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:31,520
we want to circulate this in the

1311
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:34,170
community outside of the immediate

1312
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:36,480
companies affected Airbus and Boeing and

1313
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:38,130
maybe the FAA how do we want to do that

1314
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,650
we want to do this in a way that we're

1315
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:43,650
in control of the message and we're in

1316
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:48,359
control of the talking points just kind

1317
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:49,950
of going on air at a major national news

1318
00:55:48,359 --> 00:55:51,598
outlet and saying oh yeah I have packed

1319
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:54,299
planes all the time and I can do this

1320
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:55,950
and I can do that or at a conference

1321
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:59,040
getting up in a conference stage and

1322
00:55:55,950 --> 00:56:00,930
saying it it might not get noticed and

1323
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:03,570
in fact much of his stuff didn't get

1324
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:05,669
noticed for many years but it might and

1325
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:09,060
if it does you can find yourself in a

1326
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:11,220
world of in a world of hurt so I think

1327
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:16,529
it all kind of speaks with Jen saying

1328
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:18,689
which is it's it's not 1999 anymore it's

1329
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:20,369
no longer you know you can get up and

1330
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:21,930
scream from the tallest tree and no

1331
00:56:20,369 --> 00:56:23,369
one's going to hear you people are

1332
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:26,279
listening people are paying very close

1333
00:56:23,369 --> 00:56:29,130
attention to the work that independent

1334
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:31,050
security researchers are doing and what

1335
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:35,580
they're saying whether it's on a blog or

1336
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:37,950
on the nightly news and there are real

1337
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:41,839
real repercussions for some of this

1338
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:41,839
stuff so you you need to be cognizant

1339
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:46,450
there's there's a sort of weird

1340
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:49,330
phenomenon that I'm sure most of you so

1341
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:50,770
many of us where for some reason people

1342
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:53,759
completely lose all their common sense

1343
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:58,810
as soon as they engage into it that and

1344
00:56:53,760 --> 00:57:00,760
that's that's a bad thing to do I I

1345
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:04,570
would be wary of disproportionate

1346
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:07,990
reactions on Twitter um I would be wary

1347
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:09,160
of bold statements that can be taken out

1348
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:11,529
of context

1349
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:13,899
and it's funny like you see stories

1350
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:16,210
about communications professionals like

1351
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:18,460
people in my role who fall into this

1352
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:21,250
trap all the time like it's it's like a

1353
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:23,140
weird sort of Twilight Zone because

1354
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:25,420
you're there and you're talking to your

1355
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:27,009
pals and there's all this banter and you

1356
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:29,170
kind of forget that it's actually

1357
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:33,040
one-to-many communication not one-to-one

1358
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:36,630
communication and that you're incredibly

1359
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:39,190
limited lengths of communication you're

1360
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:41,050
140 characters and like there's no

1361
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:43,930
possible way to get context and 140

1362
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:46,660
characters so you kind of it's easy to

1363
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:48,879
forget that that context that you

1364
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:50,950
haven't provided will be provided in the

1365
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,690
minds of other people who read it who

1366
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:56,710
won't necessarily know you

1367
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:59,200
and so like be very wary of how you use

1368
00:57:56,710 --> 00:58:02,650
social media and try and be smart about

1369
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:06,540
it and try and remember to some some

1370
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:09,610
common sense and and like just really

1371
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:11,770
proportionate response is important and

1372
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:16,600
we don't necessarily always see a lot of

1373
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:19,030
that and media is a completely different

1374
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:21,640
trap when you start to do meteor and you

1375
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:23,410
start to like get yourself quotas and

1376
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:24,759
things and you get comfortable doing it

1377
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:26,230
like at the beginning you're

1378
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:28,630
uncomfortable you worry about it you're

1379
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:29,890
nervous and so you like put in the time

1380
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:31,570
and s that you really think about it

1381
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:35,230
once you've started to do it for a while

1382
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:37,360
you forget that like it's a process and

1383
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:39,370
that this stuff is gonna live in print

1384
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:42,940
for a really long time Internet has a

1385
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:44,920
long memory and so I see people all the

1386
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:48,850
time like I I mentioned earlier on that

1387
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:51,230
I had fallen victim to silence I have

1388
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:55,460
done media training

1389
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:57,320
and yet the days that a reporter from

1390
00:58:55,460 --> 00:59:00,260
one of the beta nationals called me and

1391
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:04,100
you silenced on me I fell for it because

1392
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:06,230
I didn't like reinforced to myself the

1393
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:08,089
messages I fell into that trap of being

1394
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:10,820
a little bit too confident of my own

1395
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:12,800
skills and you need to reinforce this

1396
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:14,390
stuff with yourself all the time you

1397
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,410
need to make sure that you don't get to

1398
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:16,549
the point where you're like I know my

1399
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:18,290
messages I don't need to think about

1400
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:19,840
this going in because what will happen

1401
00:59:18,290 --> 00:59:22,130
is it will create a bad briefing and

1402
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:23,480
when the article comes out and you

1403
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:25,220
either won't be in it or you won't like

1404
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:26,960
what's in it so you have to keep

1405
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:30,020
investing in this stuff media training

1406
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:32,570
is not a point-in-time thing the most

1407
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:34,880
people I work with are some of I think

1408
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:37,490
some of the best most people in the

1409
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:39,440
industry but every single time they do a

1410
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:41,839
briefing they get their ass kicked by me

1411
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:43,850
because I will always give them feedback

1412
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:45,440
on it and I don't mean that they get

1413
00:59:43,850 --> 00:59:47,180
their ass kicked for me I actually don't

1414
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,950
give them credit that harsh criticisms

1415
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:50,540
but like I'll always be like hey just

1416
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:52,939
watch out for this thing because it's a

1417
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:55,220
constant reminder and I needed to I

1418
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:59,540
asked for it when I talked to breath I I

1419
00:59:55,220 --> 01:00:02,600
asked afterward for the freebies it's

1420
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:04,279
not cause I'm sorry but basically at the

1421
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:06,890
end of an interview your average

1422
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:09,050
reporter will say to you is there

1423
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:13,879
anything like that or is there nothing I

1424
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:16,850
missed and we call this freebie this is

1425
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:20,600
your prime opportunity to restate your

1426
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:22,730
core message so do not go I think I kind

1427
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:25,430
of covered it all we're good that's a

1428
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:29,630
wasted opportunity do not do that what

1429
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:30,980
you want to do is say um yeah as

1430
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:33,050
discussed I just you know I want to

1431
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:35,270
reinforce and you can restate those core

1432
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:37,670
messages that means for the last point

1433
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:39,470
that they got in your briefing was that

1434
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:41,660
cool message that was the last note you

1435
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:44,060
left it on that is a strong positive

1436
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:45,799
thing to do did you not walk away from

1437
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:46,820
the freebie the freebie is good and

1438
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,140
obviously if there's something you

1439
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:50,890
didn't cover that you wanted to get to

1440
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:57,190
then use that

1441
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:59,710
so you have now proof hopefully brief

1442
01:00:57,190 --> 01:01:02,190
the press relatively successfully so how

1443
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:04,090
do you escalate your primitive

1444
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:06,130
relationships are key we talked about

1445
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:07,840
this a bunch about you know knowing what

1446
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:08,500
a real relationship is and how to get to

1447
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:13,240
that point

1448
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:15,550
Wow it's like lesson I think the best

1449
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:17,830
ways to do this to make sure that you

1450
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:20,110
keep delivering value you know as I said

1451
01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:21,850
earlier I'm very careful about the

1452
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:25,090
things that I send to press I don't go

1453
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:26,799
to Paul with which announcement because

1454
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:29,290
he's not gonna want to read my emails if

1455
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:30,820
I do so you have to try and keep the

1456
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:32,890
quality going of what you're offering

1457
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:34,570
make sure that you continue to be

1458
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:36,250
relevant make sure that you're

1459
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:37,690
responsive and reliable when they come

1460
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:39,670
to you and ask for something that's

1461
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:41,470
really important understand that they're

1462
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:43,750
on a timeline and yes you have a

1463
01:01:41,470 --> 01:01:45,850
full-time job and it's not that but

1464
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:47,380
they're on a timeline and if you want to

1465
01:01:45,850 --> 01:01:48,790
be included in their piece like they're

1466
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:51,310
giving you the opportunity to do that

1467
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:53,230
that's a great thing you have to respond

1468
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:54,520
to that by either getting them or they

1469
01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:56,800
need quickly or at least being

1470
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:59,320
responsive enough to say hey I'm really

1471
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:00,520
sorry I can't make this work and then

1472
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:00,910
they know they can move on to somebody

1473
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:05,050
else

1474
01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:07,930
so be reliable don't expect to see the

1475
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:10,210
copy or approve it before it goes out if

1476
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:13,270
you ask most reporters are gonna laugh

1477
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:15,160
at you if you're very lucky and there's

1478
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:17,530
something really nuanced that you gave

1479
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:18,750
them they might send that tiny bit of it

1480
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:21,460
to you to make sure they got it right

1481
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:23,530
but generally speaking you should never

1482
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:25,060
expect to see this before it goes to

1483
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:27,160
print that's just not how the

1484
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:28,890
relationship works reporters have to

1485
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:32,049
mean that maintain their independence

1486
01:02:28,890 --> 01:02:34,839
and the other thing is if you said you

1487
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:36,220
would follow up then do frequently if

1488
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:39,610
you get a question you don't want to

1489
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:40,990
answer rather than like being evasive or

1490
01:02:39,610 --> 01:02:44,260
giving it on so you're not sure it's

1491
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:45,520
accurate what you'll say is I'll look

1492
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:47,170
into that and come back to you and that

1493
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,310
is a really great answer like important

1494
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:50,320
start over phone with that you can

1495
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:51,520
totally do that any time but if you say

1496
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:55,870
you're gonna do that make sure you

1497
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:56,980
actually do it be reliable okay so now

1498
01:02:55,870 --> 01:02:57,960
you've done all of that how do you go

1499
01:02:56,980 --> 01:03:02,880
away clean

1500
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:04,380
um so the first thing is again just to

1501
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,510
reinforce as I said there'd be a lot of

1502
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:09,060
repetition don't expect to see your copy

1503
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:10,530
it's not gonna happen and follow up if

1504
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:15,240
you said you would apparently never in

1505
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:18,540
my place when you see the article come

1506
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:20,040
out share it you know a reporter is

1507
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:22,710
trying to build their brand just as you

1508
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:24,089
are and so when the article comes out

1509
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:25,560
share it through social note where

1510
01:03:24,089 --> 01:03:29,670
networks and reference the reporter

1511
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:32,670
generally speaking that's a winner look

1512
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:34,950
at who covered your comment who - who

1513
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:36,300
used your stuff and so like if you've

1514
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:39,210
gone to a bunch of different people look

1515
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:41,700
at who was interested learn from it look

1516
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:43,410
at what was you so if you did a briefing

1517
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:45,390
with Paul and he used like one thing

1518
01:03:43,410 --> 01:03:46,980
that you said and nothing else try and

1519
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:49,080
like understand why that was the case

1520
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:51,240
look at the context of the article you

1521
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:52,560
can even follow up and say I wouldn't

1522
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:54,390
advise you do it all the time but like

1523
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:55,950
in specific cases you can always like

1524
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:57,868
have a conversation and say like instead

1525
01:03:55,950 --> 01:04:00,720
of interest was this you know too

1526
01:03:57,869 --> 01:04:02,580
technical or whatever and maintain a

1527
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:06,089
positive tone stay professional even if

1528
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:07,650
something that you don't like you should

1529
01:04:06,089 --> 01:04:10,230
not take the approach to three months

1530
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:13,650
the rapport remover which we're gonna

1531
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:15,570
talk about little bit more so if you are

1532
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:17,460
going to engage repress you need to walk

1533
01:04:15,570 --> 01:04:20,010
into it with your eyes open knowing that

1534
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:21,839
at some point you are going to see

1535
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:26,280
yourself quoted in a way you do not like

1536
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:28,529
this is part of the business you need to

1537
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:33,060
accept that you can do things to

1538
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:34,800
minimize your risk but ultimately it's a

1539
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:36,330
complex relationship and they're writing

1540
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,740
up an article and you're gonna see

1541
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:39,359
something in a context that you didn't

1542
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:42,180
anticipate and you're probably gonna be

1543
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:44,848
unhappy about it in that situation being

1544
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:46,790
graceful is very important if what

1545
01:04:44,849 --> 01:04:49,250
they've used is factually inaccurate

1546
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:51,990
follow up with them and let them know

1547
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:53,310
reporters want to be accurate they don't

1548
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:55,439
want to be a bunch of you know

1549
01:04:53,310 --> 01:04:57,060
fly-by-night Cowboys so if you follow up

1550
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,560
and you say hey just you know like X

1551
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:59,670
they're gonna go and change it and

1552
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:01,320
they're gonna be grateful that you let

1553
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:03,450
them know particularly if you let them

1554
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:05,570
know in a way that is friendly and

1555
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:08,490
helpful rather than aggressive and

1556
01:05:05,570 --> 01:05:09,839
advertorial but if it's not an

1557
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:10,319
inaccuracy if it's just that you're

1558
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:14,390
stuffing

1559
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:16,680
in a way you don't like suck it up sorry

1560
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:18,720
so that was a huge amount of information

1561
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:22,080
so just a very quick recap of my top

1562
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:23,779
five tips for hacking the media do your

1563
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:26,640
research know what you're getting into

1564
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:31,730
make sure that your position and message

1565
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:35,040
before you be friendly and courteous

1566
01:05:31,730 --> 01:05:38,790
before during and after be honest

1567
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:41,660
did I mention be honest and don't go off

1568
01:05:38,790 --> 01:05:45,890
the record until I tell you you have

1569
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:45,890
questions and questions for fallers

1570
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:51,848
like do I

1571
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:59,609
do any of these rules change for press

1572
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:08,339
outside of the US that you've been

1573
01:05:59,609 --> 01:06:10,650
exposed to yep so not in as much as

1574
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:13,259
again you're gonna do your research and

1575
01:06:10,650 --> 01:06:16,230
you're gonna know what the press is like

1576
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:18,540
in certain countries press a more

1577
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:20,550
interesting certain things so as a

1578
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:22,079
general rule of thumb German press is

1579
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:25,380
more technical they like technical

1580
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:28,950
detail as a general rule of thumb press

1581
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:31,200
in countries like Spain and France are

1582
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:33,299
really really interested in having angle

1583
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:35,730
that specifically raised it relate for

1584
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:37,260
that country they want customers from

1585
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:40,730
that country they want to talk about

1586
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:43,710
companies involved in that country as a

1587
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:51,960
general rule of thumb UK press are a

1588
01:06:43,710 --> 01:06:54,000
little bit less formal and sarcastic so

1589
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:56,400
yeah it's like again if you do your

1590
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,690
research and you know who the press are

1591
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,069
that you're talking to you and what

1592
01:06:57,690 --> 01:07:01,380
they're interested in and you've looked

1593
01:06:59,069 --> 01:07:06,630
at like the way they cover things then

1594
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:09,050
all the other rules apply any other

1595
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:09,050
questions

1596
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:20,029
oh yeah company bubbles in here who

1597
01:07:16,789 --> 01:07:21,369
wrote this media training okay so Josh

1598
01:07:20,029 --> 01:07:24,079
just starts all the differences between

1599
01:07:21,369 --> 01:07:26,660
on background off the record and on the

1600
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:28,039
record okay on the record very

1601
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:30,078
straightforward it means that you're

1602
01:07:28,039 --> 01:07:33,079
going to get quoted potentially if

1603
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:35,660
you've done a good job and and it will

1604
01:07:33,079 --> 01:07:39,230
be attributed to you off the record

1605
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:41,750
means it won't end up in print at all on

1606
01:07:39,230 --> 01:07:43,519
background means the reporter can use

1607
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:47,359
the content but they can't attribute it

1608
01:07:43,519 --> 01:07:50,209
to you so that would be you know source

1609
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:54,380
familiar with the incident source with

1610
01:07:50,210 --> 01:07:56,720
knowledge of the you know company that

1611
01:07:54,380 --> 01:08:01,029
type of stuff so when Greenberg was

1612
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:05,689
piece about Kaspersky being in bed with

1613
01:08:01,029 --> 01:08:07,160
whatever KGB school today there were

1614
01:08:05,690 --> 01:08:09,559
lots of people who were very upset

1615
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:12,049
because all of the sources were unnamed

1616
01:08:09,559 --> 01:08:14,180
so all of the people who spoke to room

1617
01:08:12,049 --> 01:08:19,189
Berg about that spoke to them on

1618
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:23,089
background basically is basically come

1619
01:08:19,189 --> 01:08:27,589
out wrong here and that's user I mean on

1620
01:08:23,089 --> 01:08:30,290
background is use often these days you

1621
01:08:27,589 --> 01:08:32,839
know I think generally when you're

1622
01:08:30,290 --> 01:08:34,488
sourcing people I think the most of the

1623
01:08:32,839 --> 01:08:35,719
time now people want to know why they're

1624
01:08:34,488 --> 01:08:38,269
being sourced and why they're anonymous

1625
01:08:35,719 --> 01:08:40,370
so you know who asked not to be named

1626
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:42,440
because he or she didn't have permission

1627
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:45,920
from his employer to speak or because

1628
01:08:42,439 --> 01:08:47,198
you know that's a that's a frequent one

1629
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:50,480
or because they were worried about

1630
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:52,129
repercussions you know professional

1631
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:54,318
repercussions or something like that so

1632
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:56,420
it's if you're just sourcing somebody

1633
01:08:54,319 --> 01:09:00,310
and it's not clear why their source I

1634
01:08:56,420 --> 01:09:00,310
guess that's that can be problematic

1635
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:08,360
and I would say in general you want to

1636
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:11,569
make the ground rules clear before you

1637
01:09:08,359 --> 01:09:13,219
tell them anything so I have people who

1638
01:09:11,569 --> 01:09:17,349
I'm interviewing all the time who will

1639
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:20,150
help me be verbose and then as an

1640
01:09:17,350 --> 01:09:22,490
addendum say oh yeah this is all off the

1641
01:09:20,149 --> 01:09:23,960
record or of course this is off the

1642
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:25,729
record or you know this is only on

1643
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:27,920
background you know and it's like well

1644
01:09:25,729 --> 01:09:29,719
no I didn't know that and you just told

1645
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,399
it to me on the record so as far as I'm

1646
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:35,030
concerned it's on the record

1647
01:09:31,399 --> 01:09:36,439
often if I relationship with you or if

1648
01:09:35,029 --> 01:09:39,710
it's not that important to be anyway

1649
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:42,200
more often the case then you'll say okay

1650
01:09:39,710 --> 01:09:43,819
or whatever but just know that they're

1651
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:45,500
under no obligation to do that if you've

1652
01:09:43,819 --> 01:09:47,660
told them stuff without specifying that

1653
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:49,010
you're that you don't want to use in a

1654
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:51,649
story or that you don't want to

1655
01:09:49,010 --> 01:09:54,890
attribute it to you unless you specify

1656
01:09:51,649 --> 01:09:55,339
that upfront then you know you're kind

1657
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:58,850
of out of luck

1658
01:09:55,340 --> 01:10:02,240
yes point to things I was saying that is

1659
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:04,130
one when you state it at the beginning

1660
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:06,679
of what you're saying make sure they

1661
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:08,330
agree like it's not just enough you need

1662
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:09,710
to say this is off the record and then

1663
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:12,590
to just say quiet they have to

1664
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:14,960
acknowledge that and I will be like very

1665
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:16,490
pedantic about making sure I get that

1666
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,720
acknowledgement even if it's with a

1667
01:10:16,490 --> 01:10:21,710
reporter that I'm really good friends

1668
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:28,250
with by which I mean a report supposing

1669
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:30,680
of weather so the second thing I would

1670
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:32,150
say is again this goes back to what I

1671
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:33,560
was saying before about you know you're

1672
01:10:32,150 --> 01:10:34,849
never off the record until like you

1673
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:37,070
really know you can be off the record

1674
01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:40,040
the same thing applies for backgrounds

1675
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:43,309
like just be very very cautious with it

1676
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:45,380
because it is a good halfway measure and

1677
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:47,690
a lot of reporters will respect it but

1678
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:49,850
at the same time there is always a

1679
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:51,830
backlash whether horses use unnamed

1680
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:55,430
sources so they would much rather have a

1681
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:57,740
name to go with the source and again if

1682
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:59,240
you don't have that relationship just be

1683
01:10:57,740 --> 01:11:02,360
very wary about offering that

1684
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:04,490
particularly as the challenge is people

1685
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:05,870
get a little a little loose tongues as

1686
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:07,700
soon as they like have that agreement

1687
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:08,840
like as soon as they hear the words on

1688
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:09,469
the background they're like what all

1689
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,969
them

1690
01:11:09,469 --> 01:11:12,949
let me tell you what I really think and

1691
01:11:10,969 --> 01:11:15,559
even if that's not gonna end up in print

1692
01:11:12,949 --> 01:11:16,999
you are creating an impression with that

1693
01:11:15,559 --> 01:11:19,010
LaPorta that you just may not want to

1694
01:11:16,999 --> 01:11:21,920
create like you want to make sure that

1695
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:31,369
they still consider you to be a credible

1696
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:32,719
valuable professional result i'm een i

1697
01:11:31,369 --> 01:11:34,489
would just say in general if you all are

1698
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:37,969
working for security companies if you're

1699
01:11:34,489 --> 01:11:40,659
doing research product research one

1700
01:11:37,969 --> 01:11:44,380
thing I've noticed is that often

1701
01:11:40,659 --> 01:11:48,440
companies now are using their blogs to

1702
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:51,039
to air research that they've done could

1703
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:53,598
be research on a third party product

1704
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:56,389
most them do a pretty good job of it but

1705
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:57,650
I am continually surprised by how kind

1706
01:11:56,389 --> 01:11:58,610
of half-assed a lot of companies are

1707
01:11:57,650 --> 01:12:00,739
about that

1708
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:02,360
so they'll complete the research wrap it

1709
01:12:00,739 --> 01:12:03,799
up and publish it on their blog the next

1710
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:05,299
day and so when they're talking to the

1711
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:08,210
press they're like Oh have you talked to

1712
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:10,190
you know GE or the company whose product

1713
01:12:08,210 --> 01:12:12,199
this is oh yeah no we haven't done that

1714
01:12:10,190 --> 01:12:13,460
or I we sent him an email we haven't

1715
01:12:12,199 --> 01:12:16,119
heard back and it's sort of like you

1716
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:17,989
know these are pretty serious

1717
01:12:16,119 --> 01:12:19,670
accusations or these are pretty serious

1718
01:12:17,989 --> 01:12:21,440
information that you're imparting to me

1719
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:23,599
a member of the press the fact that you

1720
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:25,728
haven't taken the steps to contact the

1721
01:12:23,599 --> 01:12:30,320
company and work with them through you

1722
01:12:25,729 --> 01:12:32,539
know to to redress seized I'm not saying

1723
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:34,940
it affects the it doesn't make your your

1724
01:12:32,539 --> 01:12:35,840
research any more or less true but it

1725
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:38,509
makes you look a little

1726
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:39,860
publicity-seeking as opposed to what I

1727
01:12:38,510 --> 01:12:41,599
think you would probably want to be

1728
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:44,239
perceived as which is a company that's

1729
01:12:41,599 --> 01:12:47,510
trying to do you know good good service

1730
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:48,530
yeah so when we do research we we have a

1731
01:12:47,510 --> 01:12:50,780
ton of that thank you

1732
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:56,090
that's the research is fill in that

1733
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:58,610
basically is like I said how bad is it

1734
01:12:56,090 --> 01:13:02,030
you know what are the systems involved

1735
01:12:58,610 --> 01:13:04,969
and one of the things that I reach the

1736
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:08,199
guy to to think about because I think if

1737
01:13:04,969 --> 01:13:10,789
you're a researcher I know I'm sort of

1738
01:13:08,199 --> 01:13:11,928
characterized in this way the thing that

1739
01:13:10,789 --> 01:13:14,599
drives you is you sort of have a

1740
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:16,519
curiosity about it and once you scratch

1741
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:18,349
that edge and satisfied that curiosity

1742
01:13:16,519 --> 01:13:19,909
typically the research that I work with

1743
01:13:18,349 --> 01:13:20,599
are ready to just move on to the next

1744
01:13:19,909 --> 01:13:22,159
thing

1745
01:13:20,599 --> 01:13:23,420
so the piece at the end where they have

1746
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:25,730
to write it up and go through the

1747
01:13:23,420 --> 01:13:27,710
disclosure is like for most researchers

1748
01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:30,829
I work with extremely painful that's the

1749
01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:34,070
bit where they just like can't you just

1750
01:13:30,829 --> 01:13:37,429
do it and so like having people like

1751
01:13:34,070 --> 01:13:40,040
like hold Elvis's and be willing to go

1752
01:13:37,429 --> 01:13:45,170
through okay well we need to build in a

1753
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:46,699
window to talk to press and we need to

1754
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:48,679
get a blog that like answers all these

1755
01:13:46,699 --> 01:13:50,900
different questions as painful and if

1756
01:13:48,679 --> 01:13:52,250
you work through coordinators disclosure

1757
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:54,860
like we do we have a very standard

1758
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:57,170
policy where we do coordinated

1759
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:59,690
disclosure through cert CC and we do a

1760
01:13:57,170 --> 01:14:01,400
60-day window so that means that in most

1761
01:13:59,690 --> 01:14:03,559
cases the researchers not only conduct

1762
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:04,848
to the research 60 days before like

1763
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:06,650
they've had two months of basically

1764
01:14:04,849 --> 01:14:07,070
being like I don't care and sober it's

1765
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:09,110
done

1766
01:14:07,070 --> 01:14:10,639
and in that time I'm like hey you're two

1767
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:14,059
months to write me a blog post but their

1768
01:14:10,639 --> 01:14:15,770
view is yeah but every month ago um so

1769
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:17,420
you at Sur like if you're interested in

1770
01:14:15,770 --> 01:14:19,909
getting the word out and you really do

1771
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:21,710
want to help people be safer then you

1772
01:14:19,909 --> 01:14:24,710
have to like put the time in you have to

1773
01:14:21,710 --> 01:14:26,659
be able to stay engaged do that and you

1774
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:27,889
have to help people get safer so like

1775
01:14:26,659 --> 01:14:30,440
the two questions that are always in

1776
01:14:27,889 --> 01:14:31,310
there what's the impact and that goes

1777
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:32,860
back to the thing I said at the

1778
01:14:31,310 --> 01:14:35,179
beginning about blowing up churches

1779
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:37,460
which makes it sound like a psycho and

1780
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:39,860
the second thing is how do people

1781
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:41,510
protect themselves nine times out of ten

1782
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:43,130
when I see research come out from people

1783
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:44,540
the first draft does not include

1784
01:14:43,130 --> 01:14:46,250
anything about what people can do to

1785
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:48,019
protect themselves and the reality is

1786
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:50,060
that even if you don't even know what

1787
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:51,650
they can do like put something in there

1788
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:54,530
about it like at least make an effort

1789
01:14:51,650 --> 01:14:56,420
because if if what we're doing here is

1790
01:14:54,530 --> 01:14:58,130
actually trying to help people be more

1791
01:14:56,420 --> 01:15:00,430
secure then we have to think about that

1792
01:14:58,130 --> 01:15:03,609
piece what does that leave me

1793
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:03,609
[Music]

1794
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:11,059
yes I completely agree yeah whenever you

1795
01:15:09,710 --> 01:15:14,180
speak publicly you should just assume

1796
01:15:11,060 --> 01:15:15,440
they're reporters in the room and you

1797
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:17,150
know as I said the first time I gave

1798
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:18,889
this media training he was in the room

1799
01:15:17,150 --> 01:15:20,179
so even when you're doing something that

1800
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:23,830
you really don't make a report is very

1801
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:23,830
interesting there's a reporter away
