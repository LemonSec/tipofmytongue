1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:08,189
so I do I work for core security I run

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:10,790
security there I run strategy I do

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:16,109
whatever marketing tells me pretty much

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:20,880
that's a joke so so one of the things

5
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:24,269
that we do as we do vulnerability

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,288
management and I don't mean I don't mean

7
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:30,448
that we provide a bowl and scanner and

8
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:33,360
sell that in the marketplace instead we

9
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:35,130
look at what are the risks to your

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,680
critical assets and how can you best

11
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,210
secure them when you consider the

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,510
threats and vulnerabilities that you

13
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,980
face and that's where this the the

14
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,129
perspective that I'm going to give you

15
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,529
comes from a having done security for

16
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:52,739
years and years and years and B now

17
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:57,690
being in a company that focuses on how

18
00:00:52,739 --> 00:01:00,120
do bad guys break into your networks so

19
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,800
they tell me that if I'm gonna be a good

20
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:06,000
public speaker I should always start

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,479
with a joke so I guess I'll give it a

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,610
shot

23
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:17,490
a duck walks into a bar walks in hops up

24
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,990
on the bar top bartender looks at the

25
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:23,158
duck and then he's like what the heck

26
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:25,320
are you doing dude you're a duck part

27
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,799
the the duck looks at the bartender and

28
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:32,579
he says I know but I'd like a glass of

29
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,049
milk then parts tenders like okay look

30
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:37,289
first of all it's a bar

31
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,159
second of all you're a duck third we

32
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,030
don't serve milk

33
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,220
get out but the duck leaves next day at

34
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,530
the exact same time the duck comes in

35
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,090
the bar hops up on the bar top the

36
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,920
bartender is a little ticked off now

37
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,380
he's like look I told you yesterday

38
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,180
you're a duck and this is a bar what do

39
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:58,500
you want how about a glass of milk

40
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:01,290
bartender looks at him he said I told

41
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:05,460
you it's a bar you're a duck we don't

42
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:08,580
serve milk get out the duck leaves third

43
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:11,489
day in a row he comes in this duck he

44
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:14,879
jumps up on the bar top

45
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:16,709
and the bartender looks at me says all

46
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,569
right we've been through this you're a

47
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:22,049
duck this is a bar

48
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:24,179
we don't serve milk if you ask for a

49
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:26,510
glass of milk I'm gonna nail your stupid

50
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,010
duck beak to the bar

51
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:33,358
tuck looks at him thinks about it for a

52
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:37,439
minute goes get any nails bartenders

53
00:02:33,359 --> 00:02:41,549
like no I don't have any nails okay how

54
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:43,108
about a glass of milk hey it's a come on

55
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:49,560
that's a security joke that's pretty

56
00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:51,510
good right he did a risk assessment okay

57
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,170
it's not the greatest joke in the world

58
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:57,540
but all right so the current state of

59
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,220
affairs in security when we think about

60
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:03,659
threat and vulnerability management

61
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:05,250
let's let's get past the duck bad guys

62
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:08,340
can go where they want and do what they

63
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,709
want right when's the last time you read

64
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:14,750
about somebody saying we detected an

65
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:14,750
attempted intrusion and we stopped it

66
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:20,690
yesterday we found out that the IRS

67
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:24,930
couldn't keep a hundred thousand

68
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:26,519
taxpayer identities secure right the two

69
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,280
days before that we found out that

70
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:33,000
CareFirst had been a had an intrusion

71
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,489
going on for 11 months the week before

72
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,379
that it was primeira the week before

73
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:45,090
that it was anthem etc etc etc the good

74
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:48,569
guys are just fixing damage right that's

75
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:53,129
all we're doing now the costs is in the

76
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:54,899
billions in one particular case that I'm

77
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:58,709
going to show you in a minute one

78
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:02,129
incident is in the billions CEOs are

79
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:04,620
getting fired boards are recognizing

80
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:06,810
that they have fiduciary risk the

81
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:12,329
president's talking about cybersecurity

82
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:15,019
in a State of the Union address as our

83
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:19,380
keynote speaker as Jim said this morning

84
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:21,719
would you have imagined a year ago that

85
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,139
a nation state was going to attack a

86
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:25,750
private company

87
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:28,960
in order to prevent a comedy from being

88
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:32,740
shown in a theater that may not be

89
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,930
exactly what happened there but publicly

90
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:37,389
anyway I mean can you we wouldn't have

91
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,870
even imagined that right until it

92
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:42,750
happened that's how bad it's gotten

93
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:45,900
we're not in a good place right now

94
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:51,789
if anybody thinks we are raise your hand

95
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:53,438
so I figured how did these things happen

96
00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:55,830
in the first place let's talk about that

97
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:55,830
for a minute

98
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:03,219
talk about Adobe does anybody know how

99
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:07,779
Adobe got exploited how they got

100
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:11,979
breached actually it was cool it was

101
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:15,460
cold fusion but Fergie closed so they

102
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:18,580
they had a server with a known

103
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:21,210
vulnerability with a patch with an

104
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:25,240
exploit in the wild there was a

105
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:27,430
development server was never supposed to

106
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,270
be connected to any production networks

107
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:34,330
or the Internet

108
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:36,580
accidentally miraculously one of the

109
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:39,669
interfaces on this server got turned on

110
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:44,349
so that it was accessible via the

111
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:46,960
Internet and a production network so

112
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:49,419
then it got exploited and then the

113
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,388
attacker was able to pivot into the

114
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:57,279
production networks warm his way around

115
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:58,629
until he found credit card data flash

116
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:01,990
source code

117
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:07,060
cold fusion source code Acrobat source

118
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:09,819
code and harvest all that data but the

119
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:14,860
main point I want to make is that it was

120
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:17,409
a known vulnerability on a system that

121
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:21,029
was never supposed to be accessible to

122
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:21,029
anything but test and Dev

123
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:29,069
how did homeland security get breached

124
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:31,959
last summer and turned into a botnet a

125
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:34,779
known vulnerability in this case a

126
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:35,950
default password that they elected not

127
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:39,540
to change

128
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:39,539
because it was on a test system

129
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:48,220
community health systems exploited by

130
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:50,080
heartbleed six eight months something

131
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,240
like that after heartbleed had come out

132
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,960
they thought they'd patched all their

133
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:59,320
heartbleed systems according to the

134
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:03,690
Verizon dbi are something like ninety

135
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:07,719
seven percent of all incidents in 2014

136
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:13,180
we're due to known vulnerabilities with

137
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:17,800
published exploits why am i hammering

138
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:19,890
this point because the problem today is

139
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:24,930
the same problem we had ten years ago

140
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:29,370
we're still not patching systems and

141
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:32,890
what is the real cost of that targets

142
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:34,570
publicly confirmed internal cost is two

143
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:41,590
hundred and thirty six million dollars

144
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:46,540
as of their q1 SEC filing which is a lot

145
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:50,080
of money okay but the credit card fraud

146
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:52,690
estimate and this is according to the

147
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,520
Charlotte Business Journal the credit

148
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:57,240
card fraud estimates between one point

149
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:00,159
two and two point two billion dollars

150
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:06,280
the card replacement costs are about

151
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:08,860
four hundred million dollars the card

152
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,630
brands and the banks have filed lawsuits

153
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,000
against target to recover that money

154
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:15,159
they're sick and tired of paying all of

155
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,460
that costs themselves and they're tired

156
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:22,030
of retailers not securing stuff and then

157
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:25,120
the fraud and the and the card

158
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:28,270
replacement costs get fall on to the

159
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:32,890
card brands and the banks if they win

160
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:37,380
that lawsuit target's going to be liable

161
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:43,409
for as much as three billion dollars

162
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:43,409
that's a lot of money even for target

163
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:52,110
so this is a real this is this is not in

164
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:53,189
the past your boards your CEOs weren't

165
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,740
too worried about it

166
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:58,290
seriously when they were talking about a

167
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:01,250
few tens of millions here and there they

168
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:04,769
could fix it after the fact

169
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:09,899
but when they see themselves facing

170
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:12,180
hundreds of millions even billions you

171
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:15,839
know what it just I'm not sure if you

172
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:18,388
know but to simply defend against that

173
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,610
lawsuit will cost target a couple

174
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:23,970
hundred million dollars in attorneys

175
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:26,430
fees internal costs producing all the

176
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:29,760
records that need to be produced all the

177
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:31,859
time of executives in court etc etc and

178
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,420
that's if they're successful and they

179
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:39,029
win the lawsuit couple hundred million

180
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:42,540
dollars that money comes out of net

181
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:45,089
income that money doesn't come because

182
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,670
nobody plans on four hundred five

183
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:50,790
hundred six hundred million dollars

184
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:52,709
worth of operating expense that they're

185
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:57,750
just going to set aside in case there's

186
00:09:52,709 --> 00:10:04,260
a breach so that's month that money is

187
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:08,610
being taken off the bottom line what's

188
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:10,079
leading to our inability to patch so now

189
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,890
that I've established that we have a

190
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:16,609
really big problem why can't we patch

191
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:18,779
it's not because we don't want to write

192
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:22,680
anybody in the room who doesn't want to

193
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:29,339
patch vulnerabilities I love it when I

194
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:31,680
don't get hands up anybody in your IT

195
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:35,730
operations group who doesn't want to

196
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:38,459
patch vulnerable systems but no no no no

197
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:41,329
seriously they want to patch them they

198
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:43,589
just want to do other things too right

199
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:44,819
it's not that they don't want to pack

200
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:49,079
them they have lots of competing

201
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:50,760
priorities so there was this time where

202
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:52,680
I finally was able to run a

203
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:56,130
vulnerability scan of my now

204
00:10:52,680 --> 00:11:00,079
work and I worked for a hospital system

205
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:03,180
that had 32 hospitals 70,000 employees

206
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:05,220
right hundred thousand-plus end points

207
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:08,819
when you counted them all up we ran a

208
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:10,890
bone scan and we got this thing that

209
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:14,760
said we had four hundred and ninety

210
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:18,029
thousand vulnerabilities and if you

211
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:22,050
printed the report it was like that okay

212
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:26,370
so can you imagine me the C so I take

213
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:30,300
this to my guy who's the VP of IT

214
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:31,920
operations works for the CIO and I set

215
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:35,819
that down on his desk and say hey could

216
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:39,000
you patch that stuff by Monday IT

217
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:42,570
operations wants to - but they don't

218
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,230
know what to do with it so he says he

219
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:47,820
says to me well what you want me to do

220
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,260
is scan and detect all the

221
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,350
vulnerabilities you want me to

222
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:54,890
prioritize them somehow for you and then

223
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:57,390
you want me to patch them by Monday I

224
00:11:54,890 --> 00:12:00,630
don't know how to do that I don't know

225
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:02,339
how they relate to my business this is

226
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,380
what he's telling me and I turned it

227
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:06,209
into bullet points for you I don't know

228
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:08,279
how they relate to my business I don't

229
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:12,900
know how to prioritize these problems

230
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:15,330
these vulnerabilities because you say

231
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,910
that it's a critical vulnerability but I

232
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:20,400
asked one of my team and it's sitting on

233
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:21,860
a test server we've heard this before

234
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:26,279
right

235
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:27,990
and so what happens is and then on top

236
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,760
of that you show up with heartbleed

237
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:33,959
screaming and yelling about how bad

238
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:38,850
heartbleed is the noisy news this is the

239
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:42,260
problem that not only security but IT

240
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:42,260
operations faces

241
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:52,170
it's a big data problem I know we've

242
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:55,900
heard it a million times right but it is

243
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:58,020
thousands of computers or more I had a

244
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:00,730
hundred and some odd thousand endpoints

245
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:02,670
imagine if you're like AT&T with over a

246
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,080
million endpoints

247
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:06,490
how many vulnerabilities how many

248
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:10,510
different ways can you be attacked

249
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:13,090
are they exploitable or not only

250
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:18,220
something like 5% of all vulnerabilities

251
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:20,350
get commonly exploited does that attack

252
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:23,820
pathway actually lead to sensitive data

253
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:26,320
or does it just end in a test network

254
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,180
this is a problem we have to solve

255
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,570
because otherwise you don't know what

256
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:33,250
the patch and what what the patch first

257
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:35,290
I'm not gonna say that something should

258
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,120
be left unpatched but the truth is it

259
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,880
probably will be if it's not critical

260
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:44,920
and we just have to live with that and

261
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:49,780
focus on the critical stuff remember I

262
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:51,370
said I took that stack to the so so it's

263
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:54,490
the same thing I just said but now you

264
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:57,540
can visualize the problem you're handing

265
00:13:54,490 --> 00:14:00,370
that off to this IT operations guy or

266
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:02,620
whatever whoever it is responsible for

267
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:06,250
it and he doesn't know what to do with

268
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:08,260
it this is why we need to change what

269
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:11,950
we're doing we need to actually grow up

270
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:16,210
and be mature about how we deal with

271
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:17,980
vulnerability management we need to know

272
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:21,520
these are the questions we have to be

273
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:25,180
asking do we know what vulnerabilities

274
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:27,430
threaten our business I'm sure the folks

275
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:31,599
at Adobe wanted to know that that

276
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:37,150
ColdFusion server was not patched and on

277
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:39,610
a attacked pathway how about scanning

278
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:42,340
are we doing it half hazard Li are we

279
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:45,730
you know actually doing it on a routine

280
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:48,880
normal basis do we know when things

281
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:52,090
change in our networks do we know at the

282
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:55,089
top hundred top ten ten threats are in

283
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:57,160
our network do you know where your

284
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:59,670
sensitive data is and how bad guys will

285
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,670
get to it

286
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:04,329
where does it fit in your security

287
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:08,470
program a lot of times we don't even

288
00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:10,180
know that right so this is my concept of

289
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,309
a security program yours might be

290
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:14,739
different but the goal is just to

291
00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:20,639
support the business objectives of the

292
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:23,740
organization threat and vulnerability

293
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:29,459
management is clearly part of assessing

294
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:33,850
risk so you assess risk then you design

295
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:36,969
your control systems your security

296
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:38,499
measures and you implement them and then

297
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:42,279
you monitor them to make sure that

298
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:45,309
nothing is going wrong and finally you

299
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:47,290
have wrap all of that up in security

300
00:15:45,309 --> 00:15:51,759
management which is policy and procedure

301
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:53,589
and that kind of thing and and that's

302
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,899
what your security program looks like

303
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:59,709
right well the thing we sometimes forget

304
00:15:55,899 --> 00:16:02,649
about certainly all the breaches that we

305
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:06,939
think of forgot about is to continuously

306
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:09,069
monitor because things change test

307
00:16:06,939 --> 00:16:11,349
servers get hooked up to the wrong

308
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:14,620
network new production servers get

309
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:22,029
brought online new vulnerabilities are

310
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:23,649
known etc etc so I come from a computer

311
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:26,139
engineering background system

312
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:30,069
engineering background I worked for ETS

313
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:33,389
for a long time and I like the Carnegie

314
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:36,599
Mellon maturity model so I used it as a

315
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:39,759
framework for vulnerability management

316
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:42,550
you know the concept right level zero of

317
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:47,529
means you have no program at all level

318
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:53,740
five means you're mature so something

319
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:56,170
like this non-existent you you don't

320
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:58,779
even scan maybe at best you do like

321
00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:03,939
Microsoft Patch Tuesday which is going

322
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:06,490
to go away sort of all the way to I'm

323
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:10,740
doing my vulnerability management within

324
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:10,740
the context of risk to my business

325
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:17,209
so I'll talk a little bit about each

326
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,150
step and then you guys can grill me and

327
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:24,530
tell me how I'm wrong or or challenge me

328
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:28,730
or whatever you want to do first thing

329
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:31,730
to do is get the basics in order right

330
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:34,850
if we are non existent we need to get to

331
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:36,530
this point we need to start we need to

332
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,820
have some kind of vulnerability scanner

333
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:42,350
because you have to know what the

334
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:44,780
vulnerabilities on your network are this

335
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:48,820
may include adding in web application

336
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:53,540
scanners etc depending on your scenario

337
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:56,480
you have to create emerging processes of

338
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:59,060
some sort for patching it could be as

339
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,090
simple as we're going to patch known

340
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:04,460
Microsoft vulnerabilities once they

341
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:06,740
release their newest set of

342
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:09,260
vulnerabilities on Tuesday it could be

343
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:13,370
that simple but you've got to have some

344
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:16,340
kind of a process and hopefully you can

345
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:20,389
gain some agreement from IT operations

346
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:22,820
on that process IT operations is very

347
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:24,650
processed driven so if you show up with

348
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:26,919
a process they're likely to pay

349
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:30,470
attention to you if you show up with a

350
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:37,070
fix this they're likely to say can't do

351
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:39,470
it moving from there we want to start

352
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:42,230
actually managing vulnerabilities so as

353
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:45,950
we get more mature we're moving we're

354
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:49,360
moving along that line right so now we

355
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:52,000
want to build real processes not just a

356
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:56,360
identify vulnerability patch

357
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,210
vulnerability but processes that have

358
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:01,070
some sort of a driver to them that tells

359
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:05,360
me what to patch first and what to patch

360
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:08,960
second and I know compliance is a really

361
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:12,620
bad word in security but honestly at

362
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,360
this stage very immature adopt a

363
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:19,669
compliance framework because it gives

364
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:21,409
you something to work with them PCI

365
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:24,650
HIPAA

366
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:28,010
next I don't care what it is

367
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:35,210
pick something so that you have a place

368
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:36,850
to live within seriously because if if

369
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:39,470
you're at least patching all the

370
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:41,120
vulnerabilities with a CVS s of seven

371
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:45,260
and higher you're patching something

372
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:48,050
right yes I know you can be exploited

373
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:51,100
off of four but patching somethings

374
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:52,250
better than patching nothing whoops

375
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:58,370
sorry

376
00:19:52,250 --> 00:20:00,200
I meant to hit the and that helps with

377
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:03,679
that data overload because at least now

378
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:05,780
I can sort that report by CBS s or

379
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:09,710
whatever my compliance framework says to

380
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:12,200
do right and I can create some sort of

381
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:14,210
metrics around it metrics are a good

382
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,430
thing if you happen to do vulnerability

383
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:20,300
management work even if you're not the C

384
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:21,830
so you can create metrics that say last

385
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,930
month we have four hundred and ninety

386
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:25,250
five thousand vulnerabilities of those

387
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:27,470
four hundred ninety five thousand

388
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:30,020
vulnerabilities one hundred I'm making

389
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:32,330
the numbers up one hundred and thirty

390
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:34,430
two thousand of them had a CVS s of

391
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:37,850
seven or higher that's what we had last

392
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:41,420
month we did some patching we did a new

393
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:44,149
scan now we have four hundred and eighty

394
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:46,280
thousand vulnerabilities and only a

395
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:49,310
hundred and twenty one thousand of them

396
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:51,760
have that cbss of seven or higher we're

397
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,760
improving

398
00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:04,250
thanks Paul

399
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:08,480
the it well it's happened it does happen

400
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:12,350
yes yeah I'm talking in the abstract no

401
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,940
it happens it absolutely happens I could

402
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:16,639
tell you the horror stories about the

403
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,690
other side of this trying to get people

404
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:21,610
to recognize that there's

405
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:24,289
vulnerabilities and systems etc I won't

406
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:29,149
get some kind of a management lifecycle

407
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:35,149
going some sort of recognition that we

408
00:21:29,149 --> 00:21:40,879
have to scan assess prioritize patch

409
00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:44,539
measure right and do a penetration test

410
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:50,899
find out if there's an attack path into

411
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:53,149
your network I'm sure there is but as we

412
00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:56,689
saw at Step three now we're starting to

413
00:21:53,149 --> 00:21:58,610
get to a moderate level of maturity this

414
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:01,639
is where a lot of people want to be they

415
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:03,908
they have solved they are solving their

416
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:06,709
data overload problems at this point

417
00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:09,769
they may not be getting to optimization

418
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:11,419
in the high-end risk management but

419
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:13,429
they're starting to solve the overload

420
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:17,500
problem and they're starting to do risk

421
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:20,389
based patching so risk based patching

422
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:22,370
says instead of patching because it's

423
00:22:20,389 --> 00:22:24,289
the CBS s of seven because we all

424
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:29,918
because sometimes you can write to mitre

425
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:34,908
and get that score change and sometimes

426
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:38,840
your CBS s is four but there's a known

427
00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:43,340
exploit and the system has a pathway to

428
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:47,480
a critical asset so patching the 7 and

429
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:51,129
higher didn't help you right so now we

430
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:56,120
want to be risk-based this vulnerability

431
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:58,399
leads to a critical asset regardless of

432
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,918
the score and this vulnerability over

433
00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:03,989
here leads to nothing so I don't care

434
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:11,100
about that one I care about this one

435
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:13,620
that's and that's that's getting your

436
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:18,179
prioritization to a more advanced stage

437
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:20,389
right and your metrics now focus on

438
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:23,580
improving security not just measuring

439
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:25,590
how many vulnerabilities I had and do I

440
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:29,370
have less or more than I had last month

441
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:32,970
but now we want to focus our metrics on

442
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:36,810
things like this vulnerability by

443
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:40,950
eliminating it killed an attack path to

444
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:43,320
a critical asset how many how many

445
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:46,560
assets did I have with vulnerabilities

446
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:49,250
that led me to critical assets and do I

447
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:53,720
have less of those than I had last month

448
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:58,050
right that's improving security not just

449
00:23:53,720 --> 00:24:03,830
patching stuff and you want your

450
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:03,830
processes to actually be measurable so

451
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:09,210
how many people worked on how many

452
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:15,450
vulnerabilities over what period of time

453
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:18,890
things like that at this point you start

454
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:25,170
using pen testing for validation

455
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:29,400
so a IT ops guy says yep I patched that

456
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:31,260
and I broke that pathway so now you come

457
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,720
back and you get with your red team guys

458
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:36,150
or your external pen testers whoever

459
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,640
does that work for you and say could you

460
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:42,770
check could you validate that let's

461
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:46,190
prove that we actually fix that problem

462
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:46,190
that make sense

463
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:54,850
as we start thinking about the attacker

464
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:57,520
instead of ourselves we're really

465
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:59,919
starting to get to a an advanced level

466
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,980
of maturity not everybody is going to do

467
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:07,570
this necessarily that's okay it's not

468
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:09,400
the end of the world but if you do you

469
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:12,129
start doing things like continuous

470
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:16,870
processes all right so instead of I

471
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:19,630
scanned this week I patch this week I do

472
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:21,820
my metrics this week I rest on this week

473
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:24,640
and then I start the whole thing all

474
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:27,330
over again instead it's going to be

475
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,040
something more like I am running a

476
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:34,720
continuous set of activities I'm

477
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:37,750
scanning patching measuring all the time

478
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,790
on a routine basis and every time

479
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:41,590
somebody says I patched stuff that kicks

480
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:46,780
off a new cycle of scanning and

481
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:52,090
measuring instead of doing it in the IP

482
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:55,720
scan on Monday sort of way of doing life

483
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:58,629
that process now ties together security

484
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:02,520
and operations IT operations it's not

485
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:05,170
two separate processes anymore it is

486
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:07,810
security identifying the vulnerabilities

487
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:11,380
sending a data file off to IT operations

488
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:13,929
IT operations receiving it in that

489
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:16,390
kicking off a process with NIT

490
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:22,270
operations to patch the most critical

491
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:24,640
things immediately and we start picking

492
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:27,310
on other threat vectors besides just our

493
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,280
network right up to this point we've

494
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:31,510
probably only dealt with network threats

495
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:34,570
but there's a lot of other threats or

496
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:37,720
social engineering there's Wi-Fi there's

497
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:40,360
mobile devices there's web de network

498
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,860
there's web develop there's all kinds of

499
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,719
threat vectors that you need to take

500
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:46,830
into consideration so we're going to

501
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,830
start adding those in

502
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:55,710
hopefully you can contain the social

503
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,030
engineering at the client device right

504
00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:01,590
away that would be ideal but if you

505
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:05,190
can't it would be really good to know

506
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:08,100
that that once the you know so what

507
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:10,860
happened at primeira anthem and probably

508
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:13,050
a care first from what we know is that

509
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:17,669
they had a social engineering attack

510
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:20,879
using typos squatting that enabled the

511
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:23,670
client machine to be compromised and the

512
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,950
client machines had they were

513
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:28,620
compromised down to a operating

514
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:32,280
system-level and then they had pathways

515
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:34,830
to servers inside those networks and the

516
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:40,920
databases did not have multi-factor

517
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:44,250
authentication and in place see how that

518
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:46,140
so we had a vulnerable browse we had a

519
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:48,750
vulnerable user vulnerable browser

520
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:50,700
vulnerable operating system and then we

521
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:54,840
had weak authentication security on our

522
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:58,320
database and that's how they did it it

523
00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:02,000
well if you had done what I just talked

524
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,350
about which is under stuck her

525
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,810
social engineering was not a valid

526
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:12,330
threat vector or if it was then breaking

527
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:16,350
it at the operating system level of the

528
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:18,570
client machine or enabling multi-factor

529
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:20,879
authentication on the database for

530
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:24,139
privileged access any of those things

531
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,880
would have broke in that attack pathway

532
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:28,890
but you didn't understand how all that I

533
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,780
don't mean you guys I mean the the

534
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:32,340
people that happened to didn't

535
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:34,920
understand how all that stuff gets

536
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:39,389
strung together in order to compromise a

537
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:41,220
database and now we're moving into

538
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:43,080
formalized penetration testing that

539
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,350
shows us that that can happen to us

540
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,350
right

541
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,039
if you get to this really if you get to

542
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:56,690
this point you're really good most

543
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:58,399
people won't but if you do you have now

544
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:00,379
built business goals into your

545
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:02,750
vulnerability management program so you

546
00:29:00,379 --> 00:29:07,399
understand that your business has a goal

547
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:13,460
of growing same-store revenue

548
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:15,830
year-over-year and specific IT assets

549
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:18,500
are involved in supporting that business

550
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:21,289
goal so those are going to be more

551
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,789
important to me than sharepoint over

552
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:27,259
here that's not involved in this

553
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:30,320
business goal right so I want to support

554
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:32,179
my business strategy by making sure that

555
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:36,100
I reduce the risk to the things that

556
00:29:32,179 --> 00:29:38,840
support my business strategy first I

557
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:44,509
want to make sure that I've aligned what

558
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:46,428
IT security and the business are doing I

559
00:29:44,509 --> 00:29:50,179
want to make sure that all threat

560
00:29:46,429 --> 00:29:52,519
vectors are considered now so I named

561
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:54,110
off most of the threat vectors I want to

562
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:57,289
make sure I'm looking at all of them now

563
00:29:54,110 --> 00:30:00,229
not just limiting myself to let's say

564
00:29:57,289 --> 00:30:03,440
social engineering and network because

565
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:07,940
that's pretty common but what if I have

566
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:12,139
a you know sequel injection flaw in my

567
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:14,240
web server and it's supporting database

568
00:30:12,139 --> 00:30:16,008
and they can get in that way and I

569
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,409
haven't considered web to network I've

570
00:30:16,009 --> 00:30:23,000
only looked at the social engineering

571
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:26,120
client Network attack as an example or

572
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,139
mobile attacks or you know I need to

573
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:31,070
look at all of those Wi-Fi

574
00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:32,719
man-in-the-middle etc and vulnerability

575
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:34,639
metrics those metrics we've been

576
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:39,740
building over time they now become risk

577
00:30:34,639 --> 00:30:41,719
indicators if I'm not patching so I've

578
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:44,389
got us I've got this business goal of

579
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:46,909
same-store revenue growth year over year

580
00:30:44,389 --> 00:30:49,129
and I have cash management systems that

581
00:30:46,909 --> 00:30:52,279
are part of supporting that business

582
00:30:49,129 --> 00:30:55,250
goal and the number of vulnerabilities

583
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:59,809
and attack paths on my cash management

584
00:30:55,250 --> 00:31:01,220
systems are going up not down I have a

585
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:05,149
risk to the

586
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:06,860
business at that point right and that is

587
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:14,990
the kind of thing that actually makes

588
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:16,668
non IT people pay attention so I'm just

589
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:18,710
going to show you a couple of ideas of

590
00:31:16,669 --> 00:31:20,809
what it can look like in practice it

591
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:23,240
takes work it takes products it takes

592
00:31:20,809 --> 00:31:25,580
processes and it takes people to do this

593
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:27,830
I'm not going to advocate any of those

594
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:30,770
things to you but I'm going to show you

595
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:33,610
some of the ways that this that that it

596
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:36,559
could look like for you

597
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:38,510
building prioritize the tak paths into

598
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:41,418
your network so this is a web

599
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:44,870
application server with that sequel

600
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:47,809
injection flan and from there directly

601
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:51,408
connected to it as a database that has

602
00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:58,428
an operating system vulnerability that I

603
00:31:51,409 --> 00:32:00,280
can get to this thing and I don't get

604
00:31:58,429 --> 00:32:04,309
along

605
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:08,330
etc etc and that pathway leads me to

606
00:32:04,309 --> 00:32:11,090
this critical business asset let's say

607
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:12,980
it's your credit card database that

608
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:14,689
seems kind of simplistic considering

609
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:18,740
some of the things we've seen lately but

610
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:20,659
but let's say it is right so so

611
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:25,159
understanding what this attack path

612
00:32:20,659 --> 00:32:29,679
looks like is important to understanding

613
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:33,230
where where and how to protect yourself

614
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:37,520
all of these are vulnerable systems but

615
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:40,090
only these lead me to here so those are

616
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:43,460
the ones I want to worry about first

617
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:49,610
because that makes a significant

618
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:52,309
measurable risk difference I want to

619
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:58,280
continuously monitor why do I want to

620
00:32:52,309 --> 00:33:00,980
continuously monitor because because how

621
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:03,440
many examples did I give you of people

622
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:07,549
who were breached by changes they didn't

623
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:10,480
know about or vulnerabilities they were

624
00:33:07,549 --> 00:33:10,480
unaware of

625
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:23,020
so static one-time scams static one-time

626
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:24,460
Network diagrams are not enough and by

627
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:26,560
the way your network

628
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:29,620
the way you diagram it and the way IT

629
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:32,830
operations diagrams it not how it looks

630
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:38,199
to the attacker so you might want to

631
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:39,760
consider really the thing you might want

632
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,130
to consider this because this is how it

633
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:45,390
looks to your bad guy you guys are

634
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:48,880
laughing oh man my slides aren't you

635
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:51,040
alright and the last thing and I think I

636
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,840
have about five minutes right the last

637
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:55,030
thing is you want to connect with the

638
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,530
business you want the business to

639
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:58,660
understand that there are critical

640
00:33:56,530 --> 00:34:01,770
business assets that have to be

641
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:04,750
protected and that can be protected I

642
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:08,790
just had dinner last week with a guy who

643
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:14,710
used to be a senior vice president of a

644
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:16,960
multi-billion dollar business unit of a

645
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:18,929
large healthcare system a friend of mine

646
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,400
had dinner with him he's retired

647
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:24,450
semi-retired he does it comes the

648
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:27,639
consulting thing now and I said you know

649
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:29,980
our perception and security is that CEOs

650
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:33,159
aren't all that worried about or aware

651
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:36,429
of the threat and the risk and he said

652
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:38,440
no that's not true but they think that

653
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:43,690
their security guys are taking care of

654
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:45,190
it so you need to connect with the

655
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:48,240
business and make it clear that that's

656
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:48,240
not always the case

657
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:57,830
so the last thing I'll and and I believe

658
00:34:54,860 --> 00:35:00,020
that we can make this all these slides

659
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:01,700
available if not you guys can all reach

660
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:08,240
out to me and I'll give them to you no

661
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:09,830
matter what this is how you figure out

662
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,560
where you want to be and what you want

663
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:14,840
to do and then you set about doing it

664
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,630
whether you're a practitioner or a

665
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:21,110
manager or a director or a security

666
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:24,020
executive you figure out ways to move

667
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:25,400
yourself along that maturity model

668
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:30,440
because it makes things better for your

669
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:32,270
business and at the end of the day it

670
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,610
actually results in some really cool

671
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:37,100
things like more operational efficiency

672
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:39,100
if you're figuring out what if you've

673
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:41,060
figured out which priority which

674
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,970
vulnerabilities are a priority and

675
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:45,410
you've solved that data overload problem

676
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:46,819
there's some operational efficiency

677
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:49,160
there right because all of a sudden

678
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:51,140
instead of sorting spreadsheets you're

679
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:55,270
focusing on taking care of risk to the

680
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:55,270
business which is what you're paid to do

681
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:01,610
just to give you and of course that

682
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:04,040
bottom line right I'm afraid to touch

683
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:10,880
this now but that bottom line you're

684
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:12,410
much less likely to be these guys all

685
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,040
right however much time we have I'll

686
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:22,220
take questions two minutes so that means

687
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:29,740
probably one other than Paul's question

688
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:29,740
about sending emails to mitre yeah

689
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:11,700
right so security and IT offer essential

690
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:13,290
EIT delivery to the business right so I

691
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:15,480
was just having that conversation this

692
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:24,390
morning actually it's a great question

693
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:27,210
so the if you think about this there's a

694
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:29,910
point so if i if i patch something and i

695
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:33,570
create a problem for the business that's

696
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:35,160
a risk if i don't patch something and it

697
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:38,010
creates a problem to the business it's

698
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:40,799
also a risk and what you need to do is

699
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:44,190
determine when one risk outweighs the

700
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,349
other one not easy to do but this is

701
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:50,790
where we need to start involving the

702
00:37:46,349 --> 00:37:52,320
business in the conversation saying if i

703
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:54,900
patch the server you're going to lose

704
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:57,510
some functionality however i will reduce

705
00:37:54,900 --> 00:38:01,200
the risk of a bad guys stealing credit

706
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:04,140
cards which one of those ways higher and

707
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,759
lower for you that's the that's the

708
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:08,640
question that has to be asked and that's

709
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,500
in somebody else's hands but you need to

710
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,259
put it in the right hands that's the

711
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:17,670
real and give them a real honest-to-god

712
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:18,450
measurement of risk not not a throw my

713
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:21,869
hands in the air

714
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:28,040
fudge sky is falling but look this

715
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:32,430
servers on an attack path to this yep

716
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:35,070
that helped great I think that's the end

717
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:36,690
of my time thank you for paying

718
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:42,630
attention thank you for putting up with

719
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:45,300
my slides if you want the slide deck let

720
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:48,140
me know give me a way to recontact you

721
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,140
and i'll send it to you
