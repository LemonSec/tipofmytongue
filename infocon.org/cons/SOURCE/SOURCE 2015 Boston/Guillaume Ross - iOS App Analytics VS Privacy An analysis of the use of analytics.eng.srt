1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,310
so my name is Guillaume and today I'm

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,660
gonna talk about app analytics

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:09,629
especially on iOS most of what I'm gonna

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:12,150
say and show would actually apply on on

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,530
different platforms it's just I pick you

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,890
know the platform that I use the most

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,840
myself so before we start I just wanted

8
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,660
to notes related to my presentation I

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,640
just yellow changed my color scheme

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,160
because the screen was too dark so there

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,080
might be some weird color things that we

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,369
might see and I also don't have sound

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,528
coming out from my laptop so I might

14
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:33,450
need to act out some videos that I have

15
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:34,829
in there so you'll see what's going on

16
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,200
I'll just tell you what's supposed to be

17
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,809
happening I think there's gonna be even

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,210
better so I work at rapid7 in strategic

19
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:45,059
services it's my second time speaking at

20
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:48,450
source and I live north of the wall as

21
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:51,599
my accent might have tipped you off so

22
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:54,510
first of all what are app analytics the

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,070
services provided to developers that

24
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,469
help them gain insight into how their

25
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,539
apps are being used and that can be used

26
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:02,940
for many different purposes so if you're

27
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,680
a UI designer maybe you want to know are

28
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,729
there options that people don't use

29
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,619
because they don't see where they are

30
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,119
where are people clicking if you're

31
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,770
doing troubleshooting you might want to

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,780
be able to replace sessions and see

33
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,789
what's actually going on or you might

34
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,409
you might want to take crashed on from

35
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,420
an application and investigate that

36
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,729
there's multiple you know completely

37
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,360
valid reasons why developers are using

38
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:26,460
app analytics so think of them as

39
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,729
basically just google analytics but in

40
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,179
your apps and so obligatory SEO for

41
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:32,250
talks

42
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:37,829
I just wrote Internet of Things in there

43
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:41,400
and cats so app analytics became like a

44
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:43,110
popular topic right before the iPad was

45
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,210
released so I don't know if you remember

46
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,430
before the iPad wasn't that long ago it

47
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,750
does feel like super long ago but there

48
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,340
were a lot of rumors about Apple

49
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,530
releasing a tablet everyone was

50
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,049
wondering is that gonna run OS 10 is

51
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,259
that gonna run iOS and then people were

52
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,579
pretty sure that was gonna run iOS 4 and

53
00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:01,229
out of nowhere there's these guys

54
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,899
working at flurry which is a company

55
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:05,969
that's out now owned by Yahoo they said

56
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:09,179
oh we've seen devices connecting from

57
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:12,299
Cupertino with a resolution of like 1024

58
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:14,940
by 768 doesn't look like a phone

59
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,520
and it's running iOS 3.2 so therefore we

60
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,410
say that the rumor is saying that the

61
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,540
tablet no one knew was gonna be called

62
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:24,630
iPad yet no one was even making fun of

63
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:27,390
the name yet it's not gonna run iOS 4

64
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:29,790
it's gonna run 3.2 and that turned out

65
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,440
turned out to be true and then Steve

66
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:35,010
Jobs basically just said that's an

67
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,620
actual quote he said this is pissing us

68
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:40,769
off this is violating privacy policies

69
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,390
from the App Store developers are

70
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,340
picking that code from these companies

71
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,529
putting it into all of their apps and

72
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,720
then we're testing and that happens so

73
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,330
the the App Store won't allow that

74
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:55,440
anymore unless you're using analytics

75
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:56,910
specifically for advertising and that

76
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,770
was interesting because how are you

77
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,540
going to enforce that right the App

78
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:02,970
Store is pretty restrictive on a lot of

79
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:05,429
things but there are some rules that

80
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,950
never ever seem to get enforced so for

81
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:10,140
example I like who's received a push

82
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:12,239
notification that was more like an ad or

83
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,369
something like hey you want to play this

84
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,209
game or just buy more of this you're not

85
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:19,920
supposed to do that it's an Apple

86
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:22,200
engineer or like the App Store guy going

87
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,640
to install your game and wait for 48

88
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,290
days to see if he ever gets a

89
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,339
notification about that no so that's the

90
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:30,929
type of stuff that doesn't really get

91
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:35,070
enforced so where does your data go and

92
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:38,370
that's the part where it goes to the

93
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:41,130
cloud like Microsoft so that's from the

94
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,720
league is there any football fantasy

95
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,549
football fan around here so all my

96
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,780
quotes are from the league so your data

97
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:51,360
goes to the cloud so who gets your data

98
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:53,430
what data is sent and what do they do

99
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,459
with it these were you know questions I

100
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:58,860
had and mostly were paid apps better

101
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,540
than the free apps when it came to the

102
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,790
amount of data that was sent in the type

103
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:06,090
of data that was sent so what I did is I

104
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:08,880
picked a few apps I took the top five

105
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:11,010
free and the top five paid games I took

106
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:14,579
the top five free utilities from the App

107
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:18,209
Store then I took the top five paid non

108
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:20,040
games when I seen on games I mean top

109
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:21,720
everything that is not a game so not a

110
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,180
specific category just like acts

111
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,889
actually excluding games and the reason

112
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,300
I did not even bother with the free

113
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:29,430
and that category is because we're all

114
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,499
social networks which have like their

115
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,539
own way of getting your data obviously

116
00:04:31,499 --> 00:04:35,490
and then I just took my selection of

117
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:37,139
apps that I already had on my phone and

118
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,960
that was already using so I could

119
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:42,060
compare that to what is actually popular

120
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,739
so this isn't really science first of

121
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,229
all I skipped over apps made by Apple

122
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,139
Google Microsoft these guys have their

123
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:52,258
own ways of you know they're big

124
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:53,969
companies they do their own analytics so

125
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:56,969
it's different than those using third

126
00:04:53,969 --> 00:04:58,590
parties the apps I manually selected I

127
00:04:56,969 --> 00:05:00,449
did pick them before I started you know

128
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,159
poking at them and seeing what was being

129
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:04,409
transferred but I have no way of proving

130
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:06,029
that so could be just saying anything I

131
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:08,969
excluded some apps that were too

132
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:10,860
expensive I didn't manage to expense a

133
00:05:08,969 --> 00:05:14,069
copy of Minecraft for iOS through that

134
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:18,719
though and I used the top lists from

135
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:20,159
January 30th the Canadian App Store

136
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,330
lists but there's a lot of stuff in

137
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:23,610
there that you'll see is actually

138
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:27,330
there's some overlay so these were the

139
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:29,370
top 5 free games I'm sure like a lot of

140
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:31,830
you have played at least one of game in

141
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:34,349
there or seen it terrific crack really

142
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:36,419
popular cross 0 as well if your high

143
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:37,650
score is above 500 in cross the road I

144
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:41,008
really hate you and you should probably

145
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:43,620
get a life then these are the top five

146
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:45,870
paid games with their price so minecraft

147
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,399
was the most expensive one and then

148
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,689
there's trivia crack again because

149
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:50,009
there's a paid version of it that's

150
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:54,089
slightly different like it doesn't show

151
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:58,620
ads as Sons of Anarchy game and heads up

152
00:05:54,089 --> 00:06:01,169
which is ellen degeneres game so just

153
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,300
these were the top the top ones then in

154
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:04,620
the top five paid non games the first

155
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,469
thing that i noticed that was

156
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,789
interesting is there's a lot of stuff

157
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:11,069
that then makes sense at all in there is

158
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:13,860
just was weird so one of them that

159
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:15,449
that's paid that's not free so the first

160
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,460
app and that the name of the app is

161
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:21,089
Marco Polo find your phone by shouting

162
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:24,899
Marco I guess that's for when Find My

163
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:26,639
iPhone is actually too convenient so I'm

164
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:28,589
like what is this app like what does it

165
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,539
act should we do so you you give it

166
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:32,669
access to your microphone at all times

167
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:35,279
like that seem like a perfectly

168
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:38,639
reasonable thing to do right then you

169
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:40,289
just go back to your home screen

170
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,870
you'll see on top it's running in the

171
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:45,930
background and then I'm yelling Marco

172
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:49,529
and it just replies polo with the

173
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:50,969
creepiest voice you have ever heard top

174
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:52,830
paid app in the App Store

175
00:06:50,969 --> 00:06:54,449
Canadian App Store at the end of January

176
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:57,210
people were still drunk from Christmas I

177
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:59,550
guess second app and that's again the

178
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:02,248
name of the app stick texting the emoji

179
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:06,719
emoticons killer emoticon emojis that

180
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:09,930
just screams quality pay that Dana had

181
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:11,849
afterlife photo manipulation app j-tube

182
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,199
music for YouTube background and Bob a

183
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:16,080
lot like the name of the app is like

184
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,789
that wrong it didn't even fit and face

185
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,909
tune which is basically just an image

186
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:22,650
manipulation photo to make you look

187
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:24,509
better in like a selfie or something

188
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,310
like that so first I was thinking like

189
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:28,319
the app store search might suck and

190
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:30,479
might be getting gamed because every

191
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,159
name of every app is like a kilometre

192
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,680
long that would be pretty depressing if

193
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:37,560
I was an iOS developer interested in

194
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,089
making actual useful software and no

195
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,439
offense to afterlife because that was

196
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:42,990
one in there that actually seemed to be

197
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:45,270
pretty good so you see them right here

198
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:47,779
just notice the icon for stick texting

199
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:52,770
the emoji emoticons killer emoticon

200
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:54,539
emojis screams quality again it has

201
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:56,938
nothing to do with emoji it's just

202
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:58,919
animated gifs I don't I don't know why

203
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:01,349
so three out of five

204
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:03,779
really sounded like low-quality apps on

205
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:05,909
I wonder will they use analytics more

206
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:07,469
than the other ones what's gonna happen

207
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:08,610
and then these are the ones that I

208
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:10,500
picked

209
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,089
delivery's it's just an app to track you

210
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,789
know all the stuff you buy on Amazon and

211
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:18,180
from Apple and whatever podcast client

212
00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:19,710
RSS client Twitter client and slack

213
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,210
which is you know what if the app is

214
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:23,068
free but it can go with a paid service

215
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:25,109
so again I'm sure some of you in here

216
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:28,919
that our iOS people use at least one of

217
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:32,550
these so the first thing that I did was

218
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:34,228
let's just look at my network what does

219
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:36,929
it look like when I run one of these

220
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:39,839
apps so the first one I tried most

221
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:41,578
popular game was perfect crack so what

222
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,490
you see on the left is my testing iPhone

223
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:46,439
was be launching trivia crack and what

224
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:49,860
you see on the right is is a sniffer

225
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:52,420
this is a subgraph subgraph Bega open

226
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,010
source proxy really good tool

227
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:56,290
so I'm just running the app it's not

228
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:58,330
even done and I know you can't see the

229
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:01,900
text but everything as you see right

230
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:04,810
here that's black is a domain that's

231
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:06,790
being contacted not even playing yet and

232
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:09,760
I'm just connecting to so many different

233
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:11,860
hosts and most of them are not directly

234
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,630
related to the actual gameplay so I

235
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:16,120
thought that was interesting then I

236
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:18,939
looked at just get then you know similar

237
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,500
game so as soon as I run it you know I'm

238
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,770
not even done loading the app it just

239
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:25,240
goes age you want push notifications and

240
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:27,280
it's already contacting a bunch of

241
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,420
different hosts you can see there's a

242
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,900
bunch of double click stop and

243
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:34,510
advertising related domains in there

244
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:36,730
then obviously some apple and iCloud

245
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:39,240
related stuff well that's that's a lot

246
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:41,470
of domains then what about Crossy Road I

247
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,090
can't and we're not gonna do this for

248
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,520
the 25 apps you know don't worry about

249
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:47,470
that so crusty road again pretty similar

250
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:50,380
you know you're just launching it you're

251
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:52,480
not even you know past the splash screen

252
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,920
in some in some instances and it's

253
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,930
already you know sending a lot of stuff

254
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:02,140
so you see the first thing it contacted

255
00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:03,729
was API game analytics comm and that's

256
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:06,460
something that we'll see again so

257
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,810
remember that name game unless so then I

258
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:11,350
wanted to compare that with the paid

259
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:14,050
games so what I did what you see on the

260
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:16,780
left is at five times the real time

261
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:19,209
speed is me playing each of these games

262
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:21,790
with for one minute and on the right the

263
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:23,110
pains for one minute again the text

264
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:27,069
doesn't matter just look at the scroll

265
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:32,050
bar the amount of systems that are being

266
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:34,120
contacted by my free games is much

267
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:36,640
greater than on the paved game and what

268
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:39,100
you see in great is actually just DNS

269
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,050
requests so there's some games that are

270
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,120
making a lot of DNS requests for iCloud

271
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:47,079
servers and things like that but that

272
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,580
was way more so then we have a video

273
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,670
with no sound and it says something

274
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:53,620
about looking at numbers and letters

275
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:59,860
like they mean something well do they

276
00:10:53,620 --> 00:11:02,110
well first of all red means stop so has

277
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,810
anyone ever used Little Snitch or a

278
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:06,390
similar application level

279
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:08,699
I think for mac so Bobby here everyone

280
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:10,350
else think you should if you had a

281
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,180
little snitch on your iPhone you would

282
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,500
probably kill yourself before you play

283
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,359
one of these games because it would just

284
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,710
take you like two hours to understand

285
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,529
the firewall the rules that go with that

286
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:24,630
so five free games for one minute that's

287
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:27,689
90 hosts impacted by fave games for 1

288
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:30,779
minute that's 27 most of which were

289
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:33,089
apple and iCloud related but then I

290
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:35,339
noticed there are there were a lot of

291
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:38,250
common services between paid and free so

292
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:40,200
crashlytics that's service two together

293
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:42,990
you know crash comes from from your apps

294
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,820
game analytics came back pretty often

295
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:48,960
another one called mobile app tracking

296
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:51,750
and flurry was a popular one then SSL

297
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:55,110
and TLS did people use that the people

298
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:56,040
even bother to use that no people using

299
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:59,580
crashlytics

300
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,779
yes because I crash Linux or system - so

301
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,070
everything that we're gonna see later

302
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:04,350
about the type of data that is being

303
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:05,700
sent remember that for me most of these

304
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,830
apps they don't even bother to encrypt

305
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,480
that and that was just a video you know

306
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:12,380
saying something about motorcycle

307
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,030
helmets not having any scientific proof

308
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:18,060
for you know actually helping motorcycle

309
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:20,670
drivers so just like SSL right there's

310
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:26,310
no proof it's useful so what kind of

311
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:28,770
data gets transferred so that's game

312
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,300
analytics again just look at the three

313
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:32,420
things that are highlighted you don't

314
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:35,130
it's the same string in different

315
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:37,770
contexts you don't need to see the

316
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:39,480
string it looks like a gooood so that's

317
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:43,110
a unique identifier for the device you

318
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:45,210
have most of these apps use game

319
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:47,070
analytics and that string was the same

320
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:48,990
within all of these apps so even though

321
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:51,180
each developer might not have the full

322
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:52,470
picture these guys do you know every

323
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:56,280
game you have on your device that uses

324
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:58,440
that so they get a lot of information on

325
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,730
you the developers get some information

326
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,440
but they actually can actually put it

327
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:04,020
back together and build a profile on it

328
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,610
so because that was one that was shared

329
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,770
you know between all of these different

330
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:11,010
games I wondered what does their privacy

331
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:14,850
policy look like and yeah train wreck

332
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:16,260
dot PNG so I'm not a lawyer I can see at

333
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:18,800
least one in a room

334
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:21,480
there's other ones but so it starts with

335
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,060
we use your personal information mainly

336
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,950
to provide services so that sounds like

337
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:30,599
a really strong legal term right we

338
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:32,550
mainly use it for that your information

339
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,230
is used for validation purposes but

340
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:36,000
might also be used to send you

341
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:38,250
additional promotional information about

342
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,740
our services oh you're like also that

343
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,840
you know that's a little bit like me

344
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,250
tongue Bob like give me your keys I'll

345
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,560
go park your car and maybe do a little

346
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:49,200
street racing with it but just a little

347
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,020
bit right I won't get arrested so it's

348
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,880
not like you'll care what kind of

349
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:55,650
information do you get IP addresses the

350
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,080
Vice events a lot of information about

351
00:13:55,650 --> 00:14:00,209
your your hardware might be applications

352
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,560
installed on it cookies that might

353
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:03,030
identify your browser if you're the

354
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,520
developer so just like a lot of

355
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:07,439
information but they say you can get

356
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,970
that removed see six point one on how to

357
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:14,010
do this so we'll get back to that later

358
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:16,890
oh we have a bunch of third parties to

359
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:19,080
optimize your experience we might share

360
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:20,550
that with them okay all right

361
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:24,270
that really sounds like it's going to

362
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:26,400
improve my experience and that was my

363
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:29,100
favorite one they say we may use

364
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:32,280
standard internet technologies such as

365
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:35,160
web beacons now there is an RFC for

366
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:38,459
something called web beacons it's not

367
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,560
for clear gif and yes I pronounce them

368
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,780
gif like yone just good that's cooler

369
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,609
like that or pixel pads so they're

370
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:47,220
calling it transparent image used for

371
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:50,490
tracking purposes the standard Internet

372
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,960
technology that's interesting and they

373
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,590
might also track you in the email that

374
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,780
they send

375
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:56,660
so that's valid for the user but also

376
00:14:54,780 --> 00:15:01,199
for the developer that's using that

377
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:02,610
remember you're only using HTTP and then

378
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,780
they say yes we might also share that

379
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:07,350
with people we have a strategic

380
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:09,750
relationship with 40 more graphic

381
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:12,810
purposes and blah blah blah so trusted

382
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:15,870
entities so these guys know all the

383
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:17,640
games you have and how often you play on

384
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:19,500
what networks you were when you played

385
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,390
that right they see things like your IP

386
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,400
addresses how much memory is left you

387
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:26,880
might even see things about your with

388
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:29,400
time zone in physical location and then

389
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:34,360
they say well disclose that too

390
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:36,939
pretty much anyone including government

391
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,250
or law enforcement officials and do you

392
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,840
need a warrant for that no they just if

393
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,810
we think you're being illegal or

394
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,020
unethical or legally actionable

395
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:46,270
actionable

396
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,620
yeah we'll share that so I think you can

397
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,790
probably pretend to be a cop and just

398
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:52,480
ask them for all the information they'll

399
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:54,849
probably give it to you and then you can

400
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,980
get your stuff removed so they give us

401
00:15:54,850 --> 00:16:00,010
this you know super nice you know cheap

402
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:02,140
phone number to call I think that's in

403
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:03,700
Sweden or maybe in Iceland but you can

404
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,500
also send them an email so cool so I

405
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:09,010
send them an email and see how that

406
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:11,170
turned out later but then they say hey

407
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:14,470
if you asked us to delete your data we

408
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:16,329
might retain an archived copy as

409
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:19,030
required for Allah are also legitimate

410
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:20,440
business purposes so what's a legitimate

411
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:22,030
business purpose I don't know so I don't

412
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,160
even know why I'd be wasting my time you

413
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:27,100
know asking them to remove the data if I

414
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,079
wasn't doing this song so that's my

415
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,640
understanding of the policy is we'll use

416
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,260
your stuff as we want we'll give it to

417
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,390
anyone warrant or not also you can't

418
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:37,180
really have us delete it and disclaimer

419
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:40,240
I'm not a lawyer but that's how I see it

420
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:41,560
and remember creepy guy at Starbucks is

421
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,020
also going to see that all that data

422
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,729
because it's not even HTTP because no

423
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:47,949
one ever heard of things like xkeyscore

424
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:50,260
using logs from windows or anything like

425
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:51,790
that to identify people so imagine the

426
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,620
amount of information that's leaving iOS

427
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:55,870
devices that could be used to track

428
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,990
people or you see what NS offload are

429
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:02,950
running to see if it might be vulnerable

430
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:05,290
and they're not using HTTPS but they say

431
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:07,000
that they make good-faith efforts to

432
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,740
protect your data to make sure that no

433
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,380
one's gonna steal it so today I learned

434
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:15,010
that using HTTPS is beyond good faith

435
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:18,459
effort so now what about ABS up aren't

436
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:20,379
games so what we see here again on the

437
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:23,620
left you have the free games it's gonna

438
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:25,390
flash with what is what on the right you

439
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:27,399
see a lot of gray stuff these are DNS

440
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:29,970
requests for let all the delivery

441
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,250
services yes

442
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:34,840
that's from subgraph Vega it's just a

443
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:37,840
proxy that you install so on your phone

444
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:40,629
you redirect your traffic through it and

445
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,010
you give it a lick your own certain SLE

446
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,430
certificate so if there's anything in

447
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,170
there it's

448
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:45,940
to do a men in the middle effect so you

449
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:47,350
can see you can see the data is open

450
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:51,730
source try it out it's pretty user

451
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:53,770
friendly so again the free apps on the

452
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:56,440
left are contacting way more stuff now

453
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:58,870
the the progress bar the scroll bars

454
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,910
might be deceptive a little bit because

455
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:03,159
of all the gray stuff again I have

456
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:05,710
deliveries app that's doing a DNS

457
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:08,200
request on every delivery company out

458
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:10,300
there but all shootin the numbers after

459
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,010
there's still way more stuff on so again

460
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:14,980
numbers and letters do they mean

461
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:20,500
something the free little ease for one

462
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:22,120
minute about 61 hosts were contacted if

463
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:25,750
you're using Little Snitch imagine you

464
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,879
ran five apps and that's 61 times Little

465
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,380
Snitch goes hey this app wants you

466
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,660
typically what you see when you run an

467
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:34,600
app on a Mac is this happens to phone

468
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:37,120
home check an update service few things

469
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,889
like that this is like your app wants to

470
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,139
talk to double-click game analytics

471
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:44,380
crashlytics Fleury a lot of them are

472
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:46,390
using multiple ones especially those

473
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,220
that have like in-app purchases and

474
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:51,970
freemium models they're all about

475
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:53,290
monetization of ads so they use you know

476
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:56,580
multiple different service to get there

477
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:59,920
so the paid non games for one minute 18

478
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:02,620
were contacted out of which 10 were

479
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:05,380
Apple or iCloud related and the apps

480
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:07,179
that I use only contacted 12 out of

481
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,010
which 6 were where Apple so there's

482
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:11,650
really a big difference between the pop

483
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:15,190
up free game free apps the paid apps and

484
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:17,890
the apps that you might pick if you just

485
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:20,410
know what apps are good on iOS again

486
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:22,840
ssl/tls ain't nobody got time for that

487
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:24,490
except for people using crashlytics so

488
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,760
always wondering why is everyone using

489
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:30,220
crashlytics doing SSL or TLS pretty well

490
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,560
also while everyone who's using Fleury

491
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:35,740
is not is it because flurry doesn't

492
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:39,159
support HTTP it turns out that a lot of

493
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:42,760
these services supported both methods

494
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:45,010
before and in some cases HTTP was the

495
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:47,260
default so every developer just copy

496
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:48,670
pasted the example code and they built

497
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:51,010
their apps and now because there's so

498
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:53,140
many apps out there using HTTP they

499
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:54,658
can't easily just pull the plug on it so

500
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,159
it's going to be a long term transition

501
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:59,039
together and there's also some other

502
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:01,259
services that might not be has you know

503
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:05,220
as good as things like flurry and they

504
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:07,619
don't just don't seem to care so that's

505
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:10,739
why people don't actually use the SSL

506
00:20:07,619 --> 00:20:13,379
and crashlytics they enforce it and they

507
00:20:10,739 --> 00:20:16,200
even support you know SSL key pinning as

508
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:19,320
they should so again what kind of data

509
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:22,470
was sent well what I see here is the

510
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:24,479
status of your battery my time zone how

511
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:26,879
much space is left on my device there

512
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:28,440
was information about my language apps

513
00:20:26,879 --> 00:20:31,978
where I sign up with an email address

514
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,960
you could see that in their unique

515
00:20:31,979 --> 00:20:36,989
identifiers again you know that we point

516
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,519
to my to my device some of them are able

517
00:20:36,989 --> 00:20:40,859
to know what apps you actually have

518
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:42,029
installed on iOS there were a few

519
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:43,228
different methods to get that

520
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:45,210
information some of which has been

521
00:20:43,229 --> 00:20:47,369
blocked by Apple but assume that

522
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:49,320
third-party apps can see what other apps

523
00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:51,928
are installed on your phone then you

524
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,129
could also have crash dogs that are sent

525
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:55,369
obviously that's controlled by the

526
00:20:53,129 --> 00:20:57,599
developers you could contain anything

527
00:20:55,369 --> 00:21:00,149
some of these services like crashlytics

528
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:01,739
again have the ownership of the data

529
00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:03,478
that gets sent remains with the

530
00:21:01,739 --> 00:21:05,399
developer that's using their service so

531
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:08,099
that is really good but that's not with

532
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:10,289
all of them while I was doing that only

533
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:12,210
one app complained that I was doing SSL

534
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:14,190
MN in the middle and that's overcast my

535
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:16,379
podcast client so I sleep easy knowing

536
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:18,710
that the only app that really cares

537
00:21:16,379 --> 00:21:22,559
about doing SSL well on my phone is

538
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:28,019
protecting my podcast so what can you do

539
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:29,940
against that so as a user you can't do

540
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:31,590
much except you should probably favorite

541
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,409
favorite paid apps because they're

542
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:35,668
definitely better than the free ones

543
00:21:33,409 --> 00:21:37,979
know that your data is gonna go there

544
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:42,029
it's going to be sent out there when

545
00:21:37,979 --> 00:21:44,340
it's possible opt-out apps made by

546
00:21:42,029 --> 00:21:46,710
independent developers were better than

547
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:49,228
apps made by bigger companies or

548
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:51,509
startups that are really focused on like

549
00:21:49,229 --> 00:21:53,039
eyeballs and amount of users versus the

550
00:21:51,509 --> 00:21:54,809
quality of applications and actually

551
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,820
just making money out of something that

552
00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:59,178
they sell and you can also ask for

553
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:02,070
deletion deletion how did that work I

554
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:04,559
sent game analytics an email and I said

555
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:06,119
I'd like to get my stuff deleted I don't

556
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,649
know like I don't know how they'll know

557
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:08,810
who I

558
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:11,510
what to delete so I give him two email

559
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:16,720
addresses one of which is not in the

560
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:16,720
from of the email I'm sending it and

561
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:21,260
they said we received your request but

562
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:24,290
we don't have any account registered to

563
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:25,870
any of those emails question mark it's

564
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:28,460
just because I didn't have any app that

565
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:30,229
I was registered with that email address

566
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,760
so they don't really have a way of

567
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:33,620
knowing what data was sent to them

568
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,020
actually is linked back to me so they

569
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:38,000
can't even really delete it and the

570
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:39,740
kicker was about two weeks later the guy

571
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,030
who replied tried to add me on LinkedIn

572
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:45,620
oh okay and again I just like I asked

573
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:47,930
him to delete information about to email

574
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:50,629
addresses he doesn't have any idea if I

575
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:52,010
really own the second one and maybe I

576
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:53,330
could have asked him for a copy of the

577
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:54,500
data that's in there and he would have

578
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,720
sent it to me if there had been anything

579
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,610
but because my email address wasn't in

580
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,110
there I couldn't couldn't really see so

581
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,699
it doesn't really work plus as a user

582
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:04,550
how do you know where you can ask for

583
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:06,650
your data to be deleted like who here

584
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:09,950
actually looked at the traffic that was

585
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:12,350
leaving their phones and we're at a

586
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:16,580
security conference so you can imagine

587
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:18,709
like the public in general you can ask

588
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:20,210
but developers sell these apps for like

589
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:22,400
$2 they're not they spent two hours

590
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:24,590
replying to like annoying security guy

591
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,660
asking questions about what they do with

592
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:27,919
this stuff so I asked overcast my

593
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,990
podcast line which is the best one

594
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,700
around the SSL and didn't even seem to

595
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:33,710
be using any of that stuff you never

596
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,840
reply but I don't blame them because I

597
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:37,490
paid like two dollars for the app I

598
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:41,689
can't expect them to spend two hours of

599
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:43,580
support for me and you might think that

600
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:45,740
using a VPN or something like that could

601
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:47,060
help as a user of something like freedom

602
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,880
that blocks some of the tracking

603
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:54,169
networks and things like that it does a

604
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:57,230
little bit but most of these frameworks

605
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:59,210
they'll cache the data and as soon as

606
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:01,520
you end up on seller network where the

607
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:03,260
blocks are gone it's just gonna send

608
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,490
everything so let's say you're blocking

609
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,800
it on your firewall at home you're just

610
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:08,840
blocking all these hosts as soon as you

611
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:11,899
get on the solar network it's all gonna

612
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:14,300
be sent out anyways and on iOS you know

613
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:16,040
VPNs you can make them automatically

614
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:18,040
connect but there's almost always going

615
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:20,200
to be a period of time where you're not

616
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,940
VPN and as soon as that happens all that

617
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,850
data is going to leave your device so

618
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:27,100
was an appoint as to even try so as a

619
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:29,560
security person when your enterprises

620
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:31,419
buying apps for your enterprise consider

621
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,460
that and look at what kind of traffic

622
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:37,120
these apps generate if there's stuff

623
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:38,770
that you're buying you should ask your

624
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,629
vendors to not be doing a lot of that

625
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:42,490
you should ask them what kind of data

626
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:43,810
they're sending and why and you should

627
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:45,070
see it for yourself right because there

628
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:47,560
might be information about your company

629
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:49,960
that you don't want out there look at

630
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,929
your firewall in proxy logs thankfully

631
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,280
most apps are pretty good about

632
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:56,620
identifying themselves in the user agent

633
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,810
string so if you were just to look at

634
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:01,179
your proxy logs right now at work you

635
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:03,010
would see which apps are the worst

636
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:05,500
offenders pretty easily and again

637
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:07,450
blocking destinations pretty pointless

638
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,190
especially if it's BYOD because then you

639
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:10,750
people are just gonna go home on Wi-Fi

640
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:13,780
they're just gonna go on seller network

641
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:16,750
and it's it's all gonna go anyways if

642
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:21,129
you're a developer if you're working on

643
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:22,660
an app or you're working on any kind of

644
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:24,670
service that could leverage those

645
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:26,290
remember you don't gather what you don't

646
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:27,550
need that should be like security 101

647
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:30,070
but still people gather more information

648
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:31,659
in the action need limit the amount of

649
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:34,149
third parties you're using I've seen

650
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:36,790
some of these apps using like 12 or 15

651
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:38,260
different providers for that makes no

652
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:40,590
sense the privacy policies are just

653
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:43,300
insane when you just add them up right

654
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:46,270
pick the right partners those that will

655
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:47,800
make sure that you continue being the

656
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:49,360
owner of that data that's being sent

657
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:52,990
make sure that they're not using that

658
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,580
data for their own analysis and to you

659
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:56,140
know basically profit from the

660
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:58,060
information you're gathering from your

661
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:00,280
users as long as you're using it for

662
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:03,310
your own benefit that's really what what

663
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,899
you need out of that and ensure to use

664
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:06,909
these options properly so for example if

665
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:09,850
you're using Fleury make sure you use

666
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:11,740
their SSL TLS options there's no excuse

667
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,949
not to be doing that they provide it for

668
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,530
you

669
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:16,530
so it's just a matter of turning it on

670
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:19,810
in some cases but don't trust the fault

671
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:21,730
and be clear to your users about what

672
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:23,830
you're sending where so a great example

673
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:26,560
you can just Google for it cloak is a

674
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:28,510
VPN application for iOS and they have a

675
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:30,580
page where they tell you exactly what

676
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:33,070
services they're using for

677
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:35,710
analytics and what did I sent why so

678
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:39,189
they'll say we send crash reports to

679
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:41,769
hockey app to analyze crashes only we

680
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:43,360
send anonymous identifiers to this other

681
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:45,299
service and then they points you to

682
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,500
these different services so you can see

683
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:48,879
what kind of company these guys are and

684
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,860
they've actually changed a few things

685
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,409
since I took that screenshot so now the

686
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:55,510
element is some third parties and are

687
00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:57,820
using some tools that are made by by

688
00:26:55,510 --> 00:27:00,789
Apple which you know obviously already

689
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:03,309
had a lot of information so the bottom

690
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:05,620
line is more people than we thought are

691
00:27:03,309 --> 00:27:07,510
getting your data I did anyone really

692
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:10,029
expect a game like trivia crack to be

693
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:12,429
impacting dozens and dozens and dozens

694
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:14,679
of networks when launching it maybe I'm

695
00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:18,389
naive but I wasn't I would I thought it

696
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:20,289
was probably going to contact a few but

697
00:27:18,389 --> 00:27:22,240
the first time I read it I thought

698
00:27:20,289 --> 00:27:23,529
something was wrong I thought I had some

699
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,870
apps running in the background on my

700
00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:28,059
phone so I just wiped everything I

701
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:29,709
killed all the apps and I started over

702
00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:31,240
and you know same results and then I

703
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:32,230
realized yeah it's it's actually pretty

704
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,269
bad

705
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:36,399
you can hardly block them and they're

706
00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:39,159
definitely here to stay because they're

707
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:41,590
useful for developers and framing games

708
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:43,330
with in-app purchase they really seem to

709
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:45,879
be the devil if you care about your

710
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:48,570
privacy at all because they're all about

711
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:50,409
monetizing really small transactions

712
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:52,330
they're all about monetizing

713
00:27:50,409 --> 00:27:55,000
advertisement in many cases so they're

714
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:58,480
using a huge amount of huge amount of

715
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:02,529
these so I will continue to favor paid

716
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,330
apps when I can I mean I've seen some

717
00:28:02,529 --> 00:28:06,580
paid apps that weren't much better than

718
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:09,399
than the free ones one thing that I did

719
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:11,019
notice that was interesting is an app

720
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:13,928
that has a free version with ads and

721
00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:15,519
that also has a paid version typically

722
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:17,080
they're almost identical they just

723
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:18,669
remove the ads but they still gather all

724
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:21,789
that same data it's more of a culture

725
00:28:18,669 --> 00:28:24,789
thing right so I think the more the more

726
00:28:21,789 --> 00:28:27,250
people call themselves bro in a startup

727
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:29,110
the more likely you you are to see a lot

728
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:32,320
of analytics services used but that's

729
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:33,908
not a very scientific observation but I

730
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,710
think when you install an app you can

731
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:38,169
just think well these guys who made this

732
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:39,730
have call themselves bros and if so is

733
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:42,159
probably because you're using a lot of

734
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:43,350
analytics so I left some time for

735
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,030
questions

736
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:49,120
and I want to thank you for for being

737
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:51,428
there you can send me public praise on

738
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,049
Twitter and private complaints by email

739
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:57,280
or the other way around if you want and

740
00:28:53,049 --> 00:28:58,780
make sure you enjoy source Boston and

741
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:02,559
that's what I meant about colors being

742
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:05,230
messed up so any questions about what we

743
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:10,059
do are we doomed is the world going to

744
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:16,120
end so the proxy that yet that I use is

745
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:19,210
called Vega ve GA by subgraph it's open

746
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:21,280
source runs on like Windows Linux it's

747
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:23,500
it's more user friendly than something

748
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:25,990
like burp if you're not a security

749
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:28,120
person so it's less there's less options

750
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:30,190
it's less powerful but again it's more

751
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:33,219
user friendly so invite you to check it

752
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:36,369
out Bob

753
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:36,369
[Music]

754
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:44,530
yeah would say that if you jailbreak

755
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:45,760
you're defeating so many you know iOS by

756
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:48,879
itself is actually pretty secure

757
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:51,460
platform and by jailbreaking you you are

758
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,930
going to destroy a lot of that so we

759
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:55,990
need to see the difference between

760
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:58,390
privacy and security so you might be

761
00:29:55,990 --> 00:30:00,070
able to improve your your privacy a

762
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:01,630
little bit because you might be able to

763
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:04,629
install something local like Little

764
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:06,100
Snitch on a Mac but then the security of

765
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:08,559
your device is going to be completely

766
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:11,820
ruined by the fact that you jailbroken

767
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:14,470
it so I don't think it makes sense

768
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:16,389
personally the only devices that I have

769
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:18,040
that are jailbroken are just test

770
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:20,400
devices and i jailbreak them to go you

771
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:23,379
know see the apps and see how they work

772
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:25,690
you know haven't had a jailbroken phone

773
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:28,420
as my day-to-day phone since like iOS I

774
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:29,980
don't know 3.0 you know back when you

775
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:32,080
couldn't do anything if you didn't

776
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:34,270
jailbreak but that's but that works

777
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,428
anymore I mean so I don't see any point

778
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:39,070
in jailbreaking and even then I'm not

779
00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:40,540
sure you'd be able to block you know all

780
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:42,850
that much stuff or it would be really

781
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:45,220
complicated goes back to do you want to

782
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:47,649
create 61 rules for every path that you

783
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:49,350
that you create right so even running

784
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:51,700
something like Little Snitch on a Mac

785
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:53,139
can get a little annoying sometimes you

786
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,730
even has security people you run a new

787
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:57,120
thing and it's like oh you want to allow

788
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:59,380
this and that and this and that I

789
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:03,309
couldn't imagine doing it on my phone I

790
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:05,830
mean every day I get I'm completely

791
00:31:03,309 --> 00:31:09,129
amazed at the amount of software that

792
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:10,899
gets updated without using HTTPS on Mac

793
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:12,220
it's like let's just download binaries

794
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,790
and clear-text ain't nothing wrong with

795
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:15,190
that right

796
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:20,428
so if I had to do that on my phone I

797
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:20,429
probably would just go nuts yes

798
00:31:20,809 --> 00:31:26,129
so do I have anything to add about

799
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:29,880
Android specifically well I didn't look

800
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:32,580
at Android apps but I don't see why it

801
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,650
would be much different in fact um you

802
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:37,500
know there's probably more apps on

803
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:40,080
Android that rely on advertising to make

804
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:42,120
money I know the Android store is a

805
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,889
little bit more there's some testing

806
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,600
that's done on performance of apps and

807
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:47,850
things like that so maybe you wouldn't

808
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,010
see apps that take us long to launch

809
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:51,600
because they're contacting 98 different

810
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:54,059
things but I'm sure they would contact

811
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,290
them eventually anyways so I don't see

812
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:56,700
why it would be much different on the

813
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:58,730
Android maybe it's a little worse but

814
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:01,730
that's just my gut feeling

815
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:01,730
yes

816
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:11,290
well the thing with sniffing cellar

817
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:15,129
traffic is it would require you know

818
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:16,960
different equipment and I did not sniff

819
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:19,270
anything on a slaughter network because

820
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:23,730
that might even be illegal in some cases

821
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:26,168
so but but I would think that it

822
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:28,660
everything seemed to be sent over Wi-Fi

823
00:32:26,169 --> 00:32:30,880
it would be really interesting if some

824
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:32,650
stuff was only sent over seller and I

825
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,510
did I did think about that when I was

826
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:36,850
doing that I was like what if one app

827
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:38,470
just wait sometimes you're on seller to

828
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:40,418
send some crazy stuff they really don't

829
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:42,850
want you to know about this let's face

830
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:44,940
it sniffing seller is doable but it

831
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:48,909
requires a lot more motivation and

832
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:51,130
hardware and maybe violating laws and

833
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:52,900
then not telling anyone about it so I

834
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:54,970
don't have any proof that anyone is

835
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,830
doing that but honestly I don't even

836
00:32:54,970 --> 00:33:00,330
think they have to bother because it's

837
00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:00,330
just do it over Wi-Fi ain't no one cares

838
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:10,149
well I think what concerned me the most

839
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:12,910
was list of applications that I have

840
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:14,620
installed because that can really be

841
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:16,450
tied back to you really easily right I

842
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:19,418
have like 92 apps on my you know

843
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:22,059
day-to-day phone who has the same 92

844
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:23,380
apps probably no one and the other thing

845
00:33:22,059 --> 00:33:25,720
that I found concerning was the fact

846
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:27,910
that these analytic services were able

847
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:30,340
to generate identifiers for my device

848
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:32,340
and that that same identifier was used

849
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:34,540
across games made by different

850
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:37,090
publishers you know it's one thing for

851
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:38,710
me to but I have four apps made by

852
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:40,780
Microsoft you know I would expect

853
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:42,070
Microsoft to find a way to know that you

854
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:45,010
know I'm the same person on the same

855
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:46,178
device but when it's like three

856
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:47,770
different companies making different

857
00:33:46,179 --> 00:33:50,110
games and these guys don't even know

858
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:51,910
each other and then just seeing that

859
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:53,110
that just reminded me of you know

860
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:57,250
everything that's happening on the web

861
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:59,020
with you know cookies across domains and

862
00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:01,179
social networks and things like that so

863
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:03,340
it's just you know on mobile sometimes

864
00:34:01,179 --> 00:34:05,049
we feel like things are better and then

865
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:06,760
they are elsewhere just because the

866
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:08,350
platform might look more secure but it

867
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:11,129
doesn't mean that people aren't doing

868
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:11,129
the exact same thing

869
00:34:12,109 --> 00:34:17,418
all right so I think that's it so thanks

870
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:20,710
everyone and enjoy the keynote which is

871
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:20,710
coming up in 15 minutes I think
