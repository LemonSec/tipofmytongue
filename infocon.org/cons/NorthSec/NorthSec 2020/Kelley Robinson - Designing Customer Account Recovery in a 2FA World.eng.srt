2
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:23,270
all right welcome back everyone sorry

3
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,710
for the glitches there for a moment so

4
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,780
we are back for a last talk of the day

5
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:30,760
and I have just ceremonially cracked

6
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:33,079
open the one of the many North SEC beers

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:36,350
this is the last one that remained in my

8
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:37,879
apartment so I'm very excited to welcome

9
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:40,219
this next speaker

10
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:42,379
she spoke last year at North SEC and it

11
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:43,819
was a really well-received talk and the

12
00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:46,640
talk is going to be designing customer

13
00:00:43,819 --> 00:00:49,069
account recovery in a 2fa world by Kelly

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,379
Robinson Kelly works on the account

15
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:53,359
security team at Twilio previously she

16
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:55,460
worked in a variety of API platform and

17
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,079
data engineering roles at startups her

18
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,609
research focuses on authentication user

19
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:00,710
experience and design trade-offs for

20
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:02,960
different risk profiles and 2f8 channels

21
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,879
Kelly lives in Brooklyn is an avid home

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,620
cook and spends way too much time on

23
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,660
Twitter I'm sorryi editorialized with

24
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,820
the way too much time apologies was just

25
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:14,630
too much time I'm gonna shoot tweets at

26
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:17,600
Kelly Robinson yeah give her a virtual

27
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,920
kind of applause welcome Kelly excited

28
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:24,500
for this Cheers

29
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:27,710
thank you disappointed that I do not

30
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,980
have one of those stairs as well but I

31
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:33,289
will be ceremoniously cracking one up

32
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:35,540
after I get this talk so thank you

33
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:37,070
everyone for joining us today and thank

34
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,860
you for sticking around for the end of

35
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:42,770
the day and for this talk I can tell you

36
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:45,530
the exact moment that I was inspired to

37
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:48,140
get this talk like a lot of things in

38
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:50,090
security the user experience is one of

39
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,980
the most important parts and getting

40
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:54,140
that balance right between usability and

41
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,190
necessary friction is always something

42
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,100
that we're gonna have to keep in mind

43
00:01:55,190 --> 00:02:00,560
and so when I tried to reset my password

44
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,179
for this website and they told me that

45
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,950
resetting the password would just

46
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:08,000
deactivate my two-factor authentication

47
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:10,429
I was a little upset but I think that

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,530
this whole balance of usability and

49
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:14,390
friction is especially true with

50
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:16,010
authentication because it's one of the

51
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,279
most common security measures that

52
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,319
everybody deals with

53
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,120
and we deal with it on a repeated basis

54
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,429
we're logging into websites repeatedly

55
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,380
day after day into multiple websites

56
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,720
every single day and so this is

57
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,100
something that everybody kind of around

58
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,290
the world is dealing with and is

59
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,910
familiar with and so we as security

60
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,730
professionals have to be designing these

61
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:37,380
systems in a way that makes sense so no

62
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,480
one expected to be quarantined for a

63
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,400
good chunk of 20 20 but I think one of

64
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,319
the outcomes of this is that we're all

65
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,720
doing a lot more business online and

66
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:47,790
that makes it increasingly important to

67
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,380
shore up our online authentication and

68
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,380
think about how we're allowing customers

69
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,340
to regain access to their accounts so

70
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,320
I'm going to be sharing some of the

71
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,209
things that I think are good options for

72
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,430
designing account recovery when users

73
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:01,440
have 2fa enabled I'm specifically

74
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,330
calling out customer account recovery

75
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,950
here because I think there's a different

76
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,380
way of thinking about this problem for

77
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:09,899
user facing applications compared to

78
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:12,090
something like internal employee account

79
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:16,170
recovery so I'm gonna focus on consumer

80
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:17,640
applications and end user security so my

81
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,049
name is Kelly Robinson I have been

82
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,570
working at Twilio for about three years

83
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:23,640
I specifically support folios account

84
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:26,670
security products for things like user

85
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,640
verification and phone intelligence this

86
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,179
team has been evolving a lot since it

87
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,220
was acquired

88
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,739
so the off the team was acquired by

89
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,989
Twilio about five years ago offi is our

90
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:39,269
free consumer application for 2fa that

91
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:40,739
you may be a user of and this talk is

92
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:42,209
going to incorporate both a lot of the

93
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:43,970
things that I've learned from working on

94
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:45,959
security products for the last few years

95
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:47,459
working with our developers and our

96
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,260
customers on their authentication

97
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,430
challenges but also some of the things

98
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,590
that we've learned from running a

99
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,970
two-factor authentication product and a

100
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,530
product that has an account recovery

101
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:58,410
option a product that has a lot of

102
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:00,570
security considerations that we have to

103
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:02,100
make around recovery and how that

104
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:05,130
affects our customers that are using it

105
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:07,799
if you're watching this in a logged in

106
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:10,769
twitch account which is a authy customer

107
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,480
so you if you set up to FA with twitch

108
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:14,579
that you're going to be using coffee for

109
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,680
that and I can tell you that when twitch

110
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:18,870
users need to reset their their

111
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,010
two-factor authentication you know

112
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,350
they're dealing with our support team

113
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,390
and our support team are very very

114
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,979
lovely people and you know we have to

115
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,390
make a lot of considerations around how

116
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:28,409
to make sure that people can get back

117
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:31,039
into their Twitter accounts without

118
00:04:28,409 --> 00:04:33,659
having those accounts taken over

119
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,070
so of course we hope that users don't

120
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,900
lock themselves out of their accounts

121
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,909
but there's a lot of common reasons that

122
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,469
we have to take into account when we're

123
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:42,150
designing new systems and we're

124
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,310
designing account recovery

125
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:46,349
people forget passwords that's a common

126
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,420
one they change their phone numbers

127
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:50,100
that's also common especially in cases

128
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,140
where two-factor authentication involves

129
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,630
a phone number which a lot of cases do

130
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,520
people lose devices that could be an

131
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,950
Authenticator application or a physical

132
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,719
Hardware security key or any you know

133
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,130
upgrade to the latest iPhone maybe they

134
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,690
don't lose something but they're getting

135
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,130
a new device and they forget that there

136
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,710
was anything important on that old

137
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:09,240
device but we have to figure out how to

138
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,310
address these issues while still

139
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,670
guarding against attackers and guarding

140
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:16,800
against account takeover attempts and

141
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:19,380
addressing this is expensive this can

142
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,440
cost companies up to $70 per support

143
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,880
call to unlock a an account and so we

144
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,440
have to be thinking about how we can

145
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,280
minimize this cost while still

146
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,900
protecting user accounts so one thing I

147
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,059
wanted to look at was the different

148
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,640
factors that we have access to and how

149
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,740
we can evaluate using these factors for

150
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,330
account recovery and one thing to note

151
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,400
is that the more of you these that you

152
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,450
collect when the user first signs up the

153
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,190
more that you'll have to trust and

154
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:46,409
verify against when they attempt an

155
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,090
account recovery so generally and I'll

156
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,380
be walking through more concrete

157
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,359
recommendations towards the end of the

158
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,430
talk but generally even if you're having

159
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,990
a user login with two factors you

160
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:57,330
probably want to be collecting at least

161
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,070
three factors at some point during an

162
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,570
authenticated session so that they can

163
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:02,340
make sure that they can log in with at

164
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:06,330
least two factors if they lose one of

165
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:07,560
the ones that they were using so let's

166
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,150
start with looking at them and the

167
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,260
knowledge factors or things that you

168
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,539
wouldn't know and these could be

169
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,700
passwords security questions or specific

170
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,560
account information and these could be

171
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:19,500
things like recent transactions or

172
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,229
hopefully other secret details about the

173
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,930
account knowledge factors are great

174
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:27,120
because they're easy to use and to set

175
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,250
up and they can't exactly be lost

176
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,320
the reason security questions became so

177
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,810
popular as a recovery mechanism is

178
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,909
because things like your mother's maiden

179
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,200
name or the name of your first pet those

180
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:39,180
aren't things that are going to change

181
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,030
and you'll likely remember those details

182
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,770
however knowledge factors like passwords

183
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:46,198
can of course be breached

184
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:48,120
and many security questions or account

185
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,250
details could be searched it's not

186
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,590
impossible to find the street that

187
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:56,039
someone grew up on or guess the color of

188
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:57,960
their first car and so humans are of

189
00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:01,099
course forgetful so anything like a

190
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,419
password it could also be lost that way

191
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:05,370
looking at inherent factors or things

192
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:07,080
that you are like your fingerprints your

193
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:09,780
voice or even the way that you type or

194
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,340
another way to identify you the benefits

195
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,258
of these is that you can't lose or

196
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:16,109
forget these but the downside is that

197
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:17,880
you can't really change these so the

198
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:20,520
risk is really high for these getting

199
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,430
breached which makes implementation of

200
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,258
inherent factors delicate I would say

201
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:27,780
and it's a big reason that these aren't

202
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:29,759
widely supported so if you saw the

203
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:32,068
fingerprint cloning talk from earlier

204
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:36,090
you also know that these can be clothed

205
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:37,680
which is very scary but moving on to

206
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,929
possession factors these are something

207
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,000
that you have and these tend to be more

208
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:43,919
secure than passwords because they can

209
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,050
be harder to fish and don't get leaked

210
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,669
in data breaches so these could be

211
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:50,370
things that you have like your phone

212
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:53,280
backup or recovery codes and hardware

213
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,719
security tokens like you bikies of

214
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,059
course when it comes to something you

215
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:58,800
have people are people we're all human

216
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,449
and we tend to lose and replace things

217
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,759
and that means it's hard to guarantee

218
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:05,130
that these will be available for account

219
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,779
recovery and so possession also

220
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,969
introduces additional friction when you

221
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:10,529
try to set something up and that could

222
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:12,210
be additional friction especially

223
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:13,830
compared to something that you know or

224
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:15,330
something that you are if it requires

225
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:17,669
that you have access to a physical

226
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:19,020
object then it's going to be a little

227
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:20,460
bit of additional friction very in that

228
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,990
setup phase and that's something that

229
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:25,529
you're probably also going to want to

230
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:27,270
keep in mind I specifically wanted to

231
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:28,889
highlight one type of possession factor

232
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:31,529
that we see a lot for account recovery

233
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:33,630
and that's backup or recovery codes and

234
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:36,240
so these are given to you so they're a

235
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:38,578
little bit more likely to be longer and

236
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,529
less likely to be reused and so in that

237
00:08:38,578 --> 00:08:42,630
sense they're you know they're a secret

238
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:45,180
string that is a little bit more secure

239
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:46,890
than a password but that means that

240
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,719
people have to store backup codes

241
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:50,399
somewhere and while some sites will give

242
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,500
you specific options some sites will

243
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,300
tell you write them down print them out

244
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,790
and store them in a safe place save them

245
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,439
and your password manager email

246
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:01,199
to yourself I think that's a reasonable

247
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,000
option this is a screenshot from

248
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,770
Instagram when you setup two-factor

249
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,540
authentication they give you your backup

250
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,939
codes these backup codes are fake but

251
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,380
the messaging here is real and they

252
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,940
don't really give you any useful

253
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,980
guidance they just say make sure you

254
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,110
keep them in a safe place and so what am

255
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,450
I supposed to do with that and while I

256
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:20,670
haven't found any research on this and

257
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:22,740
please if anybody has any research on

258
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:25,740
how many people actually have access to

259
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:28,290
backup codes when they need them please

260
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,030
share that with me but my hunch my

261
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:32,280
hypothesis here is that most people

262
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,990
don't actually save these and so these

263
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:37,290
become a somewhat useless form of

264
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:39,030
recovery and so like what is a solution

265
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:41,010
here there's a debatable solution here

266
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:42,720
that you could email the recovery codes

267
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:44,640
to the user that's you know like

268
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,170
automatically do that not tell the user

269
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,600
to store them themselves but actually

270
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,339
email them to them of course if they

271
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,020
lose access to their email then they're

272
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,250
locked out or if somebody gets into

273
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,350
their email then all of a sudden it's

274
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,880
not really 2fa anymore

275
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:00,120
they're also screwed if that's the case

276
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,890
but it could be a better solution for

277
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,720
some people and is that any better or

278
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:05,340
worse and those of us who store our

279
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,130
backup codes in our password manager

280
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:10,080
we're kind of all concentrating risk in

281
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:12,060
one area so I just have a lot of

282
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,410
opinions about backup codes and so this

283
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,510
is something that I kind of wanted to

284
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:18,000
call out specifically as a recovery

285
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:19,380
option you know I'm not really saying

286
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,540
that you should start automatically

287
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:23,700
emailing users or your backup codes but

288
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:27,300
it might have a higher usability than

289
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,560
whatever most people are doing today so

290
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,000
let's spend a little bit of time looking

291
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,459
at a few companies and their account

292
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,960
recovery processes a lot of companies

293
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,550
can be intentionally vague about this

294
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,050
but some have really good documentation

295
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,520
about their processes and some of these

296
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,280
are companies that I personally dealt

297
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,680
with so let's start with a pretty

298
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,600
questionable example so this is a

299
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,250
financial services company that you may

300
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,920
or may not know I'm not going to name

301
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:52,980
them they use a pretty interesting form

302
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,079
of 2fa it's a proprietary form of 2fa so

303
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,930
I can't use you know of--they or another

304
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:00,300
Authenticator app that allows backup

305
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:02,760
they just as a weird aside that doesn't

306
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:05,609
really have anything to do with account

307
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,260
recovery they have you append the 2fa

308
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,290
code at the end of your password which

309
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,810
is a little weird

310
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:14,420
but the thing that annoys me about this

311
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:15,949
company is that so when you get a new

312
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,500
phone there's not an automated process

313
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:21,080
for transferring your 2fa to that new

314
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,270
phone you have to call the help desk

315
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,740
with this company you know as a

316
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:27,199
millennial of course I hate calling

317
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:29,090
anyone but it's not just that when you

318
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,460
call the company to reset your

319
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:33,950
two-factor authentication what you have

320
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:36,080
to do is authenticate yourself over the

321
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:38,090
phone and like they don't really do any

322
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,120
actual authentication all they require

323
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:43,100
is your username and your phone number

324
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,350
in order to change this on your account

325
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,700
and so that's a little bit frustrating

326
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:49,280
that's kind of the worst of both worlds

327
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:51,470
it's not self-service online so they're

328
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:54,350
not like foregoing the extra security

329
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:56,810
for usability they're making it a little

330
00:11:54,350 --> 00:12:00,590
bit harder to reset this process but

331
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:02,119
it's also not even that secure and since

332
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:04,190
account recovery over the phone is so

333
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,750
common make sure your company is

334
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,940
securing your contact center with the

335
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:10,040
same rigor that you scare your website

336
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:11,630
this is what I spoke about last year at

337
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,939
North sac but I still think this is

338
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:15,500
really important so here's a blog post

339
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:17,900
that I wrote this week about how to do

340
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:21,320
call center security well so you can

341
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:23,630
find that on the Twilio blog next let's

342
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,760
look at authy so we're one of those

343
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:27,530
companies that we don't outline in our

344
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,140
public documentation everything that we

345
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:32,660
do for account recovery but we basically

346
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:35,150
require 2fa for any kind of account

347
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:36,800
recovery and so if the user has access

348
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,930
to some of their factors and those

349
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,329
factors could be a backup password a

350
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:43,910
sync device their mobile number and

351
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:45,080
email the process is a lot smoother so

352
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,670
if they lose access to one of their

353
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,380
factors but they still have access to at

354
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:50,510
least two of their other secure factors

355
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:52,400
then the account recovery process is

356
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:54,770
going to go pretty smoothly but we also

357
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,209
do enforce a waiting period that can be

358
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:57,860
anywhere between one to four days

359
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,930
depending on which factors you still

360
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,670
have access to and so if the user

361
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,709
doesn't have access to some of the more

362
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:05,689
important phone numbers or factors like

363
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:07,400
phone numbers then we consider phone

364
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:10,760
number an important factor here because

365
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:12,439
so much of 2fa is still done via SMS we

366
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,030
do have additional requirements to allow

367
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,790
them to change their phone number or

368
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:19,069
regain access to the account and so

369
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:21,650
while users may be annoyed at some of

370
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:22,700
these restrictions people tend to be

371
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,350
more understanding

372
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,910
additional frictions when it comes to

373
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:29,240
security products if you're somebody

374
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:31,550
that's taken the effort to sign up for

375
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,140
an Authenticator account then you're

376
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,459
probably somebody that cares a little

377
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:36,199
bit about security and is going to

378
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:40,160
understand that this is something that's

379
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,810
necessary next let's look at github and

380
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,130
github is an interesting one fortunately

381
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,449
I've never had to go through the account

382
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:46,430
recovery process there but they have

383
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:48,980
really extensive documentation about

384
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:50,630
their 2fa setup and recovery process and

385
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,820
they also offer a lot of options for

386
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:54,950
recovering you're a cow so one option

387
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,360
here is recovery tokens so make sure

388
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:58,400
that you save your github recovery

389
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,870
tokens somewhere that's the easiest way

390
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,020
to recover your account if you lose

391
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:06,260
access to your your primary form of 2fa

392
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:08,240
they also will let you fall back to SMS

393
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,860
if you can if you choose to do so you

394
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,270
don't have to fall back to ass on this

395
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,430
and I think that's a important

396
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:15,560
distinction and that would be if you

397
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:19,010
have a stronger form of 2fa enabled like

398
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:20,839
totp or web often they also do an

399
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:23,210
interesting thing where you can

400
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,520
configure your Facebook account to store

401
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:27,890
a recovery token and this is an option

402
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,480
that Facebook allows you can get more

403
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:31,370
information about how github sets this

404
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,530
up in their Docs that I have linked here

405
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:36,260
including the recover accounts elsewhere

406
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:38,569
link and so that's an interesting way to

407
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:40,939
kind of store a trusted token on another

408
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:42,350
device the downside of this is that they

409
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,450
assume that you have a Facebook account

410
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,240
they offer plenty of other options for

411
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:48,440
you if you don't have a Facebook account

412
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,120
but the upside here is that you're able

413
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,590
to add your you know you're probably

414
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,060
more likely to act be able to access

415
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,290
your Facebook account than you are

416
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,989
you're getting AB account if you get

417
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:58,370
locked out of that but interestingly I

418
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,020
wanted to tell us anecdote a friend of

419
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:02,720
mine went through the account recovery

420
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:04,220
process with github and said kind of in

421
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,990
line with this warning that's shown here

422
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,360
they told her that she could unlink her

423
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:10,610
email address so that they could use it

424
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,830
again to create a new account pork her

425
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,750
stuff and then in six months if the old

426
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:16,700
username was still dormant they would

427
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,890
release it to her and so that's a pretty

428
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,660
extreme form of a waiting period but

429
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:22,250
that is one way that they can kind of

430
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:25,510
slow down the process of an attacker

431
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:27,560
taking over a trusted github username

432
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:29,750
it's pretty extreme it's pretty

433
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,920
unforgiving six month waiting period is

434
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,450
pretty long

435
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,520
and I don't know if that's true for all

436
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:35,770
accounts maybe their account was

437
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,020
especially high risk

438
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:39,610
but definitely make sure that you as a

439
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,100
you know somebody that might be working

440
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:43,450
with developers and working in code

441
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,710
yourself have some Recovery Options

442
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:49,480
configured on your github account um

443
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:50,890
speaking of Facebook the one option for

444
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,600
account recovery on Facebook that I

445
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:54,280
wanted to highlight is somewhat unique

446
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,560
or at least tied to the features of that

447
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,910
product and so Facebook is interesting

448
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,040
because they allow you to nominate three

449
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:02,140
to five friends that can confirm your

450
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,870
identity before giving your account back

451
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:07,449
to you so this is a pretty cool idea if

452
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:09,250
your product has a social component like

453
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:10,780
Facebook this could be a reasonable

454
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,400
solution I don't know if I would

455
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,740
recommend building a social component

456
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,910
just for this but that could be

457
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,610
something that if there's other reasons

458
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:19,750
that you have that in your product this

459
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,700
could be a way that you could build

460
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:23,200
account recovery in and it's also a way

461
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:25,120
to think about what are the unique

462
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,880
aspects of your product that you could

463
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,830
use for account recovery um one thing

464
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,780
challenge here is getting users to set

465
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:34,750
this up may be a challenge I'm not much

466
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:36,610
of a Facebook user but I did so I had to

467
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,050
dig into profile settings to find this

468
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:40,720
generally you don't want people to have

469
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:42,729
to dig into profile settings to find

470
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,920
these types of security features but

471
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:48,790
maybe they haven't prompted me for just

472
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:50,170
because I don't log on very often so

473
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,490
those are some examples of what

474
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,959
different companies are currently doing

475
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,970
and now I want to talk through some

476
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,520
concrete recommendations of what you can

477
00:16:54,970 --> 00:17:00,250
do for your company so the first one is

478
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:02,230
that you want to have users register

479
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:04,089
more factors than they need for every

480
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:08,020
day log in and so this is true both for

481
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:09,699
one effe or for two fa but the benefit

482
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,800
here is that you have additional trusted

483
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,870
factors to compare against when the user

484
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:16,750
loses access to one of their main login

485
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:18,939
factors and so the more factors that you

486
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:21,160
have access to and the more factors that

487
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,690
the user is previously registered more

488
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,430
confident that you could be the right

489
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:26,260
person is trying to gain access to their

490
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:27,970
account and the higher chance that the

491
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:30,730
user will still have access to at least

492
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:33,010
two of their factors so generally if you

493
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:34,150
if the user is logging in with 2fa you

494
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,650
want to make sure that you're verifying

495
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:38,470
at least two factors for them to regain

496
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:40,540
access to their account so you could

497
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,950
register these at signup that's you know

498
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,510
a pretty guaranteed way to make sure

499
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:45,400
that the user has these on their account

500
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:47,020
or it could be during a different

501
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,910
authenticated session that's also really

502
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,750
common you know get users signed up as

503
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,160
quickly as possible

504
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,930
and then have them add additional

505
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,510
security later if they start to become

506
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:57,910
an active user of your site requiring

507
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:59,350
users to register additional factors

508
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,030
that signup is going to create some

509
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:02,800
additional overhead in that process you

510
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:04,420
know if you have the notion of like a

511
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,889
sign up or a growth team you might want

512
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,090
to be talking to them about how they're

513
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:09,220
implementing this and how it will affect

514
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:10,990
your registration numbers but it's

515
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:13,000
definitely justifiable in certain use

516
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,680
cases if you're doing any kind of

517
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,270
financial services or anything that is

518
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:20,530
going to have a level of fraud detection

519
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:22,600
and in place for creating making sure

520
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:24,820
that people that sign up are real users

521
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,409
that's certainly a use case where you

522
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:29,649
could have them at register additional

523
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:31,780
factors ing bank for example supports

524
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,700
virtual video calls to verify new

525
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:35,290
customers but you know if you're an

526
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,000
internet retailer you probably don't

527
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:41,710
want to be asking a user to upload a

528
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,390
government ID another recommendation is

529
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:45,160
that you do want to design your recovery

530
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:47,410
process based on the value your business

531
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:49,060
is protecting and so this means that you

532
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:50,920
want to do some threat modeling you know

533
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:53,260
watch Alyssa's great talk from earlier

534
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,880
on that look at your account takeover

535
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,770
costs and understand how much you're

536
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,270
actually using you want to make sure

537
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:00,310
that you're making the right level in an

538
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:02,290
investment for your business if you're

539
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:04,120
in a higher value industry like you know

540
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:05,680
financial services this could mean

541
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,989
adding that additional friction to your

542
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,130
recovery process but also make sure that

543
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:11,800
you're considering this from your

544
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:13,930
customers perspective to do they

545
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,700
understand the value of their account so

546
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:17,830
if the user is signing up for a service

547
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:20,800
like Gemini you know a crypto currency

548
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:22,449
exchange that user probably is willing

549
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:26,740
to opt in to more security than they

550
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:28,180
would for like a door - account and this

551
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,640
is a great quote from a security

552
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:33,190
researcher Cormac Hurley where he argues

553
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,950
that users reject a lot of good security

554
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:37,990
advice but for good reason because a lot

555
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:40,150
of security advice involves taking a lot

556
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:42,250
of time and they either don't understand

557
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:43,630
that time is a risk to them and their

558
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,880
account that they're trying to add

559
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:47,260
security measures to they don't

560
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,870
understand at the time they might risk

561
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:52,150
losing or they might just not care I was

562
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:54,669
surveying some of my security pins about

563
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:56,440
why they what they think of backup codes

564
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,970
and it was interesting because there was

565
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,250
some one person that was like yeah I

566
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:03,070
have this a very detailed folder

567
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:05,260
structure that I keep on a USB and

568
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:07,120
safe and I was like that's really great

569
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:09,070
I'm glad that you do that but like I'm

570
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,658
not even willing to do that I keep my

571
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,970
backup codes in a variety of other

572
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:14,440
places that it's not that organized but

573
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:15,460
if that's something that me is that

574
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,799
somebody that thinks a lot about

575
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:20,049
authentication and you know talks a lot

576
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:23,350
about authentication and it has this

577
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:25,029
kind of elevated paranoia compared to

578
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:26,379
the average person if I'm not willing to

579
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:27,340
go to that level that's certainly not

580
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:30,700
something that I'm going to start

581
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:32,980
recommending to the average person but

582
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:36,220
getting back to more recommendations you

583
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:38,289
definitely want to be intentional about

584
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,600
who you're allowing to reset to if a or

585
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:42,309
if you allow people to reset to FA and

586
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,439
so this is along the lines of looking at

587
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:45,700
your threat model definitely be

588
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,070
intentional about this this was a

589
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,720
conversation that I had in Twitter DM s

590
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:52,178
where I was able to get customer support

591
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,789
to reset my account completely turn off

592
00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:56,590
my to FA a um and that was just by

593
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:59,350
giving them my phone number and my email

594
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:01,928
and so my Twitter account it was my full

595
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:04,299
name but that account is not tied to

596
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:06,220
that profile at all and so they might

597
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:08,590
have done some validation there but I

598
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:10,240
highly doubt that they did and I'm not

599
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:11,740
saying that like this company shouldn't

600
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,220
be letting their support team do this

601
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:16,539
but like I was wary enough of this that

602
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:19,330
I don't want to tell you who this

603
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:21,908
company was and so because I'm more

604
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:23,110
paranoid than the average person you

605
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:25,210
know this is something that I was like a

606
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:27,010
little wary of but from a service

607
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:28,899
perspective it was really easy to deal

608
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:30,399
with so there's that trade-off but I'm

609
00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:33,668
not really sure like whether or not this

610
00:21:30,399 --> 00:21:35,500
was the right answer um and also the

611
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:37,210
reason that I addressed this this is

612
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,710
just like completely a side note but the

613
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:40,029
reason I had to reset my to have a code

614
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:42,270
for this company is because it's not a

615
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:44,679
company that I log into very frequently

616
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:46,570
and I wasn't getting that e2f a code

617
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:47,830
sent to my phone so when I was trying to

618
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:50,710
log in they were like check your phone

619
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:52,178
we sent you an SMS like I you know tried

620
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:54,700
to do that and I just wasn't getting any

621
00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:57,580
SMS tokens but it turned out that I had

622
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:59,409
set up this account using AA fee and so

623
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,870
all their - FA messages were telling me

624
00:21:59,409 --> 00:22:03,610
to check my sms messages but they were

625
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:06,309
actually not doing that because I had

626
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:08,649
set up a TOTP token and so that's just

627
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:10,750
like a kind of a side that if you're one

628
00:22:08,649 --> 00:22:12,520
way to like help hopefully prevent a -

629
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:14,169
FA is to be clear on the messaging when

630
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,340
you're sending to f8 opens make sure

631
00:22:14,169 --> 00:22:16,810
that you're sending them

632
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,850
and messaging that you're sending them

633
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:23,409
to the channels that users actually have

634
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:25,570
been figured another thing that you can

635
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:27,010
do is prompt users to confirm

636
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:29,350
information that could be used for

637
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:31,450
recovery when they log in and so this is

638
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:32,889
one way that Twitter does that this is

639
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,240
the same idea behind things like

640
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:36,790
security checkups and email

641
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,740
notifications to review your account you

642
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:40,659
know I mentioned that digging into

643
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:42,250
profile settings probably isn't going to

644
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:44,050
be a very good way to get users to

645
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,730
update their security settings these

646
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:48,100
types of prompts are one way to get

647
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:49,540
users to either add additional factors

648
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,790
or make sure that the factors they have

649
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:53,530
registered are up-to-date then these

650
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:55,690
reminders are relatively cheap and easy

651
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:56,950
to implement and this is especially

652
00:22:55,690 --> 00:23:00,600
compared to the cost of what a customer

653
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:00,600
lockout or account recovery would be

654
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:05,500
another recommendation more than general

655
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,930
prompts is that you can also time these

656
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:10,210
reminders and get specific with them and

657
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:12,190
so time them around the holidays and

658
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:13,450
around new iPhone releases this is

659
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:16,270
something that you know from the augie

660
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:17,800
side of things we always see a higher

661
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:19,600
volume of support tickets around the

662
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,669
holidays when people get new phones and

663
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,990
around new iPhone releases and so that's

664
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:24,520
when people are changing their phones

665
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,870
that's when they might get locked out it

666
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,670
makes a lot of sense like there's not

667
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:29,739
really anything too crazy that's

668
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:31,270
happening there but an example of this

669
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:34,300
is an email I got from safety or last

670
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:35,560
winter is just reminder to save your

671
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:38,230
recovery code so that you don't get

672
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,429
locked out of your account and you know

673
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:41,200
off you used to be one of the only

674
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:43,750
Authenticator apps to support backups

675
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,100
that's no longer the case this may be

676
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,540
less of a problem now that more

677
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:49,689
Authenticator apps are starting to

678
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:51,430
support this this feature and you know

679
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:53,860
usually when you change a phone at least

680
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:55,930
in you know a lot of Western countries

681
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:58,479
you don't change your phone number but

682
00:23:55,930 --> 00:24:00,580
this is something that in some countries

683
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,950
people you know don't use their phone

684
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:04,600
number as the same type of identifier

685
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:08,770
and don't have that kind of static

686
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:10,240
identity that we think up here but even

687
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:12,010
actually Google Authenticator just

688
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,710
rolled out a token export feature for

689
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:16,960
Android it's not totally the same as the

690
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:18,550
Authenticator app support backups but

691
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,950
it's it's one way to make that process

692
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:24,730
of changing to FA tokens between phones

693
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:26,380
a little bit easier so another big thing

694
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:28,010
hopefully you're already doing this if

695
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,450
you support two FA

696
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:31,370
but you really want to make sure that

697
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:34,700
you're designing your 2fa onboarding

698
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:36,409
well and so in a 2018 study that focused

699
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,300
on the usability of you bikies

700
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:39,980
researchers found that setup success

701
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:42,409
varied a lot depending on the platform

702
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:45,110
that the customers were trying to log

703
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:48,650
into and so users logging into Google

704
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:50,389
had an 83% success rate of enabling 2fa

705
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:52,250
but when they were trying to log into

706
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:55,490
Facebook they only had a 32 percent

707
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:57,530
success rate of enabling 2fa and one

708
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:59,210
thing that's interesting is 19% of

709
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:01,399
people actually locked themselves out of

710
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:03,530
Windows 10 because the system allowed

711
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:06,710
them to enable the factor without ever

712
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:09,950
doing a successful verification and so a

713
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:11,540
lot has changed since 2018 but I think

714
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:13,520
this study is really interesting look at

715
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:15,649
how onboarding UX and impacts user

716
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,780
success and so it sounds obvious but

717
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:20,000
make sure that you your users are

718
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:22,490
completing at least one successful

719
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:28,400
authentication before they ever enable

720
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:29,900
that factor and finally the last

721
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,910
recommendation that I have that you want

722
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:34,460
to make sure you do is is ad waiting

723
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:37,580
periods to deter hackers and give users

724
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:39,950
real time real users time to dispute any

725
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:42,199
takeover attempts remember that your

726
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:44,000
solution is not going to ever perfectly

727
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,990
prevent attacks but in most cases you're

728
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,460
trying to build something that's

729
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:48,980
basically going to discourage people

730
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,600
from trying so like Alyssa Miller was

731
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,400
saying earlier and talked about threat

732
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,199
modeling I think the goal here is to

733
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,570
slow down an attacker and this is one

734
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,370
very explicit way to do that and this

735
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:00,350
gives you as the website and as a

736
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:02,689
service time to respond and protect

737
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:05,629
legitimate users so this is pretty

738
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:08,960
common for high-risk them account resets

739
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:10,280
so github this is their notification

740
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,290
that account recovery may take up to

741
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,879
three to five business days and so

742
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:15,350
because this is business days you can

743
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,090
assume that maybe there's like a real

744
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:18,620
human that's reviewing in some of these

745
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:20,540
maybe they send these to their security

746
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:23,290
team for review I'm sure it's some kind

747
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:25,460
of at least semi automated process

748
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:27,560
Gemini which is a crypto currency

749
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:29,600
exchange enforces a waiting period on

750
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,190
any kind of withdrawals just for a

751
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,740
password reset so this is not even

752
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:35,300
resetting you know your second factor

753
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,650
but this is you know one of the factors

754
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,450
if you're resetting it and doing an

755
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:41,500
account recovery here they're still

756
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:41,500
enforcing that waiting period

757
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,770
and then you know I just kind of wanted

758
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:47,660
to throw in some ideas into the ring for

759
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:49,639
debate - you know I already mentioned

760
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:51,230
automatically emailing backup codes

761
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,210
really curious to see what people think

762
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:54,740
about that idea you know we kind of

763
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:57,170
talked about trusted contact

764
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:59,000
authorization you know curious to see

765
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:00,710
like if people have you know tried this

766
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,820
and what the downsides are that's not

767
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:03,680
something that we've decided to

768
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,919
implement but you know I think it could

769
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:08,330
work for the right context you know what

770
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,460
about like something like link site

771
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:12,800
authorization this is what key base you

772
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:15,920
know presume was actually trying to do

773
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:18,649
the idea here was that if you know my

774
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:20,750
account on you know foo website is the

775
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:23,150
same person as my Twitter account if you

776
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:26,090
already have those linked could I tweet

777
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:27,890
something that builds some kind of trust

778
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:30,919
that I am the one that's trying to log

779
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:32,690
back into foo website you know that's

780
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,660
certainly possible like I don't know how

781
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:37,130
reasonable the implementation there is

782
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:38,690
then the one of the last things that I

783
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:40,160
wanted to kind of talk about was SMS

784
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:41,750
fallback like I've heard a lot of

785
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,460
debates and had some debates about this

786
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:46,550
whether that's a good option for

787
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:48,830
recovery of totp or hard for your token

788
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:50,810
or whether it defeats the point and it

789
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:52,310
might defeat the point but I think it's

790
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:55,220
better than nothing and it's probably

791
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:56,840
going to lower overhead for support and

792
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:59,570
that's something that's always important

793
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:01,850
to consider - so my general advice there

794
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:03,919
is like offer SMS as a fallback option

795
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:05,780
but don't make people use that as a

796
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,550
fallback option you want to really

797
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:09,740
delight your security conscious users

798
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:11,960
and so github does this like they offer

799
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:13,880
SMS as a fallback option but you don't

800
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,730
have to opt into that you don't have to

801
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,680
opt into SMS as that as a to FA channel

802
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:20,060
if you don't trust it

803
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,740
and of course you know what about

804
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:23,629
blockchain I'm just kidding please don't

805
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:26,300
save your computer resources for

806
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:28,610
something else but you know debate that

807
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,840
if you want to so you know I did want

808
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:31,219
something want to focus on the positives

809
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,750
here but I do have a couple of things

810
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:37,610
that you shouldn't do don't for instance

811
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:39,380
let people only use one factor to regain

812
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:42,020
access to accounts where they have to FA

813
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:43,790
enabled and we saw a wave of account

814
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:46,250
gets hacked because they were protected

815
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:48,409
with a password and SMS phase two FA and

816
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:51,560
then the attackers were able to sim swap

817
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:53,000
the the customer and bypass the password

818
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,679
because they had a second factor even

819
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,250
though the users had strong passwords

820
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,840
and

821
00:28:55,250 --> 00:29:01,190
that's something that you really want to

822
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:03,020
avoid and also just like please don't be

823
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:04,490
this company if you're going to disable

824
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:07,668
the second factor in account recovery

825
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:09,860
honestly just like don't offer to FA at

826
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:11,659
least send a fallback message to the SMS

827
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:13,580
in this case like I did still have

828
00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:15,289
access to my second factor for some

829
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:19,850
reason I just haven't saved the password

830
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:22,340
in you know in my password manager and

831
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:23,809
finally don't let this discourage you

832
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:25,280
there's a lot of ways that you can think

833
00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:28,039
about designing this but don't give up

834
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:30,830
on to FA the school research shows that

835
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:33,260
even SMS code sent to a recovery phone

836
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:35,840
number help prevent 76% of targeted

837
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:37,879
attacks and up to a hundred percent of

838
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,530
automated boss so this is really good

839
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,299
coverage and protect a lot of people

840
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:42,500
from account takeover just put a little

841
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:45,889
bit of thought into designing this

842
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:47,419
process and you'll be go golden so like

843
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:49,700
everything this will depend on your

844
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:51,559
business but here are some of the things

845
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:55,549
that you might want to monitor as you

846
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:57,230
adjust your to FA onboarding as you

847
00:29:55,549 --> 00:29:59,770
adjust your experience and think about

848
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:01,880
designing that and how you do recovery

849
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:03,350
definitely be friends with the support

850
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,090
team and make sure that you're aligned

851
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:07,340
on how much friction you're forcing your

852
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:09,379
users to endure because support costs

853
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:11,809
may go up as a result of adding

854
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:13,280
additional factors as a result of adding

855
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:15,500
additional security to your

856
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:18,530
authentication process but that's okay

857
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:20,210
if it's actually decreasing the relative

858
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:21,320
amount of compromised accounts or the

859
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:25,520
losses that you're suffering from

860
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:27,020
account takeover so I really hope that

861
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,789
this talk is giving you some ideas for

862
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:31,730
how to think about your account recovery

863
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:33,140
processes again my biggest thing here is

864
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,700
that you you know there's not a right

865
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,380
answer here but I really just want you

866
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,549
to think about it think about what's

867
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:39,950
right for your business think about

868
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:42,080
what's right for your users and adjust

869
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:44,270
accordingly and introduce the right

870
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,039
level of friction so if you have any

871
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:47,929
questions please add them to the saito

872
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:50,299
or you can reach out to me on Twitter

873
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:52,610
that's my twitter handle once again my

874
00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:54,730
name is Kelly Robinson and thank you for

875
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:54,729
listening

876
00:30:55,150 --> 00:31:03,169
all right the first question is from a

877
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:04,850
bravely named user gödel I think how is

878
00:31:03,169 --> 00:31:06,830
email a solid solution to store backup

879
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:08,850
codes if email is down everything will

880
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:11,010
go with it yeah

881
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:13,490
exactly I mean I didn't say it was a

882
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:16,020
solid solution I said it was a solution

883
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:17,610
and so like with everything like you're

884
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:19,470
gonna have to balance that against how

885
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:21,360
usable it is the benefit of that is that

886
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:23,490
users are probably more likely to have

887
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,979
access to their email account than they

888
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:28,860
would to whatever piece of paper they

889
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:31,170
printed out when they originally like

890
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:32,490
store their backup codes so like this is

891
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:34,710
one of those things like I don't have

892
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:37,350
the answer here I don't know if there is

893
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:39,000
a good answer for backup codes I really

894
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:41,340
want somebody to do this study maybe

895
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,930
I'll just have to you know work with

896
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:47,850
somebody in academia to design that

897
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:52,200
myself but yeah I mean there's there's a

898
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:54,840
lot of benefits of like usability in

899
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,920
these solutions and so that's something

900
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:59,360
that you're just gonna have to decide

901
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,360
whether you want to take the risk there

902
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:04,290
gotcha

903
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:06,240
all right so next one if I sum it up or

904
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:13,740
register three plus factors for 2fa

905
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:15,050
right yes awesome all right at this one

906
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:17,460
I'm actually very interested in myself

907
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:19,860
should we roll our own 2fa or use a

908
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:22,890
third-party provider or maybe if I can

909
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:27,419
rephrase that if I may what are the

910
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:28,980
risks of rolling your own yeah I mean it

911
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:31,260
depends on what you mean by roll your

912
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:33,390
own so it depends like some factors are

913
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:35,550
gonna be a lot easier to implement

914
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:38,340
yourselves like there's a lot of

915
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:41,210
libraries out there and most major

916
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:43,830
languages for doing things like TOTP um

917
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:45,960
you know but that's something that's a

918
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:47,189
somewhat complicated solution like

919
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:50,940
you're gonna have to start dealing with

920
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:52,850
things like time drifts and what you do

921
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:55,500
when somebody gets locked out of it

922
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:58,649
obviously I am biased since I work for a

923
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:00,240
security vendor that offers 2fa but the

924
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:02,370
thing that you're gonna have to keep in

925
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,870
mind is that a lot of channels like you

926
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:05,520
know SMS you're gonna have to outsource

927
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:08,699
the actual setting of the messages

928
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:10,590
anyway and so you know one of the

929
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,720
benefits that people end up coming to us

930
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:15,060
for is because folio offers that you

931
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,520
know kind of as a built in solution and

932
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:19,409
so yeah definitely like look at your

933
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,570
options and see how many people you have

934
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:22,070
available to support this like anything

935
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:25,120
that's with a

936
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:27,110
build verse by situation like you

937
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,389
probably will have to do less

938
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:31,129
configuration if you and less code if

939
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:33,440
you buy you know or at least partially

940
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:36,560
buys a solution or an API like we offer

941
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,940
but the risk to building your own is

942
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:40,429
that you're going to have to think about

943
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:42,350
a lot more edge cases and then you're

944
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:44,540
going to have to probably have more

945
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:46,550
people around to support those and also

946
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:47,930
support people when they you know get

947
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:49,460
locked out one of the one of the other

948
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:52,340
reasons that you know like a company

949
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:56,450
like twitch ends up coming to us for

950
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:59,090
their 2fa is that we we support the end

951
00:33:56,450 --> 00:34:00,590
user support when they get locked out of

952
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:02,419
their accounts were there you know they

953
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:04,189
end up calling to Leo's account security

954
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:08,300
team or Attilio support team instead of

955
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:10,280
purchase support team that makes a lot

956
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:16,160
of sense never have I ever been screwed

957
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:17,000
over by a time drift alright um so next

958
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,589
one um

959
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:25,760
how widespread is hardware token support

960
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:28,520
so you see this a lot more with internal

961
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,970
like enterprise employee security right

962
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:34,429
now it's you know hardware tokens are

963
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:38,199
based on top of something like Fido to

964
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:38,199
or you to S or web authentication

965
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:47,750
umbrella of support and not every device

966
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:49,699
like or not every website has support

967
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:51,560
for that yet and so it's not super

968
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:53,540
widespread especially on the consumer

969
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:56,389
side but like you will start to see this

970
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:58,460
a lot more with you know internal

971
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:59,930
employees support and that kind of thing

972
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:02,870
and that's because it's a lot easier for

973
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:04,669
the account recovery honestly so if you

974
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:07,009
lose your hardware security key like

975
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:09,530
there's a not like a lot of good ways to

976
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:13,070
get past that if you want to make sure

977
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:15,020
that's something that is used to log you

978
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:16,430
into an account and so let a lot of

979
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:18,950
people end up recommending is that you

980
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:20,779
get two Hardware tokens and so you

981
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,790
essentially have the same factor and

982
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:24,140
then a backup duplicate of it that you

983
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:26,509
would keep in an account or something

984
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:27,859
and that's excuse me that's gonna be

985
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:29,600
something that's really hard to get a

986
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:31,760
lot of consumers to do because there's a

987
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:34,310
lot of overhead and setting that up and

988
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,990
you know there is a huge risk there I'm

989
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:37,759
if somebody loses that token my

990
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:40,700
are you going to let them use different

991
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:43,340
factor for recovering that if they don't

992
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,990
have access to that so the the short

993
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:47,570
answer is it's not very widespread on

994
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:50,540
the consumer side yet I think that will

995
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:52,550
start to change as more devices that we

996
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:55,130
already have like our phones adopt the

997
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:57,530
web offense standard Google started

998
00:35:55,130 --> 00:36:00,410
doing this with Android phones but right

999
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:03,800
now as far as I know Android phones are

1000
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:11,350
only able to be a web a pen a compatible

1001
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:17,180
Authenticator for Google websites gotcha

1002
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:18,950
so sorry asks location can be an unseen

1003
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:20,868
factor for example when I went on

1004
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:22,580
holiday and wanted to log on to an app

1005
00:36:20,869 --> 00:36:25,810
on another device it wouldn't let me do

1006
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:27,860
that how can users be informed so

1007
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:29,779
there's a lot of these types of like

1008
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:33,080
silent authenticators that are starting

1009
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:36,260
to be introduced and this is can be part

1010
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:38,150
of like a biometric type Authenticator

1011
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:40,760
that's basically you seeing things about

1012
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:42,560
who or where you are to try to suss out

1013
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,750
whether or not that's something that we

1014
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,690
are comfortable with letting you have

1015
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:50,720
access to things the problem with these

1016
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:52,609
is that you they're not transparent to

1017
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,609
the users and so users can't really

1018
00:36:52,609 --> 00:36:57,290
configure the settings around these you

1019
00:36:55,609 --> 00:36:59,210
know we see some exceptions to that

1020
00:36:57,290 --> 00:37:02,060
right like bank fraud is a good example

1021
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:04,609
where you can tell your bank hey I'm

1022
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:06,440
gonna be traveling to X country for the

1023
00:37:04,609 --> 00:37:09,549
next two weeks like if you see activity

1024
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:11,810
on my card there don't like turn it off

1025
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:14,869
outside of banking I don't know of a ton

1026
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:16,730
of examples where companies let you

1027
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:18,230
explicitly like give permission for that

1028
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:19,820
and so that's gonna be something that's

1029
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:22,670
challenging from the user management

1030
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:26,690
side of this the other problem here is

1031
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:29,420
like there's just like less you know we

1032
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:30,500
don't have as much confirmation on this

1033
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:32,510
yet about whether some of these

1034
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:34,220
biometric Authenticator is like there's

1035
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:36,950
some debate about like whether voice

1036
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:39,080
recognition is a good use case or a good

1037
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:41,629
Authenticator for we see this a lot and

1038
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:43,009
like over the phone support people are

1039
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:47,060
trying to use this to help like save

1040
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:48,530
time in phone support but there's also

1041
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,279
been studies and things like voice

1042
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:51,500
recognition

1043
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,910
are proven to be racist and so is that a

1044
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,440
good often if you're going to be

1045
00:37:52,910 --> 00:38:02,149
discriminating against the set of your

1046
00:37:54,440 --> 00:38:03,650
users might not be yeah um alright I

1047
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,970
think we have time for one last one it

1048
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:06,830
seems to dovetail with a bunch of the

1049
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:11,810
other ones that I've seen

1050
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:13,100
what about Fido u2f so this is kind of

1051
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:16,370
what I was talking about with hardware

1052
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:18,529
security keys so this is you know u2f is

1053
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:21,069
the universal second factor and I think

1054
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:25,340
we're will start to see more of this

1055
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:27,200
converges in Fido to it the whole goal

1056
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:29,630
around using web offline as a factors

1057
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,850
that we want to replace passwords and so

1058
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:33,440
we still might have two-factor

1059
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:35,900
authentication

1060
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,460
but those Pat the the major factors that

1061
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:41,090
we're going to be using will no longer

1062
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:43,070
include a password and so I don't know

1063
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:45,380
if like you two F is going to be the

1064
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,850
term that we're going to be using going

1065
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:49,220
forward I think you know just for

1066
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:50,839
semantic purposes web off end and is

1067
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:52,609
going to be like what we'll specie a lot

1068
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:55,520
more of and to that point like I think

1069
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:57,470
as the devices that we already have like

1070
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,030
our phones start to become trusted

1071
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:01,399
authenticators like we'll start to see

1072
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:04,040
that pick up a lot more because I'm not

1073
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:07,310
as likely to like lose my iPhone as I

1074
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:09,020
would be likely to you know lose a

1075
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:10,610
hardware security key that I only used

1076
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:13,790
to log into a handful of websites

1077
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:16,250
perhaps and so the the challenge there

1078
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:18,290
is like how do we you set the backup how

1079
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:20,990
do you register another trusted secure

1080
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:23,060
factor in case somebody does lose their

1081
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:24,200
phone because that's something that you

1082
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:26,299
know we definitely have to deal with

1083
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,189
right now and giving some level of

1084
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:32,000
controls of the user of what they want

1085
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:34,100
to allow as a trusted backup and trusted

1086
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,170
recovery device in the case of lost

1087
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:39,040
phone is going to be something that I

1088
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:41,450
think we'll have to start explicitly

1089
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:47,029
giving users control over when they

1090
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:48,740
register those factors awesome thank you

1091
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:51,310
so much all right

1092
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:53,660
um thanks so much for being here again

1093
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:56,450
wish it could have been physically on a

1094
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:59,240
tree all it's been a really great talk

1095
00:39:56,450 --> 00:40:02,808
and thanks for closing out the afternoon

1096
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:04,999
evening whatever time is at this point

1097
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:07,500
in such an amazing way I really

1098
00:40:04,999 --> 00:40:25,919
appreciate it

1099
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:25,920
