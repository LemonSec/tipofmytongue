misinformation play books and a little

7
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,690
bit about the speakers so Roger Johnston

closely with the credibility coalition

13
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,790
in this InfoSec working group to develop

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,350
counters for disinformation and to

15
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,480
provide tooling to the a MIT community

16
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,010
today roger volunteers with the

17

evangelizes the need for greater

21
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,370
awareness of disinformation his recent

56
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:09,419
these folks please give them a virtual

57
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:12,200
round of applause and

58
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,200
yeah let's get started

59
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:21,119
okay so hello there my name is Roger and

60
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:24,810
today we're going to be talking to you

61
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,849
about cognitive security and it's a

62
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,880
rapidly growing domain that interacts

63
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:32,310
with both cyber and physical security

64
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:35,780
and it includes things like information

65
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:38,190
operations and disinformation

66
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:41,010
specifically we want to introduce the

67
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:44,099
tools techniques and resources for

68
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:46,890
threat sharing response and practical

69
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:48,410
applications there are five things we're

70
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:52,048
going to be talking about today

71
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:54,690
what disinformation is to threat

72
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:57,450
intelligence folks how to run

73
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,670
distributed teams for combating

74
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:02,369
disinformation the standards you'll need

75
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:09,390
to do so and the tools required to do

76
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:12,900
that so yes so over to you SJ okay so

77
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:15,119
next slide I'm gonna have to start

78
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,260
talking about what this thing is so

79
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,920
called negative security is the thing

80
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:22,399
we're trying to protect their

81
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:26,429
traditionally of being cyber security

82
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,530
networks wires computers and physical

83
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,880
security has become part of that the

84
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,200
idea you need to protect your physical

85
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,630
domains but there's also sighting of

86
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:38,790
collective security that you're

87
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:41,250
protecting not just the computer

88
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:45,709
networks and the physical domains but

89
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:50,780
also the mental domains around them now

90
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:55,350
part of that has all has been within

91
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:57,540
cyber security for a very long time it's

92
00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:00,239
always been if you look for it this idea

93
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,160
that it's a lot easier to mess with

94
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,410
people's minds to get what you want than

95
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:08,400
to mess with the system's now we're

96
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:10,290
seeing it turning up in very large scale

97
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,970
that it's a lot easier to mess with

98
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:15,690
people's minds to get what you want for

99
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:17,250
pretty much everything so the thing that

100
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,539
you're seeing a lot of right now is this

101
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,409
information you're seeing a lot of

102
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:25,979
disinformation campaigns you're seeing

103
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:27,060
everything from things like health care

104
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:32,030
disinformation

105
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:35,310
there and misinformation through to 5g

106
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:37,380
conspiracy theories and lots lots of

107
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,419
different motivations for it people are

108
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,230
doing this for money they're doing it

109
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:42,840
for attention

110
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:46,470
they're doing it for geopolitical Ames

111
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:50,460
they're doing for political aims lots of

112
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:52,470
reasons behind but focusing back to what

113
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:56,400
what it is we're talking about so what

114
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:58,830
we're talking about is how we deal with

115
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,919
disinformation how we deal with

116
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:07,229
cognitive security as part of an

117
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:10,440
embedding insight a CTI team so how did

118
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:12,770
we do threat intelligence when the thing

119
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,990
we're trying to protect is cognitive and

120
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:20,190
one of those threats is disinformation

121
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:22,350
so lots lots of definitions very easy to

122
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:25,080
get hung up for a very long time on this

123
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:27,150
infant and disinformation definitions so

124
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,430
we just use one working different

125
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:34,260
definition for the moment and this this

126
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:37,250
idea of this deliberate promotion false

127
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:40,530
misleading misattributed information so

128
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:42,360
the information that you use in a

129
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,799
disinformation disinformation campaign

130
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,950
doesn't have to be false you can use

131
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,440
real information but you can use false

132
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:52,110
attribution you can put it in a false

133
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:56,330
context you can use fake groups to

134
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:58,470
amplify it in a fake way so we have

135
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:00,690
disinformation campaigns we are

136
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:03,240
interested in the creation propagation

137
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:06,500
consumption of those and we're

138
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:09,780
interested in large-scale disinformation

139
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:12,389
we don't care that my grandmother thinks

140
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:16,469
my favorite color isn't purple we do

141
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:18,510
care if the intent is to change beliefs

142
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:21,600
and large amount of people we do care if

143
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:24,590
the intent is to create confusion we do

144
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,630
care if the intent is to create harm and

145
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:32,820
we can talk about visual harms for a

146
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:36,030
very long time as well next slide so

147
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:39,690
originally we started working on amat

148
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:41,369
looking at two levels so this was a

149
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:44,160
geopolitical level

150
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:46,319
so countries have this is the dye model

151
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,000
are different ways of affecting each

152
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,740
other so diplomatic informational

153
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,069
military economic so these were

154
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,690
traditionally a country had borders you

155
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:57,389
have to kind of find a way across those

156
00:06:54,690 --> 00:07:00,060
borders now every single one of these

157
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:02,370
gets influenced by information and

158
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,680
everywhere you have information you can

159
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:06,990
use this information to influence that

160
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,270
so now countries influence each other

161
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:11,220
using this information so we've got

162
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:15,719
these large-scale attacks coming country

163
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:18,300
to country next slide we also got

164
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:21,870
interested in what the business

165
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:24,090
correlation of that was so equally this

166
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:26,759
dine model for businesses so each of

167
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:29,068
these things now relies on information

168
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:32,849
each of these things can be corrupted by

169
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:37,530
this information so but now we're in a

170
00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:40,440
different world Kovich has shown a lot

171
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:42,119
of cracks in information societies where

172
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:45,630
we're all at home we're all relying on

173
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:48,509
information not all of us are at home

174
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:50,969
but a large number of people are relying

175
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:54,750
on online information on what's

176
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:58,919
happening in the world and there are

177
00:07:54,750 --> 00:08:04,380
unholy alliances forming between crowds

178
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:09,299
like the anti-vaxxers far right-wing

179
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:11,699
terrorists let there are people looking

180
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,490
to make money off the back of these that

181
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:16,050
there's all sorts of motivations going

182
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:18,900
on there are all sorts of swirls of

183
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:24,630
things going on and this looks very very

184
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:28,440
similar to the sorts of storms of

185
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:32,669
information you get across networks but

186
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:36,539
just on a human level so next slide so

187
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:41,130
what we see as people responding to this

188
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:45,529
are these layers of information so as

189
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:48,510
somebody creating a disinformation event

190
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:52,620
quite often you will see these longer

191
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:54,689
longer scale campaigns so 5g is a very

192
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,840
long term think

193
00:08:54,690 --> 00:09:00,690
people working on anti 5g anti backs is

194
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:04,770
a very long-term thing but you'll see

195
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:08,130
inside that incidents the Stafford Act

196
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:09,390
incident just took a few days there was

197
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,860
a room where the staffer that was going

198
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,380
to get implemented people were going to

199
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:16,490
be locked at home

200
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:19,080
5g COBIT 5g causes Kovac came up

201
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:23,150
appeared went away again and we keep

202
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:25,800
seeing incident after incident people

203
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:29,040
generally run on stories so narratives

204
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,870
the stories we tell ourselves about who

205
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,900
we are what's happening in the world

206
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:36,660
around us who we're not so we have this

207
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:39,209
idea of in-group so who we belong to and

208
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:42,150
who we don't belong to and you can use

209
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:44,190
narratives to strengthen beliefs in

210
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:46,590
what's happening you can use narratives

211
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:48,630
to strengthen beliefs and who you are

212
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:51,570
you can use narratives to confuse people

213
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:55,350
and you can use that to weaken whole

214
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:57,930
populations but as a data scientist as a

215
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:01,320
responder what you tend to see are these

216
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:02,699
artifacts you don't see the campaign's

217
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,490
the incidents and narratives you have to

218
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,640
work out what those are from the

219
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:12,360
messages from the texts from the images

220
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:16,710
from the groups from the accounts from

221
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:19,230
the social media from websites and to

222
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:23,190
work your way back up this pyramid so

223
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:26,130
what we see in practice is we track

224
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:28,710
incidents we look for narratives that

225
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:31,320
tie together those incidents but we work

226
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:33,710
at on out from artifacts so there's a

227
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:38,610
correlate here again with traditional TI

228
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:43,530
but this is where we come from so next

229
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:46,140
slide as with everything else people

230
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:49,310
process technology culture every system

231
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:52,350
and this all starts with people

232
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:53,849
everything starts with people so there

233
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:56,760
are people generating this they are

234
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:59,880
using people both as endpoints but also

235
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:04,530
as carriers and there are people to

236
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:07,420
respond to this so next slide so we

237
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:08,860
built the cogset collab

238
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,209
came out of the Mississippi Cosette

239
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,670
groups from last year we spoke about

240
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:15,310
last year the concept collab is a

241
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:17,920
nonprofit that was built to bring

242
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:21,550
together all the different people who

243
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,829
could start building the CTI response so

244
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:26,650
to create the resources to in need

245
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:28,690
create the processes create the tools to

246
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:31,930
start defending this cognitive domain

247
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:36,640
and do this in the similar way to other

248
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:39,430
CGI and then covered 19 happened so we

249
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,620
have this great idea to build a American

250
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:46,150
equivalent to Lithuanian elves which are

251
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:48,190
groups that do this make this

252
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:51,340
information response volunteer

253
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:53,950
disinformation response in Eastern

254
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:55,930
Europe and we were going to spend a

255
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:58,360
whole year doing it just setting it all

256
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:00,520
up and Cove it so we found ourselves

257
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:04,180
running and supporting community

258
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:09,640
deployments around the world so next

259
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:13,959
slide and luckily some of us have been

260
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:18,220
here before so 10 years ago I was lucky

261
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:20,650
enough to be part of the crisis mapping

262
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:24,300
community so I was one of the original

263
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:27,930
leads who was setting up processes

264
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:32,439
working out how to build data responses

265
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:34,800
so that the maps and data sets that

266
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:39,190
people responding to disasters need it

267
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:42,370
got into their hands in disasters during

268
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:45,940
those disasters and it was a very very

269
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:49,300
similar problem there was data in lots

270
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:51,370
of different places there was social

271
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:56,260
media there was this information

272
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:57,640
information there were flows there were

273
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,260
volunteers who wanted to help there were

274
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,260
people who had tools and it wasn't

275
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:05,170
joined up so we have a similar thing

276
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:08,740
happening now so now we have four teams

277
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:10,479
here that were part of coab in 19

278
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:13,660
activation which is a team that's

279
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,510
working on information and hazardous

280
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,939
information feed over to us covered 19

281
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:21,430
disinformation which was set up by

282
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:26,230
myself and a fellow

283
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:27,699
former crisis mapper so he's now over at

284
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:30,040
the Atlantic Council because that was a

285
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:34,149
search team which also has a

286
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:37,270
disinformation feed collection cogset

287
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:41,410
collab providing the back-end process

288
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:44,319
and tools support and the disinformation

289
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:46,000
team inside the CTI leak we were lucky

290
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,290
enough to be asked to set this up so

291
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,779
we're going to talk about this and as we

292
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:55,660
talk about this we're not with two

293
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:57,130
humans here were two people talking but

294
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,689
we're talking about what a team is doing

295
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:01,750
or what he is still doing is still

296
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:03,580
building and I just want to take a

297
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,160
second just say how immensely proud I am

298
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:09,070
er all the people who've come in brought

299
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,050
their skills and brought themselves and

300
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:15,089
just stepped up and started building

301
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:17,430
this thing it's immensely impressive

302
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:21,520
okay next slide

303
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:22,060
so that's the people building there's no

304
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,270
point

305
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:29,560
building a pretty view of what's going

306
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:31,060
on if you can't actually act my friend

307
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,599
Pablo has a saying for this which I'm

308
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:36,670
completely forgotten at the moment but

309
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,339
it's basically something like yeah and

310
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:40,959
and then so you've got to think about

311
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:45,070
who can actually act at the other side

312
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:47,709
so you have the ice axe which are the

313
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:50,890
critical sectors to feed out to so the I

314
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:52,989
sales I sack system we've been part of

315
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:55,990
helping set up the cloud native security

316
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:57,970
I sell one of the reasons we pick the

317
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:00,250
tools that we did was because the

318
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:02,830
existing networks already used those

319
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:05,529
tools so we could feed straight in so we

320
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:08,709
have set of set of groups over to the

321
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:10,660
left we can connect over to and being

322
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:14,619
pile of CTI lets us connect into more

323
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:16,540
people who can respond so quite often

324
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:20,010
when you hear talks about this

325
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:22,750
information there's this assumption that

326
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:24,189
well you can educate people and the

327
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:28,329
platform's can take stuff off their

328
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:30,220
sites and then there's a pause there's

329
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:31,540
an awful lot more that can be done with

330
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,640
an awful lot more responders and we're

331
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:35,779
going to talk about that at the end of

332
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,819
this talk but just a sense

333
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:41,959
more people who can get involved in our

334
00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:45,939
getting involved okay next slide let's

335
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:49,489
get to the process bit so this is the

336
00:15:45,939 --> 00:15:52,459
text setup that we're using at the

337
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:55,459
moment and don't get hung up on what's

338
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:58,878
in it this is just basic tooling tools

339
00:15:55,459 --> 00:16:01,008
that we're using again the the miss

340
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:03,259
panned the hive matching with tools that

341
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:05,899
other people are using the slacks

342
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:09,319
well everyone uses slacks oh hell we're

343
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:12,499
building slots all over the place but

344
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:13,849
this idea that we've got alerts coming

345
00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:16,910
through we've got collection coming

346
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:19,040
through and we analyze in tools that

347
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:22,279
other people understand within a CTI

348
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:25,910
world so it's not a surprise to anybody

349
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:29,569
and we're going from this alert to

350
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:32,149
action and just next slide and again

351
00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:35,149
this is for reading later it's this

352
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:37,189
sense of your your flowing through this

353
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:38,600
you're not just collecting just because

354
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:41,000
you can do something pretty when we

355
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:44,149
collect when we decide to start an

356
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,370
instant report we do it in the hope that

357
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:48,139
we can make some difference so it's like

358
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:50,180
tell people you're doing this make sure

359
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:52,839
it's actually going to do something or

360
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:54,859
has a potential do something useful

361
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:57,920
start putting it somewhere other people

362
00:16:54,860 --> 00:17:02,769
can find it and make sure it goes

363
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:07,339
somewhere so this is the plan next slide

364
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:09,169
so let's look back at that collection

365
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:11,208
part so that was like alert how you

366
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:14,380
start this and then look it's how we

367
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:17,649
actually get stuff into the systems so

368
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,649
next slide

369
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:23,198
so we spent last year building our Emmet

370
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:25,918
and I'm sure we bought some of you to

371
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,080
tears talking about how we built a

372
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:32,110
disinformation version of the attack

373
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:34,510
framework so adversary misinformation

374
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:37,899
influence tactics techniques this idea

375
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:42,370
is that we needed a framework to

376
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:46,929
understand how the bad guys would

377
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:50,168
organize a disinformation incident so

378
00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:53,380
it's at the innocent level so that if we

379
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:56,260
understand and we can map the activities

380
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:59,230
that they do and a techniques they use

381
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:01,149
we can then map counters to those

382
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:04,120
techniques ways to deal with those

383
00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:05,379
techniques so we've got the framework

384
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,699
we've been building out the process

385
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,710
we're building out those counters

386
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:11,289
building out tools we can use so

387
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:12,850
originally we built amat as a missive

388
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:15,429
basic working group under the

389
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:19,689
credibility coalition we've now moved it

390
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:21,730
over to Mike we're taking it on which is

391
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:24,340
wonderful because then they get a mate

392
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:26,110
and attack but for the moment we're

393
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:32,620
running it under Cox at colab because

394
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:35,830
we're using it so next slide this is

395
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:41,049
what it looks like in practice we built

396
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:43,658
this by looking at every type of stage

397
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:47,370
based framework that might be useful so

398
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:50,260
we looked at the attack framework and

399
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:51,489
other info SEC frameworks we couldn't

400
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:57,700
get any of those to quite fit this

401
00:18:51,490 --> 00:19:00,850
information we looked at advertising

402
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:03,760
technologies so we looked at the funnel

403
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:08,080
networks the the funnel frameworks that

404
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:11,350
were used to describe how people move

405
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,480
through AdTech those are really useful

406
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:16,418
for describing how people get

407
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:20,220
radicalized and there are parts of those

408
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:23,080
in in amat the fact that you have things

409
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,610
in fact there's there's a stage missing

410
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:28,570
off the back of this which is the

411
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:30,490
monitoring and evaluation stage that you

412
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,689
go through a campaign and then you check

413
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:34,360
how well it worked

414
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:36,820
just so there are pieces all the way

415
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,740
through this there's also a task list

416
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:41,590
behind damage that you don't see on the

417
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:45,519
front end but these are techniques so

418
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:47,289
just like attack there's tactic stages

419
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,360
and there are techniques within each

420
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:51,580
stage that that you see happening and

421
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:55,229
now I'm going to hand it over to Roger

422
00:19:51,580 --> 00:20:01,149
because he's been quiet for way too long

423
00:19:55,230 --> 00:20:02,889
okay thanks Esther so we have we have

424
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:05,129
the i'ma framework and we have some

425
00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:08,379
ideas for we're talking about

426
00:20:05,129 --> 00:20:10,269
disinformation in general but we need to

427
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:12,250
make that practical need to actually

428
00:20:10,269 --> 00:20:17,710
apply that and people did you work with

429
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:20,980
it so this is an example probably most

430
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:23,049
people are familiar with planned emic as

431
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:26,289
a deep pond conspiracy theory video that

432
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:28,240
recently came out and make some pretty

433
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:32,559
dubious claims about the nature of Kobe

434
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:36,100
19 and it's an interesting example to

435
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:37,750
look at because it doesn't just resonate

436
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,610
with a normal conspiracy crowds but it

437
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:42,970
really threatened to become mainstream

438
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:48,820
for a number of reasons in part due to

439
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:50,769
the high production quality and some of

440
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,428
the specific techniques they used which

441
00:20:50,769 --> 00:20:56,289
we'll get to

442
00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:57,879
and then next slide but when we look at

443
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:59,379
this example when we look this influence

444
00:20:57,879 --> 00:21:02,110
operation we want to be able to

445
00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:04,600
deconstruct it specifically enumerate

446
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:09,428
the individual techniques so that we can

447
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:15,730
go and counter them in this case my

448
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:18,129
endemic relies very heavily on an appeal

449
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:22,779
to Authority it uses the attack the

450
00:21:18,129 --> 00:21:27,219
technique used to fake experts so dr. JD

451
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:29,889
Mike Ovitz is and now disgrace doctor

452
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:31,960
but the message resonates because it

453
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:34,178
suspends disbelief with the viewer a

454
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,460
person that would perhaps otherwise not

455
00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:37,899
take a message seriously thinks to

456
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,399
themselves well this is a doctor so

457
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:40,899
perhaps we should entertain this

458
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:42,800
thoughts

459
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:47,390
[Music]

460
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:51,970
and that's that's pretty interesting you

461
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:51,970
can then go and counter this technique

462
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:58,670
by focusing on things like her

463
00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:00,800
credentials individuals involved whether

464
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:02,330
science debunks this whether there's

465
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,690
previous research that says this is

466
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:07,070
false but that doesn't necessarily

467
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:09,620
matter that much the damage is already

468
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:12,340
done and we see this with fake experts

469
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:16,280
in other fields such as anti vaccines

470
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:18,800
climate change or whatever and so this

471
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:21,050
technique using a using a fake experts

472
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:24,159
who push to push out a narrative is

473
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:27,860
effective because it's a human story and

474
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:31,610
the place into a narrative of a lone

475
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:34,879
researcher who is out you know trying to

476
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:36,889
defend herself against the powers that

477
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:42,560
be the political and scientifically

478
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:43,580
thought would crush this theory and and

479
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,810
that's you know that's not about the

480
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,669
science that's about that's about the

481
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:52,220
human story

482
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:53,330
so moving on each of these techniques

483
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:56,330
that we're looking at whether it's

484
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:58,399
planned emic and these appeals will take

485
00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:00,919
it they got experts or the use of bonds

486
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,690
to amplify message we need to be able to

487
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:05,210
work with these ideas quickly and map

488
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:07,010
them out so that we can we can model

489
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:09,710
these behaviors and model them and their

490
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:12,050
progression over time and so one of the

491
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:15,710
first tools that we actually turns to

492
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:18,530
was the mitre attack matrix and the

493
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:19,970
attack navigator excuse me and we kind

494
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:22,670
of retrofitted the navigator to work

495
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:24,620
with Emmet's so now we're able to you

496
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:27,650
know just click through the UI create

497
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:31,219
layers for red and blue team planning to

498
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:35,120
model out what the attacker is doing the

499
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:37,310
strap our ideas for how to count to them

500
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:41,719
and then export this into other tools

501
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:46,389
such as miss or threatened cell reports

502
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:50,690
or however we wants to use that

503
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:52,850
mitre recently upgraded or modified the

504
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:54,620
attack matrix so that it supports sub

505
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:56,719
techniques which is really interesting

506
00:23:54,620 --> 00:24:00,409
so previously you had something like

507
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,530
it was a very clunky kind of technique

508
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:05,870
lots of things would be contained in it

509
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:07,580
the idea we have now is to go the same

510
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:09,830
route using subject mix and be able to

511
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,270
refine these further so you know a

512
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:15,639
little more granular than what we're

513
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:15,639
representing here so that's in the works

514
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:28,100
okay okay so that was the techniques and

515
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:30,260
tactics how we represent those we're

516
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:35,110
also looking at how we fit things like

517
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:38,000
narratives into Miss specifically and

518
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:39,649
we've just started looking at how

519
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,550
narratives grow and die because now it

520
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:45,620
is also appear and disappear and

521
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:47,690
attached to different groups in

522
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:49,909
different ways so we've looked at the CM

523
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:51,590
you listen for covert 19 we're looking

524
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:55,220
at other lists from other groups we're

525
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:56,750
also seeing narratives being combined so

526
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:59,500
covert is interesting because we're

527
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:02,090
seeing Kovich narratives combining with

528
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,570
conspirator cost burfi narratives male

529
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:05,480
swear

530
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:09,439
so there's a whole bunch of interesting

531
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:11,180
work from storytelling to be to be

532
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,820
brought in here so just pretty this is

533
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:15,920
placeholder we're unless but there's

534
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:17,290
work if anyone's interested in playing

535
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:28,130
with this complain

536
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:32,149
next fun oh okay dope so I just

537
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:33,620
really no place to do this um okay so a

538
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:35,570
lot of the work we did in the last year

539
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:40,159
was really to bootstrap our set of tools

540
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:43,520
and putting everything in sticks was a

541
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:46,520
requirement miss can use sticks most

542
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,960
tips do use sticks and it's a standard

543
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,090
for the ice house and ice axe

544
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:53,330
importantly so I've added some new

545
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:55,639
objects we have new SG oohs and AHS

546
00:25:53,330 --> 00:26:00,129
arose in the works to further extended

547
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,130
language that we can use with Emmett's

548
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:07,370
but one of the major things we recently

549
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:09,110
concentrated on was was misc I did a lot

550
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:10,459
of work to get a mitt included and work

551
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:12,889
natively in this

552
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,960
so that were able to able to tag event

553
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:20,890
C's in the appropriate Hema techniques

554
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:23,690
and importantly we recently set up a new

555
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:26,530
mist sharing community specifically for

556
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:30,260
disinformation and so we're working with

557
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:32,480
friends in nato canada RRM other

558
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:35,990
partners to start sharing and

559
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:43,030
collaborating on information operations

560
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:46,130
in a like a dedicated channel so yeah so

561
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:48,020
I'm in this for me worked in a set of

562
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:54,380
tags new objects that are specific to

563
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:56,360
information operations and did you for a

564
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:59,990
lobster kata me of disinformation is a

565
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:02,389
set of tags specifically for talking

566
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:06,260
about the nature of an operation and

567
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:13,250
it's like relationship to States or

568
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:15,940
political actors or whatever and this is

569
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:21,290
this is why we're doing it this is why

570
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:24,200
this is why we want to use this really

571
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:25,610
it's about showing though the story

572
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,020
that's happening it's not just it's not

573
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:29,149
just collecting the indicators I don't

574
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:32,080
really care to just have a set of URLs

575
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:34,040
or a set of Twitter handles or posts

576
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:37,820
what we actually want to do is represent

577
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:40,010
how those relate to each other how

578
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:42,560
they're being used so just a certain

579
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:45,140
Twitter handle cross post see a set of

580
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:47,600
blogs and how does that relates to you

581
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:49,970
know domains that are owned by some

582
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,469
party or whatever and as we collaborated

583
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:54,050
in the mist community hopefully we can

584
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:57,050
flesh out and begin to enrich these

585
00:27:54,050 --> 00:28:03,550
models and push those out to a wider

586
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:06,260
wider distribution group okay next slide

587
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:08,780
analysis next slide so this is about

588
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:11,360
making sense of what we found so graph

589
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:13,639
analysis is gaze big in what we do so

590
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:17,270
super spreaders people who are actively

591
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:19,730
spreading out disinformation finding the

592
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:21,889
origins of rumors it seems to be

593
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:23,660
tracking to money and awful lot

594
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:24,300
finding new artifacts tracking those

595
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:27,960
movements over

596
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:30,060
so this is basically how disinformation

597
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,950
is spreading over time and getting a

598
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:34,909
handle on that and being able to block

599
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:38,700
it next slide

600
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:40,320
image analysis looking for similar we

601
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,060
haven't done much looking at chellah

602
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,929
fakes we haven't seen a lot of that yet

603
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:49,190
next slide and some early work on

604
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:52,980
narrative detection next slide again and

605
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:53,610
to action next slide so this is the last

606
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,400
section

607
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:58,560
so this is looking at what can actually

608
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,530
do and it breaks down to four different

609
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:03,149
plants its actions or do we already

610
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:05,460
exist as take down the botanist educate

611
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:07,770
people and then tactic level action

612
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:09,930
technique level actions and then

613
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:11,760
doctrine doctrine level actions so

614
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:12,720
doctrine based actions which i think is

615
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:18,080
actually cutting some of the most

616
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:21,120
interesting stuff to you Roger okay

617
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,760
so yeah so we spent last year looking at

618
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:27,510
countermeasures thinking of things that

619
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:29,310
we could do ultimately the way we

620
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:31,950
organize those into buckets are based on

621
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:36,960
JP 313 effects actions that we can

622
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:39,120
detect or deny you know disrupt agree

623
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,350
destroy we want to have some type of

624
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:45,120
effect on an adversary escape abilities

625
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:47,250
so we looked at those we organized them

626
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:50,879
under that model and then started to put

627
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:54,630
them into meta categories which means

628
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,370
can we cluster a set of disruption

629
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:58,110
activities in such a way that you know

630
00:29:56,370 --> 00:30:01,139
it really belongs in its own bucket

631
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:03,929
maybe adding friction to a platform to

632
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:09,660
make it harder to use sock puppets for

633
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:11,040
example and once we have these we can

634
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:12,510
then start applying them to the

635
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:15,899
individual techniques in the Amit

636
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:18,930
framework to the individual tactics and

637
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:20,370
techniques that are in there what we're

638
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:23,930
looking at right now is a simply

639
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:28,379
accounts of our occurrence progress on

640
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:32,550
which techniques are able to it's a

641
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:34,140
counter and that's how we started but

642
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:36,440
it's not really how we finished and

643
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:37,650
that's not what we're doing anymore

644
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,540
Australian

645
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:41,760
Pablo and Greg had a conversation at

646
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:44,280
some points about the nature of

647
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,950
disinformation operation what came out

648
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:49,170
of that essentially was the idea that

649
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:52,230
influence operations have some essential

650
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:57,510
requirements you need resources it's

651
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:59,910
time media infrastructure and everything

652
00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:03,090
is universally scarce or at least honest

653
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:06,390
universally scarce so with use like with

654
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:09,870
these critical elements we can apply

655
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:11,070
those to our countermeasures or think of

656
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:12,570
our countermeasures in reference of

657
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:15,780
those critical elements ask questions

658
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:18,360
about how we can disrupt those so for

659
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:21,260
example when we're looking at resource

660
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:23,610
exhaustion things like money and

661
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:25,740
audience are there ways that we can

662
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:28,679
waste an adversary's money or make an

663
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:31,730
operation so expensive that it's no

664
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:33,690
longer worth it or or in reference to

665
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:36,390
execution or time

666
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:39,510
can we is there time so that they're not

667
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:43,230
able to achieve their goals in the

668
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:45,390
required frame example of that meeting

669
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:47,310
the 2020 election know if you're trying

670
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:48,810
to meddle in the election it'll only

671
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:51,179
make sense that you do your actions

672
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:53,639
prior to people though then afterwards

673
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:57,420
it doesn't matter so if we can throw a

674
00:31:53,640 --> 00:32:00,780
wrench in that or slow down that's a

675
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:05,130
specific elements that we can apply

676
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:06,810
effects to for that purpose but to do

677
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,920
that you kind of need to know a little

678
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:10,139
bit about who you're dealing with if you

679
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,250
can't just go in and speculate you

680
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,530
actually have to model who your

681
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:15,810
adversary is or do some research to

682
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:18,330
figure out how they're resourced what

683
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:19,919
their limitations are this was a super

684
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:24,419
interesting example one of my recent

685
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:25,530
favorites it's double deceit and the

686
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:30,500
nature of this operation it's

687
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:33,840
essentially like a dozen kids 12 or so

688
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:39,270
young young young persons sitting around

689
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:43,020
a table with smartphones posting all day

690
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:44,879
long in Indiana so it's a very low

691
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:47,370
resource operation there's one or two

692
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,880
managers maybe a bunch of kids very

693
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:52,889
little technology very little at

694
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,460
administrative oversight or or

695
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:59,910
management as as far as we're aware and

696
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:02,790
no automation no bought capabilities it

697
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:05,520
was just people dining posts into their

698
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:10,950
phone so how do you disrupt that what

699
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:16,460
looking what can we do well there are

700
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:20,450
number of ways one of the things that

701
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:23,250
came to mind that we looked at was

702
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:24,630
disrupting their ability to understand

703
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:27,210
their metrics or know whether or not

704
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:31,260
they're actually being effective if we

705
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:35,070
can engage the adversary let me bleed

706
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:36,150
though must alone there must be given

707
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:39,000
the fact that they're a lone resource

708
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:42,090
after but not or may not be able to

709
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,890
necessarily see the bigger picture we

710
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:48,030
might be able to push them in a

711
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:50,340
direction that's counter to their in

712
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:53,550
school so we can sort of time waste of

713
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:56,520
money keep them busy doing whatever but

714
00:33:53,550 --> 00:34:00,600
ultimately you know it in for their

715
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:03,300
their failure and so we've started to

716
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:05,550
model this in our playbook or play books

717
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:08,520
which is what we have all on the screen

718
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:11,399
right now and we break this down into

719
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:14,219
individual response actions so a

720
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:16,409
particular thing we want to do deep

721
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:19,230
platforming and account and then we

722
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:21,179
bundle those up into a bigger playbook

723
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:23,940
that's a situation appropriate or actor

724
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:25,889
appropriate based on the critical

725
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:28,200
elements of the effects the critical

726
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:30,360
elements we want to attack and the

727
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:33,480
effects we want to to put on that

728
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:35,659
Parliament so that's the core idea of us

729
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:37,770
building play books and I think that's

730
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:39,810
where most of our time is going right

731
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:42,629
now I know we're short on time and I

732
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:45,659
wish I could get into this a little more

733
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:47,610
but yeah I'll hand it over to you and

734
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:51,830
I'll just say thanks so much for

735
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:51,830
listening to us today thank you

736
00:34:52,550 --> 00:35:08,930
so uh back to yesterday oh no just thank

737
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:11,180
you very much oh sorry about that I was

738
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:13,730
talking while muted great with

739
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:14,690
technology um so thank you so much folks

740
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:17,690
this was amazing

741
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:20,810
it was actually I know that Mis P is a

742
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:23,630
really popular subject among our

743
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:25,820
participants and this way of working

744
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:27,850
with it and its application to you know

745
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:33,130
the world situation

746
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:38,089
to pervading so I'm just gonna attempt

747
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:39,830
to show the questions so let's go right

748
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:41,900
to it how do you account for an

749
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:45,610
irrational party or the one that is

750
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:48,800
strongly biased by beliefs over facts

751
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:53,290
this is the whole working on emotions

752
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:55,850
rather than facts think so a lot of

753
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:58,310
disinformation remember I said that she

754
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:59,509
doesn't have to be volts does actually

755
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:07,000
play with emotion

756
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:10,040
you can play in that space a lot of

757
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:14,110
really good disinformation works on

758
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:16,850
network effects so you're looking at

759
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:17,750
who's connected to a person and how you

760
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:20,839
get information through those

761
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:27,020
connections quite often the counters can

762
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:30,440
be very similar to the problem one thing

763
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:34,100
that has become very apparent with

764
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:36,410
ecovillage is that countering

765
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:40,730
disinformation isn't just about removing

766
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:44,180
the disinformation it's not just taking

767
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:46,190
out the problem it's also a twin thing

768
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:49,940
or if you have to produce better

769
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:53,170
information sources so part of the

770
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:57,290
reason this information has become so

771
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:59,930
good is that there are information

772
00:36:57,290 --> 00:37:03,259
deserts there are not those strong

773
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:07,118
sources of clear good information that

774
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:10,520
everybody recognizes and goes to

775
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:12,410
especially unfortunately there are some

776
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:15,320
countries where the state would normally

777
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:19,220
do that and doesn't have that state

778
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:22,099
representation so yes sir so some of

779
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:26,149
this is but you produce or amplify

780
00:37:22,099 --> 00:37:28,940
better information sources and the

781
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:31,040
platform's putting up links to better

782
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:33,500
information sources every time you look

783
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:36,430
at Kobey's you'll see the whio marker on

784
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:42,849
some of them has has been a good counter

785
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:50,180
I'm not sure if that's enough Roger yeah

786
00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:54,290
so I think one thing to add to that is

787
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:55,640
that there isn't necessarily so like

788
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:57,710
what we're looking at with this

789
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,359
information and this information there

790
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:00,950
isn't all this a counter and that's just

791
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:02,779
something we need to bear in mind if

792
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:05,540
somebody has a deeply entrenched

793
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:07,580
irrational belief like bleach is good

794
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:11,420
for you that's gonna be really difficult

795
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:13,730
to to steer them out of and so I I don't

796
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:16,760
know if attacking that how long is

797
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:17,960
always the solution rather to try to you

798
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:21,310
know maybe steer them to other sources

799
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:27,770
or distract them with something less

800
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:33,049
that's harmful to other folks yeah well

801
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:34,730
not awesome all right so the next

802
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:38,560
question is do you attempt to do

803
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:41,359
attribution if so how successfully

804
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:45,770
sometimes we try to track back to source

805
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:49,960
I have taken back to source where there

806
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:52,369
being private individuals and not

807
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,880
attributed so sometimes the best thing

808
00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:58,070
to do is to not give attribution

809
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:02,349
sometimes it's not helpful and you don't

810
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:08,410
want to be daxing somebody also

811
00:39:02,349 --> 00:39:12,170
attribution is hard there are countries

812
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:18,020
organizations who work hard to look like

813
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:20,950
somebody else so sometimes what you're

814
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:24,920
trying to track is not necessary

815
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:27,710
attribution but motivation so why is

816
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:29,660
somebody doing this thing and why is

817
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:31,700
suddenly somebody getting excited about

818
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:38,029
MH 14 in the middle of an active acts

819
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:40,310
conversation oh the bass question is can

820
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:43,130
we stop this or slow it down it's not

821
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:45,410
who did this I think the one thing we

822
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:48,410
can look to in that in that respect

823
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:50,330
though and sju you're touching on it is

824
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:52,370
the narrative analysis you know we can

825
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:55,400
pool the narratives that we suspected

826
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:57,560
that an actor is producing and and ask

827
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:00,800
questions who does this benefit write

828
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:03,320
like does this narrative help actor X

829
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,120
yes or no but I won't necessarily tell

830
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:07,850
us who that person is but can at least

831
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:11,980
hinge their motives and that might be as

832
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:11,980
good as we can get it in some cases so

833
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:19,670
that make sense

834
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:21,170
all right next question then you

835
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:23,150
mentioned money is often behind the

836
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:25,160
source of a rumor can you trace your way

837
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:27,500
to an idea of what kind of interests

838
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:31,399
this money has such as government

839
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:33,110
corporation mercenary Oh in in kovetz

840
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:36,920
there's an awful lot of people who are

841
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:39,950
just selling books or selling talks a

842
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:42,320
lot of pride essentially private

843
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:43,520
individuals selling their ways and we've

844
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:47,300
seen everything up to an including

845
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:49,550
t-shirts out there there's also some big

846
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:51,950
money behind some of the the protests

847
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:56,990
and stuff but more often than not has

848
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:59,089
been small money it up a large part of

849
00:40:56,990 --> 00:41:04,899
it is just like a bad revenue just

850
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:04,900
clicks right click some merchandise yeah

851
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:14,870
yeah that's kind of sad all right

852
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:17,240
another question do you know if tools

853
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:19,730
using AI in combination with Hammett to

854
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:21,470
have a situational big picture or would

855
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:25,430
there be no way for such things to be

856
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:28,669
efficient we actually as part of Cox at

857
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:31,759
Cadillac have a data science subgroup so

858
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:33,740
I played a scientist we kind of play

859
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,500
with AI so

860
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:40,310
the narrative stuff we skipped through

861
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:42,940
we did do some clustering analysis so we

862
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:45,290
basically scraped EU versus this info

863
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:46,580
scraped out their text and do cluster

864
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:50,509
analysis or their text looking for

865
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:52,700
narratives so yes we can and yes I think

866
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:57,619
it would be useful it's just on the

867
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:59,169
to-do list at the moment maybe someone

868
00:41:57,619 --> 00:42:01,790
watching wants to get on it

869
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:03,230
one of the things all complaining

870
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:05,240
interest what are the interesting things

871
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:08,720
I saw it's not really AI it's more NLP

872
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:12,649
but lighter lighter did a project if it

873
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:14,720
was called tram for parsing CGI reports

874
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:16,190
and then like matching out the sentences

875
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,410
or words or whatever to the miter attack

876
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:20,570
matrix that's something I've been

877
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:23,480
eyeballing to do but it just requires a

878
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:25,040
lot of like initial parsing of those

879
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,859
reports manually to build your data set

880
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:31,520
but if anyone wants to help me then you

881
00:42:27,859 --> 00:42:33,230
know we could make that happen so yeah I

882
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,880
mean I also gave a talk in AI for good

883
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:37,040
where they wish list in it in the back

884
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:42,800
of it so well there's a list there if

885
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:45,980
you want to go play awesome alright I

886
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,750
think we have time for one last one have

887
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:49,760
you found a way to create a common

888
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:52,130
operating picture possibly using AI

889
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,720
dashboard that can show real-time events

890
00:42:52,130 --> 00:43:00,470
with possible events that cause them any

891
00:42:53,720 --> 00:43:03,740
thoughts hmm that's not a bad thing to

892
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:06,879
aim at I mean we've got high for the K

893
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:11,060
scenes we've got miss with the

894
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:13,490
situations in there we're not too far

895
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:22,910
off just dashboard dashboarding it but

896
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:27,140
it's about making it make sense the

897
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:29,060
class yeah everyone that go sign up all

898
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:32,930

00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:48,099
station situation

906
