1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,680
okay sorry about that uh

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,359
lex thanks so much for for that

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:08,960
introduction and thanks so much to the

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,800
organizers for the invitation they've

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,759
asked for a while it's never worked with

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,839
this my schedule it happens that i teach

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,600
in early may and that often conflicts

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,400
with this event and so it's fantastic

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,960
both to be able to be here and

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,680
as was noted it's fantastic to get to be

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,720
here in person again with these kinds of

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,560
events it's been a long time and it's

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,238
great uh to have the opportunity to

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,040
again get back to face to face so i

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,880
focus on sort of the intersection

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,760
between law technology and policy

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,520
there's a lot happening right now in

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,800
canada and what i wanted to do was use

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,120
my time to try to bring you up to speed

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,840
on what is happening alert you to the

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,440
kinds of changes that have been taking

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,879
place because there have been some

23
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,399
pretty big ones in terms of where the

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,960
canadian government is at and in a sense

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,840
urge you this community to become

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,160
actively engaged because these are

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,000
issues that i think directly affect all

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,280
of us they certainly direct all

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,520
canadians but particularly those coming

30
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,159
from the security technical privacy

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,200
online communities the implications of

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,799
some of these policies i think are

33
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,439
profound and it is essential that our

34
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,000
policymakers our politicians and others

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,280
better understand some of the

36
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,840
implications of what they're deciding

37
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,159
so i titled it as you can see what lies

38
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,920
behind canada's internet regulation

39
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,119
reversal

40
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,680
and when i refer to a reversal i would

41
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,759
take us back quite a while back to the

42
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,960
late 1990s when our broadcast and

43
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,640
telecoms regulator the crtc was first

44
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,479
thinking about the internet and whether

45
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,720
or not there was or what the role might

46
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,520
be from a regulatory perspective they

47
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,280
took the position that they had the

48
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,159
power to regulate online services we

49
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,920
didn't have netflix's in the at that

50
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,360
point in time but they took the position

51
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,520
that the broadcast act would cover those

52
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,520
kinds of things but that it wasn't in

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,600
the public interest or within the policy

54
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,439
interest to do so

55
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,159
that led to some pretty innovative if

56
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,239
somewhat controversial services i don't

57
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,919
know how many people remember this

58
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,720
service here i crave tv it was in a

59
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,800
sense the youtube before there was

60
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,000
youtube

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
where this service was able to take over

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,480
the air television streams rebroadcast

63
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,760
them so that people on their 56k dial-up

64
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,920
modem could try to watch this little box

65
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,120
of television um television broadcasters

66
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,040
and others thought this was outrageous

67
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,879
nobody would ever or should ever be able

68
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,120
to watch video on the internet they

69
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,840
thought and so tried to find ways to

70
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,400
stop services like this but the canadian

71
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,080
policy was largely designed to

72
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,560
facilitate that kind of innovation and

73
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,160
it was that approach it was pretty

74
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,800
consistent for many years we can go back

75
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,560
a number go forward i suppose a number

76
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,560
of years later some of you may recall

77
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,560
this incredibly cheesy video that then

78
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,879
prime minister harper put forward when

79
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,239
he declared that there would be no

80
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,879
netflix tax he loved breaking bad was

81
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,720
the television show he decided to talk

82
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,319
about and that there would be no there

83
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,480
would be no internet taxation or no

84
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,680
netflix taxation in fact even in fairly

85
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,200
recent times under the liberal

86
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,519
government we had then heritage minister

87
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,480
melanie jolie look at this issue and

88
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,480
come to the conclusion that canada was

89
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,720
better off working with many of the

90
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,800
large internet services like netflix

91
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,120
rather than moving towards mandated

92
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,799
regulation

93
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,360
in fact this picture here which would be

94
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,000
unthinkable in the current environment

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,159
is not didn't take place that long ago

96
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,519
this was the launch

97
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,680
of the sidewalk labs

98
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,840
so-called smart city project in toronto

99
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,280
the smart city proposal between

100
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,640
waterfront toronto and and google i was

101
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,840
i served actually as waterfront

102
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,159
toronto's uh the chair of their digital

103
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,720
strategy advisory board but the launch

104
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,040
of this event which of course includes

105
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,879
the prime minister includes the then

106
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,879
premier of ontario kathleen wynne the

107
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,159
mayor of toronto and google executives

108
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,519
justin trudeau doesn't want to be in the

109
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,439
same city as a google executive right

110
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,080
now much less appear on the same stage

111
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,959
as one um i'm not sure that that's right

112
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,959
i don't think that's that's that's the

113
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,480
kind of policy positions we ought to be

114
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,040
taking but that is where we stand now

115
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,358
and even as recently as the trade

116
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,959
agreement between canada the united

117
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,880
states and mexico there was

118
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,199
policies put into that trade agreement

119
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,479
that were

120
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,720
consistent with uh sort of pro internet

121
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,199
pro innovative approach that's issued

122
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,880
some of the regular regulations that

123
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,120
we're starting to see now so for the

124
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,759
better part of two decades in canada we

125
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,560
had a largely hands-off pro-innovation

126
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,240
type approach

127
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,400
one in which that those kinds of

128
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,479
policies were imbued within our trade

129
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,000
agreements within the kind of

130
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,840
regulations we saw whether that was on

131
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,400
broadcast or telecom copyright a whole

132
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,240
range of different things

133
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,040
well where are we now and

134
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,919
why the change because there has been a

135
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,080
significant change the kinds of things

136
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,000
that we see being focused on right now

137
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,720
either passed or debated right now in

138
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,560
the house of commons in the senate

139
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,560
include changes to our elections act

140
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,759
changes to taxation related policies and

141
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,800
a series a trio of bills bill c11 which

142
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,840
deals with online streaming c18 which is

143
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,800
described as the online news act and one

144
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,120
further bill that isn't a bill yet but

145
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,039
will be one in the not too distant

146
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,919
future dealing with online harms or now

147
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,680
the government has framed it as online

148
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,720
safety

149
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,960
i think it's worth noting what's not on

150
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,160
that list so for example privacy a key

151
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,639
issue that we want to talk about on this

152
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,280
in these groups of talks is not or has

153
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,320
not been a top government priority there

154
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,160
was a piece of legislation that sought

155
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,160
to reform canadian privacy law

156
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,720
introduced in the last parliament but it

157
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,360
went absolutely nowhere i've pretty much

158
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,440
at this stage talked as about as much

159
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,400
about the bill um here as they talked

160
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
about it in the house of commons it was

161
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,960
brought forward they had scarcely any

162
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,600
debate it never went anywhere despite

163
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,880
the fact that i think there's a lot of

164
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,479
people that would say that privacy ought

165
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,800
to be one of the core priorities

166
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,039
so too with competition law concerns

167
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,120
around the role that some of the largest

168
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,280
internet platforms play

169
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,120
and trying to ensure that our

170
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,919
competition laws ensure a

171
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:22,720
pro-competitive environment where

172
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,120
there's no abuse of of dominance and the

173
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,360
like yet that hasn't been a major

174
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,639
priority

175
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,440
taylor owen from mcgill argues that the

176
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,120
kinds of approach that we see both in

177
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,039
terms of what's on the list but notably

178
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,319
what's not

179
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,080
highlights a government that seems to

180
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,240
often be focused on symptoms rather than

181
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,840
the cause

182
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,400
the problems that we see whether that's

183
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,800
some speech related concerns or are some

184
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,440
of the kind of competitive concerns we

185
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,120
see around content

186
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,440
tend to be symptoms of a broader problem

187
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,759
not the cause of the problem yet the

188
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,520
approach we've seen to date tends to

189
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,840
focus on those symptoms

190
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,759
i like to think of this approach more as

191
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,360
the government viewing the internet as a

192
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,240
basically policy as a policy atm where

193
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,720
there's plenty of money to be taken out

194
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,400
just about all the legislative

195
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,000
initiatives that we see

196
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,400
envision new payments coming from the

197
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,039
big tech companies in order to fund

198
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,639
government policies and in fact they

199
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,240
want the tech companies to fund the

200
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,880
regulatory processes as well now there's

201
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,400
a compelling argument that those

202
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,639
companies need to contribute more

203
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,639
but at a time when we are concerned i

204
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,479
think or many are concerned about our

205
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,639
dependence on those companies

206
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,479
establishing structures in which our

207
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,960
policies are dependent on those very

208
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,919
companies only makes them more powerful

209
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,759
and our dependents

210
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,960
increasingly notable so why has all of

211
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,280
this happened i'd highlight i wanted to

212
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,800
highlight just a couple of things and

213
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,639
then i will get into what has been

214
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,960
taking place so that if these are issues

215
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,319
of interest hopefully you can become

216
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,479
more actively engaged

217
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,720
i think there's several points that sort

218
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,720
of have events that took place over the

219
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,199
years that began to spark a shift

220
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,879
certainly not just in canada but in

221
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,400
other countries but i think most no

222
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,800
certainly notably here one of course if

223
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,000
you think about some of the election

224
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,759
related stuff that i'll talk about in a

225
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,080
few moments had to do of course with the

226
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,479
2016 election in the united states and

227
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,479
concerns about russian government

228
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,240
interference and the use of internet

229
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,479
platforms in doing so and canada

230
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,639
alongside many other countries race to

231
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,800
try to find ways to address some of

232
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,080
those issues

233
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,000
on the culture side with respect to

234
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,240
broadcasting content i think it's fair

235
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,479
to say that melanie jolie's proposed

236
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,479
approach with respect to netflix fell

237
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,760
flat particularly in this province and

238
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,200
the message that the government took

239
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,919
away from that was that an approach that

240
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,000
sought to work with these companies even

241
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,440
as some of those companies invest

242
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,519
hundreds of millions of dollars wasn't

243
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,160
the way to go that a sharper edge was

244
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,480
needed one in which a more hardened

245
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,480
regulatory approach was the one that the

246
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,480
public was looking for

247
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,560
globally events took place whether in

248
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,560
europe or in christchurch or elsewhere

249
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,720
that i think sparked in many are

250
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,440
rethinking around some of the harms that

251
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,080
were taking place online and the view

252
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,320
that there needed to be a more proactive

253
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,480
regulatory approach by the government

254
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,560
here's canada joining the christchurch

255
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,800
call to deal with terrorist and violent

256
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,480
extremist online

257
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,160
now those are some of the external

258
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,160
events i did for just a moment they'll

259
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,880
want to highlight one other event or

260
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,440
individual that was the target of some

261
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,560
just awful misogynist content and

262
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,240
targets online and that's catherine

263
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,120
mckenna a former cabinet minister and i

264
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,600
mentioned this because when you talk to

265
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,760
members of parliament from all parties

266
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,360
not just the current government but

267
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,080
opposition parties as well when they saw

268
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,880
what mckenna experienced it personalized

269
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,480
these issues in a way that i think in

270
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,200
many ways it hadn't previously now i

271
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,640
don't think it should take attacks

272
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,200
against one individual for politicians

273
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,959
to begin to realize that it's important

274
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,519
to have appropriate policies but i don't

275
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,600
think there's any doubt that when many

276
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,920
politicians look at what takes place

277
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,480
online they look at look at it through

278
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,560
that framing and have the view that they

279
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,040
need to be doing something about it

280
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,120
well what is it that they have said

281
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,399
needs to be

282
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,680
done

283
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,839
on the election side they've already

284
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,760
done it and it's actually proven to be

285
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,720
fairly successful the view was the best

286
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,800
way to deal with concerns around

287
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,519
electoral interference online was

288
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,360
greater transparency

289
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,519
if we better understood who was

290
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,680
advertising and how they were doing so

291
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,160
on the large platforms that kind of

292
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,160
opening them up providing some sunlight

293
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,560
into those activities that would have

294
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,560
the effect of either doing away with

295
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,640
some of the more problematic stuff or at

296
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,320
least allow the public to better

297
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,399
understand what was taking place

298
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,959
and so we passed legislation in canada

299
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,600
that required the large platforms the

300
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,279
facebooks and the googles if they

301
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,399
accepted electoral advertising to create

302
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,880
a transparency database in which anyone

303
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,959
can go take a look to see who was

304
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,440
engaged in that advertising

305
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,920
now the response from some was to say

306
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,360
well we're going to just walk away from

307
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,839
this all together so google said our

308
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,160
response if the requirement is to build

309
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,240
this is this infrastructure and create

310
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,240
all these new rules we're just happier

311
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,399
washing our hands of this advertising

312
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,560
all together and we will simply block

313
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,640
electoral advertising during the

314
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,480
particular period

315
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,720
facebook on the other hand actually did

316
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,040
create the database the so-called now

317
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,120
meta ad library and it is a fascinating

318
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,320
experiment in the way transparency can

319
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,720
have a real world impact you can go on

320
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,640
this and see whether or not whether or

321
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,640
not your local member of parliament has

322
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,880
used facebook to advertise how much

323
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,200
they've spent if they have who they've

324
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,720
targeted it and the like it's all

325
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,200
available there and what we learned was

326
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,639
that when you make this kind of

327
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,120
information more transparent it doesn't

328
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,279
necessarily stop politicians from

329
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,519
advertising on platforms in fact it

330
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,680
doesn't stop them from doing it at all

331
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,079
this kind of advertising often works but

332
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,560
what it does do is often stop some of

333
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,040
the third-party a bit more sketchy kind

334
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,440
of advertising that in the past might

335
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,000
have been disguised harder to actually

336
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,839
identify and find

337
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,920
suddenly once it becomes outed it

338
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,959
becomes transparent the impact that it

339
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,440
had is diminished and much of that kind

340
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,720
of advertising largely went away now

341
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,560
it's open to debate the extent to which

342
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,920
a foreign government was looking to

343
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,720
interfere anyway but regardless the

344
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,959
approach that we took one that didn't

345
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,800
come in with high-handed regulations but

346
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,639
said transparency can be effective

347
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,920
actually was a fairly effective approach

348
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,160
but that was an early uh

349
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,000
approach and when as we'll see in a

350
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,079
moment the approach we've seen in other

351
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,320
areas i think is quite different

352
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,639
quickly on taxation as many of you will

353
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,200
know by now in canada

354
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,279
digital taxation is here in a number of

355
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,480
different ways it's certainly here in

356
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,240
this province it's now here it's now

357
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,440
nationally

358
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,440
with respect to digital services so

359
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
there have been two core arguments

360
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,440
around taxation

361
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,839
one has been the question of whether or

362
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,839
not there should be sales taxes so to

363
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,040
speak hst qst gst

364
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,360
on digital digital services whether

365
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,040
that's netflix or some of the apple

366
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,079
services or spotify and the like and

367
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,399
increasingly over time as those services

368
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,880
became more and more prominent in our

369
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,279
lives constituted a more and more

370
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,040
relevant part of the economy the

371
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,360
argument was governments could no longer

372
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,440
overlook the potential revenue benefits

373
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,680
that would come from that much less the

374
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,920
competitive implications of some

375
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,079
services being required to collect and

376
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,800
remit those taxes and other services

377
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,720
being exempt if they were located

378
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,040
outside the jurisdiction and so where we

379
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,440
find ourselves now in canada is in fact

380
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,639
that these sales these taxes apply

381
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,240
more interesting i think is the

382
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,560
so-called digital services tax something

383
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,040
that we don't have yet but it stems from

384
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,800
the view that the large tech companies

385
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,440
in particular don't pay enough tax on

386
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,600
the revenues that they generate within

387
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,440
this country and this isn't an issue

388
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,440
that is playing out only in canada it

389
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,680
plays out in a great many jurisdictions

390
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,160
around the world as countries look at

391
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,320
these companies that are clearly doing

392
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,040
exceptionally well for the most part and

393
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,440
from a taxation perspective have often

394
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,360
been able to structure themselves

395
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,959
whether by way of the intellectual

396
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,639
property that they run where they where

397
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,480
they situate themselves from a corporate

398
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,560
perspective and the like outside of

399
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,240
jurisdictions to engage in tax

400
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,360
minimization now of course every company

401
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,120
everyone seeks to engage in tax

402
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,360
minimization but this has become more

403
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,600
pronounced and so what we've seen

404
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,920
is increasing number of countries

405
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,680
established policies where they want to

406
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,480
charge a sur tax on tech companies

407
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,360
called a digital services tax basically

408
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,279
trying to tax some of the revenues they

409
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,760
generate from our data and from some of

410
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,959
the other benefits that that accrue

411
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,560
within the country

412
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,000
there have been attempts to create a

413
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,920
national agreement an international

414
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,600
agreement on this issue

415
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,199
and the approach that we are seeing

416
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,440
right now is that canada has said if

417
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,600
this international agreement does not

418
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,000
come to fruition is not implemented by

419
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,839
2024 canada will begin to levy this tax

420
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,440
so an attempt to make sure these

421
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,480
companies pay it starts in 2024.

422
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,120
let me in my last few minutes talk

423
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,959
specifically about the legislation that

424
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,639
is those are things that are basically

425
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,560
done let's talk about a few things that

426
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,399
are forthcoming first bill c now c11 it

427
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,040
used to be c10 this is the now called

428
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,079
the online streaming act and it has a

429
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,399
fairly controversial history although it

430
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,399
started life pretty uncontroversially

431
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,600
back in november 2020 as bill c-10

432
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,079
essentially billed as legislation

433
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,160
designed to ensure that large streaming

434
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,639
services like netflix and disney amazon

435
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,839
prime made contributions to the canadian

436
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,320
broadcasting system in much the same way

437
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,399
that conventional broadcasters are

438
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,680
required to

439
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,839
now there is an interesting and i think

440
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,000
important debate that we could have

441
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,839
about the contributions those companies

442
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,399
already do make in fact if you take a

443
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,000
look at the funding for film and

444
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,920
television production in canada right

445
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,480
now you find the largest growing source

446
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,399
indeed now almost the most important

447
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,120
source other than tax credits is in fact

448
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,120
foreign funding it's the netflix's and

449
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,360
amazons that are paying for much of the

450
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,839
production that takes place right now

451
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,360
when there are claims that they don't

452
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,160
fund canadian content that overlooks the

453
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,959
fact that they can't when just a decline

454
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,440
the film that netflix funded to create

455
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,959
here in quebec

456
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,839
with quebec cruz quebec writing it ticks

457
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,839
every single box that you would want to

458
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,639
have about can con but for the fact that

459
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,440
netflix owns it and if netflix owns it

460
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,320
it can't be can con so when disney

461
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,959
creates turning red based in toronto or

462
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,280
amazon creates a mini-series on the

463
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,520
toronto maple leaps all of these things

464
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,919
seem pretty canadian with canadian crews

465
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,240
and the like yet they are not canadian

466
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,919
for these purposes which is why you

467
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,160
often hear these companies don't create

468
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,480
any can con it's because the system

469
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,559
doesn't effectively allow them to even

470
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,480
if they are providing big funding and

471
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,199
doing so but nevertheless it's not all

472
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,199
that controversial to say let's make

473
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,360
sure that they provide these additional

474
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,799
contributions

475
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,960
where this became controversial was when

476
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,640
the government said not only are we

477
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,799
going to apply these rules to the big

478
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,200
streamers we're going to apply them as

479
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,000
well to user generated content

480
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,160
to you to the content that you and i

481
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,919
create or that is being created right

482
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,080
now let's say on the twitch stream that

483
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,960
this that this talk is going out over

484
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,880
the view of the government was all of

485
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,840
that our programs that might also be or

486
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,640
should also be subject to some form of

487
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,039
regulation that sparked the fair amount

488
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,280
of controversy the bill didn't pass it

489
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,799
is now back as bill c-11 and while the

490
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,120
current heritage mr pablo rodriguez has

491
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,280
said that he has fixed the issue just

492
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,559
last night even the crtc chair ian scott

493
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,679
said no yeah no the reality is the bill

494
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,400
does give us the power to regulate user

495
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,240
content frankly anyone that reads the

496
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,240
bill can see that that's plainly the

497
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,200
case

498
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,039
well what does that mean

499
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,120
we get into the issue of regulating user

500
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,360
content in this world part of it means

501
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,360
discoverability requirements where the

502
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,320
crtc could go to youtube or tick talk or

503
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,640
instagram and say we want to ensure that

504
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,280
canadian content gets prioritized in

505
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,640
what people see

506
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,240
which sounds great unless you're a

507
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,640
digital first creator and it's not even

508
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,640
clear that you can be identified as

509
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,880
canadian for the purposes of some of

510
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,480
these services this isn't something that

511
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,840
they typically

512
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,559
even have information on but it gets

513
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,480
worse for digital first creators

514
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,480
especially those that generate most of

515
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,960
their revenue outside of canada

516
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,640
because the algorithmic choices that

517
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,480
take place let's say on a service like

518
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,200
youtube looks not only at what people

519
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,360
click on but also what they choose not

520
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,640
to click on

521
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,480
and if people's youtube feeds are

522
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,480
suddenly filled with content that is

523
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,120
there not because the algorithm

524
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,400
tells them that this is something they

525
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,480
might be interested in but rather

526
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,480
because it broadcasts regulator says

527
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,080
this is the kind of content that has to

528
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,039
be included the likelihood of clicks is

529
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,720
far lower than the kind of content

530
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,240
they're looking for

531
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,160
the problem here is that the message

532
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,720
that sends to youtube and its

533
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,039
algorithmic choices that this is content

534
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,880
people don't like when they're presented

535
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,039
with it they don't click on it

536
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,679
and so what you end up with is more

537
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,080
potential views in canada but the

538
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,320
multi-billion person

539
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,799
audience that is located outside the

540
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,039
country that so many of these creators

541
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,520
depend upon well that those people

542
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,440
suddenly find themselves demoted

543
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,760
elsewhere and so bringing in the

544
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,200
government to say that they're going to

545
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,440
regulate this kind of content raises

546
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,440
enormous kind enormous numbers of

547
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,720
concerns

548
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,480
now we've also seen the government move

549
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,919
forward with

550
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,640
bill c-18 online news which also i think

551
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,559
starts from this view that you know who

552
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,880
could oppose we know that many of the

553
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,440
new services right now are struggling we

554
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,480
should find a way to support them

555
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,080
and the approach that the government has

556
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,559
chosen is to follow a model that started

557
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,120
in australia that basically starts by

558
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,200
saying let's identify the platforms that

559
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,440
we want to make sure make contributions

560
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,000
google meta facebook perhaps twitter

561
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,720
apple uh linkedin microsoft and some

562
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,600
others

563
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,320
and then let's decide which so-called

564
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,320
news organizations qualify and the

565
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,840
government's taking a very broad

566
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,679
approach it's not just traditional

567
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,679
newspapers it's broadcasters it's the

568
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,480
cbc it's radio stations all of these are

569
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,240
potentially subject to it in fact you

570
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,240
don't even have to be canadian in order

571
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,640
to qualify for the system so long as you

572
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,960
have a couple of canadian journalists

573
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,360
let them negotiate a deal if they are

574
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,280
unable to go if they are able to

575
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,720
negotiate a deal let's have our

576
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,960
broadcast regulator review it to decide

577
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,880
if it's good enough if they say it's not

578
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,120
good enough then they say sorry not good

579
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,280
enough and you go to a mandated

580
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,840
arbitration system in which both sides

581
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,760
must put forward offers about what

582
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,440
they're willing to pay and the

583
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,200
arbitrator will have to make a decision

584
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,960
and the government even said even

585
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,799
dictates some of the kinds of things

586
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,039
that can be offered as part of this

587
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,240
process

588
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,760
now from the government's perspective

589
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,080
this was said in the house just a week

590
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,720
or so ago it's simple tech giants need

591
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,400
to compensate canadian journalists when

592
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,120
they use their content that's it no more

593
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,480
no less this is a market-based solution

594
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,919
but when we take a look at what the

595
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,919
legislation says

596
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,919
take a look at what use so-called

597
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,440
actually means now i should start by

598
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,760
noting use isn't even a term in this

599
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,760
legislation doesn't talk about using

600
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,559
news it talks about making news content

601
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,679
available

602
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,280
well what according to the canadian

603
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,880
government is making news content

604
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,200
available well part of it is reproducing

605
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,280
the news so if you took a news story and

606
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,840
you you made it available in full text

607
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,600
let's say in a facebook chat or on

608
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,440
google that's something that would be

609
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,120
required to be paid for and i think many

610
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,039
would say well we can understand that

611
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,640
but take a look at the second part of

612
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,159
this definition

613
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,120
access to the news including any portion

614
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,240
of it that is facilitated by any means

615
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,400
including an index aggregation or

616
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,320
ranking of news content

617
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,760
think about some of what some of that

618
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,679
stuff might mean even the first one news

619
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,080
content or any portion of it put forward

620
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,960
a headline on google that or on on

621
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,360
facebook that's making a portion of it

622
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,280
available create an index of

623
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,520
montreal-based newspapers which google

624
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,760
natural google does just to their front

625
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,159
pages not to actual news stories

626
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,559
that's making that that's facilitating

627
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,320
access to news

628
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,320
this idea the government's view is that

629
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,720
all of these things are somehow of value

630
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
not to the news site that's actually

631
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,280
getting this traffic delivered to them

632
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,760
but instead somehow google is benefiting

633
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,400
from sending that traffic on to these

634
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,640
sites not copying the news in some

635
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,640
instance just sending it along

636
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,440
now at the moment this only applies to

637
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,039
or would only apply to the large

638
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,360
internet platforms but think about what

639
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,120
the government is actually saying here

640
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,400
the idea that base search indexes

641
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,080
might be compensable in terms of

642
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,080
requirements to pay

643
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,159
linking might be required might be

644
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,400
compensable in terms of a requirement to

645
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,360
pay

646
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,039
and then ask yourself what makes the

647
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,960
news so special

648
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,840
if it's news requires payments for links

649
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,760
if it's news that gets to require

650
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,159
payments for inclusion in a search index

651
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,159
what is to stop anyone else from saying

652
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,120
hey google you put my website in your

653
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,679
index i'd like to get paid too hey

654
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,760
facebook someone created a link to my

655
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,799
blog shouldn't i be paid as well

656
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,960
and suddenly that kind of free flow of

657
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,440
information that we all depend upon is

658
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,559
lost

659
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,880
now this slide you cannot make out but

660
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,679
this is just a slide that highlights the

661
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,039
number of of issues and policies as part

662
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,039
of this bill that are dictated by either

663
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,440
the government or the crtc

664
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,440
i put this up to tell you this is what

665
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,640
the government thinks is limited market

666
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,919
interference

667
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,679
it's deciding everything from who

668
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,440
participates to what these agreements

669
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,720
can look like

670
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,559
ultimately to approving the agreements

671
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,080
themselves

672
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,240
now finally in my last two minutes the

673
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,120
last issue so-called online harms now

674
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,360
often called online safety

675
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,000
issues around hate and terror and the

676
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,440
like online

677
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,520
now on that process the government

678
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,520
conducted a series of private

679
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,520
consultations and had planned to

680
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,480
introduce legislation but held off given

681
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,960
the controversy over c10 and i think the

682
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,640
prevailing view that the then heritage

683
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,200
minister stephen gebo was maybe not the

684
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,880
best communicator

685
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,640
when it came to that bill much less a

686
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,559
bill dealing even more controversially

687
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:05,279
with

688
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,279
online harms issues so what they did

689
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,520
instead was hold a consultation last

690
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,400
summer

691
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,880
and made the decision not to make the

692
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,840
submissions available to the public

693
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,600
instead they issued a what we heard

694
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,440
report in which they said that they

695
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,279
summarized what they heard they

696
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,880
acknowledged that there were criticism

697
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,880
and they said we'll create a new panel

698
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,039
to take a look at some of these issues

699
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,400
now i should note that i launched an

700
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,080
accessed information request that said

701
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,679
hey i think if you launch a public

702
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,120
consultation you ought to be making you

703
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,480
ought to make the submissions that you

704
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,480
receive publicly available

705
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,559
now i got those submissions about a

706
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,720
month ago and it turned out that the

707
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,320
government's report didn't tell the

708
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,559
whole story you had companies like

709
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,360
twitter compare some of the policies to

710
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,520
internet policies in china and north

711
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,400
korea you had groups ranging from

712
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,159
muslims groups and jewish groups and

713
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,080
other vulnerable groups all saying that

714
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,200
the kinds of risks that this put forward

715
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,600
were significant in and of themselves in

716
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,080
other words the legislative proposals

717
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,120
that were

718
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,520
designed to help support and protect

719
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,679
groups actually were creating potential

720
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:10,720
harms

721
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,960
and the reason for that is that the

722
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,400
government envisioned things like

723
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,880
proactive monitoring requiring platforms

724
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,120
to proactively monitor chat and

725
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,360
activities on these sites and if they

726
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,159
identified content that they thought

727
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,960
violated some of the laws to proactively

728
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,520
disclose that to law enforcement

729
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,200
think about the possibility that you

730
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,080
post something without context in a chat

731
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,240
and an ai sees this and for whatever

732
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,159
reason thinks this represents a threat

733
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,799
and notifies the police as part of it

734
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,159
the government thought that was a good

735
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,000
idea the government thought that

736
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,320
requiring platforms to remove content

737
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,279
within 24 hours without any due process

738
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,159
or review was a good idea the government

739
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,320
thought that website blocking for those

740
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,159
platforms that wouldn't block that kind

741
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,240
of content was a good idea let's

742
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,400
conscript all the various telecom

743
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,559
providers to build in blocking

744
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,960
technologies and then require them to

745
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,640
block these sites

746
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,039
that's why you saw so many speak out

747
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,240
against it

748
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,880
so let me just conclude by saying there

749
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,880
is a lot happening there has been a

750
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,279
major reversal in the way that the

751
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,279
government has approached these issues

752
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,960
and i would say candidly and quite

753
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,520
discouragingly that despite some of the

754
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,919
voices that we've seen to date they for

755
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,000
the most part have been largely ignored

756
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,840
the government is marching ahead

757
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,840
sometimes in my view engaging in just

758
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,320
plain gas lighting in which they say

759
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
that the legislation says one thing when

760
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,640
anyone who takes the time to read

761
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,399
what the legislation actually says

762
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,559
realizes it's the opposite

763
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,279
that said the time is now for these

764
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,720
policies there are going to be hearings

765
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,520
for example on c11 in the next few weeks

766
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,440
there is an opportunity for concerned

767
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,520
canadians to make their voices heard

768
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,520
regardless of what your view happens to

769
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,559
be we deserve policies that reflect the

770
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,760
broad view of canadians and and is

771
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,760
properly informed by those who are

772
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,799
expert

773
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,399
not just on some of the speech

774
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,240
implications but on the technical side

775
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,720
too there's an opportunity here and i

776
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,799
hope many in this audience will grab it

777
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,600
thanks very much for your attention

778
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,629
[Applause]

779
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,720
thank you

780
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,320
okay hi

781
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,880
thank you for the great introduction and

782
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,000
i've been working on offenders behavior

783
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,760
and decision making for like more than

784
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,360
seven years now and i will continue in

785
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,000
the future but today i wanted to talk

786
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,360
about the

787
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,480
protection of users um

788
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,640
so because because we will talk about

789
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,200
passwords

790
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,799
um

791
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,919
so password best practices imply that

792
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:58,799
you

793
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,240
uh that

794
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:00,960
yeah

795
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,559
that the password is impossible to

796
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,799
remember and that it is never written

797
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,080
down so the idea of protection

798
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,760
behind passwords is an excellent idea

799
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,760
but

800
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,360
like every technologies has come with

801
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,960
consequences and this solution seems to

802
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,720
have been made more for computers than

803
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,320
for humans because it's impossible for a

804
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,440
human to just remember a list of 100

805
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,000
passwords with strings of random

806
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,360
characters so

807
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,679
i know that today we have solutions like

808
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:32,480
uh

809
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,440
like

810
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,520
password managers but

811
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,080
most people don't use that yet and this

812
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,159
we still need passwords to uh to use

813
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:40,920
this so

814
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:44,159
[Music]

815
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,600
um

816
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,919
studies show that there is a difference

817
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,919
in cyber security

818
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,080
knowledge or literacy

819
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,200
um

820
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,360
across the country so there there is a

821
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,600
difference between the level of of

822
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,360
knowledge across the country and this is

823
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,880
what i wanted to

824
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,559
explore in this research project

825
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,039
each year the companion north pass

826
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:11,120
release a list of the 200 most common

827
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,480
password by countries

828
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,039
the list of passwords is a compilation

829
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,159
of

830
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,640
of cybersecurity incidents that happen

831
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,720
in a year and

832
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,520
it comes from of course data breaches so

833
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,640
containing users passwords

834
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,080
and um the list is compile is is created

835
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,159
from four terabytes of information so a

836
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,919
lot of data breaches and it includes

837
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,360
well this year i don't know if it's the

838
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,760
case for each year but this year 49

839
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,240
countries

840
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,080
so here is some more information about

841
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,440
the the list the data that i use for for

842
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,559
this research so um the 200 most common

843
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,640
password for each country comprises

844
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,640
between

845
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,519
169

846
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:04,880
and 146 million user per country this

847
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,720
means that

848
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,240
in some countries there is 160 46

849
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,880
million people who use the 200 same

850
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,120
passwords but it also means that in

851
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,799
other countries there is a lot less

852
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,200
people using the same 200 passwords and

853
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,720
that is very good

854
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,120
for them

855
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,320
here the list contains the most common

856
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,960
passwords not necessarily the worst

857
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,919
password so the to determine how good is

858
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,919
a password you can observe the cracking

859
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:36,880
time

860
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,720
so when an attacker rob a list of

861
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,440
username and passwords the information

862
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,679
is usually encrypted

863
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:44,559
um

864
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,039
and time to crack will be the time it

865
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,919
takes to uh to decrypt the information

866
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,760
okay so the average time to crack

867
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,279
password is uh for if in this sample is

868
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,120
more than two million seconds so it

869
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,640
ranges from zero to uh to three billion

870
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,240
seconds

871
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,600
and here the mean time to crack is not a

872
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,360
very good measure to understand the

873
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,320
sample because uh it's very high and

874
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,039
it's like everyone is very good at

875
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,840
creating passwords but it's not the case

876
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,760
the vast majority of password included

877
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,360
in the list can be cracked in less than

878
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,640
a minute

879
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,799
so the fact that the mean time to crack

880
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:23,919
password

881
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,399
is high

882
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,960
is is uh it's because there there is

883
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,600
some pretty good passwords

884
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,200
in those 200 most common passwords

885
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,559
um

886
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,559
so a much more representative measure

887
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,919
would be the median more than the mean

888
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,919
so uh which is uh if you

889
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:44,960
um

890
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,840
order

891
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,760
a number asset like ascending numbers

892
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,760
uh to with the cracking time you

893
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,679
um

894
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,519
yeah so right in the middle in the

895
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,200
middle is like right in the middle you

896
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,600
have the two seconds that means that

897
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,120
most people

898
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,600
use like passwords that can be cracking

899
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,639
in less than two seconds

900
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,000
um this leads to wonder which countries

901
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,960
are the best and the worst in term of

902
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,360
password performance

903
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,279
i based this calculation on the mean

904
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,360
time to crack the maximum time to crack

905
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,440
present in the list the number of users

906
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,440
sharing the same password and the

907
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,120
percentage of password that can be

908
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,559
cracked in less than a minute

909
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,799
so here is the list of the best country

910
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,799
um to be in this list the country has to

911
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,000
be the best

912
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,480
in two to three criteria that i just

913
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,600
mentioned

914
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,559
um

915
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,720
the country with the little stars uh

916
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,240
indicate that

917
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,000
yes they were the best in two to three

918
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,320
criteria but they were also come up they

919
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,120
also come up at as the worst in the top

920
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,120
10 words for one criteria okay so they

921
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,960
are not so good

922
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,600
canada for example uh we are among the

923
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,519
best for the maximum time to crack and

924
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,000
for the mean time to crack nevertheless

925
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,679
we are among the worst concerning the

926
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,360
number of passwords that can be cracked

927
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,880
in less than a minute

928
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,879
so this means that most people choose

929
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,960
weak passwords

930
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,800
but a larger number of people when

931
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,560
compared with other countries have

932
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,040
better passwords a bit because they use

933
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,359
stronger password

934
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,280
here is the list of the worst country in

935
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,320
term of

936
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,079
password performance of course um

937
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,159
so same thing here to be in this list

938
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,159
you have to be the worst in two to four

939
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,399
criteria that i presented

940
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,119
um and if there's a little star it's a

941
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,520
little bit more positive here uh so

942
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,918
it indicate that you that this country

943
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:46,960
also came out in the top 10 best for one

944
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,760
criteria okay so let's take the united

945
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,280
states as an example um so they are the

946
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,239
worst in all categories except for the

947
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,400
mean time to crack it means that some

948
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,560
people have very very strong passwords

949
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,560
and it increases the mean for the

950
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,640
country

951
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,480
so in the united states some people have

952
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,880
better password hygiene we can conclude

953
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,320
that

954
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,119
so why do countries do not have the same

955
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,560
performance level in term of

956
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,720
of password

957
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,160
choice

958
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,399
um

959
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,280
so this leads to the hypothesis that a

960
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,079
characteristic of the countries

961
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,400
contribute to the overall performance

962
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,000
of

963
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,160
of password trend

964
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,240
so in other word which macro social

965
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,880
variable predict the overall performance

966
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,800
of a population in term of password

967
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,720
strain that was my research question

968
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,920
so here is how i proceeded um to answer

969
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,000
this question so in order to account for

970
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,920
the strength of password i took into

971
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,680
consideration the mean time to crack

972
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,280
remember i said the mean time to crack

973
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,280
was not a good criteria to uh to

974
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,440
understand the the sample earlier i said

975
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,920
that but now because we want to measure

976
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,839
uh the code we want to compare the

977
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,400
countries overall now it's a very

978
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,400
interesting measure to see

979
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,280
to look at um and then

980
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,760
uh several macro social variables i've

981
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,079
been considered uh to create a model

982
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,240
explaining or predicting password

983
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,160
strength this was the the goal of all

984
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,040
this

985
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,240
so a total of 29 different measures have

986
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,560
been considered in the exploration of

987
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,599
possible models of course the the model

988
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,960
do not contain uh those 29 variables but

989
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,200
here they are

990
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,079
um so i i try all that i look at all

991
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,119
that

992
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,680
is the the list i've been testing so the

993
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,160
list are the most recent data available

994
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,720
coming from official sources like world

995
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,160
bank for example

996
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,560
and so this was too many variables to

997
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,960
possibly enter in a model of course so

998
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,720
many tests have been done to for

999
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,960
selecting those that would form the

1000
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,240
model the final prediction model

1001
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,280
so uh

1002
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,000
one example of a test that i've done

1003
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,200
before

1004
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,800
try starting to create the model is a

1005
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,040
matrix of correlation so variable that

1006
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,079
correlates two i together would create a

1007
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,520
problem of musical collinearity uh for

1008
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,599
our prediction model so it

1009
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,440
we need to avoid that so for example

1010
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,760
um here the number of internet user was

1011
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,599
highly correlated with the level of

1012
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,760
digital adoption in a country that makes

1013
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,960
sense right

1014
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,640
so it would have been an error to put

1015
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,640
those two variable in the model so we

1016
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,520
had to

1017
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,079
take one off

1018
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,920
same thing here political stability is

1019
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,079
correlated strongly with regulatory

1020
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,200
quality

1021
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,320
but also with control and corruption and

1022
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,560
with governance effectiveness and with a

1023
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,400
bunch of other variables so it is an

1024
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,440
example of a variable that

1025
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,599
is not interesting to put in the model

1026
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,280
okay so you're following me and this

1027
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,119
helped me to select and try the

1028
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,000
different variable from the list

1029
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,160
then i use a multiple linear regression

1030
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,160
to build a model of prediction of

1031
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,720
password strength so i try a dozen

1032
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,760
different models um to finally identify

1033
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,359
the variable that were in fact

1034
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,720
predicting password strength

1035
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,320
so after many tests i kept six variables

1036
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,359
um

1037
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,760
from the list i previously previously

1038
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,960
showed you

1039
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,359
so uh here i present them to you okay so

1040
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,160
first voice and accountability

1041
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,079
this is one of the six components of

1042
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,359
governance indicator as uh stipulated by

1043
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:36,960
the world bank so it reflects the

1044
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,720
perception of the extent to which a

1045
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,960
country citizens are able to participate

1046
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,280
in selecting their government as well as

1047
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,440
freedom of expression freedom as of

1048
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,400
association

1049
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,119
and freedom of press that means in other

1050
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,800
words that it it gives an idea of the

1051
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,599
overall liberty of the population

1052
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,240
so let's see if this have

1053
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,480
a link with the password strength

1054
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,640
then there's the global security index

1055
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,000
which is a trusted reference that

1056
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,720
measure the commitment of countries in

1057
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,760
uh in the investment in cyber security

1058
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,960
okay um so do countries invest in cyber

1059
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,119
security and is this having an impact on

1060
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,119
password strength

1061
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,280
and then digital skills was my third

1062
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,800
variable it represent the extent to

1063
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,040
which the active population possess

1064
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,359
sufficient digital skills and this

1065
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:28,960
includes computer skills basic coding uh

1066
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,280
digital readings or a bunch of

1067
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,200
things

1068
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,480
cyber security exposure index um it's

1069
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,960
it's based on data collected publicly uh

1070
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,359
available on publicly available source

1071
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,920
like on the dark web on the deep web on

1072
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,440
data breaches

1073
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,079
so based on that we want to to calculate

1074
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:50,560
the exposure of a country so how many

1075
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,320
attack did they suffer

1076
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,320
in a year

1077
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,880
then the literacy the level of literacy

1078
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,119
among a population measures the the

1079
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,079
percentage of adults in the population

1080
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,880
um who are able to read in and and write

1081
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,640
in their own language

1082
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,920
so a higher literacy rate is an

1083
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,240
indication of higher

1084
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,480
standard of education so this was an

1085
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,200
interesting variable to put in the model

1086
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,160
finally we tested the gdp per capita so

1087
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,400
the gross domestic product um a

1088
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,240
population uh

1089
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,720
it is a standard measures of uh the

1090
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,319
value

1091
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,480
added created through the production of

1092
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,240
goods and services in the country during

1093
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,720
a certain period of time as such

1094
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,560
it also measured the income earned from

1095
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,480
that production or the total amount

1096
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,880
spent on final goods and services

1097
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,599
so it is a variable that is strongly

1098
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,400
associated with all kind of aspect of

1099
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,560
technologies uh

1100
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,800
in in countries so that's what we see in

1101
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,119
the literature so it made a lot of sense

1102
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,119
to include that in the model

1103
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,960
to see if it also correlates with

1104
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,720
password strength

1105
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,200
so here is the result i didn't put the

1106
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,319
boring

1107
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:07,440
table that goes with it so um

1108
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,040
so there the four

1109
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,000
the first four uh variable were

1110
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,319
predicting password behavior so when it

1111
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,960
increases password strength also

1112
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,480
increased um and the two last did not

1113
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,520
predict password strength okay and so

1114
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,720
let's explore each of each of those

1115
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,720
so the popularity

1116
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,520
are the spread of internet in a country

1117
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,440
i've been associated by researcher with

1118
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,119
a gravel a greater level of

1119
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,119
voice and accountability which means the

1120
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,400
liberty of the population

1121
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,760
a strong positive association has been

1122
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,040
shown between security capacity

1123
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,640
and voice and accountability in the

1124
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,680
literature

1125
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,760
so this goes along with the result of

1126
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,800
our study because it was correlated with

1127
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,599
uh with a it was a good predictor of

1128
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,160
password strength

1129
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,400
researchers have shown that a higher

1130
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,119
cyber security is related to a lower

1131
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,680
similarity between passwords inside the

1132
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,480
population um and therefore

1133
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,520
better habits of selecting passwords so

1134
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,079
this confirm to confirm

1135
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,640
uh this this section of the literature

1136
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,880
we use the global cyber security index

1137
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,640
which measured the commitment and the

1138
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,560
investments of the countries

1139
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,720
and we found that country's investment

1140
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,200
in cyber security predicts stronger

1141
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,640
passwords

1142
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,880
so yes investments in cyber security

1143
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,200
pays

1144
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,599
the results show that the number of

1145
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,839
cyber security incidents in the country

1146
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,400
is positively associated with password

1147
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,359
strength

1148
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:48,240
so the more a country is under attack

1149
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,520
and the more

1150
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,079
the more people use strong password so

1151
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,920
that's very interesting because this

1152
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,000
suggests that people are sensible to the

1153
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,920
importance of protecting data with

1154
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,839
strong password when they are exposed to

1155
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,560
more cyber security incident

1156
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,480
the literature have documented that

1157
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,440
users are well aware of the meaning of a

1158
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,040
data breach

1159
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,240
they are we have seen in the past that

1160
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,480
when a company will uh

1161
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,920
flag or or

1162
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,319
indicate or notify a data breach uh

1163
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:21,359
people like the the market will uh

1164
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:22,160
will

1165
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,640
go negatively for for them

1166
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,880
will go down for them

1167
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,319
and um

1168
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,119
we also see that after a data breach

1169
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:32,960
most people

1170
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,920
in a in a study they were saying um as

1171
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,960
much as

1172
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,000
75 of people would change their password

1173
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,440
or switch the account so people know

1174
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,000
that data breach is bad and they know

1175
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,240
that they have to modify their behavior

1176
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,119
and this seems to be doing it and this

1177
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,960
this goes along with all this literature

1178
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,839
too

1179
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,400
literacy is an important aspect to

1180
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,800
consider from my perspective in the

1181
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,119
study as it is directly connected to the

1182
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,520
use of technologies okay to seek

1183
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,760
evaluate use information found on the

1184
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,319
internet readers must navigate through

1185
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,880
their reading process

1186
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,200
if not it's too complicated and

1187
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,079
so

1188
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,960
because being knowledgeable is closely

1189
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,119
related to the capacity to acquire

1190
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,440
knowledge and that means knowing how to

1191
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,319
read

1192
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:28,240
um

1193
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,040
it was a

1194
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:35,119
like people with low level of literacy

1195
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,319
would have a lot of uh problem to adapt

1196
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:40,160
to and and to learn

1197
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,760
so um it is not surprising the result is

1198
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,319
therefore um when the level of literacy

1199
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,400
of the population increases the strength

1200
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,560
of password increases too okay it makes

1201
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,760
a lot of sense

1202
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,040
and then

1203
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,800
these two variables in the model were

1204
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,800
not predicting password strength but i

1205
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,800
choose to show them to you because it

1206
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,560
was really interesting too because we

1207
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,440
were

1208
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,160
uh we thought that it would it would

1209
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,480
correlate

1210
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,560
so digital skills have been defined as

1211
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,560
the ability to use various digital

1212
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,720
technology or application

1213
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,040
digital skills have been shown to impact

1214
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,920
the variety of online behavior however

1215
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,760
our study points toward the fact that

1216
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,800
the digital skills is not

1217
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,839
a synonym of efficient use of protection

1218
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:27,359
okay so it

1219
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,359
you'll be thought that it would go along

1220
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:32,720
but it's not a it's not a good indicator

1221
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,200
i also tested the gdp and you might

1222
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,560
wonder why but the adoption of

1223
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,000
technology in the country have been

1224
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,880
proven to be impacted by many factors

1225
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,640
including the economic growth of the

1226
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,160
population so

1227
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,680
um

1228
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,599
underdeveloped and developing countries

1229
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,160
have inferior infrastructure uh less

1230
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,160
effective manpower and the their

1231
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,040
business model did not uh

1232
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,079
did not yet shift between the industrial

1233
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:01,040
age to the information age so

1234
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:01,310
um

1235
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:02,640
[Music]

1236
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,359
this result might be a sorry

1237
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:06,640
the result of

1238
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,839
uh

1239
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:09,200
of the study

1240
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,440
indicate that wealth disparity does not

1241
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,359
influence

1242
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:15,520
strong password okay

1243
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,119
and this result might be explained by

1244
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,599
the sector in which a developed country

1245
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,200
invests

1246
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,440
also passed they have shown that

1247
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,839
countries need to acquire experience

1248
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:29,359
with it before their investments start

1249
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:32,800
to pay okay so

1250
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,280
if i want to summarize all this there is

1251
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,440
this results say that benefiting from

1252
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,960
from resources

1253
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,720
is not enough alone to explain uh or to

1254
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,720
be effective in for the use of

1255
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,839
technology and protection

1256
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,720
so in this presentation

1257
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,200
it's my last slide in this presentation

1258
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,640
we looked at the factor that most

1259
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,359
influence passwords train

1260
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:02,880
which offer new knowledge about

1261
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,040
passwords a bit in various develop and

1262
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,119
developing country setting

1263
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:09,280
the big conclusion is that yes the

1264
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,920
environment of user is affecting their

1265
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,520
behavior and their choice of passwords

1266
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,440
um we the result points are the

1267
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,000
importance of a country's investment in

1268
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,119
cyber security it also

1269
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:26,319
show that democracies help users to do

1270
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:29,359
better choice for password protection

1271
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:32,160
this is probably due to uh to the access

1272
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,960
of information

1273
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,680
also there's a

1274
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,839
a new hot subject in cyber security and

1275
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:44,079
you might have heard of we talk a lot

1276
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:47,680
about resistance resilience sorry

1277
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,480
about resilience of users uh it's a new

1278
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,960
hot topic and this is one of the

1279
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,280
conclusion of this study too users are

1280
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,640
resilient we know that because the

1281
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,680
population that are victim of higher at

1282
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,839
uh level of

1283
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,280
data breaches

1284
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,800
will do better

1285
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,800
at choosing passwords

1286
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,559
and finally the general education

1287
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,720
presented through the level of literacy

1288
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,319
is a better indicator of password

1289
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:14,240
strength than than specific digital

1290
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,920
skills

1291
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,839
so user habit in

1292
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:20,400
relation to cyber security is frequently

1293
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,040
examined from a micro perspective

1294
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,119
using for example survey results to

1295
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,599
obtain impactful factors

1296
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:28,880
that

1297
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,240
that influence individual

1298
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:36,160
decision making but our research differs

1299
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,319
by focusing on country specific factors

1300
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:41,160
and those factors help determine users

1301
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,760
vulnerabilities at a macro level and

1302
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,079
might be useful for policy around cyber

1303
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,200
security

1304
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,820
so that's it thank you

1305
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:56,129
[Applause]

1306
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,000
thank you so much jan uh we're gonna

1307
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,640
come back in five minutes so

hey everyone

1330
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,079
we're gonna come back this is our third

1331
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:08,160
talk and our final talk before the

1332
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,520
discussion

1333
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,599
uh i'd like to take this opportunity

1334
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:13,839
again to encourage everyone to put their

1335
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:15,920
their questions and their reflections

1336
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,480
and feelings on slido it really helps me

1337
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,960
as a moderator to know what people

1338
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,400
care about and want to talk about in the

1339
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,280
context of this conference so share your

1340
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,119
questions um i am thrilled to introduce

1341
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:32,240
philip lamontagne who is a research

1342
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,000
officer at the national research council

1343
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,400
of canada he got his phd from university

1344
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,480
of montreal in 2018 so i suppose that's

1345
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,960
dr lammeltang

1346
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,640
and his areas of expertise are

1347
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,040
cryptography and quantum information uh

1348
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,480
this is going to be a really interesting

1349
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,680
talk um everybody loves the blockchain

1350
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,920
around these parts i'm sure so

1351
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,680
we're going there

1352
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:54,400
and

1353
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,760
i'm really excited to learn from this

1354
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,760
one so big round of applause thank you

1355
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,300
so much

1356
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:04,209
[Applause]

1357
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,720
so can everyone hear me good i hear

1358
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,640
myself um

1359
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,559
so yeah um

1360
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:11,839
so

1361
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,839
i'm gonna talk today about privacy laws

1362
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:15,920
and and privacy uh

1363
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,200
specific privacy concept in

1364
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,440
in the right to be forgotten and i'm

1365
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,079
going to talk specifically about

1366
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:26,960
a new field of research that takes

1367
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,920
these these laws that the lawmakers

1368
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:33,359
decide and try to use tools from

1369
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:35,760
cryptography to uh

1370
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,000
to analyze to to to formalize the

1371
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,200
requirement of these laws so i'm gonna

1372
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,599
look today at the right to be forgotten

1373
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:45,200
so there's

1374
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,640
uh

1375
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:49,119
i'm gonna define at the moment what what

1376
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,720
what i mean by the right to be forgotten

1377
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,400
because there could be there there's

1378
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,480
there's other accepted definition of it

1379
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,559
or it but it's used in a more broad

1380
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:59,200
setting than what i use it for this talk

1381
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,520
so let's say we have a user who

1382
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,599
interacts with the server

1383
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:04,400
and

1384
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,079
might use google as a running example

1385
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:08,960
throughout the stock and the user

1386
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,200
maybe upload some photos to google photo

1387
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,680
maybe upload some file to drive and

1388
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:14,640
we'll

1389
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:17,280
share these uh these files to other

1390
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,480
users

1391
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,359
and and google might use this content to

1392
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:22,720
to

1393
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,040
you know image recognition or other

1394
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,599
other machine learning tasks that to

1395
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:29,680
build products upon

1396
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,000
now in the future this user might become

1397
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,119
privacy conscious and ask google to just

1398
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:36,960
delete all of its data

1399
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,040
so that so that there's not a bunch of

1400
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:42,400
photos of that person on the web and

1401
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,920
this is specifically what i mean by the

1402
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,079
right to be forgotten in this talk there

1403
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:47,440
is a broader

1404
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,040
definition where

1405
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,920
uh there might be some news article or

1406
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,599
some different recontent about you

1407
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:56,400
online that you wish to be taken down

1408
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,000
this is outside the scope of this of

1409
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,920
this stock and

1410
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,079
i'm only interested in the setting where

1411
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:04,240
you you can prove ownership of the data

1412
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:07,440
that you want to delete

1413
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:08,559
um

1414
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:10,640
so the the right to be forgotten was

1415
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:13,520
codified in in a handful of legislatures

1416
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,960
so the most famous example is a gdpr for

1417
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,520
the european government

1418
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,119
there is also

1419
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:24,160
a law in california that that has been

1420
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,799
dubbed the right to be forgotten for for

1421
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:28,720
minors it's a privacy law protecting

1422
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,319
minors

1423
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:31,359
and

1424
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:33,920
the other example that i can find is uh

1425
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,319
not really a law it's more of a case law

1426
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:38,880
in argentina where the courts

1427
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,920
gave rulings that go along with this

1428
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:45,359
notion of right to be forgotten

1429
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,240
this is an excerpt from gdpr

1430
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,240
just to know what we're talking about so

1431
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,200
i highlighted some some passages so the

1432
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,039
right to be to be a richer as they

1433
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:56,559
called it is that we should have the

1434
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:57,520
right

1435
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:00,079
to have uh our personal data erased and

1436
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:01,920
no login process

1437
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,559
right and this right uh

1438
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:06,240
is transitive in some sense it follows

1439
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,720
the data and not just the user so the

1440
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,720
this right is extended in such a way

1441
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,240
that a controller who has made the

1442
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,319
personal data public should be obliged

1443
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:16,400
to inform the other controllers

1444
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,880
uh that the data is requested for

1445
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,000
deletion and then these other

1446
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,920
controllers should should process

1447
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,400
deletion as well

1448
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,039
and and this this will come this will

1449
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:30,799
come up in the later slides as well

1450
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:31,680
so

1451
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,480
there's a

1452
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,480
um there's an intuitive notion of what

1453
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:37,599
it means to

1454
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:39,599
to to delete data if you if you have a

1455
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:42,079
database you just delete the entry in

1456
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:45,839
the database but what is more um

1457
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:47,680
what is less intuitive is what about the

1458
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,160
data that is processed so if i if i take

1459
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,000
the data and i

1460
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,680
do statistics on it or a machine

1461
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:56,319
learning algorithm

1462
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:58,720
on it what what does it mean in that

1463
01:02:58,720 --> 01:02:59,760
case

1464
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:03,839
to delete the data and also there's the

1465
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:06,640
question of with with the right to erase

1466
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,400
the data following the data along the

1467
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,559
data processing how do you

1468
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:12,799
how do you keep track of this data along

1469
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:13,839
this uh

1470
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:16,000
this line of processing

1471
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,359
so

1472
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:19,599
these laws as you have seen they were

1473
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:21,920
written in in human language

1474
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,000
which tend to be interpretable and also

1475
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,119
um

1476
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:28,400
less formal so so the goal here is to

1477
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,440
take these uh these laws and formalize

1478
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,200
it in the language of cryptography in a

1479
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:36,319
formal mathematical definition that the

1480
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:38,000
goal is that if you satisfy this

1481
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,920
definition then you know for sure that

1482
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,160
you satisfy the requirements of the law

1483
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,920
but you might be

1484
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,520
you might do more than what the law

1485
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,359
requires

1486
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:49,920
and this has been done in

1487
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,079
um

1488
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:54,440
this is the first example of such

1489
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:56,319
multi-disciplinary work

1490
01:03:56,319 --> 01:03:59,839
which has been pioneered by

1491
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:03,200
kobe nissim in these two papers

1492
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,480
and

1493
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,400
what they have done is that they have

1494
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,839
looked at

1495
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:10,559
privacy laws and uh

1496
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:12,480
shown that

1497
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,960
mathematical privacy notions such as

1498
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,799
differential privacy

1499
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:18,960
meets meets the minimal requirements of

1500
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,319
those laws

1501
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:21,680
and i encourage you to look at the

1502
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:22,799
following

1503
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:26,000
youtube talk by kobi nissim which was at

1504
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,400
stock 2021

1505
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,319
which is a great introduction to this to

1506
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:33,680
this uh this new field

1507
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,119
now

1508
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:37,200
um let's go into the the meat of the

1509
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,200
subject so

1510
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,839
how do we formalize the right to be

1511
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:44,960
forgotten so so we need to have a formal

1512
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:48,000
requirement that says if i ask you to

1513
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,599
delete this data

1514
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:52,960
then you will take some some actions

1515
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:55,359
that will guarantee me that that you

1516
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:56,960
that you

1517
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,839
meet the minimum requirements of gdpr

1518
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:02,160
for example

1519
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,359
and

1520
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:05,599
in order to formalize we'll first have

1521
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:08,079
to model the interaction and define our

1522
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:09,359
participants

1523
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:12,480
so we will define three special entities

1524
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,960
we have a data collector uh which i

1525
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,480
think is is called the controller in

1526
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,599
gdpr which is the the server is it's a

1527
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:20,880
google

1528
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:23,359
which collects data for services and and

1529
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:26,240
does some processing on the data

1530
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,000
we have the deletion requester which is

1531
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,559
our privacy conscious user

1532
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,880
that will ask

1533
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,280
his or her data to be deleted

1534
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,640
and then we

1535
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,240
have a special entity called the

1536
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,720
environment the environment

1537
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,200
captures the rest of the world right so

1538
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,599
so so if i'm the user and i interact

1539
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:47,680
with google the all of this room and all

1540
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,760
of the rest of the world goes into the

1541
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,640
environment and the environment also

1542
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,799
is our adversary in this case so in

1543
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:57,839
cryptography we always have a bad guy

1544
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:00,000
that we call the adversary and this and

1545
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,839
the environment will capture this

1546
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:03,920
adversary and we want to limit what the

1547
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,480
advice what the environment can learn

1548
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,240
about uh

1549
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:11,839
the user's data after deletion

1550
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,200
we

1551
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,559
assume that interactions have a

1552
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:16,799
beginning and end just so things are

1553
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:17,920
very

1554
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,039
precise

1555
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:20,079
and

1556
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:22,160
each entity will have

1557
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:25,280
two two variables that define it so each

1558
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,920
entity has a view which is the

1559
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,319
all of the message sent and from that

1560
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,960
entity during during the the execution

1561
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,280
during the interaction and a state a

1562
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:37,359
state is the content of all the all

1563
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:40,400
drives all of the floppy disks etc that

1564
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,880
all of the information that is known uh

1565
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:46,240
from by an entity

1566
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,599
and

1567
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:49,359
the the game is as follows right you

1568
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:51,200
have the data collector that interacts

1569
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:52,559
with the user interacts with the

1570
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:55,760
environment so so every user uh be it

1571
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,839
the deletion requester of or the other

1572
01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:00,000
users interact in some way with the with

1573
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:00,640
the

1574
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,559
collector

1575
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:04,240
and

1576
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,240
each of the each of the protocols that

1577
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,160
that go on in this way have an

1578
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:10,240
associated deletion protocol so i can i

1579
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,559
can upload something and i can ask it to

1580
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:15,599
be deleted uh sometimes this this

1581
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:17,760
deletion protocol can be trivial so if i

1582
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,839
if i do a query that doesn't change the

1583
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:21,599
state of google then then there's no

1584
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:25,119
deletion protocol associated

1585
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,079
and

1586
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,480
the deletion requester will will delete

1587
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,200
everything by the end of the execution

1588
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,160
and now

1589
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:34,000
now at the end of the execution we have

1590
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,359
all the parties that interact in some

1591
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:37,280
way and then at the end we look at these

1592
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,599
two special variables so the state of

1593
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:43,039
the data collector which represents what

1594
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:45,440
the data collector knows about about the

1595
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,160
users and the view of the environment

1596
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,160
which represents what it has learned

1597
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,319
about about the users

1598
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:53,520
and

1599
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,680
the criteria will be defined based on

1600
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:58,160
those variables

1601
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,760
so the first the first paper to

1602
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,000
formalize um

1603
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
the right to be forgotten

1604
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,319
was by goldwasser and the sudevan in

1605
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:10,559
2020 so this is very recent research and

1606
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:12,400
i've put strong in in parenthesis

1607
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,760
because they originally call it

1608
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:18,158
just deletion compliance

1609
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:19,279
and

1610
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:22,238
there have been another

1611
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:24,640
definition proposed by by other authors

1612
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:27,040
and by by myself which we will see later

1613
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:29,439
in in this talk

1614
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,679
so their definition is based on the real

1615
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:33,600
ideal paradigm

1616
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,759
in cryptography the real ideal paradigm

1617
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:37,120
is very useful

1618
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,679
um to define the security of some tests

1619
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:42,399
so so you you define the ideal

1620
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:44,719
task that you want to implement and then

1621
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:46,560
you show that that the real protocol

1622
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,880
that you're using in real life you're

1623
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:51,198
you're indistinguishable from this ideal

1624
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:53,839
ideal case so in our setting we have the

1625
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:56,238
real world as we saw uh in the previous

1626
01:08:56,238 --> 01:08:57,679
slide

1627
01:08:57,679 --> 01:08:59,839
and we have the ideal world

1628
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:01,439
defined as follows

1629
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:03,120
so

1630
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,839
what do we want

1631
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:07,359
from a deletion

1632
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:09,439
so

1633
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:12,080
intuitively any data that we ask to be

1634
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,359
deleted

1635
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:16,399
should result in a state for the for the

1636
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:19,520
data collector that is consistent with

1637
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:22,719
having sending no data at all so this is

1638
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:25,359
what the ideal world captures so in the

1639
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:27,839
ideal world the division requester

1640
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:30,238
requester did not send the data in the

1641
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:31,839
first place

1642
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:34,719
and so the criteria is that if

1643
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:36,238
uh

1644
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:38,560
if the real world

1645
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:40,479
is indistinguishable from the ideal

1646
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:43,759
world uh which is captured by this small

1647
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:45,920
approx symbol then

1648
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,000
that anything that the adversary or

1649
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,759
anything that anyone can learn about

1650
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:51,839
about the data that i've deleted in the

1651
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:53,279
real world

1652
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:55,679
uh is the same that that they can learn

1653
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:57,679
in the ideal world which is nothing at

1654
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:00,400
all because i i didn't disclose my data

1655
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,800
in the first place so this is a

1656
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,120
requirement on both

1657
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,320
the state of the

1658
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:08,719
data collector and

1659
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:11,120
the view of the environment

1660
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:14,239
because the authors of that paper

1661
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:16,719
argue that once once you disclose the

1662
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:19,760
data you cannot uh you you have lost

1663
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:21,679
control on this data right you cannot

1664
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:24,000
delete it anymore if i publish something

1665
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,280
on facebook

1666
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:28,080
uh with with uh absolutely no privacy

1667
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,080
control then that picture is public and

1668
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,239
anyone can copy it and i have no further

1669
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:35,519
control over this data

1670
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:37,600
so

1671
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,000
another

1672
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:42,800
another advantage of this real ideal

1673
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,440
paradigm is that if you

1674
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:47,920
interact with multiple data collectors

1675
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,560
and if they interact with each other in

1676
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:51,760
a

1677
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:56,000
web of protocols such as is the internet

1678
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:56,880
then

1679
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,199
this uh this notion of deletion

1680
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:01,360
compliance is uh

1681
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,440
is close under composition right so if

1682
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,840
you have all of these all of these uh

1683
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,760
data collectors that are

1684
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:10,400
uh deletion compliant

1685
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:11,120
and

1686
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,520
let's say my data follows this blue line

1687
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,199
uh

1688
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,800
from these data collectors so i could

1689
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,719
for example use a service

1690
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:21,199
that stores their data on the cloud and

1691
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:22,400
then

1692
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:25,040
like outsources some analytics or some

1693
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,120
uh advertising

1694
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,400
then

1695
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:31,520
my if my deletion request follows this

1696
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,640
blue line

1697
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,199
and each of those deletion if each of

1698
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:36,719
those data collectors are deletion

1699
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:38,880
compliant then my data should be should

1700
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,400
be erased

1701
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,800
the whole system as a whole should

1702
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,360
satisfy this requirement that

1703
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:49,599
it is as if i didn't send data at all

1704
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:52,480
but as i mentioned

1705
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:53,520
earlier

1706
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,040
there is some drawbacks with this

1707
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:56,159
definition

1708
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,480
but before uh let's see the slide that i

1709
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,360
forgot i had so so let's look at a an

1710
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:04,159
example how you would implement such a

1711
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:06,159
definition so

1712
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:08,560
the example is differential privacy

1713
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,560
uh differential privacy for those not

1714
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,440
familiar with it is um

1715
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:16,480
a property of database queries

1716
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:19,280
that says that

1717
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:22,960
whether i query a database on the left

1718
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:25,040
or a database with one element removed

1719
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:28,000
or one element change

1720
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:30,480
the resulting query the resulting data

1721
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:33,040
should be should be indistinguishable so

1722
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,080
this

1723
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:37,040
this query f you could think of as i'm

1724
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,960
asking what is the mean value of these

1725
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:41,520
uh these these amounts

1726
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,920
and of course if i return the mean value

1727
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:44,960
it's going to be different on the

1728
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,640
left-hand side from the right-hand side

1729
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,480
so what what differential privacy does

1730
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,400
is you add noise to the output

1731
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,560
which means uh

1732
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:52,860
um

1733
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:54,080
[Music]

1734
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,320
that if you add enough noise then then

1735
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,800
this 32000 not being in the data will

1736
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,040
not be noticeable uh

1737
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:03,280
from the outcome only so if you have a

1738
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:06,159
data collector that only exposes

1739
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:07,840
differentially private information to

1740
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:10,080
the world it just holds the database and

1741
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,199
expose

1742
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:13,679
differentially private information

1743
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:15,600
then all it needs to do to be deletion

1744
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,000
compliant is upon a deletion request

1745
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,199
just delete this entry from your

1746
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:22,400
database and that's it

1747
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:25,120
now

1748
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,440
let's come now to the to the strong part

1749
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,600
so what are the drawbacks the drawbacks

1750
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,360
of this real ideal paradigm

1751
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:34,159
uh so so in some sense this definition

1752
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:36,480
captures two notions at once the first

1753
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:37,360
is

1754
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:38,640
privacy

1755
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,120
uh well in this order compliance to

1756
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,520
deletion requests so i will delete uh

1757
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,520
the data that you that you sent to me

1758
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,440
and the other is privacy right so we ask

1759
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,760
that that the adversary cannot

1760
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,840
distinguish between uh

1761
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,920
when i sent my data or when i didn't

1762
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:56,560
send my data

1763
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,320
and

1764
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,719
a consequence of that is that the data

1765
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:02,239
collector cannot

1766
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:05,120
share any uh data from the deletion

1767
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,520
requester even if that was uh the

1768
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:10,000
intentional use of the serv service for

1769
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,719
example in a

1770
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:15,760
in a

1771
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,040
facebook or

1772
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,760
other social network

1773
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:22,239
and there's other technical

1774
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:24,640
uh technical hurdles with this fact as

1775
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:27,600
well which i won't go into

1776
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:28,960
so

1777
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:32,239
uh we will now look at other definitions

1778
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:33,280
other

1779
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,520
tentative definitions of of this of this

1780
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,520
right to be forgotten right there's no

1781
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:39,840
there's there's no right uh formal

1782
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,440
definition yet i'm just presenting what

1783
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,600
has been done so far

1784
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:46,719
um so the first we're going to see is by

1785
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:49,520
galc mahmudi and vasudevan which was

1786
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:50,460
just to appear

1787
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:51,840
[Music]

1788
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:57,120
in 2022 at the pets the pets conference

1789
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,239
um

1790
01:14:58,239 --> 01:14:59,679
and their

1791
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:01,440
their modification is as follows so

1792
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:04,239
instead of having a real world in an

1793
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:07,120
ideal world where the deletion requester

1794
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:10,159
sends no data at all

1795
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:12,799
in this case

1796
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:16,480
the deletion requester has a bunch of

1797
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:20,000
data and then has deleted some of it

1798
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,120
and

1799
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,920
the criteria is that these two worlds

1800
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,920
are indistinguishable so the adversary

1801
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,120
cannot tell

1802
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:28,239
which

1803
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:32,320
between e0 and e1 was deleted by the

1804
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,880
by the deletion requester

1805
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,719
all right and i should say

1806
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:39,679
i should i should emphasize that in the

1807
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:42,880
original definition of uh uh

1808
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:45,840
gal govassa and vasudevan

1809
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,080
just the fact that deletion happened is

1810
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:49,920
a breach of deletion complaints right

1811
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,920
just there's the knowing that the

1812
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,440
deletion

1813
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,679
the deletion requester interacted with

1814
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:57,360
the data collector

1815
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:00,640
is a breach of uh

1816
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,800
of deletion compliance

1817
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:06,239
so this is one attempt to weaken it and

1818
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:06,500
one

1819
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:07,679
[Music]

1820
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:10,239
setting in which it can be applied is

1821
01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:12,480
in machine on learning

1822
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:16,239
so machine and learning is a task

1823
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:18,560
where you train some machine learning

1824
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:21,199
algorithm on on a data set d

1825
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:22,400
and

1826
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,239
you have an associated deletion

1827
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:26,159
operation for your for your learning

1828
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:28,320
algorithms where if

1829
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:29,679
you take

1830
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:31,920
a trained model and delete some point

1831
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,040
you

1832
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:35,440
it should be the same as training a

1833
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,920
fresh model on the data set minus the

1834
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:40,080
the point u

1835
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:44,400
so this is an example of how you can

1836
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:47,840
satisfy deletion com satisfy the right

1837
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:49,360
to be forgotten in the case of machine

1838
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:50,320
learning

1839
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,600
and

1840
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:52,400
the

1841
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:55,280
the security of this task is that no

1842
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,360
adversaries should be able to tell what

1843
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,840
was deleted right so you you define it

1844
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,960
as follows you train a model

1845
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,719
then you let an

1846
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:06,960
environment an adversary interact with

1847
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:08,400
it

1848
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,920
then you delete a point from the model

1849
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:10,960
and

1850
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,480
let the adversary interact with it some

1851
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:15,520
more and then it should not be able

1852
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:18,800
to tell which point was deleted

1853
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,360
so so if you satisfy the previous

1854
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,679
definition of

1855
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:24,880
of

1856
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,120
weak deletion compliance

1857
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:29,360
then then you should you should be

1858
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:31,679
secure against deletion inference in the

1859
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:35,040
case of machine unlearning

1860
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:37,840
um

1861
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,760
another uh the

1862
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,280
proposed weakening

1863
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,520
that was proposed by myself and jonathan

1864
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:46,400
garden from india cemetery

1865
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,239
which was in in

1866
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:50,159
in parallel from the one that we just

1867
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:52,800
saw so it's independent work um

1868
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,159
is

1869
01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:57,520
based on the concept of simulation

1870
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:59,360
so

1871
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:02,239
simulation in cryptography is used for

1872
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:04,480
example in zero knowledge proofs so in

1873
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,320
zero knowledge proofs

1874
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:07,600
how do you prove that you have not

1875
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,080
learned anything

1876
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,800
you show that by building a simulator

1877
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,880
which is a machine that does not have

1878
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:16,320
access to

1879
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,800
to any any knowledge any new knowledge

1880
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,040
and that can produce the same outcome as

1881
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,120
someone that that interacts with with

1882
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:26,120
approver

1883
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:29,679
so in this setting what simulation

1884
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:31,600
says essentially is that

1885
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:34,560
i will construct a simulator that will

1886
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,480
not interact with the division requester

1887
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:39,120
and still produce the same state as the

1888
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:41,679
data collector so so after the leash the

1889
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:42,719
deletion

1890
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:43,840
uh

1891
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:46,400
i will will have produced the same state

1892
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,400
but the trick is that i will give this

1893
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:51,040
simulator the view of the environment so

1894
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:54,000
so so it will have everything except the

1895
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,520
data produced by

1896
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:58,159
the deletion requester

1897
01:18:58,159 --> 01:19:00,239
so this is just um

1898
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:02,320
a repeat of what i was saying so you

1899
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:04,560
will have this simulator that will

1900
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,640
internally simulate this execution but

1901
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:09,120
without without access to this arrow it

1902
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,040
will only see the view

1903
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:14,159
the view of the environment

1904
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:16,480
so this

1905
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:18,719
this simulator s

1906
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:20,800
receives the viewing of the environment

1907
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:23,199
and produces some output that should be

1908
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:24,960
close to what the data collector

1909
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:27,199
produces

1910
01:19:27,199 --> 01:19:30,639
and this is just the definition

1911
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,360
and

1912
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,239
the benefit of such a definition is that

1913
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:40,239
it captures a broader a broader uh

1914
01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:42,800
a broader class of data collectors right

1915
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,520
whereas in the in the context of strong

1916
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,440
deletion compliance you cannot you

1917
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:49,280
cannot ever have facebook being deletion

1918
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,440
compliance in that setting because

1919
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:52,800
facebook

1920
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,600
by essence shares data and as as soon as

1921
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,440
you share any data from

1922
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:59,920
the deletion requester then you cannot

1923
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,840
satisfy the division

1924
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,440
compliance

1925
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:04,719
criteria

1926
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:07,760
so what this says is that instead of

1927
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:10,239
just having the real and ideal world be

1928
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:13,920
indistinguishable i will build a machine

1929
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,280
that will

1930
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,280
reconstruct

1931
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,679
uh the state

1932
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:21,920
or i will reconstruct all of the servers

1933
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,920
of facebook but without the data that i

1934
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:26,080
sent to it in the first place so if you

1935
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:27,440
if you can show that such a machine

1936
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,639
exists you don't have to build it you

1937
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:30,400
just have to show that it's possible

1938
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,320
then then you satisfy this this notion

1939
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:35,120
of weak deletion compliance

1940
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:36,480
and and how

1941
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:39,600
one property that implies this

1942
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:40,800
definition

1943
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:43,120
is history independence

1944
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:45,600
uh so histogram dependence is a property

1945
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,840
of

1946
01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:51,120
data structure implementations

1947
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,040
so so what i mean by implementation is

1948
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:55,040
that for example if you have a graph

1949
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,040
then you can uh you can

1950
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:58,880
implement it

1951
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,719
at a lower level using

1952
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:03,280
adjacency matrix if you have a queue you

1953
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,440
can implement it using a linked list if

1954
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:08,159
you have an associative map you can

1955
01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:10,560
implement it using a

1956
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:11,020
hash

1957
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:12,320
[Music]

1958
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:15,040
a hash function with a list

1959
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,560
and

1960
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:19,120
these these implementations

1961
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:20,000
some

1962
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:20,960
times

1963
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,560
depend on

1964
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:23,360
uh

1965
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:24,719
the state of the representation

1966
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:26,719
sometimes it depends on the order in

1967
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:28,880
which the operations are done for

1968
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,800
example if i have this graph in the

1969
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,480
upper right corner

1970
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:33,270
and i do

1971
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:35,040
[Music]

1972
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,600
i build this graph using a series of add

1973
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:40,400
vertex and add edge

1974
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,880
if i do these operations in different

1975
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,639
orders they will

1976
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:46,560
they will result in different

1977
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:49,280
representations

1978
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:52,320
and what history independence

1979
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,080
says is that if you have an

1980
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:55,440
implementation that is history

1981
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:56,480
independent

1982
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:57,360
then

1983
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:59,760
this uh these representations will be

1984
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:00,800
the same

1985
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,960
regardless of the order of operations

1986
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:05,760
right they only depend on the content of

1987
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:08,840
the data structure not on the

1988
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:10,400
um

1989
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,719
not on the way not on the order in which

1990
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:14,480
it is built

1991
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:15,280
and

1992
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:17,199
for for example in this in this

1993
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:20,000
adjacency list i can i can sort

1994
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,080
inside the parentheses and i can sort

1995
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:25,199
then uh on the first uh first and second

1996
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:27,440
node of the

1997
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:29,679
of this list or a sorted list is kind of

1998
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:32,480
the canonical example of a history

1999
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:35,199
independent data structures

2000
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:39,839
right and now to conclude so uh

2001
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
the definitions that that are built in

2002
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,679
this way are intended to be stricter

2003
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:46,480
than the the laws in the model so if we

2004
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:50,080
satisfy the formal crypto definition

2005
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:51,679
then

2006
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:53,120
you meet you should meet the

2007
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:54,480
requirements of the law that so that's

2008
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:57,040
the intended goal

2009
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,639
so of course there's still no right

2010
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:00,239
definition of what it means to forget

2011
01:23:00,239 --> 01:23:03,600
data so this is very young uh

2012
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:04,400
work

2013
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,280
and we're still missing the

2014
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:08,080
multi-disciplinary approach that is

2015
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:10,639
found in the other work by by nissim

2016
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:13,120
where there were legal scholars working

2017
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:16,239
with computer scientists to

2018
01:23:16,239 --> 01:23:18,560
come up with with these these notions so

2019
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:19,520
for

2020
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:21,199
for now this has only been the work of

2021
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:22,719
cryptographers and and computer

2022
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:24,880
scientists

2023
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,239
um

2024
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:28,719
even though they seem they seem

2025
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:30,400
arbitrary and complex there are tools

2026
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:33,120
that exist to easily meet those

2027
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,880
definitions so so we've seen three

2028
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,719
differential privacy history

2029
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:39,840
independence and machine learning

2030
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:42,000
and one thing that's very important is

2031
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,320
that the honest participant of the

2032
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:45,920
earnest participation of the data

2033
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:48,239
collector is is crucial because you

2034
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:49,520
cannot force

2035
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:51,040
you cannot force someone to delete

2036
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:53,120
something you have you need to have

2037
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,639
someone that is willing to comply with

2038
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:57,679
the laws and that will that will do so

2039
01:23:57,679 --> 01:23:59,280
in in

2040
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:01,840
in the best effort

2041
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:03,760
thank you

2042
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:10,480

yeah thank you so much okay uh we're

2046
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:18,560
gonna do a final five minute break and

2047
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,600
then we're gonna come back for a

2048
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,679
discussion if you haven't gotten your

2049
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:25,440
questions on slido yet please do so um i

2050
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:27,520
will be looking at them as we moderate

2051
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,800
this conversation which i think is gonna

2052
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,880
be super super interesting thank you

2053
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:33,040
that means we're back at

uh with michael um you know

2085
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:04,800
one of the things that stood out to me

2086
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:05,679
from

2087
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:07,760
from your talk is this idea that that

2088
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:09,840
there's a real shift in the government's

2089
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:12,719
approach to technology regulation

2090
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:14,159
we've moved from

2091
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:17,199
a really pro-innovation hands-off

2092
01:38:17,199 --> 01:38:19,679
enabling approach to one that starts to

2093
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:22,320
try and target symptoms rather than than

2094
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:25,520
root causes of problems um

2095
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:27,440
one of those questions you know one of

2096
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:29,119
the interesting observations is despite

2097
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:30,400
all of these areas in which the

2098
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:32,239
government the the canadian government

2099
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:35,600
is intervening privacy isn't one of them

2100
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:37,119
and i'm wondering what the link is

2101
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:40,000
between this hands-off or

2102
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,920
sort of i would say like politically

2103
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:44,400
negligent approach to privacy

2104
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,520
um

2105
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:48,080
and this sort of symptoms versus root

2106
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:50,400
causes dynamic i'm wondering if you

2107
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:51,840
could tell us a little bit your thoughts

2108
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:53,040
on that

2109
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:55,760
sure uh so thanks thanks for that and

2110
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:58,400
and you're right it's to me the lack of

2111
01:38:58,400 --> 01:38:59,600
activity

2112
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:01,600
on privacy is is a little bit difficult

2113
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:04,400
to square if you were a government

2114
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:06,000
genuinely concerned with dealing with

2115
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
some of the core challenges that

2116
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,920
platforms and some of these technologies

2117
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:11,360
create in fact i was talking with

2118
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:13,360
somebody during the break who noted that

2119
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:15,440
quebecois has of course moved forward

2120
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:17,199
with respect to privacy and i think

2121
01:39:17,199 --> 01:39:18,719
we're seeing a number of provinces

2122
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:20,560
basically say listen if the federal

2123
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:22,080
government can't get its act together

2124
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:23,520
we're going to move ahead ourselves and

2125
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:25,119
so we're seeing that in a number of

2126
01:39:25,119 --> 01:39:26,560
different places

2127
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:28,800
you know i i my view would be that we

2128
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:30,639
can chalk up both

2129
01:39:30,639 --> 01:39:32,000
i think some of the problematic

2130
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
proposals that i highlighted in the talk

2131
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,800
as well as the inaction on privacy

2132
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:39,600
to frankly simple politics and the

2133
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:42,239
perception within government that these

2134
01:39:42,239 --> 01:39:45,119
can be tough issues to explain and so if

2135
01:39:45,119 --> 01:39:47,280
you have a simple what you think is a

2136
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:49,119
winning policy

2137
01:39:49,119 --> 01:39:50,880
you're going to run with it the

2138
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:53,040
so-called winning policy that i think we

2139
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:57,040
saw with respect to uh c11 and c18 and

2140
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:58,800
initially online harms until they got

2141
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:01,280
that pushback was that as long as you

2142
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:03,040
were on the opposite side of google

2143
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:04,480
facebook and some of the other tech

2144
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,239
companies you were where you wanted to

2145
01:40:06,239 --> 01:40:08,400
be in terms of public opinion i'm not

2146
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:10,320
totally sure that that's right but that

2147
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:12,320
was their perspective

2148
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:15,119
privacy is so much more difficult and i

2149
01:40:15,119 --> 01:40:17,199
think what the government

2150
01:40:17,199 --> 01:40:18,639
the messaging that the government came

2151
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:20,320
away from in terms of the initial

2152
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:22,800
reaction to the bill that went nowhere

2153
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:24,880
was that this is really hard i mean we

2154
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,080
saw that with respect to the

2155
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:28,239
presentations about how hard getting

2156
01:40:28,239 --> 01:40:30,239
some of these issues can be

2157
01:40:30,239 --> 01:40:32,000
and so when they took a look at an issue

2158
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,719
that left those looking for more privacy

2159
01:40:34,719 --> 01:40:36,560
concerned because they said you know we

2160
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:38,159
don't think this legislation goes far

2161
01:40:38,159 --> 01:40:40,000
enough and we saw then they got a

2162
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,520
reaction from the business community

2163
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:43,440
that said we think what you've proposed

2164
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:45,280
already goes too far

2165
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:47,360
there was no obvious hero there was no

2166
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:50,080
obvious villain in privacy it was just

2167
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:52,159
hard policy work that really needs to

2168
01:40:52,159 --> 01:40:53,119
happen

2169
01:40:53,119 --> 01:40:55,280
and the government basically said why

2170
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:57,440
bother

2171
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:58,800
yeah you know i think another thing that

2172
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:01,520
really strikes me around uh the privacy

2173
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:03,040
issue and i think it's similar to the

2174
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:04,400
competition issue

2175
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:05,920
is that um

2176
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:08,480
it's it's actually not that hard to

2177
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,880
build a lara policy uh you know we see

2178
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:12,239
this with the online harms proposal

2179
01:41:12,239 --> 01:41:13,920
which is like the government's job is to

2180
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:15,040
just um

2181
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:16,400
deal with all the bad things on the

2182
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:18,320
internet like internet bad guys and it's

2183
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:20,400
easy to be on you know it's us versus

2184
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,159
the child pornographers it's a lot

2185
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:24,400
harder to be like it's us making a

2186
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:27,040
newest balance that is constitutionally

2187
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:28,880
respectful of people's competing

2188
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:30,880
liberties and safety concerns like

2189
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:33,280
that's it's a harder sell but you know

2190
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:34,880
part of it comes down to the business

2191
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:37,520
model right um if you have a government

2192
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:39,840
that is simultaneously looking at this

2193
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:42,159
sector as an atm

2194
01:41:42,159 --> 01:41:44,560
and that sector is financed by intrusive

2195
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:47,679
advertising that relies on uh massive

2196
01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:49,280
and extraordinary data breaches that

2197
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:51,679
amount to like almost incalculable human

2198
01:41:51,679 --> 01:41:54,159
rights issues uh it's really hard to say

2199
01:41:54,159 --> 01:41:55,840
like well maybe we should like reel some

2200
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,679
of that back i wonder like do you have a

2201
01:41:57,679 --> 01:41:59,520
reaction to that

2202
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:02,000
so i mean my candid view would be that

2203
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,440
the government isn't nearly

2204
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:05,920
sophisticated enough in its thinking on

2205
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:07,440
policy to make the connection that you

2206
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:08,560
just made

2207
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:11,600
that the idea that if you what you want

2208
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:14,400
out of the platforms is their cash

2209
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:17,119
then trying to limit what they do from a

2210
01:42:17,119 --> 01:42:18,560
potentially competitive abuse

2211
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:20,639
perspective or limit the amount of data

2212
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:22,800
that they collect or how they use it

2213
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:25,199
which necessarily implicates the amount

2214
01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:27,119
of cash that they can generate that then

2215
01:42:27,119 --> 01:42:29,040
they give that then that can be used for

2216
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:31,199
your policy objectives which i think is

2217
01:42:31,199 --> 01:42:32,320
right

2218
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:34,320
frankly i i don't think i don't think

2219
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:36,719
that they're within miles of being able

2220
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:40,239
to make that connection i think this is

2221
01:42:40,239 --> 01:42:41,840
you know from the perspective of certain

2222
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:44,400
politicians it's a tick box on a mandate

2223
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:46,239
letter that says i've got to deliver on

2224
01:42:46,239 --> 01:42:48,400
some of these issues and in fact i think

2225
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:50,400
you can even go further and make the

2226
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:52,480
argument that some ways they know going

2227
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:54,000
in that on some of these issues they

2228
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,600
haven't even figured out all of these

2229
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:58,000
complexities they've decided to punt

2230
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
many of those issues to the regulator to

2231
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,880
the crtc or to a yet to be forthcoming

2232
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:04,080
regulator

2233
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:05,520
and you know yesterday we had the head

2234
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:06,960
of the crtc saying it's going to take at

2235
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:09,920
least two years to sort out the c11

2236
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:12,000
stuff and that's before there's judicial

2237
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,800
appeals and uh and reviews and the like

2238
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:16,480
we're talking about years and years and

2239
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:18,239
by that point in time if you're pablo

2240
01:43:18,239 --> 01:43:22,559
rodriguez it's somebody else's problem

2241
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:25,440
that is incredibly depressing okay i i

2242
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:26,800
i want to come back i want to come back

2243
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:28,320
to you michael because um i think that

2244
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:30,000
there's a real interest in this audience

2245
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
in particular to think about how to get

2246
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,520
engaged around these issues but i want

2247
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:35,360
to ask a question to andrea um there

2248
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:37,600
were two things that kind of um seemed a

2249
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:39,360
little bit um

2250
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:41,040
counterintuitive or surprising about

2251
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:43,280
your findings to me one of them

2252
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:45,520
with this idea that stronger passwords

2253
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:47,440
were more present in places where there

2254
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:50,000
were kind of would say maybe stronger

2255
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,159
democratic institutions or greater

2256
01:43:52,159 --> 01:43:54,159
liberty higher freedom of expression

2257
01:43:54,159 --> 01:43:57,040
metrics and things like that

2258
01:43:57,040 --> 01:43:58,800
it seems counterintuitive to me maybe

2259
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:00,719
because you think that people who live

2260
01:44:00,719 --> 01:44:03,199
in places where there's weak democratic

2261
01:44:03,199 --> 01:44:05,520
institutions would have to take more of

2262
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:08,639
a sort of proactive or like um

2263
01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:10,719
like a self-protective approach to these

2264
01:44:10,719 --> 01:44:12,320
kinds of issues or maybe it's the

2265
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:14,719
inverse and people are are jaded and

2266
01:44:14,719 --> 01:44:16,719
they don't have a strong desire to

2267
01:44:16,719 --> 01:44:18,080
protect those issues because they they

2268
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:19,119
don't feel that they're going to be

2269
01:44:19,119 --> 01:44:20,639
respected by their government so i'm

2270
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:22,400
really wondering what your reflexes are

2271
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:24,239
around what you think explains that and

2272
01:44:24,239 --> 01:44:25,600
then the other thing that i thought was

2273
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:28,000
interesting is this idea that a higher

2274
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,080
level of digital skills don't

2275
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:31,760
necessarily

2276
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:33,520
result in strong passwords and so i'm

2277
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:35,840
wondering like what are your reflexes

2278
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:38,320
around what explains these two

2279
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:40,080
conclusions i think it's an interesting

2280
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:41,760
link but do you have a hypothesis about

2281
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:42,480
like

2282
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:44,400
why

2283
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:46,320
so of course like the

2284
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:48,320
the the results that i presented today

2285
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:50,560
are kind of a preliminary analysis i can

2286
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:52,880
go much further in those analysis and i

2287
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:57,119
i will in the future um but like for the

2288
01:44:57,119 --> 01:45:00,320
second one the digital uh skills i think

2289
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:03,119
that yes you can you you know

2290
01:45:03,119 --> 01:45:05,199
you you can know

2291
01:45:05,199 --> 01:45:08,000
how to use a computer uh but it does not

2292
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,239
necessarily mean that you use it in the

2293
01:45:10,239 --> 01:45:13,600
right way or that you are aware of all

2294
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:14,639
the

2295
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:16,960
not the consequences but the the bad

2296
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:19,119
aspects of of using

2297
01:45:19,119 --> 01:45:21,600
um technologies so

2298
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:24,480
it's just like just the the

2299
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:26,480
the hypothesis or the conclusion that i

2300
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:29,440
can say for now is that it's not they

2301
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:32,719
are not synonyms so a good uh yeah good

2302
01:45:32,719 --> 01:45:34,480
use of computer is not in the name of

2303
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:36,960
knowing how to use it so that's uh

2304
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:37,840
that's

2305
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:39,760
how far i can go for now but in the

2306
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:42,560
future i hope i can answer this better

2307
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:46,320
and for the other one it was um yeah so

2308
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:49,040
in democracies i i mentioned it really

2309
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:50,719
quickly and during the presentation but

2310
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:52,800
for democracies there's a lot of other

2311
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:54,400
variables that come

2312
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:59,600
into play uh so first um well and most

2313
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:01,440
importantly the access to the

2314
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,840
information so when you have access to

2315
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:07,040
information you can be more educated and

2316
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:10,960
you can uh it's you are more um

2317
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:12,719
it uh it's

2318
01:46:12,719 --> 01:46:15,360
you you have higher probabilities of uh

2319
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:17,760
of having um

2320
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:20,880
seen how to protect yourself and and you

2321
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:21,679
can

2322
01:46:21,679 --> 01:46:24,239
educate yourself and go further in those

2323
01:46:24,239 --> 01:46:25,440
so um

2324
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:27,600
this is how i would explain

2325
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:28,719
why in

2326
01:46:28,719 --> 01:46:31,679
the the result of this study

2327
01:46:31,679 --> 01:46:32,960
cool okay that's that's really

2328
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:34,880
interesting one other thing that sort of

2329
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:36,239
um i was curious about when i was

2330
01:46:36,239 --> 01:46:38,480
listening to your talk was whether you

2331
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:40,800
think or whether you have a whether you

2332
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:42,639
know in the academic literature or

2333
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:44,159
whether you have a sort of gut feeling

2334
01:46:44,159 --> 01:46:45,520
or hypothesis

2335
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:49,040
around whether having stronger passwords

2336
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:50,880
people who have stronger passwords are

2337
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:53,600
more likely to engage in other kinds of

2338
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:56,320
good security hygiene or more likely to

2339
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:58,560
for example use encryption technology or

2340
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:00,719
anonymity software or do you think that

2341
01:47:00,719 --> 01:47:02,080
there is something particular about

2342
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:03,840
passwords that maybe

2343
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:05,840
makes your findings not generalizable to

2344
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:08,400
those other kinds of user behaviors

2345
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:11,119
so my take on that would be that yes it

2346
01:47:11,119 --> 01:47:12,560
should be related but i don't know

2347
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:14,480
because i didn't study it directly okay

2348
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:17,280
but um all the the variable that i put

2349
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:18,560
in the model

2350
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:21,040
of my presentation today it's because i

2351
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:23,440
i didn't put it like uh

2352
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:25,760
like randomly right i read the

2353
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:27,920
literature and it made sense to put them

2354
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:29,280
there because

2355
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:31,679
those variables were influencing other

2356
01:47:31,679 --> 01:47:34,320
technological behavior uh

2357
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:36,480
for protection and for other uh

2358
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:39,280
behaviors so it made sense and i think

2359
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:42,000
that in the end it would be related but

2360
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,719
uh i think it's much more complicated

2361
01:47:44,719 --> 01:47:46,880
than that and it might be related in

2362
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:49,199
complex ways so uh maybe in the future

2363
01:47:49,199 --> 01:47:52,239
i'll be able to answer that

2364
01:47:52,239 --> 01:47:53,520
cool okay that's that's really

2365
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:55,360
interesting and i think that there's

2366
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:56,800
probably a lot of people in the room who

2367
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:58,560
have kind of an intuitive thought one

2368
01:47:58,560 --> 01:47:59,840
way or the other about the answer to

2369
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:01,600
that question and so i'm sure there are

2370
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:03,679
people who will pitch you some research

2371
01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:04,960
um

2372
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:06,000
okay

2373
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,080
so first i have to apologize i was sure

2374
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:09,119
that there was going to be some

2375
01:48:09,119 --> 01:48:12,320
blockchain in this pitch as a lawyer um

2376
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:14,000
when people are like the right to be

2377
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,480
forgotten how do we deal with this messy

2378
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:19,199
problem it's it always involves a ledger

2379
01:48:19,199 --> 01:48:21,199
people just love the ledger and so i was

2380
01:48:21,199 --> 01:48:22,800
surprised so i was real i found your

2381
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:24,480
talk really interesting and i was really

2382
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:27,360
um it became much clearer to me that

2383
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:28,960
the problem the technical problem you're

2384
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:30,239
working to solve is this problem of

2385
01:48:30,239 --> 01:48:32,880
deletion in particular and as as a

2386
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:36,000
lawyer um i was so struck by your

2387
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,480
comments at the end around this this

2388
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:40,400
interdisciplinarity

2389
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:42,239
and how uh how

2390
01:48:42,239 --> 01:48:45,280
um how big the problem surrounding this

2391
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:49,119
question is because on

2392
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:51,920
at least in law the deletion looks like

2393
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:54,239
the easy problem right the hard problem

2394
01:48:54,239 --> 01:48:56,800
is what do you delete who decides how do

2395
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:59,119
you balance competing interests

2396
01:48:59,119 --> 01:49:00,800
do you keep logs

2397
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:03,520
are there mechanisms for redress um and

2398
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:05,600
so all of those questions sort of

2399
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:07,199
surround

2400
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:09,360
this issue for me one of my questions

2401
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:10,719
for you is

2402
01:49:10,719 --> 01:49:11,920
what

2403
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:14,320
what made you interested in working on

2404
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:16,719
this technical problem

2405
01:49:16,719 --> 01:49:18,880
um and like what do you see as future

2406
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:20,639
directions around that interdisciplinary

2407
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:22,800
work that needs to be done

2408
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:25,440
yeah so so unfortunately crypto has

2409
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:28,560
become a synonym for cryptocurrency uh

2410
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:31,520
in the in the general public side so

2411
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:32,719
um

2412
01:49:32,719 --> 01:49:34,719
so that's where the confusion came from

2413
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:36,960
i guess uh so to answer your questions

2414
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:38,960
yeah so the

2415
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:40,719
tools are presented the definitions

2416
01:49:40,719 --> 01:49:42,239
everything it cannot tell you what to

2417
01:49:42,239 --> 01:49:44,000
delete or what to what to keep right so

2418
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,480
this is a question for for lawmakers to

2419
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:48,320
decide or for for system designers to

2420
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:51,119
see what's useful what's not um it just

2421
01:49:51,119 --> 01:49:54,000
tells what just tells you what what what

2422
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,520
does it mean uh

2423
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:57,520
in terms of

2424
01:49:57,520 --> 01:49:59,520
technical aspects

2425
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:01,119
what what should what should you expect

2426
01:50:01,119 --> 01:50:03,520
when you ask something to be deleted

2427
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:05,679
in terms of purging everything right so

2428
01:50:05,679 --> 01:50:07,040
so the different

2429
01:50:07,040 --> 01:50:08,560
definitions that i presented are very

2430
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:10,719
strong in terms of they purge everything

2431
01:50:10,719 --> 01:50:13,119
like from from

2432
01:50:13,119 --> 01:50:15,679
the data being stored to the

2433
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:17,760
data being processed in terms of machine

2434
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:19,040
learning there's

2435
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:21,040
this machine on learning where you when

2436
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:23,360
you delete this data from from from the

2437
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:25,440
model itself

2438
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:26,560
and

2439
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:28,320
um

2440
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:30,000
so what got me interested in this

2441
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,599
question is actually just stumbling upon

2442
01:50:31,599 --> 01:50:33,199
the paper of of

2443
01:50:33,199 --> 01:50:35,599
govassar and vasudevan and just noticing

2444
01:50:35,599 --> 01:50:36,639
that this

2445
01:50:36,639 --> 01:50:38,480
this definition is very strong

2446
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:40,639
uh it's unlikely to be satisfied in

2447
01:50:40,639 --> 01:50:43,520
practice and and if you want to to

2448
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:46,400
have an impact using this definition you

2449
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:47,679
need to have something that that's

2450
01:50:47,679 --> 01:50:50,560
applicable to everyday life right so so

2451
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:53,280
when you have web web servers like the

2452
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:55,520
google facebook amazon of this world

2453
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:57,280
they provide a service based on the data

2454
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:59,199
that they collect and

2455
01:50:59,199 --> 01:51:00,719
you should expect to have the right to

2456
01:51:00,719 --> 01:51:02,159
erase your data

2457
01:51:02,159 --> 01:51:04,239
and so it makes sense to define what it

2458
01:51:04,239 --> 01:51:06,159
means to delete the data from their from

2459
01:51:06,159 --> 01:51:08,560
their servers without without having to

2460
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:09,440
to

2461
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:11,520
to restrict the services that they that

2462
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:13,599
they offer

2463
01:51:13,599 --> 01:51:14,880
okay and one of the questions i had

2464
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:16,400
about your research and i might have

2465
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:18,320
just missed this bit but it like what

2466
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:21,119
are the use cases that you imagine um

2467
01:51:21,119 --> 01:51:23,199
for for this kind of approach like

2468
01:51:23,199 --> 01:51:24,239
because there are some questions in the

2469
01:51:24,239 --> 01:51:26,080
chat about things like people's

2470
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:29,840
conversations so are you imagining um

2471
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:31,679
the deletion rules that that that you

2472
01:51:31,679 --> 01:51:34,239
set out here kind of applying to

2473
01:51:34,239 --> 01:51:36,560
information that is public in character

2474
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:38,480
or information that might have where

2475
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:39,679
there might be some kind of joint

2476
01:51:39,679 --> 01:51:42,239
privacy interest

2477
01:51:42,239 --> 01:51:44,719
so so that depends on uh on each of the

2478
01:51:44,719 --> 01:51:46,400
definitions that i presented so for the

2479
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:49,119
strong variant of deletion compliance uh

2480
01:51:49,119 --> 01:51:50,239
like

2481
01:51:50,239 --> 01:51:54,400
a chat at a messaging app like cannot be

2482
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:55,760
deletion compliant because you're

2483
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:57,599
sending out your information to another

2484
01:51:57,599 --> 01:51:58,960
to another person

2485
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:00,960
that has a local copy of it

2486
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:04,239
and so unless you ask of every

2487
01:52:04,239 --> 01:52:06,320
individual to delete the data that they

2488
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:09,360
hold about everyone else um

2489
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:11,199
you're not going to have a satisfactory

2490
01:52:11,199 --> 01:52:14,080
notion of deletion compliance and

2491
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:16,320
so for the the definition the weaker

2492
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:18,159
definition that we proposed

2493
01:52:18,159 --> 01:52:20,159
you have this

2494
01:52:20,159 --> 01:52:21,679
this this message that you send to

2495
01:52:21,679 --> 01:52:24,560
someone else now is part of the the view

2496
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:26,719
of the environment that can be used to

2497
01:52:26,719 --> 01:52:30,400
to reconstruct the the

2498
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:32,000
like the content of the hard drives of

2499
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,239
the server right the the server can know

2500
01:52:34,239 --> 01:52:36,000
this stuff because you shared it to

2501
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,119
someone else

2502
01:52:37,119 --> 01:52:38,000
uh

2503
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,239
now then then

2504
01:52:40,239 --> 01:52:41,360
uh

2505
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:43,199
there's also the question of whether you

2506
01:52:43,199 --> 01:52:45,679
should be able to delete chats messages

2507
01:52:45,679 --> 01:52:47,119
in a private

2508
01:52:47,119 --> 01:52:48,880
private conversation but that's uh

2509
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:50,400
that's not something that that

2510
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:53,440
cryptography has an answer to

2511
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:55,199
right it's it's maybe more of a

2512
01:52:55,199 --> 01:52:56,639
political question something i was

2513
01:52:56,639 --> 01:52:58,480
thinking about when uh when you were

2514
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:00,320
talking around the right to be forgotten

2515
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:02,239
it kind of comes up in some of the slido

2516
01:53:02,239 --> 01:53:03,840
questions too and it's something i was

2517
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:05,679
thinking about in michael's comments

2518
01:53:05,679 --> 01:53:07,679
about the link tags or these online

2519
01:53:07,679 --> 01:53:09,119
harms problem

2520
01:53:09,119 --> 01:53:11,119
like the and actually it kind of goes to

2521
01:53:11,119 --> 01:53:13,520
the password issue too like part of the

2522
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:15,599
problem that all of you are dealing with

2523
01:53:15,599 --> 01:53:17,360
in very different ways is like the

2524
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:19,280
classical problem of

2525
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:21,440
the internet is a machine that copies

2526
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:22,639
bits

2527
01:53:22,639 --> 01:53:25,360
um and on every level whether you're

2528
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:26,560
talking about

2529
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:28,480
uh password security whether we're

2530
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:30,000
talking about freedom of expression in

2531
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,760
the context of news or whether we're

2532
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:33,520
talking about the right to be forgotten

2533
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:35,119
we're all running up against the problem

2534
01:53:35,119 --> 01:53:36,719
of the sort of like fundamental nature

2535
01:53:36,719 --> 01:53:38,800
of what the internet is i'm wondering if

2536
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:41,199
any of you have reactions to that maybe

2537
01:53:41,199 --> 01:53:42,560
starting with michael in your

2538
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:45,760
conversations with policymakers or yeah

2539
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:48,000
yeah no

2540
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:50,000
i'm glad i'm glad you asked it's an

2541
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,199
interesting it's i think it's an

2542
01:53:51,199 --> 01:53:52,400
interesting point in you're right it

2543
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:53,199
does

2544
01:53:53,199 --> 01:53:54,639
flow throughout the

2545
01:53:54,639 --> 01:53:56,560
throughout the various presentations i

2546
01:53:56,560 --> 01:53:58,800
it actually your question brings to mind

2547
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:00,800
a comment that was made just last night

2548
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:01,840
um

2549
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:02,880
in one

2550
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:05,520
hearing where the head of the crtc

2551
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:08,400
was asked about regulating the internet

2552
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:11,199
and his response was i don't regulate

2553
01:54:11,199 --> 01:54:12,960
the internet or the crtc isn't in the

2554
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:14,800
business of regulating the internet we

2555
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:17,280
regulate broadcast

2556
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:20,159
and what you need to understand is that

2557
01:54:20,159 --> 01:54:21,440
his view

2558
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:23,920
is that broadcast within the context of

2559
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:25,360
canadian law

2560
01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:28,639
is all audio visual content wherever it

2561
01:54:28,639 --> 01:54:30,880
originates on whatever network it

2562
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:32,000
happens to

2563
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:33,599
exist on

2564
01:54:33,599 --> 01:54:36,159
now where i come from that's pretty much

2565
01:54:36,159 --> 01:54:37,280
the internet

2566
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:40,000
um but if you're a broadcaster

2567
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,080
you don't make that you think that those

2568
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:44,480
bits are broadcast bits

2569
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:46,960
and that there is a role to play for a

2570
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:48,880
broadcaster now a broadcast regulator

2571
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:50,719
now it may well be that on certain

2572
01:54:50,719 --> 01:54:52,719
issues there is a role to play

2573
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:55,280
but i don't think that the starting

2574
01:54:55,280 --> 01:54:59,520
point is that all bits are broadcast and

2575
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:02,480
one of the problems that we face is that

2576
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:04,880
the starting point from the canadian

2577
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:06,880
legislative perspective and certainly at

2578
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,400
this point in time the head of our

2579
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:09,599
regulator

2580
01:55:09,599 --> 01:55:11,920
is that this looks like broadcast

2581
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:13,679
whether it's the twitch stream of this

2582
01:55:13,679 --> 01:55:18,080
panel um or or a movie or a program on a

2583
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:19,760
mainstream commercial channel from their

2584
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:22,480
perspective all of this is the same and

2585
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:24,639
we can apply the same regulatory rules

2586
01:55:24,639 --> 01:55:26,560
in that way and i think your point about

2587
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:28,480
the need to have a i think a more

2588
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:30,800
sophisticated understanding about what's

2589
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:32,159
taking place technically and have

2590
01:55:32,159 --> 01:55:34,480
policies that respond to that has

2591
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:37,598
oftentimes been missing

2592
01:55:38,159 --> 01:55:39,040
um

2593
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:40,560
i don't know if you have thoughts about

2594
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:42,239
that that part of the problems you're

2595
01:55:42,239 --> 01:55:44,000
trying to solve are

2596
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,360
the problems of undoing what the

2597
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:47,119
internet does best

2598
01:55:47,119 --> 01:55:49,840
so so when it comes to to this broadcast

2599
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:52,159
broadcast versus like i guess a private

2600
01:55:52,159 --> 01:55:54,480
line going out of your house nowadays a

2601
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:56,000
lot of the internet is broadcasted as

2602
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
well if you you have a cell phone you

2603
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:59,520
just broke out the signal and the

2604
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:02,320
antenna catches it and what makes it

2605
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:03,119
none

2606
01:56:03,119 --> 01:56:04,000
like

2607
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,760
what makes it not really a broadcast is

2608
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:07,520
that you use encryption to have a secure

2609
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:09,520
line between between yourself and the

2610
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:11,119
provider but

2611
01:56:11,119 --> 01:56:13,760
uh so so maybe like this there's a

2612
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:15,360
there's a nuance in the definition and

2613
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:17,679
maybe there's something to

2614
01:56:17,679 --> 01:56:19,760
to address there um

2615
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:22,480
and i wanted to touch on the like this

2616
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:24,800
the way the internet works right now so

2617
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:27,440
in the past 20 years there's been a

2618
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:29,040
really essentialization of the internet

2619
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:31,119
where you have these these giants that

2620
01:56:31,119 --> 01:56:33,040
form really the backbone of the internet

2621
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:34,719
that we use every day

2622
01:56:34,719 --> 01:56:36,960
and back in the days it was

2623
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:39,440
uh mostly everyone could host their own

2624
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:42,000
infrastructure i could i could have my

2625
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,159
email server at home i still can but

2626
01:56:44,159 --> 01:56:46,880
it's a it's a lot of a hustle

2627
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:47,760
and

2628
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:49,119
uh

2629
01:56:49,119 --> 01:56:52,080
one of the big hype recently about all

2630
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:56,639
of this web 3.0 is kind of a like people

2631
01:56:56,639 --> 01:56:58,560
wanting to go back to this this original

2632
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:00,080
state of the internet where where

2633
01:57:00,080 --> 01:57:01,599
everything is decentralized and there's

2634
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:04,320
no big entity uh forming

2635
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:05,599
from uh

2636
01:57:05,599 --> 01:57:08,080
having huge power over the internet but

2637
01:57:08,080 --> 01:57:10,639
unfortunately you see as as this becomes

2638
01:57:10,639 --> 01:57:12,400
more popular you

2639
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:14,080
also have a tendency for things to

2640
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:16,800
centralize like the the nfts you have

2641
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:18,800
these big platforms that

2642
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:20,239
essentially host

2643
01:57:20,239 --> 01:57:22,080
the image that you bought

2644
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:24,159
so if they go offline then you're left

2645
01:57:24,159 --> 01:57:26,320
with just a couple of bits on on on a

2646
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:29,440
public blockchain so um

2647
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:31,839
i guess

2648
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:33,920
all right and i wanted to add something

2649
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:36,639
that that is also passed from rihann uh

2650
01:57:36,639 --> 01:57:38,639
which is that cryptography has a lot of

2651
01:57:38,639 --> 01:57:40,480
tools to protect our data online so you

2652
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:42,480
have encryption you have uh

2653
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:44,320
like all the password authentication

2654
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:46,880
there's a lot of tools to have a safe

2655
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:49,440
life online and have privacy respected

2656
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:52,000
but the downside is that you have to

2657
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,760
have strong uh

2658
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:55,440
operational security like you have to

2659
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:57,599
have strong passwords and and keep and

2660
01:57:57,599 --> 01:58:00,000
not lose them so this is some

2661
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,840
somewhere where

2662
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:03,360
if you lose your password and you lose

2663
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:05,199
all your photos on google photos then

2664
01:58:05,199 --> 01:58:06,480
you're gonna be mad so this is why

2665
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:08,639
google just has this one authentication

2666
01:58:08,639 --> 01:58:10,639
for all of the services and and

2667
01:58:10,639 --> 01:58:12,320
and it's not end to end encrypted

2668
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:14,800
because if you use if you lose your keys

2669
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:15,840
then

2670
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:17,760
then you're gonna be you're gonna be

2671
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:19,679
distraught so this is something like

2672
01:58:19,679 --> 01:58:21,520
that comes to the adoption of these

2673
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:23,520
technologies by people and why

2674
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:24,480
why

2675
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:27,360
secure passwords are a must

2676
01:58:27,360 --> 01:58:28,800
that's really interesting andrea do you

2677
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:31,520
do you have thoughts on on that issue on

2678
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:33,199
that question of you know we could have

2679
01:58:33,199 --> 01:58:34,960
really strong passwords but if we're

2680
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:37,040
sharing them for example or if we're

2681
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:39,199
engaging in other kinds of behaviors

2682
01:58:39,199 --> 01:58:40,480
that are insecure i mean it doesn't

2683
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:41,920
really matter like how do we measure how

2684
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:45,520
do we think about that in a holistic way

2685
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:46,639
well

2686
01:58:46,639 --> 01:58:49,840
if if i i made myself a utopian okay

2687
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:53,360
i'll say i'll say um that

2688
01:58:53,360 --> 01:58:55,840
like i i introduced the subject saying

2689
01:58:55,840 --> 01:58:58,000
that it's impossible for a human to

2690
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,800
remember all those passwords right but

2691
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,800
the the

2692
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:04,639
the idea behind the passwords is

2693
01:59:04,639 --> 01:59:06,159
excellent it's just that it comes with

2694
01:59:06,159 --> 01:59:09,119
consequences so um of course we can find

2695
01:59:09,119 --> 01:59:12,480
solution as you say uh but

2696
01:59:12,480 --> 01:59:15,199
in a utopian society we might also just

2697
01:59:15,199 --> 01:59:17,199
rethink the whole thing

2698
01:59:17,199 --> 01:59:19,920
and just start from scratch and we we

2699
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:22,639
see that appearing a lot more

2700
01:59:22,639 --> 01:59:25,840
like with um alternative of passwords

2701
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:28,320
like a recognition

2702
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:30,639
two identification factor as an example

2703
01:59:30,639 --> 01:59:32,960
or uh things like that so

2704
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:35,760
yes it it is we we are starting to think

2705
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:38,000
uh differently and this i think this is

2706
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:38,960
the

2707
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:41,280
like the future how it should be it

2708
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:42,560
should be

2709
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:45,760
like technology should be uh reflected

2710
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:47,679
for a human to use them and not for a

2711
01:59:47,679 --> 01:59:49,520
computer to use them

2712
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:51,679
i i really like that it's sort of um

2713
01:59:51,679 --> 01:59:53,360
like there's one of the questions in the

2714
01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:55,520
chat which is basically like what's your

2715
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:57,599
take on passwordless login is that the

2716
01:59:57,599 --> 01:59:59,360
solution to the pat like our password's

2717
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:00,960
dead i think it's a really interesting

2718
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:01,840
question because it kind of goes to

2719
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:04,239
philips comment also about um like the

2720
02:00:04,239 --> 02:00:05,960
role of centralization and

2721
02:00:05,960 --> 02:00:08,239
intermediaries right so it's it's one

2722
02:00:08,239 --> 02:00:09,760
thing to go like well people are really

2723
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:12,159
bad at remembering passwords so uh we'll

2724
02:00:12,159 --> 02:00:14,560
let our browsers do it or we'll let the

2725
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:17,119
password manager do it or we'll let our

2726
02:00:17,119 --> 02:00:19,679
retinas be our passwords but

2727
02:00:19,679 --> 02:00:20,960
you know all of that comes with

2728
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:22,560
different trade-offs do you have a do

2729
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:24,800
you have a take on is the password dead

2730
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:27,360
should the password be dead

2731
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:30,400
what and if if not that then what

2732
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:31,440
yeah

2733
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:33,280
yes i think it should be dead because it

2734
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:35,119
should not

2735
02:00:35,119 --> 02:00:37,119
just because the way it is it was

2736
02:00:37,119 --> 02:00:39,920
invented uh but i think it was a great

2737
02:00:39,920 --> 02:00:42,239
solution it is a great solution and of

2738
02:00:42,239 --> 02:00:44,639
course there's uh

2739
02:00:44,639 --> 02:00:46,719
things to help and solutions for that

2740
02:00:46,719 --> 02:00:48,960
like password managers and everything

2741
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:51,599
and we should all use that right uh but

2742
02:00:51,599 --> 02:00:54,080
most people don't my mother doesn't know

2743
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:56,480
that it exists for example and she

2744
02:00:56,480 --> 02:00:58,800
writes every one of her passwords on a

2745
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:01,040
sheep um so

2746
02:01:01,040 --> 02:01:03,599
no i i just think yeah the future

2747
02:01:03,599 --> 02:01:05,599
in the future there's no password i'm

2748
02:01:05,599 --> 02:01:06,840
i'm

2749
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:09,360
positive maybe i can have something with

2750
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:11,599
that uh so there

2751
02:01:11,599 --> 02:01:12,639
uh

2752
02:01:12,639 --> 02:01:14,159
i think there's a lot of bad password

2753
02:01:14,159 --> 02:01:16,560
policies going like around in

2754
02:01:16,560 --> 02:01:21,360
enterprises and and everywhere uh where

2755
02:01:21,360 --> 02:01:22,960
like we know how to make good passwords

2756
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:24,480
that are easy to remember yeah right you

2757
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:26,000
just take a long list of words you throw

2758
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:27,840
some dices and you and you select the

2759
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:29,679
ones that that are

2760
02:01:29,679 --> 02:01:32,159
that are chosen by the dice

2761
02:01:32,159 --> 02:01:34,239
uh but of course all of these policies

2762
02:01:34,239 --> 02:01:36,320
they force us to ask as the special

2763
02:01:36,320 --> 02:01:39,280
characters and numbers and such so

2764
02:01:39,280 --> 02:01:40,960
that makes for passwords that are hard

2765
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:43,040
to remember and there's also

2766
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:45,040
a bit of a hierarchy right our passwords

2767
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:46,480
if i

2768
02:01:46,480 --> 02:01:48,080
if i have to use a really complex

2769
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:50,080
password to unlock my computer every 15

2770
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:52,800
minutes when i walk away then i'm gonna

2771
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:54,639
be tempted to reuse the same one over

2772
02:01:54,639 --> 02:01:56,239
over and over again and just increment

2773
02:01:56,239 --> 02:01:57,920
it

2774
02:01:57,920 --> 02:02:00,639
so so you can have a really strong

2775
02:02:00,639 --> 02:02:02,800
password for some uses but some other

2776
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:05,280
uses just a key code should be short

2777
02:02:05,280 --> 02:02:07,440
suffice

2778
02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:08,880
yeah i think it that also sort of

2779
02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:11,360
reminds me of um you know the point you

2780
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:14,000
made earlier about user behavior like um

2781
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,320
i i actually

2782
02:02:16,320 --> 02:02:18,080
i texted somebody about a surprise party

2783
02:02:18,080 --> 02:02:19,360
they weren't supposed to know about

2784
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:20,960
using signal and i feel like it's like

2785
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:22,880
the perfect example of you know

2786
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:24,639
world-class encryption encryption

2787
02:02:24,639 --> 02:02:27,679
technology and xero opsec and i think

2788
02:02:27,679 --> 02:02:28,560
um

2789
02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:30,239
you know and so there's only so much

2790
02:02:30,239 --> 02:02:32,960
solving the human factor that we can do

2791
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:35,440
on the technical end um we're supposed

2792
02:02:35,440 --> 02:02:38,239
to wrap up in in in five six minutes um

2793
02:02:38,239 --> 02:02:39,920
i want to kind of circle back to to

2794
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:40,880
michael

2795
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:42,320
um

2796
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:43,360
you know and it's interesting too

2797
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:44,719
because there's actually questions about

2798
02:02:44,719 --> 02:02:46,400
the the right to be forgotten as a

2799
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:47,599
policy

2800
02:02:47,599 --> 02:02:49,840
question or as a legal question and i

2801
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:52,239
think that there's a a really neat

2802
02:02:52,239 --> 02:02:54,639
intersection between this government's

2803
02:02:54,639 --> 02:02:57,280
approach to media policy and also this

2804
02:02:57,280 --> 02:02:59,280
online harm stuff which is you know

2805
02:02:59,280 --> 02:03:01,920
ultimately coming down to the theme that

2806
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:02,800
it's

2807
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:05,679
up to the state to set up institutions

2808
02:03:05,679 --> 02:03:09,119
to remove certain kinds of content

2809
02:03:09,119 --> 02:03:12,400
from the internet uh whether that is

2810
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:14,480
information that is in breach of privacy

2811
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:16,960
laws or information that might be

2812
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:19,679
harmful or information that is uh you

2813
02:03:19,679 --> 02:03:21,360
know increasingly in the online harm's

2814
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:23,280
content what you know what what we often

2815
02:03:23,280 --> 02:03:25,599
call awful but lawful so things that are

2816
02:03:25,599 --> 02:03:27,599
offensive or perhaps insensitive but not

2817
02:03:27,599 --> 02:03:29,679
not strictly speaking criminal or

2818
02:03:29,679 --> 02:03:32,400
illegal content um i'm wondering if

2819
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:35,360
if you see um

2820
02:03:35,360 --> 02:03:37,599
when you think about these issues

2821
02:03:37,599 --> 02:03:40,000
do you think first about the sort of

2822
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:41,920
removal mechanism and framework or do

2823
02:03:41,920 --> 02:03:43,599
you think about the type of harm first

2824
02:03:43,599 --> 02:03:45,520
or the the type of right being invoked

2825
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:47,840
and how do you think policymakers and

2826
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:49,119
technologists should think about those

2827
02:03:49,119 --> 02:03:51,440
issues

2828
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:53,760
another really good question

2829
02:03:53,760 --> 02:03:56,719
i mean i think i think the way the

2830
02:03:56,719 --> 02:03:58,320
the government and policymakers have

2831
02:03:58,320 --> 02:04:00,480
been thinking about it is they see a

2832
02:04:00,480 --> 02:04:02,000
harm and i mentioned you know the

2833
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,159
mckenna example during my talk they see

2834
02:04:04,159 --> 02:04:05,280
a harm

2835
02:04:05,280 --> 02:04:06,800
and they think that something

2836
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:09,119
and they believe that it falls to them

2837
02:04:09,119 --> 02:04:11,599
to fix it and

2838
02:04:11,599 --> 02:04:14,320
their view would be the intermediaries

2839
02:04:14,320 --> 02:04:15,920
the platforms and a fair you know pretty

2840
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:18,159
centralized as we've heard world um

2841
02:04:18,159 --> 02:04:19,840
either don't have the incentives to do

2842
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:21,760
it are inconsistent in how they're doing

2843
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:24,480
it or just aren't doing it and so

2844
02:04:24,480 --> 02:04:26,000
their view would be if they're not

2845
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,320
willing to step up then we are then it's

2846
02:04:28,320 --> 02:04:30,560
incumbent on us to as us as the

2847
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:32,719
government to take that position and to

2848
02:04:32,719 --> 02:04:34,320
do something about it

2849
02:04:34,320 --> 02:04:36,159
i think that there

2850
02:04:36,159 --> 02:04:38,400
i think that there has been less

2851
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:39,280
sort of

2852
02:04:39,280 --> 02:04:43,119
analysis or or even bringing on board

2853
02:04:43,119 --> 02:04:45,599
the costs associated with

2854
02:04:45,599 --> 02:04:47,280
taking some of those policy approaches

2855
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:48,880
so freedom of expression of course is an

2856
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:51,840
obvious example um building in

2857
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:54,159
surveillance infrastructures in the name

2858
02:04:54,159 --> 02:04:55,920
of solving these issues or blocking

2859
02:04:55,920 --> 02:04:58,000
infrastructures in the name of solving

2860
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,320
these issues there's been little by in

2861
02:05:00,320 --> 02:05:02,960
the way of seeking to think through well

2862
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:04,480
what does that mean

2863
02:05:04,480 --> 02:05:07,520
if for example you you tell every major

2864
02:05:07,520 --> 02:05:09,840
internet provider in the country we want

2865
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:11,760
to ensure that you've got

2866
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:14,320
uh blocking capabilities and we will set

2867
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:16,960
up a system whereby you must respond to

2868
02:05:16,960 --> 02:05:19,280
our blocking orders

2869
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:21,199
immediately or in a short period of time

2870
02:05:21,199 --> 02:05:23,520
and they could say hey that's going to

2871
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:26,079
solve this particular harm

2872
02:05:26,079 --> 02:05:28,480
without i think enough thinking about

2873
02:05:28,480 --> 02:05:30,480
what are the new harms that you're

2874
02:05:30,480 --> 02:05:32,239
effectively creating

2875
02:05:32,239 --> 02:05:34,960
in the process

2876
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:36,400
yeah i think that's really interesting

2877
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:38,719
and maybe to like wear my citizen lab

2878
02:05:38,719 --> 02:05:40,639
hat for a second i think that there's

2879
02:05:40,639 --> 02:05:42,719
really like the way we talk about these

2880
02:05:42,719 --> 02:05:44,480
issues has become so much more

2881
02:05:44,480 --> 02:05:45,599
politically

2882
02:05:45,599 --> 02:05:46,880
sophisticated and it's like the

2883
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:48,719
government hasn't caught up it's sort of

2884
02:05:48,719 --> 02:05:50,400
like we need a grand unified theory of

2885
02:05:50,400 --> 02:05:51,760
bad stuff on the internet and how to

2886
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:54,639
take it down and um like

2887
02:05:54,639 --> 02:05:56,719
the the politics the theory the

2888
02:05:56,719 --> 02:05:58,480
discourse around and the law has moved

2889
02:05:58,480 --> 02:06:00,719
on from that because we understand that

2890
02:06:00,719 --> 02:06:02,880
if we look at the evidence

2891
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:05,280
when you build technical infrastructure

2892
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:06,639
to remove

2893
02:06:06,639 --> 02:06:08,320
quote unquote harmful content in almost

2894
02:06:08,320 --> 02:06:10,560
all cases we see that the content that

2895
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:12,960
actually gets removed is is

2896
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:14,880
or the people who end up

2897
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:16,880
censored and surveilled and monitored

2898
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:18,320
and policed as a result of these kinds

2899
02:06:18,320 --> 02:06:19,920
of interventions are overwhelmingly

2900
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:21,520
vulnerable in marginalized people and

2901
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:22,560
i'm wondering if you have a thought on

2902
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:25,199
that yeah no i i i think obviously i

2903
02:06:25,199 --> 02:06:26,719
think you're absolutely right you know i

2904
02:06:26,719 --> 02:06:28,239
think the government was

2905
02:06:28,239 --> 02:06:30,560
frankly shocked to see some of those

2906
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:33,199
very vulnerable groups come forward as

2907
02:06:33,199 --> 02:06:35,280
part of as part of that online harms

2908
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:37,280
consultation and make the exact point

2909
02:06:37,280 --> 02:06:39,040
that you just made to say that we know

2910
02:06:39,040 --> 02:06:40,800
that you're out there with policies that

2911
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:43,040
are supposedly designed to protect us

2912
02:06:43,040 --> 02:06:45,840
but what you need to understand is that

2913
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:47,520
some of your proposals are actually

2914
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:50,079
going to put us at risk in in new ways

2915
02:06:50,079 --> 02:06:51,679
or additional ways

2916
02:06:51,679 --> 02:06:53,040
and that you haven't thought through all

2917
02:06:53,040 --> 02:06:54,960
those policies and i don't think that

2918
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:56,719
but that there is any doubt

2919
02:06:56,719 --> 02:06:59,280
that there's been a failure to sort of

2920
02:06:59,280 --> 02:07:01,280
see what some of those proposals are and

2921
02:07:01,280 --> 02:07:03,599
amplify them into a global context and

2922
02:07:03,599 --> 02:07:06,239
see what they might mean so when twitter

2923
02:07:06,239 --> 02:07:07,760
comes around and says you know what some

2924
02:07:07,760 --> 02:07:09,920
of these proposals look a lot like what

2925
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:12,639
we deal with in china north korea and

2926
02:07:12,639 --> 02:07:13,840
iran

2927
02:07:13,840 --> 02:07:15,840
the immediate response which they did

2928
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:18,239
the say the immediate response to kenyan

2929
02:07:18,239 --> 02:07:20,639
government is how dare you say that we

2930
02:07:20,639 --> 02:07:23,599
are quite clearly not china north korea

2931
02:07:23,599 --> 02:07:26,079
and iran and we're not from a democratic

2932
02:07:26,079 --> 02:07:28,880
perspective but they don't seem to fully

2933
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:31,920
appreciate that when you start proposing

2934
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:35,199
blocking solutions without due process

2935
02:07:35,199 --> 02:07:37,280
you're you're setting yourself up as a

2936
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:39,199
model for those jurisdictions and those

2937
02:07:39,199 --> 02:07:41,199
jurisdictions to say hey if this was

2938
02:07:41,199 --> 02:07:43,040
good enough for canada what's the

2939
02:07:43,040 --> 02:07:44,719
difference and while we may have some

2940
02:07:44,719 --> 02:07:46,960
safeguards those countries don't it's

2941
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:48,400
just not the company we want to be

2942
02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:51,440
keeping in in any way shape or form

2943
02:07:51,440 --> 02:07:53,679
yeah that's that's that's really helpful

2944
02:07:53,679 --> 02:07:56,320
okay with our last couple minutes um

2945
02:07:56,320 --> 02:07:58,239
this is an exercise i like to do with

2946
02:07:58,239 --> 02:08:00,000
like pretty much anyone who thinks a lot

2947
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,920
about the internet and all three of you

2948
02:08:01,920 --> 02:08:03,040
do

2949
02:08:03,040 --> 02:08:04,560
um

2950
02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:05,760
i want to like bring you back to like

2951
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:08,000
your earliest memories of using the

2952
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:09,360
internet and all of you are maybe at a

2953
02:08:09,360 --> 02:08:11,199
slightly different generational place

2954
02:08:11,199 --> 02:08:12,960
there and so i think that that's that's

2955
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:15,520
great like

2956
02:08:15,520 --> 02:08:18,560
what was magical about that internet to

2957
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:20,560
you what what was like what was the

2958
02:08:20,560 --> 02:08:22,079
possibility and this is like maybe

2959
02:08:22,079 --> 02:08:23,440
something that people in the audience

2960
02:08:23,440 --> 02:08:25,199
are thinking about too and like if you

2961
02:08:25,199 --> 02:08:26,719
could

2962
02:08:26,719 --> 02:08:28,960
if you could make our internet the one

2963
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:31,440
we have today more like that

2964
02:08:31,440 --> 02:08:33,280
the thing that captured you

2965
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:35,760
um or that those first memories or if

2966
02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:37,199
you could wave a magic wand like what

2967
02:08:37,199 --> 02:08:39,440
would you change whether it's technical

2968
02:08:39,440 --> 02:08:41,840
or political or legal

2969
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:44,639
um i don't know yeah the internet you've

2970
02:08:44,639 --> 02:08:46,079
always wanted

2971
02:08:46,079 --> 02:08:47,760
we'll start with michael we'll go in

2972
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:50,079
order thanks for that we're i'm gonna

2973
02:08:50,079 --> 02:08:51,199
start from the early days of the

2974
02:08:51,199 --> 02:08:53,280
internet um

2975
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:55,280
so well as also i mean i'll tell you

2976
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:58,000
that that my first i i have two memories

2977
02:08:58,000 --> 02:08:59,599
but the the first one where i was

2978
02:08:59,599 --> 02:09:02,320
actually using it uh i was a law

2979
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:04,560
professor at dalhousie

2980
02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:07,360
in the mid-1990s i was pretty young uh

2981
02:09:07,360 --> 02:09:09,280
at the time and

2982
02:09:09,280 --> 02:09:10,880
i mean it's just so geeky but i was

2983
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:12,800
writing a piece on

2984
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:15,520
um some government legislation back in

2985
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:17,119
ontario and

2986
02:09:17,119 --> 02:09:19,840
you know i remember being able to go on

2987
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:22,560
netscape navigator and

2988
02:09:22,560 --> 02:09:24,239
being able to access one of these

2989
02:09:24,239 --> 02:09:26,560
documents and and i thought this was

2990
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:28,560
just unbelievable i was accustomed to

2991
02:09:28,560 --> 02:09:30,239
going down to the library and waiting

2992
02:09:30,239 --> 02:09:31,679
for it and maybe it shows up and maybe

2993
02:09:31,679 --> 02:09:34,400
it doesn't or interlibrary loans i don't

2994
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:36,960
know what that stuff is and the fact was

2995
02:09:36,960 --> 02:09:38,400
that i just had to press a button and

2996
02:09:38,400 --> 02:09:40,639
that document was there which you know

2997
02:09:40,639 --> 02:09:42,159
obviously by today's standards is

2998
02:09:42,159 --> 02:09:44,320
completely unremarkable

2999
02:09:44,320 --> 02:09:47,599
but by but from the world that i grew up

3000
02:09:47,599 --> 02:09:50,000
in the idea that we had instant access

3001
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,320
to information and in this case instant

3002
02:09:52,320 --> 02:09:54,800
access in for information from from

3003
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:56,880
governments in an open and transparent

3004
02:09:56,880 --> 02:09:57,760
way

3005
02:09:57,760 --> 02:10:00,639
was truly game-changing and i changed a

3006
02:10:00,639 --> 02:10:02,800
lot of the work and research that i was

3007
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:05,040
doing at that time to focus much more on

3008
02:10:05,040 --> 02:10:06,320
the internet because you could see how

3009
02:10:06,320 --> 02:10:08,880
this would transform things

3010
02:10:08,880 --> 02:10:10,880
i think we spend our governments now

3011
02:10:10,880 --> 02:10:12,400
spend too much time

3012
02:10:12,400 --> 02:10:14,719
trying to roll back from that not

3013
02:10:14,719 --> 02:10:17,040
putting that information online

3014
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:19,679
even though they cannot taking advantage

3015
02:10:19,679 --> 02:10:22,079
of the this technology in this way

3016
02:10:22,079 --> 02:10:25,520
seeing what i saw as just this this

3017
02:10:25,520 --> 02:10:27,760
miracle of access to information is

3018
02:10:27,760 --> 02:10:29,440
somehow now a threat

3019
02:10:29,440 --> 02:10:32,079
and i wish that that our governments not

3020
02:10:32,079 --> 02:10:34,719
just in canada but elsewhere um would

3021
02:10:34,719 --> 02:10:36,800
return to so more of that embrace of

3022
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:39,360
what that more open instant access to

3023
02:10:39,360 --> 02:10:40,880
information

3024
02:10:40,880 --> 02:10:42,800
means for society no matter what your

3025
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:45,520
area of interest might be

3026
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:48,719
andrea i think you're next

3027
02:10:49,360 --> 02:10:52,560
yeah so i have a baby face but my early

3028
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:54,079
memory is

3029
02:10:54,079 --> 02:10:56,800
like it's still uh with the internet

3030
02:10:56,800 --> 02:10:58,000
with the

3031
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,560
with the telephone cable okay so yes i

3032
02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:02,719
was born um

3033
02:11:02,719 --> 02:11:03,760
and

3034
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:06,719
so my earliest memory is that you know

3035
02:11:06,719 --> 02:11:08,639
because we have

3036
02:11:08,639 --> 02:11:11,280
i had to use the internet when nothing

3037
02:11:11,280 --> 02:11:13,360
was happening in the house because you

3038
02:11:13,360 --> 02:11:15,520
know if if my mother had to make a call

3039
02:11:15,520 --> 02:11:17,199
or if like you know

3040
02:11:17,199 --> 02:11:20,800
so it was always calm moment that when i

3041
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:24,000
was on on the internet and i was

3042
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:27,119
searching for like definitions of things

3043
02:11:27,119 --> 02:11:28,800
you know and no

3044
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:30,960
no no idea why i become a researcher

3045
02:11:30,960 --> 02:11:33,119
right but it was like

3046
02:11:33,119 --> 02:11:35,040
like definitions are in the dictionary

3047
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:37,199
but this was like definition of ideas

3048
02:11:37,199 --> 02:11:40,480
and i i and i love to go search for for

3049
02:11:40,480 --> 02:11:44,239
things and um it was so in calm moment

3050
02:11:44,239 --> 02:11:45,840
and today

3051
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:49,280
there's this idea of of the internet is

3052
02:11:49,280 --> 02:11:51,760
is a dangerous place right

3053
02:11:51,760 --> 02:11:53,840
so i wish

3054
02:11:53,840 --> 02:11:56,560
just that we could feel

3055
02:11:56,560 --> 02:11:59,599
this way again in the future so i'll

3056
02:11:59,599 --> 02:12:02,480
continue my research about the offenders

3057
02:12:02,480 --> 02:12:04,560
and the ways to protect

3058
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:08,800
users more effectively yeah

3059
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:10,800
that's sad yeah the internet is

3060
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:13,679
everywhere all the time fast and

3061
02:12:13,679 --> 02:12:16,960
stressful and um yeah a com a calmer

3062
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:20,960
gentler internet i'm ready for it um

3063
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:22,320
you get the last word on this one and

3064
02:12:22,320 --> 02:12:24,239
then we'll wrap so it's it's far from my

3065
02:12:24,239 --> 02:12:26,079
first experience with the internet but

3066
02:12:26,079 --> 02:12:28,000
it's my first experience with the the

3067
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,239
complexity of the web so i was in uh in

3068
02:12:30,239 --> 02:12:33,199
sejap and and we had a professor who

3069
02:12:33,199 --> 02:12:35,840
who had this gmail account he couldn't

3070
02:12:35,840 --> 02:12:38,079
get he couldn't access gmail from from

3071
02:12:38,079 --> 02:12:40,639
the university of campus where he where

3072
02:12:40,639 --> 02:12:42,800
he teaches and so

3073
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:45,840
for for our end of end of semester

3074
02:12:45,840 --> 02:12:48,320
project he acted he asked us to do to do

3075
02:12:48,320 --> 02:12:50,560
a kind of a proxy right we would we

3076
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:53,520
would write uh it was in php and we

3077
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:54,480
would

3078
02:12:54,480 --> 02:12:55,679
load up

3079
02:12:55,679 --> 02:12:57,840
gmail or google or something and and

3080
02:12:57,840 --> 02:12:59,119
just

3081
02:12:59,119 --> 02:13:02,239
like change all of the all of the load

3082
02:13:02,239 --> 02:13:04,400
all of the elements and then change all

3083
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:05,440
of the

3084
02:13:05,440 --> 02:13:08,000
the hrefs to the point uh to our own

3085
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:11,040
address so that we would just redraw the

3086
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:13,199
the page to the

3087
02:13:13,199 --> 02:13:14,560
so that it could be accessed from a

3088
02:13:14,560 --> 02:13:16,639
different address and

3089
02:13:16,639 --> 02:13:18,719
and of course uh

3090
02:13:18,719 --> 02:13:20,480
back then my impression of the internet

3091
02:13:20,480 --> 02:13:22,079
was that everything was static right you

3092
02:13:22,079 --> 02:13:24,000
have html code or you have php that

3093
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:25,520
renders something and then you receive

3094
02:13:25,520 --> 02:13:27,440
it but of course nowadays everything is

3095
02:13:27,440 --> 02:13:30,400
dynamic you have a javascript just

3096
02:13:30,400 --> 02:13:32,960
generating all the content on your page

3097
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:35,760
and that was my first um

3098
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:36,960
my first

3099
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:39,360
contact with this this new this new

3100
02:13:39,360 --> 02:13:41,440
internet beginning with gmail and and

3101
02:13:41,440 --> 02:13:45,840
all of these other other products

3102
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:47,599
cool that's great

3103
02:13:47,599 --> 02:13:49,599
um i think we're gonna wrap in the

3104
02:13:49,599 --> 02:13:51,440
interest of time and we're only five

3105
02:13:51,440 --> 02:13:53,199
minutes behind which is extraordinary

3106
02:13:53,199 --> 02:13:55,440
good job everyone um

3107
02:13:55,440 --> 02:13:57,760

presenters today um i learned so much

3109
02:14:00,159 --> 02:14:02,239
from each of you the questions were

3110
02:14:02,239 --> 02:14:03,920
great i tried to synthesize them in the

3111
02:14:03,920 --> 02:14:06,159
most cogent ways i could there's lots

3112

all right good afternoon

3119
02:14:22,960 --> 02:14:24,880
let's just wait for the slides to to

3120
02:14:24,880 --> 02:14:27,840
come up

3121
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:31,119
cool so i super happy to be here i

3122
02:14:31,119 --> 02:14:33,280
endorsed every uh everyone who

3123
02:14:33,280 --> 02:14:34,880
previously were on stage saying how

3124
02:14:34,880 --> 02:14:37,440
great it is to see people face to face

3125
02:14:37,440 --> 02:14:38,320
um

3126
02:14:38,320 --> 02:14:40,880
so before we start full disclosure

3127
02:14:40,880 --> 02:14:43,520
i've never seen a real air gap network

3128
02:14:43,520 --> 02:14:44,639
in my life

3129
02:14:44,639 --> 02:14:47,199
but in my mind it looks really just like

3130
02:14:47,199 --> 02:14:49,199
in this picture

3131
02:14:49,199 --> 02:14:52,000
so a small castle isolated cut off from

3132
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,320
the internet and used to protect the

3133
02:14:54,320 --> 02:14:56,560
most sensitive stuff

3134
02:14:56,560 --> 02:14:59,280
top secret documents power grids maybe

3135
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:02,079
nuclear centrifuges

3136
02:15:02,079 --> 02:15:04,719
and whenever we analyze a malware that

3137
02:15:04,719 --> 02:15:07,440
is designed to attack such network i'm

3138
02:15:07,440 --> 02:15:08,880
not going to lie there's a little bit of

3139
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:10,560
adrenaline rush

3140
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:12,239
because we know we're looking at a tool

3141
02:15:12,239 --> 02:15:14,800
that the threat actor designed to attack

3142
02:15:14,800 --> 02:15:15,840
something

3143
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:17,360
of great value

3144
02:15:17,360 --> 02:15:19,520
and something that probably went

3145
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:23,599
unnoticed for too long so um yeah so i'm

3146
02:15:23,599 --> 02:15:25,920
alexi uh with facundo we'll be talking

3147
02:15:25,920 --> 02:15:26,960
about

3148
02:15:26,960 --> 02:15:28,000
um

3149
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,320
how threat actors have been attacking

3150
02:15:30,320 --> 02:15:33,119
air gap networks uh with malware

3151
02:15:33,119 --> 02:15:35,440
specifically built to operate in these

3152
02:15:35,440 --> 02:15:38,320
very restricted environments

3153
02:15:38,320 --> 02:15:40,560
and you'd think such malware would be

3154
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:43,599
pretty rare right which is kind of true

3155
02:15:43,599 --> 02:15:45,679
but in 2020 alone

3156
02:15:45,679 --> 02:15:48,000
four previously unknown frameworks were

3157
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,960
uncovered and that's what prompted us to

3158
02:15:50,960 --> 02:15:54,239
revisit that specific class of malware

3159
02:15:54,239 --> 02:15:56,639
and put all the known

3160
02:15:56,639 --> 02:15:59,119
frameworks in perspective and see

3161
02:15:59,119 --> 02:16:01,040
how they work and if we could come up

3162
02:16:01,040 --> 02:16:04,960
with effective methods to detect and to

3163
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:07,119
uh to prevent these frameworks for from

3164
02:16:07,119 --> 02:16:09,040
from succeeding

3165
02:16:09,040 --> 02:16:10,719
and we actually published a very

3166
02:16:10,719 --> 02:16:13,280
thorough white paper on uh our corporate

3167
02:16:13,280 --> 02:16:15,280
blog we leave security.com just a few

3168
02:16:15,280 --> 02:16:17,520
months ago so all the details are there

3169
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:19,040
and today we're going to

3170
02:16:19,040 --> 02:16:21,280
present you some of the highlights of

3171
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:24,239
that research

3172
02:16:24,239 --> 02:16:27,840
and so to do that study we had to come

3173
02:16:27,840 --> 02:16:30,000
up with a definition of what constitutes

3174
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,080
a malware built to target air gap

3175
02:16:32,080 --> 02:16:34,000
networks because there are no real

3176
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:35,760
definitions out there at least not from

3177
02:16:35,760 --> 02:16:37,920
the technical point of view

3178
02:16:37,920 --> 02:16:39,519
and so after a couple of weeks of back

3179
02:16:39,519 --> 02:16:42,160
and forth facundo and i agreed on that

3180
02:16:42,160 --> 02:16:43,840
specific definition

3181
02:16:43,840 --> 02:16:46,558
so we define it as a malware or a set of

3182
02:16:46,558 --> 02:16:48,879
malware components acting together so a

3183
02:16:48,879 --> 02:16:50,160
framework

3184
02:16:50,160 --> 02:16:52,478
that implements an offline covert

3185
02:16:52,478 --> 02:16:54,638
communication mechanism between an air

3186
02:16:54,638 --> 02:16:58,558
gap system and the attacker

3187
02:16:58,558 --> 02:17:00,879
and we believe it all started a little

3188
02:17:00,879 --> 02:17:03,679
over 15 years ago with the infamous

3189
02:17:03,679 --> 02:17:07,280
group called sednit also known as apt-28

3190
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:10,000
who we believe developed and used a usb

3191
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:13,760
steeler as early as in 2005.

3192
02:17:13,760 --> 02:17:16,718
and after that followed no less than 16

3193
02:17:16,718 --> 02:17:18,478
other frameworks developed by other

3194
02:17:18,478 --> 02:17:20,240
threat actors so for a grand total of

3195
02:17:20,240 --> 02:17:22,638
17.

3196
02:17:22,638 --> 02:17:25,040
a few of those 17 have been attributed

3197
02:17:25,040 --> 02:17:26,638
with a pretty high confidence to known

3198
02:17:26,638 --> 02:17:28,638
threat actors such as a dark hotel or

3199
02:17:28,638 --> 02:17:30,478
mustang panda

3200
02:17:30,478 --> 02:17:32,558
but for the others the attribution has

3201
02:17:32,558 --> 02:17:35,519
been less clear-cut or even pretty

3202
02:17:35,519 --> 02:17:36,799
controversial

3203
02:17:36,799 --> 02:17:39,200
but regardless we can state that all of

3204
02:17:39,200 --> 02:17:40,799
them are the product of nation-state

3205
02:17:40,799 --> 02:17:43,359
actors hence the title of our research

3206
02:17:43,359 --> 02:17:46,398
15 years of nation state efforts

3207
02:17:46,398 --> 02:17:48,799
and in our analysis we studied all the

3208
02:17:48,799 --> 02:17:51,760
existing reports the public reports

3209
02:17:51,760 --> 02:17:54,318
on those known frameworks and compared

3210
02:17:54,318 --> 02:17:55,120
them

3211
02:17:55,120 --> 02:17:56,718
on several properties with a focus on

3212
02:17:56,718 --> 02:17:59,840
the ones that are specifically relevant

3213
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:00,558
for

3214
02:18:00,558 --> 02:18:03,359
in air-gapped networks environment such

3215
02:18:03,359 --> 02:18:05,840
as how does the malware

3216
02:18:05,840 --> 02:18:08,240
get executed on the air gap side

3217
02:18:08,240 --> 02:18:09,920
and how does the malware establish a

3218
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:11,519
communication channel

3219
02:18:11,519 --> 02:18:13,280
between the isolated systems and the

3220
02:18:13,280 --> 02:18:15,760
attacker which is the

3221
02:18:15,760 --> 02:18:18,398
how does the malware jump the air gap

3222
02:18:18,398 --> 02:18:20,000
per se

3223
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,080
and for this we formalize the anatomy of

3224
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:24,160
air gap networks but from the malware

3225
02:18:24,160 --> 02:18:25,840
operation perspective

3226
02:18:25,840 --> 02:18:27,840
and we came up with two distinct

3227
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:29,760
categories we've got connected and

3228
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:32,080
offline frameworks so let me show you

3229
02:18:32,080 --> 02:18:34,240
how how that works

3230
02:18:34,240 --> 02:18:36,478
so most of the frameworks belong to that

3231
02:18:36,478 --> 02:18:38,718
first category connected

3232
02:18:38,718 --> 02:18:41,200
connected ones and those are built to

3233
02:18:41,200 --> 02:18:42,959
provide fully remote end-to-end

3234
02:18:42,959 --> 02:18:44,879
connectivity between

3235
02:18:44,879 --> 02:18:46,638
over the internet between the attacker

3236
02:18:46,638 --> 02:18:48,879
and the isolated systems

3237
02:18:48,879 --> 02:18:50,879
and so we'll consider a target network

3238
02:18:50,879 --> 02:18:53,120
as having two sides separated with an

3239
02:18:53,120 --> 02:18:54,240
air gap

3240
02:18:54,240 --> 02:18:56,879
so at the top you've got the connected

3241
02:18:56,879 --> 02:18:59,040
side so those are computer systems that

3242
02:18:59,040 --> 02:19:01,280
have internet connectivity and at the

3243
02:19:01,280 --> 02:19:04,080
bottom you've got the air gap side where

3244
02:19:04,080 --> 02:19:05,280
all the

3245
02:19:05,280 --> 02:19:08,000
systems cannot be reached from the

3246
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:09,519
internet that's where the attacker

3247
02:19:09,519 --> 02:19:11,679
really wants to get to

3248
02:19:11,679 --> 02:19:14,240
and that's a fairly typical setup

3249
02:19:14,240 --> 02:19:15,920
at least so i've heard

3250
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:18,160
because people working in these kind of

3251
02:19:18,160 --> 02:19:19,760
environments they still need a connected

3252
02:19:19,760 --> 02:19:21,840
system to get their emails browse and

3253
02:19:21,840 --> 02:19:24,318
net and that kind of stuff

3254
02:19:24,318 --> 02:19:26,318
and that connected system will naturally

3255
02:19:26,318 --> 02:19:28,638
be the point of entry for the attacker

3256
02:19:28,638 --> 02:19:31,760
to get inside that network

3257
02:19:31,760 --> 02:19:34,160
so now techniques used to gain access on

3258
02:19:34,160 --> 02:19:35,519
that initial

3259
02:19:35,519 --> 02:19:37,439
connected system don't really differ

3260
02:19:37,439 --> 02:19:39,519
from traditional attacks it can be email

3261
02:19:39,519 --> 02:19:42,398
based watering all attacks um

3262
02:19:42,398 --> 02:19:43,679
that's not really the

3263
02:19:43,679 --> 02:19:45,439
interesting part what's interesting is

3264
02:19:45,439 --> 02:19:46,879
the type of payload that will be

3265
02:19:46,879 --> 02:19:49,280
deployed on that system

3266
02:19:49,280 --> 02:19:51,200
and

3267
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:53,520
one thing that that payload will do that

3268
02:19:53,520 --> 02:19:55,760
is specific to air gap environment is it

3269
02:19:55,760 --> 02:19:57,760
will wait for a usb drive to be plugged

3270
02:19:57,760 --> 02:20:00,160
in the system and it will weaponize it

3271
02:20:00,160 --> 02:20:02,319
just like a usb worm actually and that

3272
02:20:02,319 --> 02:20:05,120
will mean uh two things first it will

3273
02:20:05,120 --> 02:20:07,520
copy the malware meant to be executed on

3274
02:20:07,520 --> 02:20:09,120
the airgap side

3275
02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:10,560
and there will also be some sort of

3276
02:20:10,560 --> 02:20:12,960
execution vector that will trigger the

3277
02:20:12,960 --> 02:20:14,800
execution of the malware

3278
02:20:14,800 --> 02:20:17,760
it could be an exploit decoy documents

3279
02:20:17,760 --> 02:20:19,760
or something else and faculty will get

3280
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:21,680
into more details about that specific

3281
02:20:21,680 --> 02:20:24,640
part uh in just a few moments

3282
02:20:24,640 --> 02:20:26,319
and so then when the drive the

3283
02:20:26,319 --> 02:20:28,640
weaponized drive gets inserted in the

3284
02:20:28,640 --> 02:20:31,200
air gap system that's when the execution

3285
02:20:31,200 --> 02:20:33,040
vector will be triggered and the malware

3286
02:20:33,040 --> 02:20:34,640
will be deployed

3287
02:20:34,640 --> 02:20:37,120
and that malware will usually

3288
02:20:37,120 --> 02:20:38,160
do

3289
02:20:38,160 --> 02:20:39,760
some automated stuff like doing some

3290
02:20:39,760 --> 02:20:41,359
reconnaissance collecting information

3291
02:20:41,359 --> 02:20:43,120
about the environment the host

3292
02:20:43,120 --> 02:20:45,200
environment the network environment it

3293
02:20:45,200 --> 02:20:47,200
will collect files that

3294
02:20:47,200 --> 02:20:48,800
the attacker wants

3295
02:20:48,800 --> 02:20:50,399
a copy of

3296
02:20:50,399 --> 02:20:52,880
and it will store all that data

3297
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:56,160
in on the usb drive in a very covert way

3298
02:20:56,160 --> 02:20:58,960
and that's where the data exfiltration

3299
02:20:58,960 --> 02:21:01,840
from the air gap system happens

3300
02:21:01,840 --> 02:21:03,040
um

3301
02:21:03,040 --> 02:21:04,560
and again

3302
02:21:04,560 --> 02:21:06,240
faku will give you some some pretty cool

3303
02:21:06,240 --> 02:21:08,399
details about how that data gets copied

3304
02:21:08,399 --> 02:21:10,399
on the drive and and

3305
02:21:10,399 --> 02:21:12,960
and the techniques so that this it

3306
02:21:12,960 --> 02:21:14,560
doesn't get

3307
02:21:14,560 --> 02:21:17,040
detected at all

3308
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:18,720
but now the data leaving the air gap

3309
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:21,040
system onto the usb drive is one part

3310
02:21:21,040 --> 02:21:23,120
but the data still needs to reach the

3311
02:21:23,120 --> 02:21:25,359
attacker right

3312
02:21:25,359 --> 02:21:27,760
and for that the drive needs to reach

3313
02:21:27,760 --> 02:21:30,399
again the first infected system the

3314
02:21:30,399 --> 02:21:32,319
connected system

3315
02:21:32,319 --> 02:21:33,200
and

3316
02:21:33,200 --> 02:21:35,600
the malware running there on top of

3317
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:37,680
weaponizing usb drives will also have

3318
02:21:37,680 --> 02:21:40,399
code to recognize a

3319
02:21:40,399 --> 02:21:42,880
drive that will contain that exfiltrated

3320
02:21:42,880 --> 02:21:46,240
data it will parse it and exfiltrate the

3321
02:21:46,240 --> 02:21:48,399
stolen data back to the internet

3322
02:21:48,399 --> 02:21:50,000
and all these steps

3323
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:51,760
usually happen automatically in most of

3324
02:21:51,760 --> 02:21:55,840
the 17 frameworks we we analyzed

3325
02:21:56,319 --> 02:21:58,880
but other frameworks will have one layer

3326
02:21:58,880 --> 02:21:59,680
of

3327
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:02,160
additional functionality and they will

3328
02:22:02,160 --> 02:22:04,080
implement a

3329
02:22:04,080 --> 02:22:06,640
totally independent protocol

3330
02:22:06,640 --> 02:22:08,640
to allow the attacker to interactively

3331
02:22:08,640 --> 02:22:10,960
exchange commands and responses with the

3332
02:22:10,960 --> 02:22:12,720
air gap systems

3333
02:22:12,720 --> 02:22:14,240
and so in these cases we'll see two

3334
02:22:14,240 --> 02:22:16,560
different protocols you'll have one

3335
02:22:16,560 --> 02:22:18,640
protocol that goes over the internet

3336
02:22:18,640 --> 02:22:20,240
between the attacker and the connected

3337
02:22:20,240 --> 02:22:21,680
system and there will be a totally

3338
02:22:21,680 --> 02:22:24,000
different protocol that goes over the

3339
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,960
usb drive to communicate between the

3340
02:22:26,960 --> 02:22:29,040
connected system and the

3341
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:30,800
air gap ones

3342
02:22:30,800 --> 02:22:31,600
and

3343
02:22:31,600 --> 02:22:33,520
you could see the connected system as

3344
02:22:33,520 --> 02:22:35,439
acting as a proxy between the attacker

3345
02:22:35,439 --> 02:22:39,520
and the real systems of value here

3346
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:41,120
in other railroad cases the attack

3347
02:22:41,120 --> 02:22:42,479
scenario is

3348
02:22:42,479 --> 02:22:44,160
actually doesn't involve any connected

3349
02:22:44,160 --> 02:22:46,000
system at all

3350
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,479
we call these offline frameworks but i

3351
02:22:48,479 --> 02:22:50,080
think of them as like mission impossible

3352
02:22:50,080 --> 02:22:51,680
frameworks because in these cases

3353
02:22:51,680 --> 02:22:54,080
everything indicates the presence of an

3354
02:22:54,080 --> 02:22:57,040
operator on the ground and that will

3355
02:22:57,040 --> 02:22:58,800
perform those critical actions such as

3356
02:22:58,800 --> 02:23:01,680
weaponizing the usb drive or even

3357
02:23:01,680 --> 02:23:03,200
physically carrying the drive and plug

3358
02:23:03,200 --> 02:23:05,840
it in the target the target systems and

3359
02:23:05,840 --> 02:23:07,760
leave with the stolen data

3360
02:23:07,760 --> 02:23:09,760
and now i'll pass the mic to facundo who

3361
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:11,439
will give you some some pretty cool

3362
02:23:11,439 --> 02:23:13,760
details on the various ttps that that we

3363
02:23:13,760 --> 02:23:15,520
observed

3364
02:23:15,520 --> 02:23:18,760
thank you

3365
02:23:22,720 --> 02:23:25,520
so as selected said we focus on the

3366
02:23:25,520 --> 02:23:28,160
malware properties that are specific to

3367
02:23:28,160 --> 02:23:31,200
attacking their gap networks

3368
02:23:31,200 --> 02:23:34,000
we divided we have divided them in three

3369
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,800
broad categories all the techniques used

3370
02:23:36,800 --> 02:23:38,720
to execute the malicious code for the

3371
02:23:38,720 --> 02:23:41,439
purpose of gaining a foothold

3372
02:23:41,439 --> 02:23:44,880
in a network or conduct a reconnaissance

3373
02:23:44,880 --> 02:23:48,479
of potential air gap systems

3374
02:23:48,479 --> 02:23:50,160
these categories are

3375
02:23:50,160 --> 02:23:52,920
automated execution

3376
02:23:52,920 --> 02:23:56,080
non-automated execution unknowingly

3377
02:23:56,080 --> 02:23:57,399
triggered

3378
02:23:57,399 --> 02:24:00,720
non-automated execution deliberately

3379
02:24:00,720 --> 02:24:03,358
performed

3380
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:07,680
so let's begin with automated execution

3381
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:08,960
exploiting

3382
02:24:08,960 --> 02:24:11,600
the remote execution vulnerabilities is

3383
02:24:11,600 --> 02:24:14,399
the most effective technique

3384
02:24:14,399 --> 02:24:16,479
to execute the malware

3385
02:24:16,479 --> 02:24:18,560
11 such vulnerabilities have been

3386
02:24:18,560 --> 02:24:20,319
discovered and patched in the last

3387
02:24:20,319 --> 02:24:21,439
decade

3388
02:24:21,439 --> 02:24:23,920
and only two have been confirmed to have

3389
02:24:23,920 --> 02:24:26,240
used in the wild

3390
02:24:26,240 --> 02:24:29,439
the most famous one is without a doubt

3391
02:24:29,439 --> 02:24:33,120
the stock set lnk exploit

3392
02:24:33,120 --> 02:24:36,000
which only requires the user to be to

3393
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,399
view a set of lnk files through the

3394
02:24:38,399 --> 02:24:40,560
windows explorer to trigger the

3395
02:24:40,560 --> 02:24:43,439
vulnerability

3396
02:24:43,439 --> 02:24:44,479
however

3397
02:24:44,479 --> 02:24:47,120
it was later discovered by kaspersky

3398
02:24:47,120 --> 02:24:50,000
researchers that equation group

3399
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,160
funny malware had

3400
02:24:52,160 --> 02:24:55,120
used the exploit even before stuxnet

3401
02:24:55,120 --> 02:24:58,000
since at least 2008

3402
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,240
and even after microsoft released a

3403
02:25:00,240 --> 02:25:02,640
patch in 2010

3404
02:25:02,640 --> 02:25:04,560
flame mini flame

3405
02:25:04,560 --> 02:25:06,319
cows malwares

3406
02:25:06,319 --> 02:25:09,040
continued to exploit it

3407
02:25:09,040 --> 02:25:11,200
but since the discovery of these

3408
02:25:11,200 --> 02:25:12,880
malwares no

3409
02:25:12,880 --> 02:25:16,080
other exploit-based automated execution

3410
02:25:16,080 --> 02:25:18,880
has ever been observed in the wild to

3411
02:25:18,880 --> 02:25:22,720
compromise our gap networks

3412
02:25:22,800 --> 02:25:25,439
for the next category we'll take a step

3413
02:25:25,439 --> 02:25:28,240
back from the complexity of exploiting

3414
02:25:28,240 --> 02:25:30,319
software vulnerabilities and focus

3415
02:25:30,319 --> 02:25:32,399
instead on the human factor and

3416
02:25:32,399 --> 02:25:34,800
deception tricks

3417
02:25:34,800 --> 02:25:37,760
in this scenario the aim is to trick an

3418
02:25:37,760 --> 02:25:39,760
unsuspecting user

3419
02:25:39,760 --> 02:25:42,640
into executing the malicious code

3420
02:25:42,640 --> 02:25:45,760
we have observed three main techniques

3421
02:25:45,760 --> 02:25:46,720
the

3422
02:25:46,720 --> 02:25:49,120
the abuse of windows outdoor on and how

3423
02:25:49,120 --> 02:25:51,520
to play in future

3424
02:25:51,520 --> 02:25:53,760
decoy files to lure the potential

3425
02:25:53,760 --> 02:25:55,680
victims

3426
02:25:55,680 --> 02:25:57,200
and ring

3427
02:25:57,200 --> 02:25:59,680
existing files with malicious code for

3428
02:25:59,680 --> 02:26:04,560
example dark hotels retro malware uses

3429
02:26:04,560 --> 02:26:07,120
a tool that allows it to replace word

3430
02:26:07,120 --> 02:26:10,240
documents with rtf copies that contain

3431
02:26:10,240 --> 02:26:12,880
an exploit that will launch the drush

3432
02:26:12,880 --> 02:26:15,679
and on the machine

3433
02:26:16,080 --> 02:26:19,359
now at least five of the 17 frameworks

3434
02:26:19,359 --> 02:26:22,640
have abused autorun or autoplay

3435
02:26:22,640 --> 02:26:25,120
in one way or another

3436
02:26:25,120 --> 02:26:28,560
usb stealer on agent btc as well as an

3437
02:26:28,560 --> 02:26:31,520
earlier version of stocksnet

3438
02:26:31,520 --> 02:26:33,840
that implemented an autorun file that

3439
02:26:33,840 --> 02:26:36,240
contain both the executable and the

3440
02:26:36,240 --> 02:26:37,280
outer run

3441
02:26:37,280 --> 02:26:40,080
instructions

3442
02:26:40,080 --> 02:26:42,560
it disable the autoplay to force the

3443
02:26:42,560 --> 02:26:46,560
user to go to the my computer or use it

3444
02:26:46,560 --> 02:26:48,720
or use the entry in the navigation of

3445
02:26:48,720 --> 02:26:51,359
the windows explorer

3446
02:26:51,359 --> 02:26:53,920
and with the shell dll command it added

3447
02:26:53,920 --> 02:26:57,520
an additional open command

3448
02:26:57,520 --> 02:27:00,720
that disabled the autoplay

3449
02:27:00,720 --> 02:27:04,560
to force the user to oh sorry

3450
02:27:04,560 --> 02:27:06,880
set

3451
02:27:06,960 --> 02:27:09,040
an additional open command to the

3452
02:27:09,040 --> 02:27:11,920
context menu that executed stuxnet if

3453
02:27:11,920 --> 02:27:14,399
the potential victim clicks clicks on it

3454
02:27:14,399 --> 02:27:18,319
or double clicks on the drive shortcut

3455
02:27:18,319 --> 02:27:21,280
now mustang panda custom plugex malware

3456
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:23,600
uses a much simpler trick

3457
02:27:23,600 --> 02:27:26,000
it hides all the existing folders and

3458
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:27,600
drives and creates

3459
02:27:27,600 --> 02:27:31,280
an lnk files for each one pointing to

3460
02:27:31,280 --> 02:27:33,399
the malicious executable on the

3461
02:27:33,399 --> 02:27:35,600
recycle.bin folder

3462
02:27:35,600 --> 02:27:37,840
these techniques preserve the appearance

3463
02:27:37,840 --> 02:27:40,880
of the clean drive

3464
02:27:41,840 --> 02:27:45,720
just one second please

3465
02:27:53,040 --> 02:27:55,439
perhaps the techniques under this last

3466
02:27:55,439 --> 02:27:58,080
category are the most puzzling the

3467
02:27:58,080 --> 02:28:00,560
analysis indicates that the attackers

3468
02:28:00,560 --> 02:28:02,479
did not intend to trick

3469
02:28:02,479 --> 02:28:04,880
an unsuspecting user into executing the

3470
02:28:04,880 --> 02:28:07,120
malicious code

3471
02:28:07,120 --> 02:28:09,200
it appears that the concept for the

3472
02:28:09,200 --> 02:28:12,960
mission was to have a human asset

3473
02:28:12,960 --> 02:28:14,960
covertly execute the malicious

3474
02:28:14,960 --> 02:28:18,240
components in the target network

3475
02:28:18,240 --> 02:28:19,520
now

3476
02:28:19,520 --> 02:28:21,439
how do you think from a malware

3477
02:28:21,439 --> 02:28:23,840
researcher perspective

3478
02:28:23,840 --> 02:28:28,399
we cannot identify such a scenario

3479
02:28:28,399 --> 02:28:31,280
let's take the interesting case of usb

3480
02:28:31,280 --> 02:28:34,240
corporate by the apt group cycle deck

3481
02:28:34,240 --> 02:28:38,479
also known as goblin panda

3482
02:28:38,560 --> 02:28:40,399
in this case the code running on the

3483
02:28:40,399 --> 02:28:42,160
connected site responsible for

3484
02:28:42,160 --> 02:28:45,600
weaponizing the designated usb drives

3485
02:28:45,600 --> 02:28:47,760
copies the malwareman for the air gap

3486
02:28:47,760 --> 02:28:49,439
system in a hidden

3487
02:28:49,439 --> 02:28:51,439
folder on the drive

3488
02:28:51,439 --> 02:28:54,479
without any execution vector

3489
02:28:54,479 --> 02:28:56,560
so the analysis indicated that the only

3490
02:28:56,560 --> 02:28:58,960
possible way for the malware to execute

3491
02:28:58,960 --> 02:29:01,680
is if someone knows exactly where to

3492
02:29:01,680 --> 02:29:03,359
look for the malware and launch it

3493
02:29:03,359 --> 02:29:05,920
manually

3494
02:29:07,120 --> 02:29:11,439
now in 2015 we discovered a malware on a

3495
02:29:11,439 --> 02:29:13,680
mission

3496
02:29:13,680 --> 02:29:15,600
nice

3497
02:29:15,600 --> 02:29:17,920
we call it usb tiff

3498
02:29:17,920 --> 02:29:19,600
at the time we could not attribute this

3499
02:29:19,600 --> 02:29:21,680
sophisticated malware to any known

3500
02:29:21,680 --> 02:29:23,040
groups

3501
02:29:23,040 --> 02:29:25,680
it wasn't until two years later

3502
02:29:25,680 --> 02:29:28,080
when the vowel 7 leaks occurred that we

3503
02:29:28,080 --> 02:29:30,960
began to think that the malware was part

3504
02:29:30,960 --> 02:29:34,240
of the lambert's apt

3505
02:29:34,240 --> 02:29:35,280
now

3506
02:29:35,280 --> 02:29:36,960
new funding

3507
02:29:36,960 --> 02:29:39,280
helped us to narrow down the candidates

3508
02:29:39,280 --> 02:29:43,520
to an implant codenamed margarita

3509
02:29:43,520 --> 02:29:45,520
the description of the system fits

3510
02:29:45,520 --> 02:29:47,439
perfectly the scenario and the

3511
02:29:47,439 --> 02:29:52,000
capabilities implemented by usb tiff

3512
02:29:52,479 --> 02:29:54,319
the human asset

3513
02:29:54,319 --> 02:29:56,560
let's call him tom to continue the

3514
02:29:56,560 --> 02:29:58,880
mission impossible team

3515
02:29:58,880 --> 02:30:01,200
will weaponize a usb drive and create

3516
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:03,520
the circumstance on the target machine

3517
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:05,359
in which he will have to see certain

3518
02:30:05,359 --> 02:30:06,720
files

3519
02:30:06,720 --> 02:30:10,160
on the thumb drive he'll launch notepad

3520
02:30:10,160 --> 02:30:13,200
plus plus or firefall so the truecrypt

3521
02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:14,960
and the software will launch

3522
02:30:14,960 --> 02:30:18,399
in turn silently load the malware and in

3523
02:30:18,399 --> 02:30:20,080
the background it prepared all the

3524
02:30:20,080 --> 02:30:21,280
collected

3525
02:30:21,280 --> 02:30:24,720
data for exfiltration

3526
02:30:24,800 --> 02:30:27,680
now finally on that note

3527
02:30:27,680 --> 02:30:29,920
uh getting the malware to be executed on

3528
02:30:29,920 --> 02:30:33,520
the target is one part of the mission

3529
02:30:33,520 --> 02:30:36,080
the collected information needs a way to

3530
02:30:36,080 --> 02:30:38,399
leave the our gap system and safely

3531
02:30:38,399 --> 02:30:40,720
reach the attackers

3532
02:30:40,720 --> 02:30:42,399
we will now present

3533
02:30:42,399 --> 02:30:45,120
what we consider some of the coolest

3534
02:30:45,120 --> 02:30:47,040
ways the attackers have managed to

3535
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:49,920
achieve this goal

3536
02:30:50,240 --> 02:30:50,960
so

3537
02:30:50,960 --> 02:30:53,680
going back to 2008

3538
02:30:53,680 --> 02:30:56,240
finance said about too high even for

3539
02:30:56,240 --> 02:30:58,640
some of the most sophisticated malwares

3540
02:30:58,640 --> 02:31:01,280
that were discovered later but

3541
02:31:01,280 --> 02:31:03,520
possibly developed around the same time

3542
02:31:03,520 --> 02:31:05,840
and by groups with the same technical

3543
02:31:05,840 --> 02:31:08,000
proficiency

3544
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:09,920
funny is what our colleagues from

3545
02:31:09,920 --> 02:31:12,840
kaspersky dubbed the usb

3546
02:31:12,840 --> 02:31:15,359
backdoor one of the funny most

3547
02:31:15,359 --> 02:31:17,920
interesting features is that it has the

3548
02:31:17,920 --> 02:31:20,160
capability to create a hidden storage

3549
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:22,479
space in the usb drives

3550
02:31:22,479 --> 02:31:26,880
that use the fat file system

3551
02:31:27,439 --> 02:31:29,200
they achieved this by creating a

3552
02:31:29,200 --> 02:31:31,760
directory entry with a combination of

3553
02:31:31,760 --> 02:31:34,240
attributes that make it invalid for for

3554
02:31:34,240 --> 02:31:36,560
the windows parser

3555
02:31:36,560 --> 02:31:39,520
so when windows finds such a case

3556
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:41,600
the entry is ignored

3557
02:31:41,600 --> 02:31:46,000
essentially making the space invisible

3558
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:50,080
this entry contains another offset used

3559
02:31:50,080 --> 02:31:52,640
by funny to locate

3560
02:31:52,640 --> 02:31:54,880
an allocated space of almost one

3561
02:31:54,880 --> 02:31:58,640
megabyte in size which contains the

3562
02:31:58,640 --> 02:32:01,200
collected information as well as both

3563
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:03,120
commands and the result of executing

3564
02:32:03,120 --> 02:32:05,760
those commands on the target machines

3565
02:32:05,760 --> 02:32:07,760
all the modules that the attacker would

3566
02:32:07,760 --> 02:32:10,160
want to execute on the system to further

3567
02:32:10,160 --> 02:32:12,240
our main capabilities

3568
02:32:12,240 --> 02:32:15,200
on the compromise system

3569
02:32:15,200 --> 02:32:18,080
it's also worth noting that flame

3570
02:32:18,080 --> 02:32:20,080
used a similar trick by creating an

3571
02:32:20,080 --> 02:32:22,720
entry with an invalid name that windows

3572
02:32:22,720 --> 02:32:25,439
will also ignore this invalid name was

3573
02:32:25,439 --> 02:32:28,960
for uh for a special file

3574
02:32:30,160 --> 02:32:31,200
now

3575
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:33,760
ramsey is a malware that we discovered

3576
02:32:33,760 --> 02:32:37,920
in 2020 and attribute to dark hotel ipt

3577
02:32:37,920 --> 02:32:39,359
the attackers came up with a

3578
02:32:39,359 --> 02:32:41,200
decentralized way to spread the

3579
02:32:41,200 --> 02:32:43,280
collected information about the system

3580
02:32:43,280 --> 02:32:44,399
drives

3581
02:32:44,399 --> 02:32:46,880
as well as the network and other

3582
02:32:46,880 --> 02:32:50,000
removable drives

3583
02:32:50,240 --> 02:32:52,800
when ramsay is injected into a process

3584
02:32:52,800 --> 02:32:55,520
it will hook the close handle api and

3585
02:32:55,520 --> 02:32:58,000
when the hook is executed it checks the

3586
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,800
extension of the file that was opened by

3587
02:33:00,800 --> 02:33:02,640
the process

3588
02:33:02,640 --> 02:33:04,479
it is a word though if it is a word

3589
02:33:04,479 --> 02:33:06,479
document it will append

3590
02:33:06,479 --> 02:33:08,800
a special container that encapsulates

3591
02:33:08,800 --> 02:33:11,840
the collected compressed information

3592
02:33:11,840 --> 02:33:14,560
the same containers is also append to

3593
02:33:14,560 --> 02:33:17,680
every word document found in the in any

3594
02:33:17,680 --> 02:33:20,399
available drives

3595
02:33:20,399 --> 02:33:23,439
ramsey follows the same philosophy to

3596
02:33:23,439 --> 02:33:25,600
receive commands it will look for other

3597
02:33:25,600 --> 02:33:28,160
type of files which might potentially

3598
02:33:28,160 --> 02:33:30,080
have an appended container with the

3599
02:33:30,080 --> 02:33:32,160
instruction to execute

3600
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:34,640
certain modules or commands at a

3601
02:33:34,640 --> 02:33:38,800
specific target machine based on a gu id

3602
02:33:38,800 --> 02:33:42,479
that is in the container

3603
02:33:45,200 --> 02:33:47,359
all right now how to defend against

3604
02:33:47,359 --> 02:33:49,439
those those types of attacks

3605
02:33:49,439 --> 02:33:51,439
if you can remember just one thing from

3606
02:33:51,439 --> 02:33:53,520
our talk is that

3607
02:33:53,520 --> 02:33:56,640
it's always always always about usb

3608
02:33:56,640 --> 02:33:58,160
drives

3609
02:33:58,160 --> 02:34:00,880
there has been no publicly

3610
02:34:00,880 --> 02:34:03,359
reported cases of any other physical

3611
02:34:03,359 --> 02:34:06,080
layer used to communicate across air

3612
02:34:06,080 --> 02:34:07,040
gaps

3613
02:34:07,040 --> 02:34:09,359
no electromagnetic signals no acoustic

3614
02:34:09,359 --> 02:34:11,200
signals nothing is authentic like that

3615
02:34:11,200 --> 02:34:12,479
it's always

3616
02:34:12,479 --> 02:34:14,399
via usb drives

3617
02:34:14,399 --> 02:34:17,439
so how to make it harder for attackers

3618
02:34:17,439 --> 02:34:20,319
well of course disable usb ports on any

3619
02:34:20,319 --> 02:34:22,080
systems where it's not absolutely

3620
02:34:22,080 --> 02:34:24,080
necessary uh that's going to greatly

3621
02:34:24,080 --> 02:34:26,880
reduce the attack surface um but

3622
02:34:26,880 --> 02:34:28,720
for the remaining systems where usb

3623
02:34:28,720 --> 02:34:32,800
drives are have to stay enabled

3624
02:34:32,800 --> 02:34:34,720
there's a way to implement policies in

3625
02:34:34,720 --> 02:34:37,520
windows to prevent file execution when

3626
02:34:37,520 --> 02:34:40,720
they come from from removable drives

3627
02:34:40,720 --> 02:34:43,040
so that's one thing

3628
02:34:43,040 --> 02:34:44,880
and there are some more complex

3629
02:34:44,880 --> 02:34:46,640
scenarios where you could deploy some

3630
02:34:46,640 --> 02:34:49,520
sort of middle box where um

3631
02:34:49,520 --> 02:34:52,160
operators legitimate users of these

3632
02:34:52,160 --> 02:34:55,359
networks would connect usb drives um

3633
02:34:55,359 --> 02:34:56,960
back whenever they would cross the air

3634
02:34:56,960 --> 02:34:59,120
gap in any direction and that machine

3635
02:34:59,120 --> 02:35:01,280
would for example remove unwanted file

3636
02:35:01,280 --> 02:35:04,880
types such as lnk and autorun files and

3637
02:35:04,880 --> 02:35:07,600
it could perform an anti-malware scan

3638
02:35:07,600 --> 02:35:09,040
as well

3639
02:35:09,040 --> 02:35:10,720
of course we don't really expect an

3640
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:12,240
attacker on the ground to follow that

3641
02:35:12,240 --> 02:35:13,600
policy

3642
02:35:13,600 --> 02:35:15,520
but you can still put on put some

3643
02:35:15,520 --> 02:35:16,800
controls

3644
02:35:16,800 --> 02:35:19,920
someone shared with me a technique that

3645
02:35:19,920 --> 02:35:21,520
apparently is deployed

3646
02:35:21,520 --> 02:35:23,439
in different organizations where that

3647
02:35:23,439 --> 02:35:25,040
middle box would

3648
02:35:25,040 --> 02:35:27,680
also perform take a forensic image of

3649
02:35:27,680 --> 02:35:30,319
the drive and combine with some proper

3650
02:35:30,319 --> 02:35:33,600
logging on the the other systems uh it

3651
02:35:33,600 --> 02:35:35,200
would allow a ss admin for example to

3652
02:35:35,200 --> 02:35:37,200
spot some

3653
02:35:37,200 --> 02:35:39,040
some usb drive that would have been

3654
02:35:39,040 --> 02:35:40,720
inserted in a system

3655
02:35:40,720 --> 02:35:42,560
without having been sanitized first and

3656
02:35:42,560 --> 02:35:44,720
they could investigate further so there

3657
02:35:44,720 --> 02:35:46,319
are ways to to

3658
02:35:46,319 --> 02:35:50,160
to at least detect some anomalies

3659
02:35:50,479 --> 02:35:51,680
now

3660
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:55,040
keeping air gap systems updated is also

3661
02:35:55,040 --> 02:35:57,280
something that could be interesting um

3662
02:35:57,280 --> 02:36:00,160
here we see the use of zero day exploits

3663
02:36:00,160 --> 02:36:03,040
against uh air gap systems uh by

3664
02:36:03,040 --> 02:36:05,359
different frameworks so stuxnet used an

3665
02:36:05,359 --> 02:36:06,880
impressive five

3666
02:36:06,880 --> 02:36:10,960
zero days feni and brutal kangaroo two

3667
02:36:10,960 --> 02:36:12,880
each easy cheese we're not sure if it

3668
02:36:12,880 --> 02:36:14,720
was a zero day

3669
02:36:14,720 --> 02:36:16,160
but in fact

3670
02:36:16,160 --> 02:36:20,319
one days were actually more popular

3671
02:36:20,319 --> 02:36:23,359
that means that air gap networks got

3672
02:36:23,359 --> 02:36:24,720
breached by

3673
02:36:24,720 --> 02:36:27,439
um by exploitation of vulnerabilities

3674
02:36:27,439 --> 02:36:29,520
for which

3675
02:36:29,520 --> 02:36:32,160
patches were available

3676
02:36:32,160 --> 02:36:33,920
the thing is that if

3677
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:35,680
apparently some some sediments things

3678
02:36:35,680 --> 02:36:36,479
that

3679
02:36:36,479 --> 02:36:39,439
keeping an air gap a network air gap

3680
02:36:39,439 --> 02:36:42,560
will uh will protect against uh against

3681
02:36:42,560 --> 02:36:45,359
attacks but if the systems are unpatched

3682
02:36:45,359 --> 02:36:47,200
you've got some sort of like egg model

3683
02:36:47,200 --> 02:36:48,720
where you've got a very strong outer

3684
02:36:48,720 --> 02:36:49,520
shell

3685
02:36:49,520 --> 02:36:51,359
which is the air gap itself but as soon

3686
02:36:51,359 --> 02:36:53,280
as it breaks well you're you end up with

3687
02:36:53,280 --> 02:36:55,600
a with a big mess

3688
02:36:55,600 --> 02:36:59,600
so it's not it's really not ideal

3689
02:37:00,479 --> 02:37:03,920
um challenges so i just a few words on

3690
02:37:03,920 --> 02:37:07,040
the challenges of analyzing that type of

3691
02:37:07,040 --> 02:37:09,200
malware specifically

3692
02:37:09,200 --> 02:37:12,479
not only because the malware is is very

3693
02:37:12,479 --> 02:37:14,640
are usually pretty sophisticated and

3694
02:37:14,640 --> 02:37:16,800
technically advanced but it's also

3695
02:37:16,800 --> 02:37:19,439
challenging because samples are hard to

3696
02:37:19,439 --> 02:37:20,479
come by

3697
02:37:20,479 --> 02:37:21,280
um

3698
02:37:21,280 --> 02:37:23,280
air gap systems don't always run

3699
02:37:23,280 --> 02:37:25,520
endpoint production and even if they do

3700
02:37:25,520 --> 02:37:27,359
they probably don't have telemetry

3701
02:37:27,359 --> 02:37:28,880
enabled where

3702
02:37:28,880 --> 02:37:31,120
incidents of of uh

3703
02:37:31,120 --> 02:37:33,040
of suspicious files would be reported to

3704
02:37:33,040 --> 02:37:35,680
the vendor and that creates a huge blind

3705
02:37:35,680 --> 02:37:38,160
spot for uh for security vendors like

3706
02:37:38,160 --> 02:37:39,760
like us

3707
02:37:39,760 --> 02:37:42,160
and at the same time these attacks

3708
02:37:42,160 --> 02:37:44,640
happen kind of by definition in very

3709
02:37:44,640 --> 02:37:47,439
sensitive networks so victims are very

3710
02:37:47,439 --> 02:37:49,280
very unlikely to share samples with

3711
02:37:49,280 --> 02:37:51,439
external researchers and even less

3712
02:37:51,439 --> 02:37:54,160
likely to produce a public report of the

3713
02:37:54,160 --> 02:37:58,240
incident and describe what happened

3714
02:37:58,399 --> 02:38:02,000
an example of that is ramsay as fakundo

3715
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,160
mentioned that's a malware we discovered

3716
02:38:04,160 --> 02:38:07,200
in 2020 and the research started by

3717
02:38:07,200 --> 02:38:09,600
spotting a trojanized 7-zip installer on

3718
02:38:09,600 --> 02:38:10,960
virustotal

3719
02:38:10,960 --> 02:38:12,800
and we eventually so we analyzed the

3720
02:38:12,800 --> 02:38:14,800
file and we determined that it was a

3721
02:38:14,800 --> 02:38:17,280
component meant to run on the air gap

3722
02:38:17,280 --> 02:38:18,240
side

3723
02:38:18,240 --> 02:38:20,000
of a network

3724
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,240
and

3725
02:38:22,479 --> 02:38:23,520
we

3726
02:38:23,520 --> 02:38:25,439
started looking for the other component

3727
02:38:25,439 --> 02:38:27,040
so the one that would be running on a

3728
02:38:27,040 --> 02:38:30,000
connected side one that would parse

3729
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,640
the the usb drives and look for that ram

3730
02:38:32,640 --> 02:38:34,399
z container that facundo mentioned

3731
02:38:34,399 --> 02:38:35,920
before

3732
02:38:35,920 --> 02:38:37,760
and as you can see that's an actual

3733
02:38:37,760 --> 02:38:40,800
screenshot of our internal wiki

3734
02:38:40,800 --> 02:38:42,479
for two years that

3735
02:38:42,479 --> 02:38:44,479
that element has not been uh fulfilled

3736
02:38:44,479 --> 02:38:47,200
we never found that corresponding

3737
02:38:47,200 --> 02:38:49,439
sample that would that would parse the

3738
02:38:49,439 --> 02:38:51,920
the actual containers so

3739
02:38:51,920 --> 02:38:53,120
um

3740
02:38:53,120 --> 02:38:54,880
who knows maybe we'll find that sample

3741
02:38:54,880 --> 02:38:56,560
one day and we'll really understand how

3742
02:38:56,560 --> 02:38:58,160
the attackers used

3743
02:38:58,160 --> 02:39:00,399
ramsey in their attacks but until now

3744
02:39:00,399 --> 02:39:02,160
well we're not sure how everything

3745
02:39:02,160 --> 02:39:04,319
really worked

3746
02:39:04,319 --> 02:39:05,600
so that's it for us thank you for

3747
02:39:05,600 --> 02:39:07,680
attention and if you ever come across

3748
02:39:07,680 --> 02:39:10,319
some malware that you believe might be

3749
02:39:10,319 --> 02:39:12,560
built to target airguard networks feel

3750
02:39:12,560 --> 02:39:15,680
free to reach out i will assure you we

3751
02:39:15,680 --> 02:39:17,600
assure you that we'll uh handle the

3752
02:39:17,600 --> 02:39:19,280
samples with the utmost the

3753
02:39:19,280 --> 02:39:21,200
confidentiality will honor any tlp

3754
02:39:21,200 --> 02:39:24,399
designation you want to assign and thank

3755

me

3780
02:47:37,279 --> 02:47:40,720
um so let's talk about apts today we're

3781
02:47:40,720 --> 02:47:42,720
gonna specifically talk about muddy

3782
02:47:42,720 --> 02:47:45,359
water that is an iranian apt i'm just

3783
02:47:45,359 --> 02:47:47,279
gonna take a moment to share my screen

3784
02:47:47,279 --> 02:47:50,479
so that you guys can see my presentation

3785
02:47:50,479 --> 02:47:53,039
and

3786
02:47:54,080 --> 02:47:56,080
already

3787
02:47:56,080 --> 02:47:57,680
alright hopefully everyone can see my

3788
02:47:57,680 --> 02:48:00,560
presentation now good afternoon everyone

3789
02:48:00,560 --> 02:48:02,479
my name is ashir malhotra today i'm

3790
02:48:02,479 --> 02:48:04,080
going to be presenting about the muddy

3791
02:48:04,080 --> 02:48:05,840
water apt

3792
02:48:05,840 --> 02:48:07,760
my talk is titled muddy water from

3793
02:48:07,760 --> 02:48:09,040
canaries to

3794
02:48:09,040 --> 02:48:10,720
turkeys

3795
02:48:10,720 --> 02:48:12,240
before we begin for those of you that

3796
02:48:12,240 --> 02:48:14,960
don't know me i'm shir i'm a threat

3797
02:48:14,960 --> 02:48:17,840
researcher at cisco talos i specialize

3798
02:48:17,840 --> 02:48:20,000
in malware analysis threat intelligence

3799
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:21,840
and different kinds of malware detection

3800
02:48:21,840 --> 02:48:22,960
techniques

3801
02:48:22,960 --> 02:48:25,439
more recently my focus has been on

3802
02:48:25,439 --> 02:48:28,160
disclosing apt operations

3803
02:48:28,160 --> 02:48:30,160
specifically in the asians

3804
02:48:30,160 --> 02:48:32,080
in the asian continent

3805
02:48:32,080 --> 02:48:33,760
right now i'm located out of the united

3806
02:48:33,760 --> 02:48:35,840
states i'm presenting to you from

3807
02:48:35,840 --> 02:48:38,080
washington d.c

3808
02:48:38,080 --> 02:48:39,840
now this research was done in

3809
02:48:39,840 --> 02:48:43,040
collaboration with vitor vitor is also a

3810
02:48:43,040 --> 02:48:45,439
cyber security researcher at cisco talos

3811
02:48:45,439 --> 02:48:47,439
he's actually the research lead for my

3812
02:48:47,439 --> 02:48:50,160
team for europe and asia

3813
02:48:50,160 --> 02:48:51,920
vito was supposed to originally present

3814
02:48:51,920 --> 02:48:53,439
this research but unfortunately he

3815
02:48:53,439 --> 02:48:55,200
couldn't present today so

3816
02:48:55,200 --> 02:48:56,640
which is why you all are stuck with me

3817
02:48:56,640 --> 02:48:58,800
today so yeah

3818
02:48:58,800 --> 02:48:59,920
um

3819
02:48:59,920 --> 02:49:02,080
peter loves mobile malware and loves to

3820
02:49:02,080 --> 02:49:03,439
reverse engineer different kinds of

3821
02:49:03,439 --> 02:49:06,560
malware samples he's an avid apt hunter

3822
02:49:06,560 --> 02:49:08,800
and veto is located out of portugal

3823
02:49:08,800 --> 02:49:10,880
right now

3824
02:49:10,880 --> 02:49:12,800
all right let's talk about the agenda so

3825
02:49:12,800 --> 02:49:14,880
today we're gonna talk about four key

3826
02:49:14,880 --> 02:49:17,120
sections uh we're gonna introduce the

3827
02:49:17,120 --> 02:49:18,960
muddy water apt group

3828
02:49:18,960 --> 02:49:21,040
we're gonna take a look at about

3829
02:49:21,040 --> 02:49:22,720
five campaigns for that have been

3830
02:49:22,720 --> 02:49:24,640
conducted by muddy water in the past

3831
02:49:24,640 --> 02:49:26,720
year or so then we're going to talk

3832
02:49:26,720 --> 02:49:28,640
about a very novel technique that this

3833
02:49:28,640 --> 02:49:31,120
apt has started using recently

3834
02:49:31,120 --> 02:49:33,600
namely infection tracking they basically

3835
02:49:33,600 --> 02:49:35,840
use a methodology a specific technique

3836
02:49:35,840 --> 02:49:38,399
to track successful infections across

3837
02:49:38,399 --> 02:49:40,240
the set of victims and we're

3838
02:49:40,240 --> 02:49:41,840
specifically going to talk about

3839
02:49:41,840 --> 02:49:44,479
homemade tokens and canary tokens and

3840
02:49:44,479 --> 02:49:45,600
then i'm going to take a couple of

3841
02:49:45,600 --> 02:49:47,840
slides and go through the conclusions

3842
02:49:47,840 --> 02:49:50,560
and hopefully by the end of the

3843
02:49:50,560 --> 02:49:52,560
presentation you will know as much about

3844
02:49:52,560 --> 02:49:54,560
muddy water as i do so

3845
02:49:54,560 --> 02:49:56,399
fingers crossed

3846
02:49:56,399 --> 02:49:58,800
all right let's talk about muddy water

3847
02:49:58,800 --> 02:50:01,359
so what is muddy water

3848
02:50:01,359 --> 02:50:04,560
muddy water is an iranian apt group it's

3849
02:50:04,560 --> 02:50:07,920
also known as mercury or static kitten

3850
02:50:07,920 --> 02:50:09,520
very recently i think at the beginning

3851
02:50:09,520 --> 02:50:12,240
of this year it was attributed to iran's

3852
02:50:12,240 --> 02:50:14,319
history of intelligence and security the

3853
02:50:14,319 --> 02:50:16,000
mois division

3854
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,800
by the united states cyber command

3855
02:50:18,800 --> 02:50:21,680
muddy water primarily tends to target

3856
02:50:21,680 --> 02:50:22,880
entities

3857
02:50:22,880 --> 02:50:24,720
usually government entities in north

3858
02:50:24,720 --> 02:50:26,880
america europe and asia

3859
02:50:26,880 --> 02:50:28,880
and the focus of their operations is

3860
02:50:28,880 --> 02:50:31,439
primarily espionage and intellectual

3861
02:50:31,439 --> 02:50:33,760
property theft and the intention to

3862
02:50:33,760 --> 02:50:36,000
establish and maintain long-term access

3863
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,080
into their targets networks

3864
02:50:38,080 --> 02:50:39,760
we've seen some sporadic instances of

3865
02:50:39,760 --> 02:50:41,520
muddy water carrying out ransomware

3866
02:50:41,520 --> 02:50:43,439
attacks as well but that's a whole

3867
02:50:43,439 --> 02:50:45,040
different topic of discussion and we're

3868
02:50:45,040 --> 02:50:47,200
going to be covering that today

3869
02:50:47,200 --> 02:50:49,040
now we believe that muddy water is a

3870
02:50:49,040 --> 02:50:51,840
super group this is basically an

3871
02:50:51,840 --> 02:50:54,000
umbrella organization or a conglomerate

3872
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,160
of groups that consists of smaller

3873
02:50:56,160 --> 02:50:58,080
groups that focus on individual

3874
02:50:58,080 --> 02:51:01,439
geographies all throughout the world

3875
02:51:01,439 --> 02:51:04,000
that being said let's take a look at all

3876
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:05,520
the different campaigns that have been

3877
02:51:05,520 --> 02:51:08,240
conducted by muddy water over the past

3878
02:51:08,240 --> 02:51:10,560
year or so

3879
02:51:10,560 --> 02:51:11,920
so now the intention of this

3880
02:51:11,920 --> 02:51:13,920
presentation initially was to talk about

3881
02:51:13,920 --> 02:51:15,920
three key campaigns and show

3882
02:51:15,920 --> 02:51:18,560
similarities between them the first

3883
02:51:18,560 --> 02:51:20,240
campaign that we wanted to talk about

3884
02:51:20,240 --> 02:51:23,520
was uh one that started in april and

3885
02:51:23,520 --> 02:51:26,399
was carried out through august of 2021

3886
02:51:26,399 --> 02:51:28,479
this campaign specifically targeted

3887
02:51:28,479 --> 02:51:31,279
entities in armenia and pakistan

3888
02:51:31,279 --> 02:51:33,600
the second campaign that we saw muddy

3889
02:51:33,600 --> 02:51:35,840
water conduct was against turkish

3890
02:51:35,840 --> 02:51:37,680
entities and we discovered this in

3891
02:51:37,680 --> 02:51:39,840
november of 2021

3892
02:51:39,840 --> 02:51:42,479
and then there was another a third

3893
02:51:42,479 --> 02:51:44,080
campaign that was targeting a lot of

3894
02:51:44,080 --> 02:51:45,680
countries in the arabian peninsula are

3895
02:51:45,680 --> 02:51:46,960
way more prolific and way more

3896
02:51:46,960 --> 02:51:48,800
aggressive that we discovered in

3897
02:51:48,800 --> 02:51:51,200
december of 2021.

3898
02:51:51,200 --> 02:51:52,880
during the course of our research when

3899
02:51:52,880 --> 02:51:54,240
while we were tracking all three of

3900
02:51:54,240 --> 02:51:55,040
these

3901
02:51:55,040 --> 02:51:57,040
campaigns we discovered that there were

3902
02:51:57,040 --> 02:51:59,279
multiple overlaps in the ttps used

3903
02:51:59,279 --> 02:52:01,279
across all of these campaigns

3904
02:52:01,279 --> 02:52:02,880
basically a technique would be

3905
02:52:02,880 --> 02:52:04,800
introduced in one campaign it would be

3906
02:52:04,800 --> 02:52:07,120
refined and made reliable and then it

3907
02:52:07,120 --> 02:52:09,279
would be migrated to

3908
02:52:09,279 --> 02:52:10,960
another campaign that was being

3909
02:52:10,960 --> 02:52:12,800
conducted in a completely distinct and

3910
02:52:12,800 --> 02:52:16,560
different region of the world

3911
02:52:17,200 --> 02:52:19,200
it's not just the reuse of techniques

3912
02:52:19,200 --> 02:52:21,200
they observed in across these three

3913
02:52:21,200 --> 02:52:22,720
campaigns we also saw a lot of new

3914
02:52:22,720 --> 02:52:24,640
techniques being introduced as well and

3915
02:52:24,640 --> 02:52:26,640
i'm going to talk about them uh during

3916
02:52:26,640 --> 02:52:28,479
the course of uh this presentation as

3917
02:52:28,479 --> 02:52:29,840
well

3918
02:52:29,840 --> 02:52:32,000
now uh when we started looking at these

3919
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:34,160
campaigns and the more we delved into

3920
02:52:34,160 --> 02:52:35,840
these campaigns and the more research we

3921
02:52:35,840 --> 02:52:38,080
did and the more stuff we uncovered

3922
02:52:38,080 --> 02:52:40,399
uh we realized that in order to present

3923
02:52:40,399 --> 02:52:42,240
this at a

3924
02:52:42,240 --> 02:52:43,520
you know a really good conference like

3925
02:52:43,520 --> 02:52:44,720
not sec

3926
02:52:44,720 --> 02:52:46,399
we needed to go back and take a look at

3927
02:52:46,399 --> 02:52:48,160
some of the other campaigns that body

3928
02:52:48,160 --> 02:52:49,920
water had conducted in the recent years

3929
02:52:49,920 --> 02:52:50,960
as well

3930
02:52:50,960 --> 02:52:53,359
so i'm gonna talk through a timeline of

3931
02:52:53,359 --> 02:52:54,640
all the different campaigns and the

3932
02:52:54,640 --> 02:52:56,640
different attack instances in this

3933
02:52:56,640 --> 02:52:58,560
particular template

3934
02:52:58,560 --> 02:52:59,920
we're going to list all of them and then

3935
02:52:59,920 --> 02:53:01,920
we're going to list all the salient ttps

3936
02:53:01,920 --> 02:53:03,359
that were used in each of these

3937
02:53:03,359 --> 02:53:04,640
campaigns

3938
02:53:04,640 --> 02:53:06,640
so let's start with the first one the

3939
02:53:06,640 --> 02:53:08,240
first campaign that i'd like to talk

3940
02:53:08,240 --> 02:53:11,359
about was conducted by the apt group in

3941
02:53:11,359 --> 02:53:14,319
march 2021 and this was targeting

3942
02:53:14,319 --> 02:53:16,479
countries in the middle east

3943
02:53:16,479 --> 02:53:18,960
um this specific campaign consisted of

3944
02:53:18,960 --> 02:53:20,800
phishing emails with lawyers that were

3945
02:53:20,800 --> 02:53:23,520
sent to targets uh basically a pdf would

3946
02:53:23,520 --> 02:53:25,359
arrive in your inbox that would say hey

3947
02:53:25,359 --> 02:53:26,640
open up this pdf this is from a

3948
02:53:26,640 --> 02:53:28,160
legitimate entity

3949
02:53:28,160 --> 02:53:30,399
the pdf would contain language that said

3950
02:53:30,399 --> 02:53:33,200
hey you need to download this specific

3951
02:53:33,200 --> 02:53:36,240
zip file or this archive from uh this

3952
02:53:36,240 --> 02:53:38,000
remote location and execute the file

3953
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:39,439
inside of it

3954
02:53:39,439 --> 02:53:41,680
what basically happened was that the

3955
02:53:41,680 --> 02:53:44,720
malicious archives consisted of remote

3956
02:53:44,720 --> 02:53:46,399
controlled software utilities such as

3957
02:53:46,399 --> 02:53:50,160
screen connect and report utilities

3958
02:53:50,160 --> 02:53:52,399
once the victim executed these utilities

3959
02:53:52,399 --> 02:53:54,240
on their end point the attackers were

3960
02:53:54,240 --> 02:53:56,399
able to manually connect to the infected

3961
02:53:56,399 --> 02:53:57,600
endpoint and then they would start

3962
02:53:57,600 --> 02:53:59,040
pivoting and start

3963
02:53:59,040 --> 02:54:00,640
an entirely new infection chain from

3964
02:54:00,640 --> 02:54:01,680
there

3965
02:54:01,680 --> 02:54:03,279
during the course of this campaign we

3966
02:54:03,279 --> 02:54:05,200
also saw the attackers use various types

3967
02:54:05,200 --> 02:54:07,680
of commodity tools such as legolo which

3968
02:54:07,680 --> 02:54:10,080
is a reversed unlinked software which

3969
02:54:10,080 --> 02:54:11,680
can be used to establish long-term

3970
02:54:11,680 --> 02:54:13,520
communication channels between an

3971
02:54:13,520 --> 02:54:16,640
infected endpoint and the attackers

3972
02:54:16,640 --> 02:54:18,319
the screenshot that i have on the screen

3973
02:54:18,319 --> 02:54:21,359
today is a pdf that masquerades as a

3974
02:54:21,359 --> 02:54:23,760
circular from the national media council

3975
02:54:23,760 --> 02:54:26,080
of the united arab emirates

3976
02:54:26,080 --> 02:54:28,960
the tint here basically states that

3977
02:54:28,960 --> 02:54:30,720
we have a new version of the media

3978
02:54:30,720 --> 02:54:32,479
library it's available on this link

3979
02:54:32,479 --> 02:54:34,080
please go ahead and click it don't ask

3980
02:54:34,080 --> 02:54:36,160
any questions open up the zip archive

3981
02:54:36,160 --> 02:54:38,319
and execute the file with the inside of

3982
02:54:38,319 --> 02:54:38,960
it

3983
02:54:38,960 --> 02:54:41,279
and that's how the victims get infected

3984
02:54:41,279 --> 02:54:43,359
with a remote control software that the

3985
02:54:43,359 --> 02:54:46,240
attackers then can then connect to

3986
02:54:46,240 --> 02:54:47,520
now the next

3987
02:54:47,520 --> 02:54:50,160
attack instance of uh an operation

3988
02:54:50,160 --> 02:54:53,279
conducted by muddy water was against

3989
02:54:53,279 --> 02:54:57,359
pakistan uh in april of 2021.

3990
02:54:57,359 --> 02:54:59,760
this attack instance considered of

3991
02:54:59,760 --> 02:55:01,920
maldox being delivered

3992
02:55:01,920 --> 02:55:05,359
to the victims usually masquerading as a

3993
02:55:05,359 --> 02:55:07,760
government document of some sort

3994
02:55:07,760 --> 02:55:09,439
the screenshot that i have on the screen

3995
02:55:09,439 --> 02:55:12,720
is from a blurred out court case

3996
02:55:12,720 --> 02:55:15,279
from a pakistani court

3997
02:55:15,279 --> 02:55:17,200
this maldot consisted of malicious vba

3998
02:55:17,200 --> 02:55:18,720
macros that would reach out to a remote

3999
02:55:18,720 --> 02:55:21,040
url and then download the connectwise

4000
02:55:21,040 --> 02:55:22,880
remote access client that would be run

4001
02:55:22,880 --> 02:55:24,240
on the system and then the attackers

4002
02:55:24,240 --> 02:55:26,160
could connect to it

4003
02:55:26,160 --> 02:55:27,840
what's interesting about this campaign

4004
02:55:27,840 --> 02:55:29,200
and the reason why we wanted to talk

4005
02:55:29,200 --> 02:55:31,840
about this is because this campaign was

4006
02:55:31,840 --> 02:55:33,760
this attack instance was the first

4007
02:55:33,760 --> 02:55:36,399
instance of tracking tokens being used

4008
02:55:36,399 --> 02:55:38,000
by the adversary

4009
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:39,600
so for those of us that don't know what

4010
02:55:39,600 --> 02:55:42,080
tracking tokens are the basically

4011
02:55:42,080 --> 02:55:44,720
urls that are embedded inside

4012
02:55:44,720 --> 02:55:47,600
an artifact you know an html file or

4013
02:55:47,600 --> 02:55:50,479
an executable or a maldoc and when that

4014
02:55:50,479 --> 02:55:52,319
specific artifact is opened up on the

4015
02:55:52,319 --> 02:55:53,520
endpoint

4016
02:55:53,520 --> 02:55:55,760
the artifact will make an http call to

4017
02:55:55,760 --> 02:55:58,800
that specific url in order to register a

4018
02:55:58,800 --> 02:56:00,800
successful infection

4019
02:56:00,800 --> 02:56:04,000
for the endpoint with the attackers

4020
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:06,399
the reason why we call this

4021
02:56:06,399 --> 02:56:08,880
an instance of homemade tracking tokens

4022
02:56:08,880 --> 02:56:11,359
is because the attackers use their own

4023
02:56:11,359 --> 02:56:13,439
servers assigned their own ips and

4024
02:56:13,439 --> 02:56:15,680
managed and operated these servers

4025
02:56:15,680 --> 02:56:16,880
and which is why we're calling them

4026
02:56:16,880 --> 02:56:18,399
homemade tokens this is basically a

4027
02:56:18,399 --> 02:56:20,960
homegrown implementation of tracking

4028
02:56:20,960 --> 02:56:23,760
infection tokens

4029
02:56:23,760 --> 02:56:25,600
the next campaign that we observed being

4030
02:56:25,600 --> 02:56:28,160
carried out by muddy water was against

4031
02:56:28,160 --> 02:56:31,920
armenia in june 2021.

4032
02:56:31,920 --> 02:56:34,479
basically what happened was uh in this

4033
02:56:34,479 --> 02:56:36,080
case the attackers would distribute

4034
02:56:36,080 --> 02:56:38,560
malicious executables that were built

4035
02:56:38,560 --> 02:56:41,120
based on a builder that they have we

4036
02:56:41,120 --> 02:56:42,720
believe this is a customized builder and

4037
02:56:42,720 --> 02:56:45,439
we've seen executables being

4038
02:56:45,439 --> 02:56:47,279
generated by this builder and being used

4039
02:56:47,279 --> 02:56:49,760
in other campaigns as well

4040
02:56:49,760 --> 02:56:51,760
at the very core of it the executable

4041
02:56:51,760 --> 02:56:55,520
word drop a decoy document it would also

4042
02:56:55,520 --> 02:56:57,920
drop and execute a powershell based

4043
02:56:57,920 --> 02:57:00,000
downloader

4044
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:02,240
we also saw the attackers use specific

4045
02:57:02,240 --> 02:57:04,399
file extensions like dot conventions for

4046
02:57:04,399 --> 02:57:05,920
the powershell scripts that the

4047
02:57:05,920 --> 02:57:07,760
executables would

4048
02:57:07,760 --> 02:57:09,840
deploy on the infected endpoint

4049
02:57:09,840 --> 02:57:12,080
and we also saw the use of lull bins to

4050
02:57:12,080 --> 02:57:13,840
instrument components of the infection

4051
02:57:13,840 --> 02:57:15,359
chain

4052
02:57:15,359 --> 02:57:16,640
now the screenshot that i have on the

4053
02:57:16,640 --> 02:57:18,399
screen by the way is

4054
02:57:18,399 --> 02:57:20,880
supposed to be a confidential document

4055
02:57:20,880 --> 02:57:23,680
from ericsson it's a technical guide of

4056
02:57:23,680 --> 02:57:26,560
some kind and it pertains to viva mts

4057
02:57:26,560 --> 02:57:28,720
which is a telecom services provider in

4058
02:57:28,720 --> 02:57:30,240
armenia so

4059
02:57:30,240 --> 02:57:32,399
you know the attackers

4060
02:57:32,399 --> 02:57:33,439
know what they're doing this is

4061
02:57:33,439 --> 02:57:34,560
basically used

4062
02:57:34,560 --> 02:57:36,960
target telecom communication entities in

4063
02:57:36,960 --> 02:57:39,439
armenia

4064
02:57:39,439 --> 02:57:41,359
uh if you take a look at the powershell

4065
02:57:41,359 --> 02:57:43,920
based downloader this was a very short

4066
02:57:43,920 --> 02:57:46,399
and sweet and simple uh downloader or

4067
02:57:46,399 --> 02:57:49,040
stager if i may say um basically what

4068
02:57:49,040 --> 02:57:50,800
happens within it is uh i've got the

4069
02:57:50,800 --> 02:57:53,120
code uh screenshotted on the on the

4070
02:57:53,120 --> 02:57:56,160
slide deck here but the downloader will

4071
02:57:56,160 --> 02:57:58,000
basically send out preliminary system

4072
02:57:58,000 --> 02:57:59,520
information to the command control

4073
02:57:59,520 --> 02:58:01,600
server and then it will wait for the

4074
02:58:01,600 --> 02:58:02,960
command and control server to issue

4075
02:58:02,960 --> 02:58:06,000
powershell script commands to the

4076
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:08,240
infected endpoint to the script and any

4077
02:58:08,240 --> 02:58:09,520
of the commands that are received by the

4078
02:58:09,520 --> 02:58:10,960
script will then be executed on the

4079
02:58:10,960 --> 02:58:12,319
infected endpoint

4080
02:58:12,319 --> 02:58:14,160
so you know very short very sweet very

4081
02:58:14,160 --> 02:58:16,479
simple very tight implementation nothing

4082
02:58:16,479 --> 02:58:18,560
fancy here you know it gets them a

4083
02:58:18,560 --> 02:58:20,240
foothold inside the network and allows

4084
02:58:20,240 --> 02:58:23,279
them to start executing more commands uh

4085
02:58:23,279 --> 02:58:24,720
you know manually issuing more commands

4086
02:58:24,720 --> 02:58:26,240
and start executing more commands on the

4087
02:58:26,240 --> 02:58:28,800
infected system

4088
02:58:28,800 --> 02:58:31,840
now uh an extension of this attack on

4089
02:58:31,840 --> 02:58:35,680
armenian entities was also seen again

4090
02:58:35,680 --> 02:58:38,640
targeting entities in pakistan in august

4091
02:58:38,640 --> 02:58:40,000
2021.

4092
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:41,359
basically the infection chain is the

4093
02:58:41,359 --> 02:58:43,840
same the payloads are the same you know

4094
02:58:43,840 --> 02:58:45,760
this the same kind of ttps have been

4095
02:58:45,760 --> 02:58:47,840
used against this attack against

4096
02:58:47,840 --> 02:58:49,600
entities in pakistan

4097
02:58:49,600 --> 02:58:51,040
we see the use of the same type of

4098
02:58:51,040 --> 02:58:53,760
executables that use the same exact same

4099
02:58:53,760 --> 02:58:56,000
type of powershell downloader they use

4100
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:58,160
the same file extensions they use the

4101
02:58:58,160 --> 02:59:01,439
same type of lol bins however in this

4102
02:59:01,439 --> 02:59:03,600
specific attack instance we saw the

4103
02:59:03,600 --> 02:59:06,720
attackers use homemade tokens again

4104
02:59:06,720 --> 02:59:09,439
and what's interesting here is that

4105
02:59:09,439 --> 02:59:11,359
the homemade tokens used in this case

4106
02:59:11,359 --> 02:59:13,840
had the exact same ip address as those

4107
02:59:13,840 --> 02:59:15,520
seen earlier in

4108
02:59:15,520 --> 02:59:17,200
a very different campaign targeting

4109
02:59:17,200 --> 02:59:21,520
pakistan this is the one from april 2021

4110
02:59:21,760 --> 02:59:22,720
so

4111
02:59:22,720 --> 02:59:26,640
um at this point in time um

4112
02:59:26,640 --> 02:59:28,640
i'm basically trying to color code all

4113
02:59:28,640 --> 02:59:30,960
of the salient ttps in the slide to show

4114
02:59:30,960 --> 02:59:32,720
you the similarities and the

4115
02:59:32,720 --> 02:59:34,479
commonalities between the various

4116
02:59:34,479 --> 02:59:35,600
campaigns

4117
02:59:35,600 --> 02:59:38,000
so you see some in orange some

4118
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:40,240
common ttps in blue across different

4119
02:59:40,240 --> 02:59:43,200
campaigns the sum in purple

4120
02:59:43,200 --> 02:59:44,000
so

4121
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:46,479
this is basically meant for you to

4122
02:59:46,479 --> 02:59:48,800
keep track of all the commonalities and

4123
02:59:48,800 --> 02:59:51,279
all the overlaps in gdps

4124
02:59:51,279 --> 02:59:53,920
now let's look at one of the

4125
02:59:53,920 --> 02:59:55,840
one of the very interesting muddy water

4126
02:59:55,840 --> 02:59:58,720
campaigns from november 2021

4127
02:59:58,720 --> 03:00:00,479
this campaign specifically targeted

4128
03:00:00,479 --> 03:00:02,560
entities in turkey we discovered this in

4129
03:00:02,560 --> 03:00:04,960
november but this was uh operational

4130
03:00:04,960 --> 03:00:06,640
this campaign had been operational since

4131
03:00:06,640 --> 03:00:09,359
at least september of 2021

4132
03:00:09,359 --> 03:00:12,160
um in this campaign the attackers took a

4133
03:00:12,160 --> 03:00:14,160
two-fold approach

4134
03:00:14,160 --> 03:00:16,560
on one hand they used executables that

4135
03:00:16,560 --> 03:00:20,080
acted as the droppers and downloaders

4136
03:00:20,080 --> 03:00:22,240
and the initial infection vectors for

4137
03:00:22,240 --> 03:00:24,240
the infection chains but on the other

4138
03:00:24,240 --> 03:00:26,080
hand the attackers also use different

4139
03:00:26,080 --> 03:00:28,640
types of malicious documents as well to

4140
03:00:28,640 --> 03:00:30,319
instrument the attacks

4141
03:00:30,319 --> 03:00:32,399
now in the case of the executables we

4142
03:00:32,399 --> 03:00:33,920
saw

4143
03:00:33,920 --> 03:00:36,960
the executables uh deploy a second

4144
03:00:36,960 --> 03:00:38,960
variant of a powershell based downloader

4145
03:00:38,960 --> 03:00:41,279
or a stager and we also saw the use of

4146
03:00:41,279 --> 03:00:44,000
different kinds of lower bins

4147
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:46,479
at a very high level um this is what the

4148
03:00:46,479 --> 03:00:48,240
infection chain basically looks like the

4149
03:00:48,240 --> 03:00:50,880
executable will drop and display a decoy

4150
03:00:50,880 --> 03:00:52,880
document that is relevant and pertinent

4151
03:00:52,880 --> 03:00:54,160
to the victims that they're trying to

4152
03:00:54,160 --> 03:00:55,279
infect

4153
03:00:55,279 --> 03:00:57,840
it will execute a powershell based

4154
03:00:57,840 --> 03:00:59,840
instrument script which is responsible

4155
03:00:59,840 --> 03:01:01,279
for executing the powershell based

4156
03:01:01,279 --> 03:01:03,520
downloader the downloader will then

4157
03:01:03,520 --> 03:01:04,960
reach out to the command and control

4158
03:01:04,960 --> 03:01:07,279
server which will issue new commands to

4159
03:01:07,279 --> 03:01:09,439
the downloader which will then execute

4160
03:01:09,439 --> 03:01:12,800
those commands on the infected endpoint

4161
03:01:12,800 --> 03:01:14,560
now as in the case of the previous

4162
03:01:14,560 --> 03:01:17,600
downloader we see this new variant also

4163
03:01:17,600 --> 03:01:20,240
is very short and very simple you know

4164
03:01:20,240 --> 03:01:22,000
basically all there is

4165
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:23,680
the core of the functionality in this

4166
03:01:23,680 --> 03:01:25,359
downloader is to

4167
03:01:25,359 --> 03:01:26,560
take commands from the command and

4168
03:01:26,560 --> 03:01:28,399
control server and just execute them

4169
03:01:28,399 --> 03:01:30,319
non-stop on the infected endpoint that's

4170
03:01:30,319 --> 03:01:32,080
it so basically

4171
03:01:32,080 --> 03:01:34,399
that they're using very small and very

4172
03:01:34,399 --> 03:01:36,960
compact implants to establish an initial

4173
03:01:36,960 --> 03:01:40,080
foothold into the networks

4174
03:01:40,080 --> 03:01:42,319
now uh i spoke about the sec the

4175
03:01:42,319 --> 03:01:44,160
two-fold approach right so the second

4176
03:01:44,160 --> 03:01:46,080
approach that the attackers took during

4177
03:01:46,080 --> 03:01:47,840
the course of this campaign was to use

4178
03:01:47,840 --> 03:01:49,600
malicious pdfs

4179
03:01:49,600 --> 03:01:51,840
that would be opened up by the victim

4180
03:01:51,840 --> 03:01:53,840
and the pdf would have language that

4181
03:01:53,840 --> 03:01:54,640
said

4182
03:01:54,640 --> 03:01:56,319
we cannot display the

4183
03:01:56,319 --> 03:01:58,479
the the content of the document to you

4184
03:01:58,479 --> 03:02:00,640
uh however the correct version of the

4185
03:02:00,640 --> 03:02:02,640
document is available at this location

4186
03:02:02,640 --> 03:02:04,080
please click on this location and open

4187
03:02:04,080 --> 03:02:06,080
up this document and that's exactly what

4188
03:02:06,080 --> 03:02:07,600
happens during the infection chain the

4189
03:02:07,600 --> 03:02:09,680
pdf reaches out to a remote location

4190
03:02:09,680 --> 03:02:10,880
that downloads

4191
03:02:10,880 --> 03:02:13,200
a maldock the maldoc consists of

4192
03:02:13,200 --> 03:02:16,399
malicious vba macros that will in turn

4193
03:02:16,399 --> 03:02:17,279
drop

4194
03:02:17,279 --> 03:02:19,359
a vbs based instrument and a powershell

4195
03:02:19,359 --> 03:02:21,920
based downloader and then the infection

4196
03:02:21,920 --> 03:02:23,279
chain is pretty much the same you know

4197
03:02:23,279 --> 03:02:25,279
the instrumenter will uh execute the

4198
03:02:25,279 --> 03:02:26,800
powershell based downloader which will

4199
03:02:26,800 --> 03:02:28,960
download commands from the remote

4200
03:02:28,960 --> 03:02:31,439
locations and execute them on the

4201
03:02:31,439 --> 03:02:34,319
infected endpoint

4202
03:02:34,319 --> 03:02:37,279
now what's interesting here is uh

4203
03:02:37,279 --> 03:02:39,359
the maldox disguised themselves as

4204
03:02:39,359 --> 03:02:41,760
reports or forms belonging to different

4205
03:02:41,760 --> 03:02:44,160
ministries in the turkish government and

4206
03:02:44,160 --> 03:02:46,080
i've got a few examples here you know we

4207
03:02:46,080 --> 03:02:48,720
saw reports that uh you know maldox that

4208
03:02:48,720 --> 03:02:50,880
masqueraded as reports from the health

4209
03:02:50,880 --> 03:02:53,520
ministry the interior ministry or from

4210
03:02:53,520 --> 03:02:54,640
turkey

4211
03:02:54,640 --> 03:02:56,560
uh so it's it's kind of interesting that

4212
03:02:56,560 --> 03:02:57,920
you know they were trying to this gives

4213
03:02:57,920 --> 03:02:59,359
us an indication that they were actually

4214
03:02:59,359 --> 03:03:00,399
trying to

4215
03:03:00,399 --> 03:03:02,560
infect users who have relations with

4216
03:03:02,560 --> 03:03:04,000
these specific

4217
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:05,840
ministries

4218
03:03:05,840 --> 03:03:08,000
now uh

4219
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:10,319
another interesting point to note here

4220
03:03:10,319 --> 03:03:12,800
is that the attackers started using

4221
03:03:12,800 --> 03:03:15,040
canary tokens instead of homegrown

4222
03:03:15,040 --> 03:03:16,960
tokens in their maildocks

4223
03:03:16,960 --> 03:03:19,120
so for those of us that don't know

4224
03:03:19,120 --> 03:03:20,520
canary tokens

4225
03:03:20,520 --> 03:03:22,560
canarytokens.com is basically a free

4226
03:03:22,560 --> 03:03:24,080
service that allows you to register a

4227
03:03:24,080 --> 03:03:26,399
url that you can then put in your

4228
03:03:26,399 --> 03:03:28,399
artifacts and when those artifacts are

4229
03:03:28,399 --> 03:03:30,800
run you know the the artifact the

4230
03:03:30,800 --> 03:03:32,880
executable or the maldoc will reach out

4231
03:03:32,880 --> 03:03:33,600
to

4232
03:03:33,600 --> 03:03:36,160
that specific url on canarytokens.com

4233
03:03:36,160 --> 03:03:38,880
and register a successful infection

4234
03:03:38,880 --> 03:03:40,960
so um

4235
03:03:40,960 --> 03:03:43,760
now we have uh i i tried to the

4236
03:03:43,760 --> 03:03:46,640
attackers now switched from the use of

4237
03:03:46,640 --> 03:03:48,800
homegrown infrastructure for tracking

4238
03:03:48,800 --> 03:03:50,960
infection tokens you remember i spoke

4239
03:03:50,960 --> 03:03:53,120
about homemade tokens they moved from

4240
03:03:53,120 --> 03:03:55,040
homemade tokens to

4241
03:03:55,040 --> 03:03:57,120
canary tokens and we believe that this

4242
03:03:57,120 --> 03:03:58,800
is an attempt at

4243
03:03:58,800 --> 03:04:04,119
legitimizing their infection tracking

4244
03:04:12,560 --> 03:04:14,880
body water you know a lot of them most

4245
03:04:14,880 --> 03:04:16,720
of them use powershell based downloaders

4246
03:04:16,720 --> 03:04:18,880
in one form or the other to establish an

4247
03:04:18,880 --> 03:04:20,640
initial foothold on the infected

4248
03:04:20,640 --> 03:04:22,720
endpoints

4249
03:04:22,720 --> 03:04:23,760
however

4250
03:04:23,760 --> 03:04:25,680
there was a new campaign in december

4251
03:04:25,680 --> 03:04:28,080
2021 and that you know made its way well

4252
03:04:28,080 --> 03:04:31,439
into 2022 that targeted a multitude of

4253
03:04:31,439 --> 03:04:34,560
countries in the arabian peninsula

4254
03:04:34,560 --> 03:04:35,760
what basically happened during the

4255
03:04:35,760 --> 03:04:38,080
course of this campaign was uh this is

4256
03:04:38,080 --> 03:04:39,600
the infection chain you know a phishing

4257
03:04:39,600 --> 03:04:41,760
email would arrive in the victim's inbox

4258
03:04:41,760 --> 03:04:43,279
with the maldoc

4259
03:04:43,279 --> 03:04:45,040
uh the malicious document would be

4260
03:04:45,040 --> 03:04:47,760
opened it consisted of a malicious vba

4261
03:04:47,760 --> 03:04:48,880
macro

4262
03:04:48,880 --> 03:04:51,680
that would instrument the next stages of

4263
03:04:51,680 --> 03:04:53,680
the infection chain however what's

4264
03:04:53,680 --> 03:04:55,600
different here and what's unique here is

4265
03:04:55,600 --> 03:04:58,160
that the attackers now moved from using

4266
03:04:58,160 --> 03:05:00,880
powershell base scripts to using wsf

4267
03:05:00,880 --> 03:05:02,240
based scripts

4268
03:05:02,240 --> 03:05:05,359
wsf is the window scripting file um

4269
03:05:05,359 --> 03:05:07,359
it has the ability to

4270
03:05:07,359 --> 03:05:09,279
have multiple uh

4271
03:05:09,279 --> 03:05:11,680
scripts if i may say or multiple uh

4272
03:05:11,680 --> 03:05:13,920
scriptlets inside of the file from

4273
03:05:13,920 --> 03:05:15,439
different languages

4274
03:05:15,439 --> 03:05:16,880
and that's what we saw during the course

4275
03:05:16,880 --> 03:05:18,880
of this campaign we saw

4276
03:05:18,880 --> 03:05:21,120
the wsf based rat which we're calling

4277
03:05:21,120 --> 03:05:22,399
slough rat

4278
03:05:22,399 --> 03:05:23,760
being used to deploy additional

4279
03:05:23,760 --> 03:05:25,279
malicious payloads on the infected

4280
03:05:25,279 --> 03:05:27,760
endpoint and we saw the reuse of the

4281
03:05:27,760 --> 03:05:30,240
legolo reverse tunneling utility that we

4282
03:05:30,240 --> 03:05:33,359
saw earlier in march of 2021

4283
03:05:33,359 --> 03:05:35,840
uh being used again in this specific uh

4284
03:05:35,840 --> 03:05:38,160
campaign as well

4285
03:05:38,160 --> 03:05:39,439
so um

4286
03:05:39,439 --> 03:05:41,279
let me give you a brief overview of what

4287
03:05:41,279 --> 03:05:42,800
slow rat is

4288
03:05:42,800 --> 03:05:45,680
we we named the terms flower at but it

4289
03:05:45,680 --> 03:05:47,760
is also known as canopy

4290
03:05:47,760 --> 03:05:50,960
this rat was also disclosed by the cyber

4291
03:05:50,960 --> 03:05:52,880
security and infrastructure security

4292
03:05:52,880 --> 03:05:55,359
agency of the united states uh the csi

4293
03:05:55,359 --> 03:05:56,319
agency

4294
03:05:56,319 --> 03:05:58,560
um this is a wsf based rat so it

4295
03:05:58,560 --> 03:06:00,479
contains different

4296
03:06:00,479 --> 03:06:03,520
snippets of code consisting of bb script

4297
03:06:03,520 --> 03:06:05,359
and javascript and the execution jumps

4298
03:06:05,359 --> 03:06:07,680
from one snippet to the other in order

4299
03:06:07,680 --> 03:06:09,359
to carry out the malicious functionality

4300
03:06:09,359 --> 03:06:12,880
that resides inside of this strat

4301
03:06:12,880 --> 03:06:15,600
if you take a look at this specific rat

4302
03:06:15,600 --> 03:06:16,800
you know if you just open it up in a

4303
03:06:16,800 --> 03:06:18,319
text editor

4304
03:06:18,319 --> 03:06:20,000
you will see that there's a lot of

4305
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:21,760
obfuscation here

4306
03:06:21,760 --> 03:06:23,680
but if you peel through the obfuscation

4307
03:06:23,680 --> 03:06:26,000
layers at the end of the day it's a very

4308
03:06:26,000 --> 03:06:28,160
simple rack it has the ability to

4309
03:06:28,160 --> 03:06:30,399
execute arbitrary commands on the

4310
03:06:30,399 --> 03:06:32,240
infected endpoints you know

4311
03:06:32,240 --> 03:06:34,080
the server will issue a command the rat

4312
03:06:34,080 --> 03:06:34,960
will

4313
03:06:34,960 --> 03:06:36,560
execute that command on the infected

4314
03:06:36,560 --> 03:06:39,439
endpoint it then stores the output of

4315
03:06:39,439 --> 03:06:41,359
the command in the text file that text

4316
03:06:41,359 --> 03:06:42,640
file is

4317
03:06:42,640 --> 03:06:45,040
subsequently read by the rat and then

4318
03:06:45,040 --> 03:06:47,840
exfiltrated out to the command and

4319
03:06:47,840 --> 03:06:49,439
control server

4320
03:06:49,439 --> 03:06:51,920
the the rat also had the capability to

4321
03:06:51,920 --> 03:06:53,840
deploy additional malware payloads and

4322
03:06:53,840 --> 03:06:55,680
we saw the use of you know as i said the

4323
03:06:55,680 --> 03:06:57,920
legolo reverse tunneling utility being

4324
03:06:57,920 --> 03:07:00,080
used here as well

4325
03:07:00,080 --> 03:07:01,520
by infections

4326
03:07:01,520 --> 03:07:03,200
by infected end points that were running

4327
03:07:03,200 --> 03:07:05,200
slower

4328
03:07:05,200 --> 03:07:08,080
okay so at this point in time uh

4329
03:07:08,080 --> 03:07:10,560
we've been through all the different

4330
03:07:10,560 --> 03:07:12,399
muddy water campaigns

4331
03:07:12,399 --> 03:07:14,240
but what i'd like to highlight here is

4332
03:07:14,240 --> 03:07:15,760
that if you look very closely at these

4333
03:07:15,760 --> 03:07:17,920
slides you will see that there there are

4334
03:07:17,920 --> 03:07:19,920
very there are some very common tdps you

4335
03:07:19,920 --> 03:07:22,319
know the use of executables across

4336
03:07:22,319 --> 03:07:23,920
different campaigns you know from

4337
03:07:23,920 --> 03:07:26,319
armenia to pakistan to turkey

4338
03:07:26,319 --> 03:07:28,319
the use of uh

4339
03:07:28,319 --> 03:07:31,600
remote control utilities from march 2021

4340
03:07:31,600 --> 03:07:34,000
that were reused again in december 2021

4341
03:07:34,000 --> 03:07:36,080
and well into january at

4342
03:07:36,080 --> 03:07:39,040
the beginning of this year

4343
03:07:39,040 --> 03:07:40,640
all right so let's talk about canary

4344
03:07:40,640 --> 03:07:44,240
tokens so um canary tokens uh the the

4345
03:07:44,240 --> 03:07:46,240
usage of canary tokens for tracking

4346
03:07:46,240 --> 03:07:48,720
infection chains is very novel

4347
03:07:48,720 --> 03:07:49,600
uh

4348
03:07:49,600 --> 03:07:51,680
to this specific apt we haven't seen

4349
03:07:51,680 --> 03:07:53,279
this before the first time we discovered

4350
03:07:53,279 --> 03:07:55,279
this was when we were taking a look at

4351
03:07:55,279 --> 03:07:57,040
their campaigns

4352
03:07:57,040 --> 03:08:00,560
you know sometime in april 2021

4353
03:08:00,560 --> 03:08:02,080
and the more we looked at these

4354
03:08:02,080 --> 03:08:05,120
campaigns the more we realized that

4355
03:08:05,120 --> 03:08:07,279
the attackers were slowly refining this

4356
03:08:07,279 --> 03:08:08,479
technique

4357
03:08:08,479 --> 03:08:12,000
so in april of last year in the campaign

4358
03:08:12,000 --> 03:08:14,640
targeting pakistani entities we saw that

4359
03:08:14,640 --> 03:08:16,319
the attacker started using homemade

4360
03:08:16,319 --> 03:08:18,880
infection tokens right

4361
03:08:18,880 --> 03:08:21,200
this was the experimental phase for the

4362
03:08:21,200 --> 03:08:22,960
for the for this specific technique you

4363
03:08:22,960 --> 03:08:24,880
know the attack the attackers were

4364
03:08:24,880 --> 03:08:26,319
testing the waters they were trying to

4365
03:08:26,319 --> 03:08:27,359
make sure

4366
03:08:27,359 --> 03:08:28,960
uh uh you know they were trying to

4367
03:08:28,960 --> 03:08:31,520
understand the utility of this technique

4368
03:08:31,520 --> 03:08:34,240
um they used this technique up until

4369
03:08:34,240 --> 03:08:36,240
august of 2021

4370
03:08:36,240 --> 03:08:38,800
um perhaps around this point in time the

4371
03:08:38,800 --> 03:08:41,760
attackers realized that using homegrown

4372
03:08:41,760 --> 03:08:43,760
infrastructure and homemade tokens was a

4373
03:08:43,760 --> 03:08:45,279
little bit too noisy

4374
03:08:45,279 --> 03:08:47,200
you know a random document you know

4375
03:08:47,200 --> 03:08:48,720
suspicious document reaching out to a

4376
03:08:48,720 --> 03:08:50,720
random ip on your network is you know

4377
03:08:50,720 --> 03:08:52,240
bound to catch somebody's attention at

4378
03:08:52,240 --> 03:08:54,560
some point in time

4379
03:08:54,560 --> 03:08:57,120
which is why beginning with the campaign

4380
03:08:57,120 --> 03:09:00,160
targeting turkey in november 2021 we saw

4381
03:09:00,160 --> 03:09:02,720
the attackers try to legitimize their

4382
03:09:02,720 --> 03:09:05,760
infection token tracking systems uh they

4383
03:09:05,760 --> 03:09:07,200
started using a more professional

4384
03:09:07,200 --> 03:09:09,560
implementation and they started adopting

4385
03:09:09,560 --> 03:09:12,000
canarytokens.com in order to keep track

4386
03:09:12,000 --> 03:09:15,359
of their infections right

4387
03:09:15,359 --> 03:09:17,279
now um

4388
03:09:17,279 --> 03:09:19,200
canary tokens is a very interesting

4389
03:09:19,200 --> 03:09:22,000
concept and uh during the course of our

4390
03:09:22,000 --> 03:09:23,520
research we try to come up with a

4391
03:09:23,520 --> 03:09:26,239
hypothesis of why the attackers were

4392
03:09:26,239 --> 03:09:28,160
using uh you know homemade infection

4393
03:09:28,160 --> 03:09:29,840
tracking tokens and canary tokens

4394
03:09:29,840 --> 03:09:31,359
specifically

4395
03:09:31,359 --> 03:09:32,560
um

4396
03:09:32,560 --> 03:09:34,000
so canary tokens can be used for a

4397
03:09:34,000 --> 03:09:35,920
number of purposes and these are

4398
03:09:35,920 --> 03:09:38,160
we have four hypotheses the the most

4399
03:09:38,160 --> 03:09:39,840
obvious one is you know you want to keep

4400
03:09:39,840 --> 03:09:42,479
track of successful infections

4401
03:09:42,479 --> 03:09:44,560
uh on the other hand we believe that

4402
03:09:44,560 --> 03:09:46,640
canary tokens can also be used for

4403
03:09:46,640 --> 03:09:48,720
anti-analysis so you know basically you

4404
03:09:48,720 --> 03:09:50,319
can have an instance where

4405
03:09:50,319 --> 03:09:52,000
you send a request to the token server

4406
03:09:52,000 --> 03:09:55,359
first and only if the token request is

4407
03:09:55,359 --> 03:09:57,840
received will the server issue a payload

4408
03:09:57,840 --> 03:10:00,720
to the specific uh infection so this is

4409
03:10:00,720 --> 03:10:03,359
a way to thwart uh isolated analysis of

4410
03:10:03,359 --> 03:10:05,040
specific components of an infection

4411
03:10:05,040 --> 03:10:06,479
chain

4412
03:10:06,479 --> 03:10:08,800
um i believe that query tokens can also

4413
03:10:08,800 --> 03:10:11,040
be used as a form of

4414
03:10:11,040 --> 03:10:13,120
timing checks for anti-analysis you know

4415
03:10:13,120 --> 03:10:15,040
you check the duration between a token

4416
03:10:15,040 --> 03:10:17,120
request and a request for the payload

4417
03:10:17,120 --> 03:10:19,439
and if it's too small then you you know

4418
03:10:19,439 --> 03:10:21,040
the infection is probably running on a

4419
03:10:21,040 --> 03:10:22,960
sandbox or some kind of an automated

4420
03:10:22,960 --> 03:10:24,880
system

4421
03:10:24,880 --> 03:10:27,120
a canary tokens can also be used to find

4422
03:10:27,120 --> 03:10:29,840
protections um you know if a token

4423
03:10:29,840 --> 03:10:31,200
server keeps

4424
03:10:31,200 --> 03:10:32,880
receiving requests from an infected

4425
03:10:32,880 --> 03:10:34,000
endpoint

4426
03:10:34,000 --> 03:10:35,760
but there are no requests for the

4427
03:10:35,760 --> 03:10:37,840
payload from the infected endpoint then

4428
03:10:37,840 --> 03:10:39,279
that means that

4429
03:10:39,279 --> 03:10:40,960
you know the victim has some sort of

4430
03:10:40,960 --> 03:10:42,560
blocking and protection mechanism in

4431
03:10:42,560 --> 03:10:44,080
place and the

4432
03:10:44,080 --> 03:10:45,760
adversaries can then

4433
03:10:45,760 --> 03:10:48,479
modify their strategy and change their

4434
03:10:48,479 --> 03:10:50,160
techniques and tools

4435
03:10:50,160 --> 03:10:51,600
in order to

4436
03:10:51,600 --> 03:10:53,520
achieve a greater degree of success

4437
03:10:53,520 --> 03:10:56,960
against that specific victim

4438
03:10:57,520 --> 03:11:00,560
all right so i know this is a lot and i

4439
03:11:00,560 --> 03:11:02,560
know i rushed through a lot of the the

4440
03:11:02,560 --> 03:11:03,680
content because there was a lot of

4441
03:11:03,680 --> 03:11:05,760
content but i promise that i'm just

4442
03:11:05,760 --> 03:11:07,359
going to present two more slides to you

4443
03:11:07,359 --> 03:11:08,640
and i'm just going to talk about the

4444
03:11:08,640 --> 03:11:11,040
conclusions here

4445
03:11:11,040 --> 03:11:12,319
so um

4446
03:11:12,319 --> 03:11:15,200
in case there weren't enough uh timeline

4447
03:11:15,200 --> 03:11:18,239
slides for you i have yet another one

4448
03:11:18,239 --> 03:11:19,520
this time we've tried to do something

4449
03:11:19,520 --> 03:11:21,760
different on the left hand side we have

4450
03:11:21,760 --> 03:11:23,760
a timeline of all the campaigns that

4451
03:11:23,760 --> 03:11:25,359
we've discussed today

4452
03:11:25,359 --> 03:11:28,239
and we've also presented and color-coded

4453
03:11:28,239 --> 03:11:31,279
all the salient ttps along with the

4454
03:11:31,279 --> 03:11:32,720
different campaigns you know in the

4455
03:11:32,720 --> 03:11:33,920
bullet points

4456
03:11:33,920 --> 03:11:35,920
but on the right-hand side we this is

4457
03:11:35,920 --> 03:11:39,040
our attempt at showing the different uh

4458
03:11:39,040 --> 03:11:41,439
commonalities between all the different

4459
03:11:41,439 --> 03:11:43,920
campaigns that water has conducted over

4460
03:11:43,920 --> 03:11:45,680
the course of the last year

4461
03:11:45,680 --> 03:11:47,359
you know you see the use of honey tokens

4462
03:11:47,359 --> 03:11:49,279
across different campaigns we see that

4463
03:11:49,279 --> 03:11:51,359
the honey tokens were then evolved into

4464
03:11:51,359 --> 03:11:54,640
an into a completely new and uh distinct

4465
03:11:54,640 --> 03:11:56,880
campaign that was targeting turkey we

4466
03:11:56,880 --> 03:11:59,760
see that uh you know this similar

4467
03:11:59,760 --> 03:12:01,439
payload similar powershell based

4468
03:12:01,439 --> 03:12:03,200
downloaders and file names and

4469
03:12:03,200 --> 03:12:04,800
extensions and load bins were used

4470
03:12:04,800 --> 03:12:07,359
across multiple distinct campaigns

4471
03:12:07,359 --> 03:12:10,479
and uh this indicates that the adversary

4472
03:12:10,479 --> 03:12:12,479
is reusing their ttps you know they're

4473
03:12:12,479 --> 03:12:14,399
usually using the gdps and they're

4474
03:12:14,399 --> 03:12:16,160
borrowing from one another based on the

4475
03:12:16,160 --> 03:12:19,040
reliability of and and you know the

4476
03:12:19,040 --> 03:12:21,439
utility of a specific technique that

4477
03:12:21,439 --> 03:12:24,000
they've used in the past

4478
03:12:24,000 --> 03:12:26,319
all right so in conclusion

4479
03:12:26,319 --> 03:12:29,120
uh we believe that muddy water is a

4480
03:12:29,120 --> 03:12:33,120
super group we believe that it is a

4481
03:12:33,120 --> 03:12:35,120
an umbrella organization that consists

4482
03:12:35,120 --> 03:12:36,800
of separate teams that are targeting

4483
03:12:36,800 --> 03:12:38,800
different geographies

4484
03:12:38,800 --> 03:12:41,680
all of these teams borrow tdps from one

4485
03:12:41,680 --> 03:12:43,040
another

4486
03:12:43,040 --> 03:12:44,800
um and we've seen that we've seen

4487
03:12:44,800 --> 03:12:46,560
evidence of the reviews of their tdps

4488
03:12:46,560 --> 03:12:48,319
from one campaign to the other in

4489
03:12:48,319 --> 03:12:50,399
distinct and different geographies

4490
03:12:50,399 --> 03:12:52,960
however that does not mean that the

4491
03:12:52,960 --> 03:12:55,439
group is not that the individual groups

4492
03:12:55,439 --> 03:12:58,080
are not innovating on their own as well

4493
03:12:58,080 --> 03:12:59,840
we see that the groups are innovating on

4494
03:12:59,840 --> 03:13:01,920
their own they develop their own ttps

4495
03:13:01,920 --> 03:13:03,600
they develop their own suit of tools

4496
03:13:03,600 --> 03:13:05,840
they develop their own tactics

4497
03:13:05,840 --> 03:13:08,560
they test them out they refine them they

4498
03:13:08,560 --> 03:13:10,560
make them more reliable

4499
03:13:10,560 --> 03:13:13,680
and once the utility of these techniques

4500
03:13:13,680 --> 03:13:15,840
has been proven they will put them in a

4501
03:13:15,840 --> 03:13:18,880
common pool of tactics and tools and

4502
03:13:18,880 --> 03:13:21,680
these tools can then be utilized by

4503
03:13:21,680 --> 03:13:23,520
another sub team in a completely

4504
03:13:23,520 --> 03:13:24,800
different campaign targeting a

4505
03:13:24,800 --> 03:13:27,760
completely different geography

4506
03:13:27,760 --> 03:13:28,640
uh

4507
03:13:28,640 --> 03:13:30,080
although there's different tools and

4508
03:13:30,080 --> 03:13:31,600
techniques being used and there's some

4509
03:13:31,600 --> 03:13:34,319
amount of uh overlap between the ttps as

4510
03:13:34,319 --> 03:13:35,040
well

4511
03:13:35,040 --> 03:13:37,120
we strongly believe that all of these

4512
03:13:37,120 --> 03:13:40,000
teams under the muddy water umbrella

4513
03:13:40,000 --> 03:13:42,560
serve a common set of goals you know

4514
03:13:42,560 --> 03:13:45,200
they serve the interests of a common

4515
03:13:45,200 --> 03:13:47,840
nation state which is iran in this case

4516
03:13:47,840 --> 03:13:50,160
and their primary focus again is to

4517
03:13:50,160 --> 03:13:52,319
conduct espionage to establish and

4518
03:13:52,319 --> 03:13:54,640
maintain long-term access into their

4519
03:13:54,640 --> 03:13:58,160
victims networks and to prime also do

4520
03:13:58,160 --> 03:13:59,920
some amount of intellectual property

4521
03:13:59,920 --> 03:14:02,560
theft as well

4522
03:14:02,560 --> 03:14:05,439
and that brings us to the end of the

4523
03:14:05,439 --> 03:14:08,439
presentation

4524
03:14:10,800 --> 03:14:13,040
uh i think we have we have a separate

4525
03:14:13,040 --> 03:14:14,880
session for answering questions as well

4526
03:14:14,880 --> 03:14:16,560
so we'll take that up i believe that's

4527
03:14:16,560 --> 03:14:18,239
at 310

4528
03:14:18,239 --> 03:14:19,359
um

4529
03:14:19,359 --> 03:14:22,359
today

4530
03:14:52,160 --> 03:14:54,399
welcome back everyone

4531
03:14:54,399 --> 03:14:56,800
so here is the time for the q and a and

4532
03:14:56,800 --> 03:15:00,160
panel session for the malware uh sec the

4533
03:15:00,160 --> 03:15:01,439
malwareblock

4534
03:15:01,439 --> 03:15:03,920
of the northsec conference uh first

4535
03:15:03,920 --> 03:15:07,200
please welcome suhera she's a

4536
03:15:07,200 --> 03:15:09,279
senior security researcher at

4537
03:15:09,279 --> 03:15:10,479
crowdstrike

4538
03:15:10,479 --> 03:15:13,439
she will be doing a workshop on static

4539
03:15:13,439 --> 03:15:15,040
malware analysis

4540
03:15:15,040 --> 03:15:16,640
starting at four o'clock today i think

4541
03:15:16,640 --> 03:15:19,600
just a few minutes after the

4542
03:15:19,600 --> 03:15:22,880
the panel uh and uh it will be continued

4543
03:15:22,880 --> 03:15:25,439
tomorrow so it's a two two day workshop

4544
03:15:25,439 --> 03:15:27,200
probably super interesting

4545
03:15:27,200 --> 03:15:28,960
um

4546
03:15:28,960 --> 03:15:32,640
and we have our presenters uh

4547
03:15:32,640 --> 03:15:34,479
everyone is here

4548
03:15:34,479 --> 03:15:36,160
so um

4549
03:15:36,160 --> 03:15:37,600
i will be asking questions from the

4550
03:15:37,600 --> 03:15:38,640
audience

4551
03:15:38,640 --> 03:15:40,479
it's not too late if you do have

4552
03:15:40,479 --> 03:15:43,040
questions i do have the uh

4553
03:15:43,040 --> 03:15:44,319
the

4554
03:15:44,319 --> 03:15:46,880
your question will pop up here on i have

4555
03:15:46,880 --> 03:15:49,760
my laptop open in front of me so if uh

4556
03:15:49,760 --> 03:15:51,600
if you still have questions or follow-up

4557
03:15:51,600 --> 03:15:53,680
questions uh feel free to send them to

4558
03:15:53,680 --> 03:15:56,800
sleep slido and i will be able to ask

4559
03:15:56,800 --> 03:15:58,640
them

4560
03:15:58,640 --> 03:16:01,120
first of all thank you all for your

4561
03:16:01,120 --> 03:16:04,160
very good presentations um

4562
03:16:04,160 --> 03:16:07,120
and i have a few very good questions

4563
03:16:07,120 --> 03:16:09,279
from the the audience

4564
03:16:09,279 --> 03:16:12,800
so i'm going to start with

4565
03:16:13,439 --> 03:16:15,040
the ones about air gap network this is

4566
03:16:15,040 --> 03:16:18,640
the subject that i think

4567
03:16:18,880 --> 03:16:21,359
we got the most uh question about

4568
03:16:21,359 --> 03:16:22,239
um

4569
03:16:22,239 --> 03:16:24,960
so i i have a few questions where people

4570
03:16:24,960 --> 03:16:26,160
were asking

4571
03:16:26,160 --> 03:16:30,000
about um you know all the um

4572
03:16:30,000 --> 03:16:32,560
proof of concept that that was

4573
03:16:32,560 --> 03:16:34,080
presented at

4574
03:16:34,080 --> 03:16:35,840
various

4575
03:16:35,840 --> 03:16:36,960
places

4576
03:16:36,960 --> 03:16:39,680
where you know you can extract data with

4577
03:16:39,680 --> 03:16:41,680
with light or with

4578
03:16:41,680 --> 03:16:43,600
leds or with

4579
03:16:43,600 --> 03:16:47,040
sound or with any kind of

4580
03:16:48,160 --> 03:16:50,239
other methods so you're presented about

4581
03:16:50,239 --> 03:16:51,520
usb

4582
03:16:51,520 --> 03:16:54,080
do they do you think that they are uh

4583
03:16:54,080 --> 03:16:55,600
really a proof of concept do you think

4584
03:16:55,600 --> 03:16:57,120
that they really apply

4585
03:16:57,120 --> 03:17:00,960
to the the in the real world

4586
03:17:00,960 --> 03:17:03,359
so great question because

4587
03:17:03,359 --> 03:17:05,680
one of the reasons also behind our

4588
03:17:05,680 --> 03:17:07,600
research was to see how much of these

4589
03:17:07,600 --> 03:17:08,720
techniques

4590
03:17:08,720 --> 03:17:11,359
were in the wild um

4591
03:17:11,359 --> 03:17:14,160
and the answer is really like

4592
03:17:14,160 --> 03:17:17,439
not as so they're not in the wild

4593
03:17:17,439 --> 03:17:19,760
as far as public knowledge is concerned

4594
03:17:19,760 --> 03:17:22,640
so it's not impossible that

4595
03:17:22,640 --> 03:17:24,560
attacks happen and they were either

4596
03:17:24,560 --> 03:17:26,319
never detected or never reported on

4597
03:17:26,319 --> 03:17:28,160
publicly

4598
03:17:28,160 --> 03:17:29,760
that being said

4599
03:17:29,760 --> 03:17:30,800
those

4600
03:17:30,800 --> 03:17:32,479
techniques don't

4601
03:17:32,479 --> 03:17:34,560
execute out of thin air

4602
03:17:34,560 --> 03:17:36,640
there still needs to be a payload that

4603
03:17:36,640 --> 03:17:38,640
will implement

4604
03:17:38,640 --> 03:17:40,720
whatever like using speakers and

4605
03:17:40,720 --> 03:17:42,080
microphones or things like that so

4606
03:17:42,080 --> 03:17:43,920
they're still malicious code that will

4607
03:17:43,920 --> 03:17:46,160
implement those techniques and that code

4608
03:17:46,160 --> 03:17:48,060
can be detected so um

4609
03:17:48,060 --> 03:17:50,319
[Music]

4610
03:17:50,319 --> 03:17:52,960
it's not it's those are cool techniques

4611
03:17:52,960 --> 03:17:54,479
for sure

4612
03:17:54,479 --> 03:17:55,520
but

4613
03:17:55,520 --> 03:17:57,680
before if if you manage an air gap

4614
03:17:57,680 --> 03:17:59,920
network before you implement a faraday

4615
03:17:59,920 --> 03:18:01,760
cage around everything

4616
03:18:01,760 --> 03:18:03,920
make sure you tackle the usb stick

4617
03:18:03,920 --> 03:18:06,000
problem first properly

4618
03:18:06,000 --> 03:18:07,439
and that you manage

4619
03:18:07,439 --> 03:18:09,359
software updates and then you can focus

4620
03:18:09,359 --> 03:18:11,920
on on that kind of stuff

4621
03:18:11,920 --> 03:18:17,359
and do you think that the the lack of um

4622
03:18:17,439 --> 03:18:18,640
of

4623
03:18:18,640 --> 03:18:20,720
us seeing it seeing it in the wild is

4624
03:18:20,720 --> 03:18:22,479
due to the fact that we

4625
03:18:22,479 --> 03:18:24,399
we don't have the telemetry we don't we

4626
03:18:24,399 --> 03:18:26,399
couldn't actually collect them

4627
03:18:26,399 --> 03:18:28,560
it's a it's a factor but then again what

4628
03:18:28,560 --> 03:18:31,359
what we detect in terms of like the

4629
03:18:31,359 --> 03:18:33,680
malware that we know that uses usb we

4630
03:18:33,680 --> 03:18:37,040
don't necessarily detect the use of usb

4631
03:18:37,040 --> 03:18:40,080
as a covert mechanism itself will detect

4632
03:18:40,080 --> 03:18:42,479
the files like the malware that will

4633
03:18:42,479 --> 03:18:45,600
write to usb to usb drives or that will

4634
03:18:45,600 --> 03:18:47,760
gain persistence on the system or that

4635
03:18:47,760 --> 03:18:49,279
will

4636
03:18:49,279 --> 03:18:50,960
iterate on the file system and find

4637
03:18:50,960 --> 03:18:55,279
files to to to copy um so the the

4638
03:18:55,279 --> 03:18:57,040
physical communication mechanism that

4639
03:18:57,040 --> 03:18:58,960
jumps the air gap is just one tiny part

4640
03:18:58,960 --> 03:19:01,120
of the whole attack and even though it's

4641
03:19:01,120 --> 03:19:03,279
yeah of course it's hard to detect like

4642
03:19:03,279 --> 03:19:05,600
lights flashing at a certain speed

4643
03:19:05,600 --> 03:19:08,000
um it's hard to detect but there's a

4644
03:19:08,000 --> 03:19:09,600
plenty of other things that that can be

4645
03:19:09,600 --> 03:19:12,479
detected so i'm i think that it's not

4646
03:19:12,479 --> 03:19:14,560
necessarily because of lack of being

4647
03:19:14,560 --> 03:19:16,560
able to detect that that we don't see it

4648
03:19:16,560 --> 03:19:18,479
in the wild

4649
03:19:18,479 --> 03:19:21,200
i have a follow-up question but i think

4650
03:19:21,200 --> 03:19:24,000
everyone can can answer uh well give

4651
03:19:24,000 --> 03:19:26,239
their opinion

4652
03:19:26,239 --> 03:19:28,560
is about how you know it's always more

4653
03:19:28,560 --> 03:19:31,680
sexy to talk about the the how we break

4654
03:19:31,680 --> 03:19:33,040
stuff you know the

4655
03:19:33,040 --> 03:19:35,920
uh how are we we're actually able to uh

4656
03:19:35,920 --> 03:19:37,920
compromise something or

4657
03:19:37,920 --> 03:19:39,439
uh

4658
03:19:39,439 --> 03:19:41,680
talk about potential uh

4659
03:19:41,680 --> 03:19:42,720
attacks

4660
03:19:42,720 --> 03:19:43,520
uh

4661
03:19:43,520 --> 03:19:45,040
but

4662
03:19:45,040 --> 03:19:48,160
it seems that we get more and less media

4663
03:19:48,160 --> 03:19:49,920
attention when it comes to

4664
03:19:49,920 --> 03:19:50,960
new ways

4665
03:19:50,960 --> 03:19:53,439
around protecting against those those

4666
03:19:53,439 --> 03:19:54,399
attacks

4667
03:19:54,399 --> 03:19:56,080
do you think as an industry we should

4668
03:19:56,080 --> 03:19:58,319
focus more on

4669
03:19:58,319 --> 03:20:00,640
the novel defense techniques rather than

4670
03:20:00,640 --> 03:20:04,560
always like spending so much effort into

4671
03:20:04,560 --> 03:20:05,359
uh

4672
03:20:05,359 --> 03:20:07,840
like red team or you know

4673
03:20:07,840 --> 03:20:09,279
trying to break

4674
03:20:09,279 --> 03:20:12,000
the the the

4675
03:20:12,000 --> 03:20:16,239
the security of the different systems

4676
03:20:16,479 --> 03:20:20,160
so i've got an opinion on that but

4677
03:20:20,160 --> 03:20:22,319
let's hear you first then

4678
03:20:22,319 --> 03:20:23,760
of course it makes better headlines

4679
03:20:23,760 --> 03:20:25,760
saying this is how i broke that instead

4680
03:20:25,760 --> 03:20:28,560
of this is how i defendant against a

4681
03:20:28,560 --> 03:20:31,120
hypothetical attack um but the problem

4682
03:20:31,120 --> 03:20:32,960
when you show how to break something

4683
03:20:32,960 --> 03:20:35,120
without showing how to defend against it

4684
03:20:35,120 --> 03:20:36,640
like who is

4685
03:20:36,640 --> 03:20:38,960
who will benefit from that information

4686
03:20:38,960 --> 03:20:40,880
who benefits from a technique to break

4687
03:20:40,880 --> 03:20:44,479
something that cannot be defended yet

4688
03:20:44,479 --> 03:20:46,560
so i think it's the responsible thing is

4689
03:20:46,560 --> 03:20:48,160
at least to give some ideas sometimes it

4690
03:20:48,160 --> 03:20:50,319
cannot be fixed easily but at least

4691
03:20:50,319 --> 03:20:52,319
give some some ideas how to mitigate how

4692
03:20:52,319 --> 03:20:53,439
to detect

4693
03:20:53,439 --> 03:20:55,279
otherwise you're just giving hints for

4694
03:20:55,279 --> 03:20:59,040
attackers to to break more stuff

4695
03:21:02,960 --> 03:21:04,880
and i'd also add that it's also a

4696
03:21:04,880 --> 03:21:06,319
question of like

4697
03:21:06,319 --> 03:21:08,319
oh sorry

4698
03:21:08,319 --> 03:21:11,680
hello okay so i agree with that and i'd

4699
03:21:11,680 --> 03:21:13,520
also like to add that it's a question of

4700
03:21:13,520 --> 03:21:16,080
risk assessment as well um so

4701
03:21:16,080 --> 03:21:18,160
you know attackers and i mean even

4702
03:21:18,160 --> 03:21:19,760
including ourselves that are not

4703
03:21:19,760 --> 03:21:22,479
attackers we're still kind of lazy right

4704
03:21:22,479 --> 03:21:24,560
so you will try to find that low hanging

4705
03:21:24,560 --> 03:21:25,920
fruit and that's kind of what you're

4706
03:21:25,920 --> 03:21:28,720
gonna start by going after

4707
03:21:28,720 --> 03:21:29,840
and so

4708
03:21:29,840 --> 03:21:31,680
yes all these flashy new techniques are

4709
03:21:31,680 --> 03:21:33,840
very great and stuff i don't think they

4710
03:21:33,840 --> 03:21:35,520
have to be overlooked i think they're

4711
03:21:35,520 --> 03:21:37,680
worth talking about but we have to not

4712
03:21:37,680 --> 03:21:39,600
forget that things like defense and

4713
03:21:39,600 --> 03:21:41,520
death and

4714
03:21:41,520 --> 03:21:42,800
making sure that you have all your

4715
03:21:42,800 --> 03:21:45,439
basics covered are also really worth it

4716
03:21:45,439 --> 03:21:47,680
as well

4717
03:21:51,279 --> 03:21:54,319
okay so um

4718
03:21:54,560 --> 03:21:56,880
i've had a question for you uh

4719
03:21:56,880 --> 03:22:00,560
regarding your your presentation

4720
03:22:00,560 --> 03:22:02,319
um so

4721
03:22:02,319 --> 03:22:04,840
do you think it would be possible to

4722
03:22:04,840 --> 03:22:07,680
further help the compilation

4723
03:22:07,680 --> 03:22:10,560
uh to just to see an equivalent of the

4724
03:22:10,560 --> 03:22:14,000
javascript that was actually

4725
03:22:14,000 --> 03:22:16,560
used as source for the for producing the

4726
03:22:16,560 --> 03:22:18,560
v8 snapshots

4727
03:22:18,560 --> 03:22:20,000
yes certainly and that's a great

4728
03:22:20,000 --> 03:22:22,880
question so what we saw was a okay

4729
03:22:22,880 --> 03:22:25,040
result and we were able to work with it

4730
03:22:25,040 --> 03:22:26,720
but it was not ideal

4731
03:22:26,720 --> 03:22:29,120
and i do believe that we could make that

4732
03:22:29,120 --> 03:22:32,399
a lot better um especially regarding

4733
03:22:32,399 --> 03:22:34,080
like all these properties so like when

4734
03:22:34,080 --> 03:22:36,960
we're you know loading a library and it

4735
03:22:36,960 --> 03:22:38,479
you know you do like dot something dot

4736
03:22:38,479 --> 03:22:40,560
something dot something it creates like

4737
03:22:40,560 --> 03:22:41,760
tens and

4738
03:22:41,760 --> 03:22:43,520
lines of codes and it's like really hard

4739
03:22:43,520 --> 03:22:45,760
to read so i do believe that the next

4740
03:22:45,760 --> 03:22:48,319
steps for that specific tool will be to

4741
03:22:48,319 --> 03:22:50,720
improve the result of the decompilation

4742
03:22:50,720 --> 03:22:54,239
and i do think that it's possible yeah

4743
03:22:54,880 --> 03:22:57,278
thank you

4744
03:23:00,960 --> 03:23:03,520
i have a question for ashir

4745
03:23:03,520 --> 03:23:05,920
um so um

4746
03:23:05,920 --> 03:23:08,080
regarding the canary tokens

4747
03:23:08,080 --> 03:23:10,319
uh so

4748
03:23:10,319 --> 03:23:12,720
what do you think uh

4749
03:23:12,720 --> 03:23:13,520
so

4750
03:23:13,520 --> 03:23:17,680
when people make defensive tools

4751
03:23:17,680 --> 03:23:18,560
when they

4752
03:23:18,560 --> 03:23:20,239
provide some kind of

4753
03:23:20,239 --> 03:23:22,080
services that can be used as canary

4754
03:23:22,080 --> 03:23:25,120
token is there any mitigations that they

4755
03:23:25,120 --> 03:23:29,200
can use to avoid misuse by bad actors

4756
03:23:29,200 --> 03:23:31,520
yeah so uh canary tokens is one of the

4757
03:23:31,520 --> 03:23:33,359
tools and services that fall into the

4758
03:23:33,359 --> 03:23:35,040
grey area you know they can be used by

4759
03:23:35,040 --> 03:23:37,200
legitimate parties such as red teamers

4760
03:23:37,200 --> 03:23:38,960
but they can also be used by bad

4761
03:23:38,960 --> 03:23:40,960
adversaries to serve their purposes as

4762
03:23:40,960 --> 03:23:43,680
well i think it's very important for

4763
03:23:43,680 --> 03:23:46,000
service providers of these services to

4764
03:23:46,000 --> 03:23:48,880
proactively figure out if their platform

4765
03:23:48,880 --> 03:23:50,640
is being misused

4766
03:23:50,640 --> 03:23:52,960
and also it is the responsibility of the

4767
03:23:52,960 --> 03:23:54,399
community you know researchers like us

4768
03:23:54,399 --> 03:23:55,760
so that we can provide the right kind of

4769
03:23:55,760 --> 03:23:58,319
threat intelligence that prompts people

4770
03:23:58,319 --> 03:23:59,200
and

4771
03:23:59,200 --> 03:24:02,720
organizations to block uh certain events

4772
03:24:02,720 --> 03:24:04,319
that are being used or certain artifacts

4773
03:24:04,319 --> 03:24:06,319
that are actually misusing them

4774
03:24:06,319 --> 03:24:08,319
so you have to have a proactive model

4775
03:24:08,319 --> 03:24:09,920
where they can do take downs and they

4776
03:24:09,920 --> 03:24:12,720
can proactively go out and find

4777
03:24:12,720 --> 03:24:14,960
misuse of their platforms this is for

4778
03:24:14,960 --> 03:24:16,560
for the service providers and then you

4779
03:24:16,560 --> 03:24:17,920
have to couple that with the right kind

4780
03:24:17,920 --> 03:24:19,920
of threat intelligence so that other

4781
03:24:19,920 --> 03:24:21,359
organizations can also protect

4782
03:24:21,359 --> 03:24:23,920
themselves you know until a vendor or a

4783
03:24:23,920 --> 03:24:27,120
service provider takes action

4784
03:24:27,120 --> 03:24:30,160
and i have another question do you think

4785
03:24:30,160 --> 03:24:32,160
it's also a

4786
03:24:32,160 --> 03:24:34,560
a problem because

4787
03:24:34,560 --> 03:24:37,600
those canary tokens generate logs on

4788
03:24:37,600 --> 03:24:40,880
someone's server uh and do you think

4789
03:24:40,880 --> 03:24:43,920
that can be used to further uh find

4790
03:24:43,920 --> 03:24:45,920
identify victims

4791
03:24:45,920 --> 03:24:49,040
and perhaps uh help

4792
03:24:49,040 --> 03:24:50,399
remediation

4793
03:24:50,399 --> 03:24:53,600
correct so uh using third party services

4794
03:24:53,600 --> 03:24:55,840
like canary tokens you know that that

4795
03:24:55,840 --> 03:24:57,520
would leave logs which can be recovered

4796
03:24:57,520 --> 03:24:59,200
and tracked sometimes even by the

4797
03:24:59,200 --> 03:25:00,720
service providers

4798
03:25:00,720 --> 03:25:03,439
um it's it's uh

4799
03:25:03,439 --> 03:25:05,600
you know it's uh they can they can be

4800
03:25:05,600 --> 03:25:06,640
used

4801
03:25:06,640 --> 03:25:09,279
in any form uh the problem here is that

4802
03:25:09,279 --> 03:25:12,319
uh canary tokens are not usually um you

4803
03:25:12,319 --> 03:25:13,760
know something like canary tokens is not

4804
03:25:13,760 --> 03:25:14,880
usually by

4805
03:25:14,880 --> 03:25:17,520
blocked is is a part of block lists so

4806
03:25:17,520 --> 03:25:18,960
it becomes a problem for various

4807
03:25:18,960 --> 03:25:20,720
remediation teams to figure out whether

4808
03:25:20,720 --> 03:25:22,160
this is actually red team activity or

4809
03:25:22,160 --> 03:25:23,439
this is an actual adversary in your

4810
03:25:23,439 --> 03:25:25,359
networks that's actually doing some

4811
03:25:25,359 --> 03:25:28,319
activity of this form

4812
03:25:30,880 --> 03:25:32,000
all right so

4813
03:25:32,000 --> 03:25:35,520
thank you we have uh some more general

4814
03:25:35,520 --> 03:25:36,319
uh

4815
03:25:36,319 --> 03:25:38,319
question as well that everyone can can

4816
03:25:38,319 --> 03:25:39,359
answer

4817
03:25:39,359 --> 03:25:41,600
um

4818
03:25:43,359 --> 03:25:44,160
so

4819
03:25:44,160 --> 03:25:46,319
there was a question about if we are

4820
03:25:46,319 --> 03:25:47,439
seeing

4821
03:25:47,439 --> 03:25:49,520
uh if there's an increase in trends in

4822
03:25:49,520 --> 03:25:51,439
malware trying to steal or generate

4823
03:25:51,439 --> 03:25:54,319
cryptocurrencies

4824
03:25:54,319 --> 03:25:58,160
on non-traditional targets

4825
03:25:59,040 --> 03:26:00,720
this is something we've

4826
03:26:00,720 --> 03:26:04,358
you've seen or

4827
03:26:05,840 --> 03:26:07,279
so i'm not the

4828
03:26:07,279 --> 03:26:08,880
the expert at

4829
03:26:08,880 --> 03:26:11,359
eset in in that field um

4830
03:26:11,359 --> 03:26:13,920
what's super common is uh

4831
03:26:13,920 --> 03:26:16,319
is iot botnets deploying

4832
03:26:16,319 --> 03:26:19,359
uh miners there for

4833
03:26:19,359 --> 03:26:21,040
some reason because those are not really

4834
03:26:21,040 --> 03:26:23,840
powerful machines um

4835
03:26:23,840 --> 03:26:24,960
what's

4836
03:26:24,960 --> 03:26:26,080
what's more

4837
03:26:26,080 --> 03:26:28,239
uh what makes the most money i guess is

4838
03:26:28,239 --> 03:26:31,279
stealing rather than mining crypto

4839
03:26:31,279 --> 03:26:33,760
and that that's uh that's going on quite

4840
03:26:33,760 --> 03:26:36,720
uh quite intensely right now

4841
03:26:36,720 --> 03:26:37,600
yes

4842
03:26:37,600 --> 03:26:40,080
yeah mining requires i think uh a huge

4843
03:26:40,080 --> 03:26:42,160
botnet rather than stealing where you

4844
03:26:42,160 --> 03:26:44,479
just have a single target that

4845
03:26:44,479 --> 03:26:47,840
you must compromise

4846
03:26:52,720 --> 03:26:53,439
so

4847
03:26:53,439 --> 03:26:55,760
now our research you know

4848
03:26:55,760 --> 03:26:57,040
we've been doing

4849
03:26:57,040 --> 03:26:58,960
well the the field of maori research has

4850
03:26:58,960 --> 03:27:00,960
been has been there for

4851
03:27:00,960 --> 03:27:04,800
about 30 years now it's quite

4852
03:27:04,800 --> 03:27:06,319
quite long

4853
03:27:06,319 --> 03:27:08,880
recently we've seen a

4854
03:27:08,880 --> 03:27:12,679
new kind of uh

4855
03:27:14,239 --> 03:27:17,520
a job title but you know uh helping in

4856
03:27:17,520 --> 03:27:21,200
in in in this this research uh called uh

4857
03:27:21,200 --> 03:27:23,920
threat researchers uh where uh there's

4858
03:27:23,920 --> 03:27:25,520
um

4859
03:27:25,520 --> 03:27:27,120
uh

4860
03:27:27,120 --> 03:27:28,560
people with

4861
03:27:28,560 --> 03:27:30,640
no or a little

4862
03:27:30,640 --> 03:27:33,120
knowledge about reverse engineering

4863
03:27:33,120 --> 03:27:35,600
trying to identify malware campaigns and

4864
03:27:35,600 --> 03:27:36,640
so on

4865
03:27:36,640 --> 03:27:38,000
um

4866
03:27:38,000 --> 03:27:41,040
do you think that there's

4867
03:27:41,040 --> 03:27:43,040
a risk that uh

4868
03:27:43,040 --> 03:27:45,520
attacks get wrongly attributed or that

4869
03:27:45,520 --> 03:27:48,960
there's missing technical information

4870
03:27:48,960 --> 03:27:50,479
uh when

4871
03:27:50,479 --> 03:27:51,680
uh

4872
03:27:51,680 --> 03:27:53,840
so that if do you think that there's a

4873
03:27:53,840 --> 03:27:56,399
trend that we are uh

4874
03:27:56,399 --> 03:27:58,239
perhaps uh

4875
03:27:58,239 --> 03:27:59,120
not

4876
03:27:59,120 --> 03:28:01,600
giving the the the public

4877
03:28:01,600 --> 03:28:02,960
the the

4878
03:28:02,960 --> 03:28:04,720
the

4879
03:28:04,720 --> 03:28:06,560
factual or scientific

4880
03:28:06,560 --> 03:28:09,560
output

4881
03:28:11,680 --> 03:28:13,920
um for sure i think

4882
03:28:13,920 --> 03:28:16,800
the first part is that attribution is

4883
03:28:16,800 --> 03:28:19,439
hard so there's many many threats and

4884
03:28:19,439 --> 03:28:22,479
some of them use common ttps right

4885
03:28:22,479 --> 03:28:24,399
tactics procedures

4886
03:28:24,399 --> 03:28:27,359
and it is hard sometimes to distinguish

4887
03:28:27,359 --> 03:28:29,359
them between themselves

4888
03:28:29,359 --> 03:28:30,239
but

4889
03:28:30,239 --> 03:28:31,760
i do think it's kind of like a best

4890
03:28:31,760 --> 03:28:33,920
effort and because there's so much

4891
03:28:33,920 --> 03:28:35,920
industry collaboration in the field i

4892
03:28:35,920 --> 03:28:38,239
find it makes it so much easier for

4893
03:28:38,239 --> 03:28:39,680
researchers

4894
03:28:39,680 --> 03:28:42,239
and so it ultimately helps the public

4895
03:28:42,239 --> 03:28:43,359
have

4896
03:28:43,359 --> 03:28:45,760
the best information

4897
03:28:45,760 --> 03:28:47,439
it's not perfect but it's the best

4898
03:28:47,439 --> 03:28:50,239
effort i find

4899
03:28:51,680 --> 03:28:53,120
i think

4900
03:28:53,120 --> 03:28:55,200
the truth is in the code

4901
03:28:55,200 --> 03:28:57,439
so whenever malware is involved you

4902
03:28:57,439 --> 03:28:59,840
can't fully understand what's going on

4903
03:28:59,840 --> 03:29:02,720
without reverse engineering thoroughly

4904
03:29:02,720 --> 03:29:05,040
the the samples

4905
03:29:05,040 --> 03:29:07,840
we actually had a case last week i think

4906
03:29:07,840 --> 03:29:09,600
where um

4907
03:29:09,600 --> 03:29:11,439
some some people put up a blog post

4908
03:29:11,439 --> 03:29:13,680
saying they found similarity between is

4909
03:29:13,680 --> 03:29:16,080
in destroyer 2 and another malware

4910
03:29:16,080 --> 03:29:17,120
family

4911
03:29:17,120 --> 03:29:18,880
and they use the code similarity

4912
03:29:18,880 --> 03:29:21,120
analysis techniques and indeed there

4913
03:29:21,120 --> 03:29:23,760
were some parts of the code in industry

4914
03:29:23,760 --> 03:29:25,439
2 that was very

4915
03:29:25,439 --> 03:29:27,279
pretty much identical to parts of the

4916
03:29:27,279 --> 03:29:29,359
code in that other malware family which

4917
03:29:29,359 --> 03:29:31,680
i forgot the name of

4918
03:29:31,680 --> 03:29:33,600
so they were like oh why why is this

4919
03:29:33,600 --> 03:29:36,000
going on is there a connection with with

4920
03:29:36,000 --> 03:29:36,880
that

4921
03:29:36,880 --> 03:29:38,640
um

4922
03:29:38,640 --> 03:29:41,120
the problem is that one of our reverse

4923
03:29:41,120 --> 03:29:42,479
engineers spotted that the code

4924
03:29:42,479 --> 03:29:44,720
similarity was in like standard

4925
03:29:44,720 --> 03:29:46,000
libraries

4926
03:29:46,000 --> 03:29:50,399
that are probably present in 75 of

4927
03:29:50,399 --> 03:29:51,600
c code

4928
03:29:51,600 --> 03:29:54,479
um so yes there was similarity but

4929
03:29:54,479 --> 03:29:56,239
the person doing the analysis didn't

4930
03:29:56,239 --> 03:29:58,960
understand what they were looking at

4931
03:29:58,960 --> 03:30:01,439
so that led to some

4932
03:30:01,439 --> 03:30:04,800
very very wrong attribution and

4933
03:30:04,800 --> 03:30:07,840
we actually called it out i think

4934
03:30:07,840 --> 03:30:09,840
nicely but

4935
03:30:09,840 --> 03:30:11,279
and they updated the blog post saying

4936
03:30:11,279 --> 03:30:13,359
further research showed that oh it's not

4937
03:30:13,359 --> 03:30:15,200
a real connection but so it's important

4938
03:30:15,200 --> 03:30:17,760
to pay attention to those to reversing

4939
03:30:17,760 --> 03:30:18,960
because

4940
03:30:18,960 --> 03:30:21,120
as i said the truth is in the code i

4941
03:30:21,120 --> 03:30:23,439
believe

4942
03:30:25,439 --> 03:30:27,920
hi there okay um i guess i want to add

4943
03:30:27,920 --> 03:30:29,120
to that to

4944
03:30:29,120 --> 03:30:31,760
leon and alex that would make well it

4945
03:30:31,760 --> 03:30:33,279
points about

4946
03:30:33,279 --> 03:30:35,120
code and

4947
03:30:35,120 --> 03:30:37,200
you know that's where a lot of the

4948
03:30:37,200 --> 03:30:38,479
pudding is

4949
03:30:38,479 --> 03:30:41,840
but also i've seen code that would

4950
03:30:41,840 --> 03:30:45,040
trick analysts into thinking that oh

4951
03:30:45,040 --> 03:30:47,359
this attribution i see some interesting

4952
03:30:47,359 --> 03:30:49,840
strings like it may look like it comes

4953
03:30:49,840 --> 03:30:51,520
from a particular group

4954
03:30:51,520 --> 03:30:52,800
and uh

4955
03:30:52,800 --> 03:30:54,720
and and this is where i think the

4956
03:30:54,720 --> 03:30:56,960
original question was you know there are

4957
03:30:56,960 --> 03:30:59,279
individuals out there that do

4958
03:30:59,279 --> 03:31:01,680
data analysis they try to look at this

4959
03:31:01,680 --> 03:31:02,560
um

4960
03:31:02,560 --> 03:31:04,319
they try to make uh i guess with

4961
03:31:04,319 --> 03:31:05,920
whatever existing data they're looking

4962
03:31:05,920 --> 03:31:07,840
at to make attribution

4963
03:31:07,840 --> 03:31:10,640
uh they are also those individuals also

4964
03:31:10,640 --> 03:31:13,359
are important in a controversially

4965
03:31:13,359 --> 03:31:15,600
speaking manner but i think the key is

4966
03:31:15,600 --> 03:31:18,319
when you have reversers and analysts

4967
03:31:18,319 --> 03:31:19,680
work together

4968
03:31:19,680 --> 03:31:20,560
and

4969
03:31:20,560 --> 03:31:23,120
that's also kind of where i come from in

4970
03:31:23,120 --> 03:31:26,319
my field of work and i i have to always

4971
03:31:26,319 --> 03:31:27,600
i create

4972
03:31:27,600 --> 03:31:29,840
a lot of um

4973
03:31:29,840 --> 03:31:31,840
write-up on what i've reversed but also

4974
03:31:31,840 --> 03:31:34,399
i work with analysts to see what they

4975
03:31:34,399 --> 03:31:36,080
have on their end and it's a lot of

4976
03:31:36,080 --> 03:31:38,160
discussion from there on and i think

4977
03:31:38,160 --> 03:31:40,720
it's it's like that it's it's a hard

4978
03:31:40,720 --> 03:31:43,040
thing attribution but it's a

4979
03:31:43,040 --> 03:31:44,960
never-ending

4980
03:31:44,960 --> 03:31:47,438
process

4981
03:31:50,560 --> 03:31:54,239
thank you um

4982
03:31:54,239 --> 03:31:58,000
i have another question um so uh we

4983
03:31:58,000 --> 03:32:00,160
we've seen we've seen it during the the

4984
03:32:00,160 --> 03:32:02,560
in the invasion of ukraine but also in

4985
03:32:02,560 --> 03:32:05,279
in previous conflict uh but i think it's

4986
03:32:05,279 --> 03:32:07,520
it's been

4987
03:32:07,520 --> 03:32:09,920
i think it's never been as clear uh

4988
03:32:09,920 --> 03:32:11,439
during the past few months in ukraine

4989
03:32:11,439 --> 03:32:12,800
that malware

4990
03:32:12,800 --> 03:32:17,040
is used in in the context of war

4991
03:32:17,040 --> 03:32:19,840
do you think that malware research

4992
03:32:19,840 --> 03:32:20,840
as

4993
03:32:20,840 --> 03:32:23,520
a field as

4994
03:32:23,520 --> 03:32:25,439
an impact outside of the technical

4995
03:32:25,439 --> 03:32:26,640
sphere so

4996
03:32:26,640 --> 03:32:28,960
we talk about about we talk a lot about

4997
03:32:28,960 --> 03:32:31,600
our analysis but do you think that

4998
03:32:31,600 --> 03:32:34,160
our work actually

4999
03:32:34,160 --> 03:32:37,279
has repercussion outside of the

5000
03:32:37,279 --> 03:32:38,720
technical

5001
03:32:38,720 --> 03:32:41,119
crowd

5002
03:32:43,120 --> 03:32:45,359
yes

5003
03:32:46,479 --> 03:32:49,279
but to what extent

5004
03:32:49,279 --> 03:32:52,000
uh of course it has some repercussions

5005
03:32:52,000 --> 03:32:54,080
how how much it's hard to tell you know

5006
03:32:54,080 --> 03:32:56,080
if you document

5007
03:32:56,080 --> 03:32:58,720
a campaign or an attack that was never

5008
03:32:58,720 --> 03:33:00,399
discovered before

5009
03:33:00,399 --> 03:33:02,080
you're gonna expose tactics you're gonna

5010
03:33:02,080 --> 03:33:05,600
expose assets used by the attackers

5011
03:33:05,600 --> 03:33:07,520
some attackers will immediately like

5012
03:33:07,520 --> 03:33:09,920
pivot to something totally different

5013
03:33:09,920 --> 03:33:11,760
some attackers will keep using the same

5014
03:33:11,760 --> 03:33:14,000
c2s the same malware just tweak it a

5015
03:33:14,000 --> 03:33:15,200
little bit

5016
03:33:15,200 --> 03:33:16,000
in

5017
03:33:16,000 --> 03:33:17,840
in those cases did the publication

5018
03:33:17,840 --> 03:33:19,279
really have an impact

5019
03:33:19,279 --> 03:33:22,720
maybe not or it helped people defend

5020
03:33:22,720 --> 03:33:25,279
better i guess um

5021
03:33:25,279 --> 03:33:27,840
so it's a trick question i think we will

5022
03:33:27,840 --> 03:33:30,000
never know how much impact our

5023
03:33:30,000 --> 03:33:32,720
publications will have because those

5024
03:33:32,720 --> 03:33:35,439
impacted our governments and they won't

5025
03:33:35,439 --> 03:33:37,840
call us saying hey screw you you messed

5026
03:33:37,840 --> 03:33:41,600
up our attack or something like that

5027
03:33:43,200 --> 03:33:45,600
anyone else

5028
03:33:45,600 --> 03:33:47,680
no okay i'd like to hear uh sharer's

5029
03:33:47,680 --> 03:33:50,160
take on that one

5030
03:33:50,160 --> 03:33:52,399
all right so so i believe that the the

5031
03:33:52,399 --> 03:33:55,279
intelligence that we generate uh leads

5032
03:33:55,279 --> 03:33:56,960
to protection mechanisms you know

5033
03:33:56,960 --> 03:33:57,920
existing

5034
03:33:57,920 --> 03:33:59,680
enhancement of existing mechanisms as

5035
03:33:59,680 --> 03:34:02,239
well as creating new mechanisms

5036
03:34:02,239 --> 03:34:04,720
and uh when we stop and attack at the

5037
03:34:04,720 --> 03:34:07,359
right time whether it's for a

5038
03:34:07,359 --> 03:34:09,600
critical services you know utility or

5039
03:34:09,600 --> 03:34:11,840
for a hospital

5040
03:34:11,840 --> 03:34:14,880
we don't know we don't really in certain

5041
03:34:14,880 --> 03:34:17,120
instances we don't really know how much

5042
03:34:17,120 --> 03:34:18,720
of the attack we actually stopped and

5043
03:34:18,720 --> 03:34:20,399
you know how much of the damage we

5044
03:34:20,399 --> 03:34:21,920
actually prevented

5045
03:34:21,920 --> 03:34:23,600
and uh you know that's a conundrum

5046
03:34:23,600 --> 03:34:24,720
because you know we want to stop and

5047
03:34:24,720 --> 03:34:26,720
attack as soon as possible but if we do

5048
03:34:26,720 --> 03:34:28,319
that you know sometimes we don't know

5049
03:34:28,319 --> 03:34:30,560
the scope of the entire operation

5050
03:34:30,560 --> 03:34:33,279
and um so it's very important the work

5051
03:34:33,279 --> 03:34:34,960
that we do even if we publish

5052
03:34:34,960 --> 03:34:37,040
disclosures where the attackers are not

5053
03:34:37,040 --> 03:34:39,120
forced to change their ttps i'm very

5054
03:34:39,120 --> 03:34:40,880
sure that in one form or the other we

5055
03:34:40,880 --> 03:34:42,800
are protecting some of our customers or

5056
03:34:42,800 --> 03:34:44,960
the you know the general public as a

5057
03:34:44,960 --> 03:34:47,199
whole

5058
03:34:49,439 --> 03:34:51,520
we have two two interesting questions

5059
03:34:51,520 --> 03:34:53,680
from the audience

5060
03:34:53,680 --> 03:34:56,319
the first one is regarding the trust of

5061
03:34:56,319 --> 03:34:58,479
the security vendors so the security

5062
03:34:58,479 --> 03:35:00,160
products you install

5063
03:35:00,160 --> 03:35:02,160
how do you address the issue of trusting

5064
03:35:02,160 --> 03:35:03,279
that vendor

5065
03:35:03,279 --> 03:35:05,600
and the possibility that it may be

5066
03:35:05,600 --> 03:35:08,000
compromised or

5067
03:35:08,000 --> 03:35:10,479
over oversight by their respective

5068
03:35:10,479 --> 03:35:12,960
government

5069
03:35:15,760 --> 03:35:18,000
that's a political question to be honest

5070
03:35:18,000 --> 03:35:18,880
yes

5071
03:35:18,880 --> 03:35:22,319
not really a technical question

5072
03:35:22,720 --> 03:35:25,439
i'll just say that honestly this is out

5073
03:35:25,439 --> 03:35:27,200
of my field of qualifications and i'm

5074
03:35:27,200 --> 03:35:29,840
not qualified for

5075
03:35:29,840 --> 03:35:32,960
sorry captain kangaroo

5076
03:35:33,040 --> 03:35:35,359
um

5077
03:35:35,680 --> 03:35:39,479
the other one was

5078
03:35:45,520 --> 03:35:47,600
yes the other one was

5079
03:35:47,600 --> 03:35:48,560
whether

5080
03:35:48,560 --> 03:35:52,319
we've seen an increase in mobile uh

5081
03:35:52,319 --> 03:35:54,720
malware

5082
03:35:54,720 --> 03:35:58,319
and uh versus desktop malware or

5083
03:35:58,319 --> 03:36:02,239
versus what desktop malware like regular

5084
03:36:02,239 --> 03:36:05,640
stuff we see

5085
03:36:07,680 --> 03:36:10,560
i've got another one the the um

5086
03:36:10,560 --> 03:36:13,439
he said it's it's for the the

5087
03:36:13,439 --> 03:36:16,000
noobs but i don't think it's it's it's i

5088
03:36:16,000 --> 03:36:18,160
think it's a good question is is about

5089
03:36:18,160 --> 03:36:20,080
how attribution works how how do we

5090
03:36:20,080 --> 03:36:21,279
decide

5091
03:36:21,279 --> 03:36:25,520
uh to publish an assessment on uh the

5092
03:36:25,520 --> 03:36:26,880
the uh

5093
03:36:26,880 --> 03:36:28,720
that this

5094
03:36:28,720 --> 03:36:30,560
attack was performed by a particular

5095
03:36:30,560 --> 03:36:32,000
group

5096
03:36:32,000 --> 03:36:34,640
and if we have thresholds for

5097
03:36:34,640 --> 03:36:36,239
thinking we have enough evidence or

5098
03:36:36,239 --> 03:36:37,520
clues that

5099
03:36:37,520 --> 03:36:41,200
uh it's uh it's them

5100
03:36:43,359 --> 03:36:46,720
it's a difficult question actually

5101
03:36:46,720 --> 03:36:49,279
i can try yeah sure

5102
03:36:49,279 --> 03:36:50,160
um

5103
03:36:50,160 --> 03:36:52,319
so i guess it's how do you assess how do

5104
03:36:52,319 --> 03:36:55,040
you yeah um

5105
03:36:55,040 --> 03:36:58,239
it's a hard one and every time i have to

5106
03:36:58,239 --> 03:37:00,319
write an intel report on a piece of

5107
03:37:00,319 --> 03:37:01,600
malware

5108
03:37:01,600 --> 03:37:04,080
i am constantly reviewed and critiqued

5109
03:37:04,080 --> 03:37:06,399
on my assessment

5110
03:37:06,399 --> 03:37:08,560
but a lot of the criteria is it's i

5111
03:37:08,560 --> 03:37:11,760
guess it's easier for those as reverse

5112
03:37:11,760 --> 03:37:13,600
engineers because you

5113
03:37:13,600 --> 03:37:16,319
look at code and that's a bit more

5114
03:37:16,319 --> 03:37:19,520
factual and i can especially if you see

5115
03:37:19,520 --> 03:37:21,680
a particular technique doing something

5116
03:37:21,680 --> 03:37:24,479
and it then it can then it's a high

5117
03:37:24,479 --> 03:37:27,200
probability a high confidence that that

5118
03:37:27,200 --> 03:37:30,239
proves that thing but you can but when

5119
03:37:30,239 --> 03:37:31,920
it comes to answering questions like do

5120
03:37:31,920 --> 03:37:34,560
you know or can you foresee how this

5121
03:37:34,560 --> 03:37:37,200
piece of malware this attacker will plan

5122
03:37:37,200 --> 03:37:38,800
their next move

5123
03:37:38,800 --> 03:37:40,880
that's difficult and that's not an

5124
03:37:40,880 --> 03:37:42,399
assessment that i

5125
03:37:42,399 --> 03:37:44,720
would like to write and i try to avoid

5126
03:37:44,720 --> 03:37:45,920
that

5127
03:37:45,920 --> 03:37:47,040
so

5128
03:37:47,040 --> 03:37:48,800
it depends on the individual so when i

5129
03:37:48,800 --> 03:37:51,439
do an assessment it's very technical

5130
03:37:51,439 --> 03:37:55,120
and that's how i like to keep it

5131
03:37:57,120 --> 03:37:59,760
i agree with that and i'd also like to

5132
03:37:59,760 --> 03:38:02,720
add that sometimes we do let get lucky

5133
03:38:02,720 --> 03:38:06,319
um so the opsec of the threat actors is

5134
03:38:06,319 --> 03:38:08,720
not always on point and it happens where

5135
03:38:08,720 --> 03:38:10,720
we do get lucky and we kind of

5136
03:38:10,720 --> 03:38:12,640
gain extra insights into who these

5137
03:38:12,640 --> 03:38:15,120
peoples are who these people are or

5138
03:38:15,120 --> 03:38:16,479
how are they

5139
03:38:16,479 --> 03:38:19,279
doing things and why and it's purely out

5140
03:38:19,279 --> 03:38:23,120
of luck so this does happen

5141
03:38:23,120 --> 03:38:25,520
and there's no one recipe to attribute

5142
03:38:25,520 --> 03:38:28,239
an attack to to a threat actor if there

5143
03:38:28,239 --> 03:38:30,479
if there's one uh well we're not aware

5144
03:38:30,479 --> 03:38:31,760
of it

5145
03:38:31,760 --> 03:38:34,080
and there's it's it's about comparing

5146
03:38:34,080 --> 03:38:35,760
different indicators some are really

5147
03:38:35,760 --> 03:38:37,040
strong

5148
03:38:37,040 --> 03:38:39,279
or stronger some are weaker but they

5149
03:38:39,279 --> 03:38:40,800
still matter

5150
03:38:40,800 --> 03:38:42,160
there are technical indicators for

5151
03:38:42,160 --> 03:38:45,199
example a reuse of an ip address that is

5152
03:38:45,199 --> 03:38:47,040
not like a shared hosting provider for

5153
03:38:47,040 --> 03:38:49,760
example that's a fairly good indicator

5154
03:38:49,760 --> 03:38:50,960
it's not foolproof but it's a good

5155
03:38:50,960 --> 03:38:53,359
indicator the malware itself have we

5156
03:38:53,359 --> 03:38:55,439
seen that malware before is that that

5157
03:38:55,439 --> 03:38:57,680
malware was attributed previously

5158
03:38:57,680 --> 03:39:00,080
by the industry as being operated by a

5159
03:39:00,080 --> 03:39:02,800
single entity that is labeled as

5160
03:39:02,800 --> 03:39:04,479
apt something

5161
03:39:04,479 --> 03:39:05,840
and then you've got the targeting you've

5162
03:39:05,840 --> 03:39:06,720
got

5163
03:39:06,720 --> 03:39:09,600
other software ttps uh use of like spear

5164
03:39:09,600 --> 03:39:11,760
phishing or whatever like that are all

5165
03:39:11,760 --> 03:39:13,040
put together

5166
03:39:13,040 --> 03:39:14,399
you can make an assessment that

5167
03:39:14,399 --> 03:39:17,680
everything points to a campaign that was

5168
03:39:17,680 --> 03:39:20,640
launched by this this known actor

5169
03:39:20,640 --> 03:39:22,479
but again it's it's an assessment it's

5170
03:39:22,479 --> 03:39:27,920
not a it's rarely a 100 determination

5171
03:39:31,120 --> 03:39:33,359
do you want to add anything issue

5172
03:39:33,359 --> 03:39:35,840
sure so i agree with everyone on the

5173
03:39:35,840 --> 03:39:39,279
panel uh attribution is hard and um it

5174
03:39:39,279 --> 03:39:41,279
tends to be very subjective at times it

5175
03:39:41,279 --> 03:39:43,279
depends on the amount of information you

5176
03:39:43,279 --> 03:39:44,479
have you know the output of your

5177
03:39:44,479 --> 03:39:46,640
reversing exercises as well

5178
03:39:46,640 --> 03:39:47,600
as your

5179
03:39:47,600 --> 03:39:49,520
institutional knowledge and looking at

5180
03:39:49,520 --> 03:39:50,960
open source intelligence and code

5181
03:39:50,960 --> 03:39:53,279
similarities and stuff like that what i

5182
03:39:53,279 --> 03:39:56,160
also want to highlight here is that

5183
03:39:56,160 --> 03:39:58,720
it's okay if you can't attribute stuff

5184
03:39:58,720 --> 03:40:00,720
it's it's that's that's not a problem

5185
03:40:00,720 --> 03:40:02,800
you know we can convey doubt in an

5186
03:40:02,800 --> 03:40:04,720
effective manner and that's completely

5187
03:40:04,720 --> 03:40:06,239
okay and justified

5188
03:40:06,239 --> 03:40:08,479
you know i'd rather con wait out more

5189
03:40:08,479 --> 03:40:10,319
effectively rather than come up with the

5190
03:40:10,319 --> 03:40:14,080
wrong attribution any day of the week

5191
03:40:14,319 --> 03:40:16,560
all right thank you very much

5192
03:40:16,560 --> 03:40:19,199
and uh thank thanks to everyone for your

5193

15-minute break if i'm not mistaken or

5199
03:40:32,720 --> 03:40:35,040

5298
04:00:18,680 --> 04:00:21,439
video by saying

5299
04:00:21,439 --> 04:00:24,239
nothing i'm talking about in here is not

5300
04:00:24,239 --> 04:00:26,479
public information so it's already stuff

5301
04:00:26,479 --> 04:00:28,080
that's gone out uh i don't speak on

5302
04:00:28,080 --> 04:00:29,680
behalf of my employers while i'm here

5303
04:00:29,680 --> 04:00:31,120
i'm speaking from personal experience

5304
04:00:31,120 --> 04:00:32,560
i've been with crowdstrike for a while

5305
04:00:32,560 --> 04:00:34,160
i've been doing this for 20 years though

5306
04:00:34,160 --> 04:00:35,760
so

5307
04:00:35,760 --> 04:00:37,040
that's kind of the whole thing so let's

5308
04:00:37,040 --> 04:00:39,359
start with my first incident um i was

5309
04:00:39,359 --> 04:00:41,520
pretty young it was a long time ago

5310
04:00:41,520 --> 04:00:43,359
ransomware wasn't a thing yet

5311
04:00:43,359 --> 04:00:45,040
uh and

5312
04:00:45,040 --> 04:00:46,319
i was kind of a junior incident

5313
04:00:46,319 --> 04:00:47,680
responder really like getting into my

5314
04:00:47,680 --> 04:00:49,120
stuff getting very excited about things

5315
04:00:49,120 --> 04:00:50,720
and we had a malware case kind of like

5316
04:00:50,720 --> 04:00:51,600
what we've been talking about for the

5317
04:00:51,600 --> 04:00:53,279
last couple of hours except much less

5318
04:00:53,279 --> 04:00:54,239
advanced than anything we've been

5319
04:00:54,239 --> 04:00:56,080
talking about for the last couple hours

5320
04:00:56,080 --> 04:00:57,920
um we hit the big red panic button a

5321
04:00:57,920 --> 04:00:59,199
bunch of people go running into this

5322
04:00:59,199 --> 04:01:00,560
executive's office we're freaking out

5323
04:01:00,560 --> 04:01:01,760
we're tearing apart computers we're

5324
04:01:01,760 --> 04:01:02,800
pulling stuff out we're like getting

5325
04:01:02,800 --> 04:01:05,359
ready to like do dead disc work

5326
04:01:05,359 --> 04:01:06,399
and

5327
04:01:06,399 --> 04:01:08,479
over the space of probably oh i don't

5328
04:01:08,479 --> 04:01:10,080
know a full day

5329

running around waving their hands oh my

god it might be a state motivated threat

5332
04:01:16,319 --> 04:01:18,640
actor they might be attacking us

5333
04:01:18,640 --> 04:01:20,640
turns out it was actually just an email

5334
04:01:20,640 --> 04:01:21,840
campaign

5335
04:01:21,840 --> 04:01:23,920
um and the only reason

5336
04:01:23,920 --> 04:01:25,359
we were freaking out was because the

5337
04:01:25,359 --> 04:01:27,279
email campaign deployed something on

5338
04:01:27,279 --> 04:01:29,439
this one executive's desktop

5339
04:01:29,439 --> 04:01:31,680
and the poor executive went yeah let me

5340
04:01:31,680 --> 04:01:34,080
just click on that and open it

5341
04:01:34,080 --> 04:01:36,080
uh that ended badly uh it ended in a

5342
04:01:36,080 --> 04:01:38,479
huge waste of resources i had ended us

5343
04:01:38,479 --> 04:01:40,640
scrambling pretty much all the jets

5344
04:01:40,640 --> 04:01:42,160
and the search dogs and the fire

5345
04:01:42,160 --> 04:01:43,600
department

5346
04:01:43,600 --> 04:01:44,479
for

5347
04:01:44,479 --> 04:01:47,120
nothing uh it also kind of did some bad

5348
04:01:47,120 --> 04:01:49,520
stuff for our security team because we

5349
04:01:49,520 --> 04:01:50,960
got looked at as the the people who

5350
04:01:50,960 --> 04:01:52,319
freak out over nothing which is not a

5351
04:01:52,319 --> 04:01:53,760
great situation

5352
04:01:53,760 --> 04:01:54,640
so

5353
04:01:54,640 --> 04:01:56,399
i there's some commonalities here you've

5354
04:01:56,399 --> 04:01:58,239
seen them up on the screen of course but

5355
04:01:58,239 --> 04:01:59,359
one of the things that i like kind of

5356
04:01:59,359 --> 04:02:01,520
pointing out is that uh

5357
04:02:01,520 --> 04:02:03,199
there are usually three things you need

5358
04:02:03,199 --> 04:02:05,439
for doing uh incident response well

5359
04:02:05,439 --> 04:02:07,279
they're up there i'll let you read them

5360
04:02:07,279 --> 04:02:08,720
i'm going to talk about a second story

5361
04:02:08,720 --> 04:02:10,880
where and this was a little bit later in

5362
04:02:10,880 --> 04:02:12,160
my career

5363
04:02:12,160 --> 04:02:14,479
at a hospital we had something

5364
04:02:14,479 --> 04:02:17,120
worse happen this time it was real

5365
04:02:17,120 --> 04:02:19,760
so ransomware hits a hospital

5366
04:02:19,760 --> 04:02:21,680
this happens unfortunately it's a it's a

5367
04:02:21,680 --> 04:02:23,040
thing this time it's not so bad that

5368
04:02:23,040 --> 04:02:24,640
it's like making the hospital not work

5369
04:02:24,640 --> 04:02:26,000
but it's bad enough that it's messing

5370
04:02:26,000 --> 04:02:27,520
everything up for us

5371
04:02:27,520 --> 04:02:28,720
and we hit the big red button and

5372
04:02:28,720 --> 04:02:30,800
everybody panics and everybody runs and

5373
04:02:30,800 --> 04:02:32,640
thankfully

5374
04:02:32,640 --> 04:02:34,479
we had the ability to call out for help

5375
04:02:34,479 --> 04:02:35,920
so we got some extra people in but it

5376
04:02:35,920 --> 04:02:37,040
took us a little while to get to that

5377
04:02:37,040 --> 04:02:38,319
point

5378
04:02:38,319 --> 04:02:40,160
we also didn't have any way of talking

5379
04:02:40,160 --> 04:02:41,439
to anyone in the various divisions of

5380
04:02:41,439 --> 04:02:43,359
the it team or anything else so you know

5381
04:02:43,359 --> 04:02:44,640
it took us a while to get to the point

5382
04:02:44,640 --> 04:02:46,319
where we were covering things

5383
04:02:46,319 --> 04:02:48,080
so by the time we finished the recovery

5384
04:02:48,080 --> 04:02:50,160
you know about 16 million years later

5385
04:02:50,160 --> 04:02:51,279
actually it was

5386
04:02:51,279 --> 04:02:52,880
close to six months

5387
04:02:52,880 --> 04:02:54,960
um the threat comes back and whacks us

5388
04:02:54,960 --> 04:02:57,439
again

5389
04:02:57,439 --> 04:02:59,600
yeah that was great

5390
04:02:59,600 --> 04:03:00,640
um

5391
04:03:00,640 --> 04:03:02,160
i think the main thing here basically is

5392
04:03:02,160 --> 04:03:03,760
plans communication and visibility

5393
04:03:03,760 --> 04:03:06,000
obviously the visibility part is

5394
04:03:06,000 --> 04:03:07,279
actually

5395
04:03:07,279 --> 04:03:09,760
my number 10 on this list it's the first

5396
04:03:09,760 --> 04:03:11,040
stop

5397
04:03:11,040 --> 04:03:12,720
can you even detect threat actor

5398
04:03:12,720 --> 04:03:14,319
activity uh and a lot of people are

5399
04:03:14,319 --> 04:03:15,920
gonna be like yeah cool we've got

5400
04:03:15,920 --> 04:03:17,439
tooling we've got automation we've got

5401
04:03:17,439 --> 04:03:19,760
all this cool stuff and that's great uh

5402
04:03:19,760 --> 04:03:21,279
it's very important i work for a company

5403
04:03:21,279 --> 04:03:22,880
that sells automation and tooling i

5404
04:03:22,880 --> 04:03:24,319
worked for a company prior to this that

5405
04:03:24,319 --> 04:03:25,920
also did that i've spent a lot of my

5406
04:03:25,920 --> 04:03:27,120
life looking at other people's work

5407
04:03:27,120 --> 04:03:29,760
around it and honestly

5408
04:03:29,760 --> 04:03:31,120
everybody's doing a good job in this

5409
04:03:31,120 --> 04:03:32,640
space i'll obviously say that you know

5410
04:03:32,640 --> 04:03:33,840
my employers are better than everyone

5411
04:03:33,840 --> 04:03:35,040
else because i work there but i've also

5412
04:03:35,040 --> 04:03:36,160
actually gotten to work with their stuff

5413
04:03:36,160 --> 04:03:38,080
a lot uh

5414
04:03:38,080 --> 04:03:39,840
but

5415
04:03:39,840 --> 04:03:41,439
the main thing here for me is actually

5416
04:03:41,439 --> 04:03:43,840
people um you can have all the shiny

5417
04:03:43,840 --> 04:03:44,960
blinky lights in the world you can have

5418
04:03:44,960 --> 04:03:46,880
all the machines that go ping it really

5419
04:03:46,880 --> 04:03:48,560
doesn't matter if you don't have people

5420
04:03:48,560 --> 04:03:51,040
who are capable of handling those things

5421
04:03:51,040 --> 04:03:51,760
so

5422
04:03:51,760 --> 04:03:52,880
you know there are two questions on this

5423
04:03:52,880 --> 04:03:54,640
slide obviously uh and these were ones

5424
04:03:54,640 --> 04:03:56,399
that i would keep asking every time i

5425
04:03:56,399 --> 04:03:57,920
changed jobs every time i got a new role

5426
04:03:57,920 --> 04:04:00,239
as an incident responder um what what's

5427
04:04:00,239 --> 04:04:01,840
the security stack look like and it's

5428
04:04:01,840 --> 04:04:03,439
gone from

5429
04:04:03,439 --> 04:04:04,880
norton antivirus which should give you

5430
04:04:04,880 --> 04:04:06,720
an idea of how long i've been doing this

5431
04:04:06,720 --> 04:04:09,520
uh to advanced endpoint detection and

5432
04:04:09,520 --> 04:04:11,199
threat resolution blah blah blah

5433
04:04:11,199 --> 04:04:12,720
intelligence sprinkle some blockchain on

5434
04:04:12,720 --> 04:04:14,319
there whatever you want

5435
04:04:14,319 --> 04:04:15,199
um

5436
04:04:15,199 --> 04:04:17,520
and and the thing with this is that

5437
04:04:17,520 --> 04:04:19,680
that stuff's great

5438
04:04:19,680 --> 04:04:21,600
but sometimes your solutions bale or

5439
04:04:21,600 --> 04:04:23,920
twine and duct tape or just grab

5440
04:04:23,920 --> 04:04:26,080
so

5441
04:04:26,319 --> 04:04:27,680
knowing that you can detect stuff is

5442
04:04:27,680 --> 04:04:28,640
great

5443
04:04:28,640 --> 04:04:30,399
knowing what happened is

5444
04:04:30,399 --> 04:04:33,520
even better and a lot harder and and

5445
04:04:33,520 --> 04:04:35,279
the three things here on this slide

5446
04:04:35,279 --> 04:04:37,040
these are kind of uh you know an ideal

5447
04:04:37,040 --> 04:04:39,600
situation i've never worked with a team

5448
04:04:39,600 --> 04:04:41,279
either in consulting or in you know in

5449
04:04:41,279 --> 04:04:43,199
practice when i was doing it where we

5450
04:04:43,199 --> 04:04:44,880
have all three of these lined up

5451
04:04:44,880 --> 04:04:46,080
perfectly

5452
04:04:46,080 --> 04:04:48,000
usually what we've got is we've got a

5453
04:04:48,000 --> 04:04:49,120
situation where we've got some good

5454
04:04:49,120 --> 04:04:50,880
investigators but

5455
04:04:50,880 --> 04:04:53,040
the logs aren't being stored anywhere or

5456
04:04:53,040 --> 04:04:54,319
the logs are only being preserved for a

5457
04:04:54,319 --> 04:04:56,479
week because they're too many of them or

5458
04:04:56,479 --> 04:04:58,160
on and on and on

5459
04:04:58,160 --> 04:04:59,279
um

5460
04:04:59,279 --> 04:05:01,279
in a lot of these situations you know

5461
04:05:01,279 --> 04:05:02,960
your your outcome from your your actual

5462
04:05:02,960 --> 04:05:04,239
incident response is probably not going

5463
04:05:04,239 --> 04:05:05,840
to be as good as you want it to it's not

5464
04:05:05,840 --> 04:05:07,760
going to be one of those things where

5465
04:05:07,760 --> 04:05:09,920
hey you know this is great

5466
04:05:09,920 --> 04:05:11,359
we resolved everything but let me talk

5467
04:05:11,359 --> 04:05:13,920
about one where it did work for me um

5468
04:05:13,920 --> 04:05:15,680
and this was a little while ago

5469
04:05:15,680 --> 04:05:17,760
uh it was another uh minor ransomware

5470
04:05:17,760 --> 04:05:19,439
case and this time basically i walked in

5471
04:05:19,439 --> 04:05:20,720
the door i think i was working alone at

5472
04:05:20,720 --> 04:05:22,720
this point and i said you know where

5473
04:05:22,720 --> 04:05:24,640
your logs and the it person comes back

5474
04:05:24,640 --> 04:05:27,760
and says oh they're right over there

5475
04:05:27,760 --> 04:05:31,040
all 40 gigs of them go nuts

5476
04:05:31,040 --> 04:05:33,359
so several hours later

5477
04:05:33,359 --> 04:05:35,040
i had started to be able to reconstruct

5478
04:05:35,040 --> 04:05:36,399
how the threat actor got in what they

5479
04:05:36,399 --> 04:05:38,479
did everything else this is you know not

5480
04:05:38,479 --> 04:05:39,920
not a lot of systems we're talking about

5481
04:05:39,920 --> 04:05:42,319
it's a fairly limited scope

5482
04:05:42,319 --> 04:05:45,439
and what was kind of nice about it was

5483
04:05:45,439 --> 04:05:47,120
we actually had a resolution within a

5484
04:05:47,120 --> 04:05:49,040
week you know it wasn't an incident that

5485
04:05:49,040 --> 04:05:50,399
just dragged on and on and on we

5486
04:05:50,399 --> 04:05:52,000
actually knew what we could do

5487
04:05:52,000 --> 04:05:52,720
so

5488
04:05:52,720 --> 04:05:55,359
that's a good situation um i've been in

5489
04:05:55,359 --> 04:05:57,199
a lot of bad situations and usually it's

5490
04:05:57,199 --> 04:06:00,000
because logs are missing or they're not

5491
04:06:00,000 --> 04:06:01,920
stored long enough or

5492
04:06:01,920 --> 04:06:03,520
people aren't trained on their equipment

5493
04:06:03,520 --> 04:06:04,960
i think i'm repeating myself but i think

5494
04:06:04,960 --> 04:06:06,080
you get the point

5495
04:06:06,080 --> 04:06:08,640
um i've also worked with a lot of grep

5496
04:06:08,640 --> 04:06:09,920
in the past that's why this is up here

5497
04:06:09,920 --> 04:06:11,600
this is actually me

5498
04:06:11,600 --> 04:06:13,359
25 years ago when i got my start in

5499
04:06:13,359 --> 04:06:16,080
incident response

5500
04:06:17,840 --> 04:06:18,880
so

5501
04:06:18,880 --> 04:06:20,319
the next question

5502
04:06:20,319 --> 04:06:21,840
we've gone with

5503
04:06:21,840 --> 04:06:24,319
can we see the ta

5504
04:06:24,319 --> 04:06:26,560
can we investigate

5505
04:06:26,560 --> 04:06:28,560
this is a bigger piece for me what can i

5506
04:06:28,560 --> 04:06:29,520
contain

5507
04:06:29,520 --> 04:06:31,760
um i love this picture and that's why i

5508
04:06:31,760 --> 04:06:33,760
put it up here but i

5509
04:06:33,760 --> 04:06:35,199
there are a couple of main things about

5510
04:06:35,199 --> 04:06:37,760
containment containment is should be

5511
04:06:37,760 --> 04:06:39,600
your first move on an incident but in a

5512
04:06:39,600 --> 04:06:42,960
lot of cases your first move is

5513
04:06:43,520 --> 04:06:45,760
once you get past this part go to

5514
04:06:45,760 --> 04:06:47,760
containment look at what you can contain

5515
04:06:47,760 --> 04:06:49,520
and you should know what you can contain

5516
04:06:49,520 --> 04:06:51,279
but a lot of people don't because

5517
04:06:51,279 --> 04:06:53,439
you know

5518
04:06:53,439 --> 04:06:54,560
there's more than just the incident

5519
04:06:54,560 --> 04:06:56,399
response team working in i.t

5520
04:06:56,399 --> 04:06:57,120
so

5521
04:06:57,120 --> 04:06:58,960
you're going to end up in situations

5522
04:06:58,960 --> 04:07:00,239
where

5523
04:07:00,239 --> 04:07:01,680
your containment isn't working because

5524
04:07:01,680 --> 04:07:03,120
you're missing pieces there's missing

5525
04:07:03,120 --> 04:07:04,399
communication that kind of goes back up

5526
04:07:04,399 --> 04:07:06,239
to my top slide right

5527
04:07:06,239 --> 04:07:07,680
i've worked with teams that really know

5528
04:07:07,680 --> 04:07:08,880
their stuff and they've got good process

5529
04:07:08,880 --> 04:07:09,840
and there's been tooling and

5530
04:07:09,840 --> 04:07:11,520
investigation and this is also doing the

5531
04:07:11,520 --> 04:07:13,040
consulting side of things

5532
04:07:13,040 --> 04:07:15,040
um but for me the containment part is

5533
04:07:15,040 --> 04:07:16,800
usually where people trip up we think

5534
04:07:16,800 --> 04:07:19,199
we've succeeded we're not sure can we

5535
04:07:19,199 --> 04:07:20,720
call you and get some more information

5536
04:07:20,720 --> 04:07:22,640
and i've been the person asking those

5537
04:07:22,640 --> 04:07:23,680
questions

5538
04:07:23,680 --> 04:07:25,600
and for me it's kind of perpetually a

5539
04:07:25,600 --> 04:07:26,880
case of like

5540
04:07:26,880 --> 04:07:30,000
how sure are we uh how far can we see so

5541
04:07:30,000 --> 04:07:31,760
let's go back two slides you know who

5542
04:07:31,760 --> 04:07:33,199
who's actually able to help us here

5543
04:07:33,199 --> 04:07:35,600
which is another piece

5544
04:07:35,600 --> 04:07:37,199
so

5545
04:07:37,199 --> 04:07:38,960
i think with ransomware it's actually

5546
04:07:38,960 --> 04:07:40,319
really simple to talk about containment

5547
04:07:40,319 --> 04:07:42,479
we're basically saying okay

5548
04:07:42,479 --> 04:07:44,479
stop the spread cool

5549
04:07:44,479 --> 04:07:45,840
great we've done that uh what about the

5550
04:07:45,840 --> 04:07:47,920
threat actor and the c2 networks and the

5551
04:07:47,920 --> 04:07:51,120
rats and the data

5552
04:07:51,120 --> 04:07:53,199
well you can't prove the data was

5553
04:07:53,199 --> 04:07:55,199
exfiltrated unless you can see what's

5554
04:07:55,199 --> 04:07:56,960
going on on the network

5555
04:07:56,960 --> 04:07:58,319
and if you can't see what's going on on

5556
04:07:58,319 --> 04:08:00,159
the network oh let me back up a slide no

5557
04:08:00,159 --> 04:08:02,560
i'm kidding

5558
04:08:02,560 --> 04:08:04,640
so the next piece after the containment

5559
04:08:04,640 --> 04:08:06,159
side and actually in some cases at the

5560
04:08:06,159 --> 04:08:08,159
very beginning of the containment side

5561
04:08:08,159 --> 04:08:08,800
is

5562
04:08:08,800 --> 04:08:10,560
who do i call for help

5563
04:08:10,560 --> 04:08:12,239
i where's your team of avalanche search

5564
04:08:12,239 --> 04:08:14,479
dogs coming from um you know are you

5565
04:08:14,479 --> 04:08:15,680
able to call

5566
04:08:15,680 --> 04:08:17,600
across the room to the it engineering

5567
04:08:17,600 --> 04:08:19,120
department and say okay can you like you

5568
04:08:19,120 --> 04:08:20,800
know close all this stuff up i've got a

5569
04:08:20,800 --> 04:08:22,080
really interesting story about that one

5570
04:08:22,080 --> 04:08:24,159
actually uh

5571
04:08:24,159 --> 04:08:26,080
i was working at a place where we had a

5572
04:08:26,080 --> 04:08:28,720
really really large network and

5573
04:08:28,720 --> 04:08:31,199
what basically happened one friday of

5574
04:08:31,199 --> 04:08:33,359
course at around five o'clock

5575
04:08:33,359 --> 04:08:36,479
when i was on my way out to a conference

5576
04:08:36,479 --> 04:08:38,720
was the entire network went offline not

5577
04:08:38,720 --> 04:08:39,920
just

5578
04:08:39,920 --> 04:08:41,600
not just the internal one but our

5579
04:08:41,600 --> 04:08:43,199
connection out and literally everything

5580
04:08:43,199 --> 04:08:45,199
else we basically ddosed ourselves from

5581
04:08:45,199 --> 04:08:47,120
the inside of the network

5582
04:08:47,120 --> 04:08:49,199
and network engineering lead comes over

5583
04:08:49,199 --> 04:08:50,239
to me and says you're never going to

5584
04:08:50,239 --> 04:08:52,080
guess what just happened

5585
04:08:52,080 --> 04:08:53,760
and i'm like well i think i am because

5586
04:08:53,760 --> 04:08:54,880
you're going to tell me and i'm going to

5587
04:08:54,880 --> 04:08:58,399
bet it was a worm yeah it was

5588
04:08:58,399 --> 04:08:59,920
so the problem with this was we had no

5589
04:08:59,920 --> 04:09:02,560
way of reaching the side of the

5590
04:09:02,560 --> 04:09:04,880
large campus that i was working on to

5591
04:09:04,880 --> 04:09:06,640
talk to the people who had the worm to

5592
04:09:06,640 --> 04:09:07,920
tell them to stop

5593
04:09:07,920 --> 04:09:09,920
for three hours so our entire network

5594
04:09:09,920 --> 04:09:11,120
was offline for three hours because we

5595
04:09:11,120 --> 04:09:14,239
didn't have a phone number

5596
04:09:14,239 --> 04:09:15,840
the other piece of this and this kind of

5597
04:09:15,840 --> 04:09:17,520
turned into something later because the

5598
04:09:17,520 --> 04:09:18,880
reason this ddos happened was we had a

5599
04:09:18,880 --> 04:09:20,560
piece of technology that had

5600
04:09:20,560 --> 04:09:22,479
really really really really poor

5601
04:09:22,479 --> 04:09:24,000
internal security

5602
04:09:24,000 --> 04:09:24,800
um

5603
04:09:24,800 --> 04:09:26,000
i don't know if any of you have ever run

5604
04:09:26,000 --> 04:09:28,479
across a username of developer and a

5605
04:09:28,479 --> 04:09:30,080
password of

5606
04:09:30,080 --> 04:09:32,319
you can guess

5607
04:09:32,319 --> 04:09:33,600
so

5608
04:09:33,600 --> 04:09:34,960
this is where the functions that end in

5609
04:09:34,960 --> 04:09:36,159
r come in

5610
04:09:36,159 --> 04:09:38,479
in this case hr wasn't involved

5611
04:09:38,479 --> 04:09:40,960
pr thankfully wasn't involved but lawyer

5612
04:09:40,960 --> 04:09:42,960
was involved and then there was a third

5613
04:09:42,960 --> 04:09:44,239
one that we didn't have to call up our

5614
04:09:44,239 --> 04:09:46,560
fourth one sorry external responder

5615
04:09:46,560 --> 04:09:47,920
um

5616
04:09:47,920 --> 04:09:50,000
knowing when to escalate is kind of

5617
04:09:50,000 --> 04:09:51,680
important because getting those people

5618
04:09:51,680 --> 04:09:53,840
those r's on board

5619
04:09:53,840 --> 04:09:55,600
is sometimes going to require a call at

5620
04:09:55,600 --> 04:09:56,800
three o'clock in the morning and

5621
04:09:56,800 --> 04:09:57,920
sometimes it's going to require that

5622
04:09:57,920 --> 04:10:00,319
they actually get over there in time uh

5623
04:10:00,319 --> 04:10:02,319
when i've worked for on-site incident

5624
04:10:02,319 --> 04:10:03,680
response teams which i've done a little

5625
04:10:03,680 --> 04:10:05,920
bit we usually try and have a 24-hour

5626
04:10:05,920 --> 04:10:07,199
readiness time if you're in the middle

5627
04:10:07,199 --> 04:10:09,600
of a ransomware case that's

5628
04:10:09,600 --> 04:10:11,680
that's a lot of time you know

5629
04:10:11,680 --> 04:10:14,000
so be prepared to get extra help know

5630
04:10:14,000 --> 04:10:16,319
who to call for extra help and know who

5631
04:10:16,319 --> 04:10:18,479
to escalate and if we you know go back

5632
04:10:18,479 --> 04:10:20,159
to my original sort of

5633
04:10:20,159 --> 04:10:22,960
not exactly an incident incident uh

5634
04:10:22,960 --> 04:10:24,880
the escalation went to me but i was the

5635
04:10:24,880 --> 04:10:26,560
only incident responder there i was the

5636
04:10:26,560 --> 04:10:28,159
junior incident responder and that's all

5637
04:10:28,159 --> 04:10:29,199
i did

5638
04:10:29,199 --> 04:10:30,000
um

5639
04:10:30,000 --> 04:10:31,760
and it was coming from an executive who

5640
04:10:31,760 --> 04:10:33,120
probably should have been the person who

5641
04:10:33,120 --> 04:10:34,960
actually had the power to do that

5642
04:10:34,960 --> 04:10:36,479
but didn't really know how that worked

5643
04:10:36,479 --> 04:10:38,319
and i think this is probably one key

5644
04:10:38,319 --> 04:10:40,720
point to take away from this is

5645
04:10:40,720 --> 04:10:42,159
you need sponsorship from somebody

5646
04:10:42,159 --> 04:10:43,520
further up in the organization even if

5647
04:10:43,520 --> 04:10:44,880
you're at the top of the organization

5648
04:10:44,880 --> 04:10:48,159
you should probably have that backing

5649
04:10:50,880 --> 04:10:53,680
so the next piece in my top 10 list is

5650
04:10:53,680 --> 04:10:55,840
criticality

5651
04:10:55,840 --> 04:10:57,760
this is one of my favorites because i do

5652
04:10:57,760 --> 04:10:59,439
a lot of strategic practice work as well

5653
04:10:59,439 --> 04:11:01,840
as incident response uh and i help run

5654
04:11:01,840 --> 04:11:03,840
red team blue teams and you know do

5655
04:11:03,840 --> 04:11:05,439
tabletop exercises with people so we

5656
04:11:05,439 --> 04:11:06,880
spend a lot of time

5657
04:11:06,880 --> 04:11:08,560
doing simulations and sitting folks in a

5658
04:11:08,560 --> 04:11:10,399
room not as many folks as are here right

5659
04:11:10,399 --> 04:11:12,880
now but sometimes we get quite a lot

5660
04:11:12,880 --> 04:11:15,600
and we usually will have a question of

5661
04:11:15,600 --> 04:11:16,960
like okay so where are your critical

5662
04:11:16,960 --> 04:11:18,000
systems

5663
04:11:18,000 --> 04:11:20,080
and my favorite thing in the world and

5664
04:11:20,080 --> 04:11:21,600
by favorite i mean i absolutely hate it

5665
04:11:21,600 --> 04:11:23,600
and it's kind of terrible is the number

5666
04:11:23,600 --> 04:11:25,840
of blank faces i see when i ask that

5667
04:11:25,840 --> 04:11:27,359
because there's always a

5668
04:11:27,359 --> 04:11:28,640
oh

5669
04:11:28,640 --> 04:11:30,560
yeah i mean i guess

5670
04:11:30,560 --> 04:11:31,920
i guess the point of sale machines are

5671
04:11:31,920 --> 04:11:33,359
critical or

5672
04:11:33,359 --> 04:11:35,040
maybe it's that that electronic health

5673
04:11:35,040 --> 04:11:37,120
record that's probably important or or

5674
04:11:37,120 --> 04:11:39,199
maybe our sql database and then it

5675
04:11:39,199 --> 04:11:41,520
balloons and this is the thing with what

5676
04:11:41,520 --> 04:11:42,800
critical is

5677
04:11:42,800 --> 04:11:43,840
uh

5678
04:11:43,840 --> 04:11:45,279
it's obviously going to vary for

5679
04:11:45,279 --> 04:11:46,960
organization you know if you're if

5680
04:11:46,960 --> 04:11:48,880
you're in uh you know if you're running

5681
04:11:48,880 --> 04:11:50,399
a store for example you're doing sales

5682
04:11:50,399 --> 04:11:51,359
it's going to be a very different thing

5683
04:11:51,359 --> 04:11:53,439
from if you're a hospital or a factory

5684
04:11:53,439 --> 04:11:55,359
that makes widgets

5685
04:11:55,359 --> 04:11:57,520
it's also going to vary per team

5686
04:11:57,520 --> 04:11:59,120
everyone thinks what they're doing is

5687
04:11:59,120 --> 04:12:00,319
important you don't want to really take

5688
04:12:00,319 --> 04:12:01,920
that away from them obviously but you do

5689
04:12:01,920 --> 04:12:03,439
have to have a hard conversation about

5690
04:12:03,439 --> 04:12:05,600
who gets budgets and who's responsible

5691
04:12:05,600 --> 04:12:07,760
for patching and who's going to be there

5692
04:12:07,760 --> 04:12:09,199
when the lights go out and who you're

5693
04:12:09,199 --> 04:12:10,479
going to call to restore everything

5694
04:12:10,479 --> 04:12:11,359
because

5695
04:12:11,359 --> 04:12:13,680
as an incident responder you can't do

5696
04:12:13,680 --> 04:12:15,439
everything and usually this is why we

5697
04:12:15,439 --> 04:12:17,439
act you know we call it a team but the

5698
04:12:17,439 --> 04:12:19,680
team kind of extends

5699
04:12:19,680 --> 04:12:20,960
the other piece of this is who knows

5700
04:12:20,960 --> 04:12:21,760
what

5701
04:12:21,760 --> 04:12:24,399
and uh and who knows what they own

5702
04:12:24,399 --> 04:12:26,000
and this is my favorite this is my

5703
04:12:26,000 --> 04:12:27,520
favorite sort of like dig down when

5704
04:12:27,520 --> 04:12:29,520
we're doing uh tabletop exercises the

5705
04:12:29,520 --> 04:12:30,800
worst thing in the world in an incident

5706
04:12:30,800 --> 04:12:32,000
is to not know who owns the system

5707
04:12:32,000 --> 04:12:33,920
you're working with i actually uh had a

5708
04:12:33,920 --> 04:12:34,720
case

5709
04:12:34,720 --> 04:12:36,640
years ago where

5710
04:12:36,640 --> 04:12:39,120
we uh we had a it was another malware

5711
04:12:39,120 --> 04:12:40,479
case so it gives you an idea how long it

5712
04:12:40,479 --> 04:12:42,000
was because you know

5713
04:12:42,000 --> 04:12:43,680
malware now is solved by everything but

5714
04:12:43,680 --> 04:12:47,600
it was a malware on a windows xp machine

5715
04:12:47,600 --> 04:12:49,520
malware on a windows xp machine and a

5716
04:12:49,520 --> 04:12:50,800
part of one of the buildings i worked in

5717
04:12:50,800 --> 04:12:52,720
that no one knew even existed until the

5718
04:12:52,720 --> 04:12:55,600
malware pinged our antivirus and went hi

5719
04:12:55,600 --> 04:12:56,720
i'm here

5720
04:12:56,720 --> 04:12:59,359
calling out to russia

5721
04:12:59,359 --> 04:13:00,800
come get me

5722
04:13:00,800 --> 04:13:02,800
and we're like okay where is this where

5723
04:13:02,800 --> 04:13:04,399
is the system

5724
04:13:04,399 --> 04:13:06,479
turns out it was in the basement and it

5725
04:13:06,479 --> 04:13:09,920
was attached to our hvac system

5726
04:13:11,279 --> 04:13:13,279
and when we got down there

5727
04:13:13,279 --> 04:13:14,560
we start tearing it apart we're like

5728
04:13:14,560 --> 04:13:16,239
okay first of all no one knew this was

5729
04:13:16,239 --> 04:13:18,000
here whose is it you know can you tell

5730
04:13:18,000 --> 04:13:19,600
me what it does it took us two days to

5731
04:13:19,600 --> 04:13:21,120
figure out it was connected to the hvac

5732
04:13:21,120 --> 04:13:22,000
system

5733
04:13:22,000 --> 04:13:23,760
that was another one that kind of turned

5734
04:13:23,760 --> 04:13:25,760
into an emergency for us because it was

5735
04:13:25,760 --> 04:13:28,000
around the time of stuxnet

5736
04:13:28,000 --> 04:13:29,680
and there were questions being asked and

5737
04:13:29,680 --> 04:13:31,680
thankfully again it didn't blow up too

5738
04:13:31,680 --> 04:13:33,439
big we didn't have to do the whole you

5739
04:13:33,439 --> 04:13:36,000
know panic arms waving thing but

5740
04:13:36,000 --> 04:13:37,840
we did have to spend a lot of time doing

5741
04:13:37,840 --> 04:13:39,920
a very long and deep investigation after

5742
04:13:39,920 --> 04:13:41,120
that just to make sure everything else

5743
04:13:41,120 --> 04:13:43,279
was okay because

5744
04:13:43,279 --> 04:13:45,600
we also discovered that the hvac system

5745
04:13:45,600 --> 04:13:48,080
was controlled by a whole bunch of plcs

5746
04:13:48,080 --> 04:13:50,399
and workstations and servers that we

5747
04:13:50,399 --> 04:13:54,000
hadn't seen yet and weren't on our radar

5748
04:13:54,000 --> 04:13:55,920
this critical i don't know is an hvac

5749
04:13:55,920 --> 04:13:57,760
system critical for a building i think

5750
04:13:57,760 --> 04:13:58,800
so

5751
04:13:58,800 --> 04:14:00,399
i ran a simulation a little while ago

5752
04:14:00,399 --> 04:14:01,760
with one of our hospital clients that i

5753
04:14:01,760 --> 04:14:03,120
kind of love because we actually set it

5754
04:14:03,120 --> 04:14:04,080
up so that we just turned off

5755
04:14:04,080 --> 04:14:06,880
refrigeration for them

5756
04:14:06,880 --> 04:14:08,319
turn off refrigeration in the middle of

5757
04:14:08,319 --> 04:14:10,720
a coveted vaccine campaign

5758
04:14:10,720 --> 04:14:12,720
you have a huge problem on your hands so

5759
04:14:12,720 --> 04:14:14,080
again going back to knowing what's

5760
04:14:14,080 --> 04:14:15,840
critical and who owns it that's going to

5761
04:14:15,840 --> 04:14:19,520
extend outside the i.t team sometimes

5762
04:14:20,399 --> 04:14:22,159
the next piece is how do we customer and

5763
04:14:22,159 --> 04:14:24,399
i i like saying it this way because it's

5764
04:14:24,399 --> 04:14:28,239
also how do i even uh or how do i cope

5765
04:14:28,239 --> 04:14:29,279
um

5766
04:14:29,279 --> 04:14:31,520
this isn't a self-help seminar so i'm

5767
04:14:31,520 --> 04:14:32,560
not going to get into the individual

5768
04:14:32,560 --> 04:14:33,760
coping skills that you have to have as

5769
04:14:33,760 --> 04:14:35,199
an incident responder which i'm sure all

5770
04:14:35,199 --> 04:14:36,560
of you have probably struggled with if

5771
04:14:36,560 --> 04:14:38,159
you're an incident responder and

5772
04:14:38,159 --> 04:14:39,920
probably if you do security at all

5773
04:14:39,920 --> 04:14:41,600
you've had to struggle with this

5774
04:14:41,600 --> 04:14:43,760
this part's about the organization uh

5775
04:14:43,760 --> 04:14:44,800
you can see what's on the slide

5776
04:14:44,800 --> 04:14:46,560
obviously but

5777
04:14:46,560 --> 04:14:48,560
let me talk about something that is in

5778
04:14:48,560 --> 04:14:49,680
the picture on the slide this is a

5779
04:14:49,680 --> 04:14:51,040
picture of woodstock

5780
04:14:51,040 --> 04:14:52,960
this is the nice picture of what was up

5781
04:14:52,960 --> 04:14:54,560
the field from what was down the field

5782
04:14:54,560 --> 04:14:56,640
at the end of woodstock and all the way

5783
04:14:56,640 --> 04:14:58,239
through woodstock

5784
04:14:58,239 --> 04:14:59,840
they had to hire helicopters to get

5785
04:14:59,840 --> 04:15:01,040
musicians in and out because they were

5786
04:15:01,040 --> 04:15:02,640
so narrowly focused on the idea of let's

5787
04:15:02,640 --> 04:15:04,239
do this show but they sort of forgot to

5788
04:15:04,239 --> 04:15:06,159
install porta-potties and people got

5789
04:15:06,159 --> 04:15:07,520
sick

5790
04:15:07,520 --> 04:15:09,359
and they couldn't get ambulances in

5791
04:15:09,359 --> 04:15:10,560
woodstock was actually worse than the

5792
04:15:10,560 --> 04:15:12,080
fire festival in some senses just in

5793
04:15:12,080 --> 04:15:13,600
terms of the emergency preparedness and

5794
04:15:13,600 --> 04:15:14,880
kind of dealing with

5795
04:15:14,880 --> 04:15:16,479
all of this stuff so

5796
04:15:16,479 --> 04:15:18,080
i you're probably asking yourself

5797
04:15:18,080 --> 04:15:19,279
caspian what's your point which is a

5798
04:15:19,279 --> 04:15:21,199
really funny thing to ask yourself

5799
04:15:21,199 --> 04:15:23,680
because your name is not caspian but my

5800
04:15:23,680 --> 04:15:25,040
point is really simple

5801
04:15:25,040 --> 04:15:27,199
be prepared for denials of service be

5802
04:15:27,199 --> 04:15:29,040
prepared for things shutting down be

5803
04:15:29,040 --> 04:15:32,080
prepared with out-of-band communications

5804
04:15:32,080 --> 04:15:34,080
going back to again my first

5805
04:15:34,080 --> 04:15:35,680
non-incident story and actually the

5806
04:15:35,680 --> 04:15:37,439
second one as well that out-of-band

5807
04:15:37,439 --> 04:15:39,600
communication piece was huge uh if we

5808
04:15:39,600 --> 04:15:40,800
had had it it would have been very

5809
04:15:40,800 --> 04:15:42,239
simple if we thought all our networks

5810
04:15:42,239 --> 04:15:44,159
were compromised cool let's switch to

5811
04:15:44,159 --> 04:15:45,439
signal and talk

5812
04:15:45,439 --> 04:15:47,680
or something else

5813
04:15:47,680 --> 04:15:48,880
right now though

5814
04:15:48,880 --> 04:15:49,760
you know

5815
04:15:49,760 --> 04:15:50,960
we're kind of having a hard time here

5816
04:15:50,960 --> 04:15:52,880
because we can't talk we can't speak we

5817
04:15:52,880 --> 04:15:55,279
can't see we don't know what's going on

5818
04:15:55,279 --> 04:15:56,800
so

5819
04:15:56,800 --> 04:15:58,880
this brings me to the next piece we also

5820
04:15:58,880 --> 04:16:00,399
don't know who does what i kind of

5821
04:16:00,399 --> 04:16:01,520
talked about this in the criticality

5822
04:16:01,520 --> 04:16:02,319
piece

5823
04:16:02,319 --> 04:16:04,000
um

5824
04:16:04,000 --> 04:16:05,279
not knowing who owns what's going to

5825
04:16:05,279 --> 04:16:07,439
slow you down i i mention that with the

5826
04:16:07,439 --> 04:16:08,880
story about the windows xp box in the

5827
04:16:08,880 --> 04:16:10,399
basement

5828
04:16:10,399 --> 04:16:11,760
not knowing who does what's going to

5829
04:16:11,760 --> 04:16:14,000
hurt you even more if i go in in an

5830
04:16:14,000 --> 04:16:16,399
incident and turn off a critical system

5831
04:16:16,399 --> 04:16:19,040
or i just turn off a system or i trip

5832
04:16:19,040 --> 04:16:20,640
over a power supply that knocks out the

5833
04:16:20,640 --> 04:16:23,600
billing system for somebody

5834
04:16:23,600 --> 04:16:24,880
we need to know

5835
04:16:24,880 --> 04:16:26,239
who's going to call the people at the

5836
04:16:26,239 --> 04:16:27,600
end of the billing system we need to

5837
04:16:27,600 --> 04:16:29,199
know who's going to turn the power

5838
04:16:29,199 --> 04:16:31,199
supply back on i need to know all this

5839
04:16:31,199 --> 04:16:32,479
other stuff

5840
04:16:32,479 --> 04:16:34,800
uh incidents don't occur in a vacuum so

5841
04:16:34,800 --> 04:16:36,640
as much as an incident responder my

5842
04:16:36,640 --> 04:16:38,560
focus is going to be put out the fire

5843
04:16:38,560 --> 04:16:40,239
you know stop the bleeding fix all the

5844
04:16:40,239 --> 04:16:41,120
stuff

5845
04:16:41,120 --> 04:16:42,479
there's all this other stuff going on

5846
04:16:42,479 --> 04:16:44,239
where we're going to need to actually

5847
04:16:44,239 --> 04:16:45,600
call these people in and get them to

5848
04:16:45,600 --> 04:16:47,439
work so you know the 4r as i mentioned

5849
04:16:47,439 --> 04:16:48,319
before

5850
04:16:48,319 --> 04:16:50,399
your your lawyers your hr your pr those

5851
04:16:50,399 --> 04:16:52,560
folks i

5852
04:16:52,560 --> 04:16:54,479
a lot of good

5853
04:16:54,479 --> 04:16:56,239
prepared organizations i work with and

5854
04:16:56,239 --> 04:16:57,920
i'm saying good and prepared sort of

5855
04:16:57,920 --> 04:16:58,800
separately because there are a lot of

5856
04:16:58,800 --> 04:17:01,600
good organizations that are unprepared

5857
04:17:01,600 --> 04:17:03,040
the ones that are prepared usually

5858
04:17:03,040 --> 04:17:04,720
actually have a sense of who does what

5859
04:17:04,720 --> 04:17:06,560
uh in this case you know

5860
04:17:06,560 --> 04:17:08,880
we do check who the pseudo reports go to

5861
04:17:08,880 --> 04:17:10,880
um that's actually kind of important

5862
04:17:10,880 --> 04:17:12,720
knowing about that

5863
04:17:12,720 --> 04:17:14,319
putting that down somewhere in a way

5864
04:17:14,319 --> 04:17:16,080
that is accessible for your responders

5865
04:17:16,080 --> 04:17:17,920
for me if i'm your responder is going to

5866
04:17:17,920 --> 04:17:19,439
make a huge difference

5867
04:17:19,439 --> 04:17:21,120
because if i don't know then who do i

5868
04:17:21,120 --> 04:17:24,359
talk to

5869
04:17:24,800 --> 04:17:27,120
so the next piece

5870
04:17:27,120 --> 04:17:28,880
speaking of talking

5871
04:17:28,880 --> 04:17:32,080
if i can actually get it to advance

5872
04:17:32,080 --> 04:17:33,120
there we go

5873
04:17:33,120 --> 04:17:35,120
next piece is connections you'd think i

5874
04:17:35,120 --> 04:17:36,399
would have put this at the top but i'm

5875
04:17:36,399 --> 04:17:37,680
kind of going in reverse order i don't

5876
04:17:37,680 --> 04:17:39,600
know if anyone's kind of noticed that

5877
04:17:39,600 --> 04:17:40,479
um

5878
04:17:40,479 --> 04:17:42,159
connections are really important for a

5879
04:17:42,159 --> 04:17:43,760
couple of reasons

5880
04:17:43,760 --> 04:17:45,279
the first piece on this slide is

5881
04:17:45,279 --> 04:17:46,319
actually the one that you probably

5882
04:17:46,319 --> 04:17:47,680
should be thinking of before the

5883
04:17:47,680 --> 04:17:48,800
incident

5884
04:17:48,800 --> 04:17:50,479
have you scanned externally do you know

5885
04:17:50,479 --> 04:17:52,399
how everyone's getting in do you have a

5886
04:17:52,399 --> 04:17:54,239
way of getting into that data center or

5887
04:17:54,239 --> 04:17:56,159
anywhere else remotely

5888
04:17:56,159 --> 04:17:57,600
and if you don't

5889
04:17:57,600 --> 04:17:59,760
are you prepared to drive for two hours

5890
04:17:59,760 --> 04:18:01,520
to lavalle or

5891
04:18:01,520 --> 04:18:03,359
toronto that's going to take longer than

5892
04:18:03,359 --> 04:18:06,560
two hours if you're driving from here

5893
04:18:06,720 --> 04:18:09,120
access is a really big deal

5894
04:18:09,120 --> 04:18:10,479
loss of access especially when

5895
04:18:10,479 --> 04:18:12,159
everything goes out also a really big

5896
04:18:12,159 --> 04:18:13,359
deal

5897
04:18:13,359 --> 04:18:14,800
i don't have a good story about this

5898
04:18:14,800 --> 04:18:16,000
because i can't talk about some of the

5899
04:18:16,000 --> 04:18:18,479
stuff that i've seen except to

5900
04:18:18,479 --> 04:18:19,920
give a vague indication that that

5901
04:18:19,920 --> 04:18:22,720
two-hour drive was something that one of

5902
04:18:22,720 --> 04:18:24,800
my clients did experience a few times

5903
04:18:24,800 --> 04:18:26,800
and they had to basically say

5904
04:18:26,800 --> 04:18:28,319
yeah we need to figure out a way to get

5905
04:18:28,319 --> 04:18:29,520
in

5906
04:18:29,520 --> 04:18:30,319
well

5907
04:18:30,319 --> 04:18:32,080
and i'm merging a whole bunch of people

5908
04:18:32,080 --> 04:18:34,399
in this case so they build this bashing

5909
04:18:34,399 --> 04:18:35,520
host and it's really nice but it's

5910
04:18:35,520 --> 04:18:36,880
getting scanned constantly they haven't

5911
04:18:36,880 --> 04:18:38,720
put any kind of anything on it to

5912
04:18:38,720 --> 04:18:40,640
prevent it from actually being used for

5913
04:18:40,640 --> 04:18:42,880
remote desktop access

5914
04:18:42,880 --> 04:18:44,080
one of my favorite

5915
04:18:44,080 --> 04:18:45,760
thread actors really loves using remote

5916
04:18:45,760 --> 04:18:47,359
desktop to just sling stuff all over the

5917
04:18:47,359 --> 04:18:50,399
place guess what happened

5918
04:18:50,399 --> 04:18:52,239
it was a lot of fun to solve that one we

5919
04:18:52,239 --> 04:18:53,840
had this really cool new tool that had

5920
04:18:53,840 --> 04:18:55,359
just come out that we could actually map

5921
04:18:55,359 --> 04:18:57,439
the remote desktop sessions out from so

5922
04:18:57,439 --> 04:18:58,720
we could see exactly what they were

5923
04:18:58,720 --> 04:18:59,600
doing

5924
04:18:59,600 --> 04:19:01,600
i sort of chuckled when we saw this

5925
04:19:01,600 --> 04:19:02,880
person just basically download

5926
04:19:02,880 --> 04:19:05,040
metasploit from rapid 7's site and start

5927
04:19:05,040 --> 04:19:07,600
using that

5928
04:19:10,640 --> 04:19:11,920
this piece i'm sure you've all had to

5929
04:19:11,920 --> 04:19:13,600
deal with at some point

5930
04:19:13,600 --> 04:19:16,080
i have extensively this is actually

5931
04:19:16,080 --> 04:19:17,199
where and this is one of my favorite

5932
04:19:17,199 --> 04:19:19,760
parts as well this this criticality

5933
04:19:19,760 --> 04:19:22,159
they go hand in hand they're like

5934
04:19:22,159 --> 04:19:23,199
they're like drinking too much in a

5935
04:19:23,199 --> 04:19:25,199
hangover you know they're they're just

5936
04:19:25,199 --> 04:19:28,159
gonna be there all the time uh

5937
04:19:28,159 --> 04:19:29,279
so

5938
04:19:29,279 --> 04:19:30,800
first of all

5939
04:19:30,800 --> 04:19:33,920
please please save me next time and test

5940
04:19:33,920 --> 04:19:35,359
your backups i've been in so many

5941
04:19:35,359 --> 04:19:37,040
situations myself and with other people

5942
04:19:37,040 --> 04:19:37,840
where

5943
04:19:37,840 --> 04:19:39,600
those backups weren't properly tested or

5944
04:19:39,600 --> 04:19:41,439
the restore process wasn't properly

5945
04:19:41,439 --> 04:19:43,120
tested that's an even bigger one i mean

5946
04:19:43,120 --> 04:19:45,840
if you're restoring over a t1 line and

5947
04:19:45,840 --> 04:19:47,840
you've got terabytes of data that's not

5948
04:19:47,840 --> 04:19:50,000
going to work out well if that as400

5949
04:19:50,000 --> 04:19:51,600
that you don't have a backup for that

5950
04:19:51,600 --> 04:19:53,199
drives all of your production systems

5951
04:19:53,199 --> 04:19:54,239
goes down

5952
04:19:54,239 --> 04:19:55,920
you may want to have a backup system for

5953
04:19:55,920 --> 04:19:56,720
it

5954
04:19:56,720 --> 04:19:58,560
backups are a big deal backups are cost

5955
04:19:58,560 --> 04:20:00,239
center

5956
04:20:00,239 --> 04:20:02,000
backups are also what allow you to get

5957
04:20:02,000 --> 04:20:03,600
out of the ransomware incident quickly

5958
04:20:03,600 --> 04:20:04,640
because

5959
04:20:04,640 --> 04:20:06,560
that's usually what's going to happen

5960
04:20:06,560 --> 04:20:08,239
we're you know we may find a decrypter

5961
04:20:08,239 --> 04:20:10,720
we may find a key that's cool but man if

5962
04:20:10,720 --> 04:20:12,479
you can restore from backup quickly

5963
04:20:12,479 --> 04:20:14,239
enough you're going to be fine the rest

5964
04:20:14,239 --> 04:20:17,520
of it's going to be an investigation

5965
04:20:18,000 --> 04:20:18,880
so

5966
04:20:18,880 --> 04:20:20,800
this brings me to number 10

5967
04:20:20,800 --> 04:20:22,159
on my list

5968
04:20:22,159 --> 04:20:24,159
i've been hinting at it all day

5969
04:20:24,159 --> 04:20:26,960
do you have a plan uh i work with lots

5970
04:20:26,960 --> 04:20:28,159
of people who don't they didn't write it

5971
04:20:28,159 --> 04:20:30,640
down their plans uh a nice iso document

5972
04:20:30,640 --> 04:20:32,159
that has a phone number in it

5973
04:20:32,159 --> 04:20:34,960
um and that's it

5974
04:20:34,960 --> 04:20:36,960
so there are good plans and bad plans

5975
04:20:36,960 --> 04:20:38,319
the plan you wrote for the auditors is a

5976
04:20:38,319 --> 04:20:39,680
bad plan

5977
04:20:39,680 --> 04:20:41,359
the good plan

5978
04:20:41,359 --> 04:20:43,840
is not the end of my slide deck

5979
04:20:43,840 --> 04:20:45,760
it's all these little boxes here and let

5980
04:20:45,760 --> 04:20:47,359
me let me let me walk you through this

5981
04:20:47,359 --> 04:20:49,199
just in case you got tired of being rick

5982
04:20:49,199 --> 04:20:50,960
rolled um

5983
04:20:50,960 --> 04:20:52,560
the never gonna is your actual master

5984
04:20:52,560 --> 04:20:54,399
incident response plan

5985
04:20:54,399 --> 04:20:55,520
that's the thing that has all the phone

5986
04:20:55,520 --> 04:20:56,880
numbers that you have tear aways from

5987
04:20:56,880 --> 04:20:58,479
you give them to people and say okay you

5988
04:20:58,479 --> 04:20:59,279
go

5989
04:20:59,279 --> 04:21:01,760
it engineering guy help me out here

5990
04:21:01,760 --> 04:21:04,080
the next piece playbooks

5991
04:21:04,080 --> 04:21:05,600
playbooks are kind of useful when you're

5992
04:21:05,600 --> 04:21:06,880
doing this all the time and you're kind

5993
04:21:06,880 --> 04:21:08,000
of panicking your way through something

5994
04:21:08,000 --> 04:21:08,960
because you've actually got something

5995
04:21:08,960 --> 04:21:10,159
written down you can go back and say

5996
04:21:10,159 --> 04:21:12,720
okay we've done this before

5997
04:21:12,720 --> 04:21:14,080
let's see how it works or we've planned

5998
04:21:14,080 --> 04:21:15,920
this out and tested it did i mention

5999
04:21:15,920 --> 04:21:17,840
testing testing's really important

6000
04:21:17,840 --> 04:21:19,520
um and then the last piece the awesome

6001
04:21:19,520 --> 04:21:21,199
piece is the fact that those playbooks

6002
04:21:21,199 --> 04:21:23,120
and the plan and everything else goes

6003
04:21:23,120 --> 04:21:24,800
right back into a continuous improvement

6004
04:21:24,800 --> 04:21:26,640
process that you can use

6005
04:21:26,640 --> 04:21:28,720
to build better i.t and build better

6006
04:21:28,720 --> 04:21:31,279
incident responders

6007
04:21:31,279 --> 04:21:32,479
so that's it

6008
04:21:32,479 --> 04:21:33,359
um

6009
04:21:33,359 --> 04:21:35,199
i'm just going to do this one more time

6010
04:21:35,199 --> 04:21:36,640
i've never rolled a room full of people

6011
04:21:36,640 --> 04:21:38,880
before

6012
04:21:38,880 --> 04:21:40,319
thank you all very much

6013
04:21:40,319 --> 04:21:42,479
i hope you hope you enjoyed that and

6014
04:21:42,479 --> 04:21:43,680
obviously questions will be later so

6015
04:21:43,680 --> 04:21:47,159
i'll be back for that

6016
04:21:53,270 --> 04:21:56,679

which is about javascript javascript

6057
04:33:36,400 --> 04:33:39,118
obfuscation uh classification with

6058
04:33:39,118 --> 04:33:42,320
machine learning those are scary words

6059

frameworks enabling us to build systems

6067
04:33:59,759 --> 04:34:02,480
today at a scale and is unthinkable just

6068
04:34:02,480 --> 04:34:04,080
several years ago

6069
04:34:04,080 --> 04:34:06,160

6088
04:34:51,520 --> 04:34:53,118
security

6089
04:34:53,118 --> 04:34:55,759
we provide our customers a wealth of

6090
04:34:55,759 --> 04:34:58,719
solutions like web application firewall

6091
04:34:58,719 --> 04:35:00,879
ddos protection client-side protection

6092
04:35:00,879 --> 04:35:03,039
account takeover prevention

6093
04:35:03,039 --> 04:35:04,400
and more

6094
04:35:04,400 --> 04:35:05,599
um

6095
04:35:05,599 --> 04:35:07,438
today i'm going to tell you about one of

6096
04:35:07,438 --> 04:35:09,759
our recent projects

6097
04:35:09,759 --> 04:35:11,680
that combines

6098
04:35:11,680 --> 04:35:13,118
research in

6099
04:35:13,118 --> 04:35:15,680
security and machine learning

6100
04:35:15,680 --> 04:35:16,958
and this

6101
04:35:16,958 --> 04:35:20,000
project is about classifying

6102
04:35:20,000 --> 04:35:22,480
pieces of code into obfuscated and clear

6103
04:35:22,480 --> 04:35:24,879
text ones

6104
04:35:24,879 --> 04:35:26,400
so let's start

6105
04:35:26,400 --> 04:35:28,958
so the motivation is

6106
04:35:28,958 --> 04:35:31,520
clearly to help customers to prevent

6107
04:35:31,520 --> 04:35:32,480
attacks

6108
04:35:32,480 --> 04:35:35,199
and one of ways to do so is to

6109
04:35:35,199 --> 04:35:38,000
concentrate on a client-side perspective

6110
04:35:38,000 --> 04:35:39,759
so

6111
04:35:39,759 --> 04:35:42,000
a typical website has many many

6112
04:35:42,000 --> 04:35:44,320
resources most of them are totally

6113
04:35:44,320 --> 04:35:45,359
harmless

6114
04:35:45,359 --> 04:35:46,160
but

6115
04:35:46,160 --> 04:35:49,039
there could be several malicious ones if

6116
04:35:49,039 --> 04:35:51,359
attackers manage to inject them into the

6117
04:35:51,359 --> 04:35:54,320
website and the question is how how we

6118
04:35:54,320 --> 04:35:56,080
find them and how we distinguish between

6119
04:35:56,080 --> 04:35:57,840
those

6120
04:35:57,840 --> 04:36:00,320
so since a website has many many

6121
04:36:00,320 --> 04:36:02,879
resources this is something that clearly

6122
04:36:02,879 --> 04:36:05,680
cannot be done done manually and

6123
04:36:05,680 --> 04:36:08,879
moreover even semi semi-automatically is

6124
04:36:08,879 --> 04:36:10,561
not good enough we need a totally

6125
04:36:10,561 --> 04:36:15,039
automatic automated process to do that

6126
04:36:15,039 --> 04:36:15,840
so

6127
04:36:15,840 --> 04:36:19,278
let's take a simple example of of of

6128
04:36:19,278 --> 04:36:23,118
resources and and see how how it looks

6129
04:36:23,118 --> 04:36:24,561
so

6130
04:36:24,561 --> 04:36:26,561
here

6131
04:36:26,561 --> 04:36:30,480
we have a piece of code in javascript

6132
04:36:30,480 --> 04:36:33,438
which is actually a keylogger so

6133
04:36:33,438 --> 04:36:35,359
you can see i'm not sure if you can see

6134
04:36:35,359 --> 04:36:38,160
my laser but anyway here above you can

6135
04:36:38,160 --> 04:36:39,759
see the command and control endpoint

6136
04:36:39,759 --> 04:36:41,840
which is example.com

6137
04:36:41,840 --> 04:36:44,400
and you can see that we are listening to

6138
04:36:44,400 --> 04:36:47,199
keydown events and

6139
04:36:47,199 --> 04:36:48,958
we send in the data to the command

6140
04:36:48,958 --> 04:36:50,320
control

6141
04:36:50,320 --> 04:36:51,199
back

6142
04:36:51,199 --> 04:36:54,240
every every 10 seconds

6143
04:36:54,240 --> 04:36:56,561
and now let's take a look at another

6144
04:36:56,561 --> 04:36:59,959
piece of code

6145
04:37:00,958 --> 04:37:03,520
so it looks really similar you can see

6146
04:37:03,520 --> 04:37:05,438
that the command control endpoint here

6147
04:37:05,438 --> 04:37:06,799
is missing

6148
04:37:06,799 --> 04:37:09,278
and you can see that we listening to the

6149
04:37:09,278 --> 04:37:10,799
same event

6150
04:37:10,799 --> 04:37:12,080
and we

6151
04:37:12,080 --> 04:37:13,840
just login it

6152
04:37:13,840 --> 04:37:17,520
locally once every every hour

6153
04:37:17,520 --> 04:37:18,799
so i

6154
04:37:18,799 --> 04:37:19,599
just

6155
04:37:19,599 --> 04:37:22,240
highlighted the difference here for you

6156
04:37:22,240 --> 04:37:24,320
and as you can see

6157
04:37:24,320 --> 04:37:26,958
uh for this very very simple example

6158
04:37:26,958 --> 04:37:29,199
almost trivial example the differences

6159
04:37:29,199 --> 04:37:30,719
are very subtle

6160
04:37:30,719 --> 04:37:32,400
so it requires

6161
04:37:32,400 --> 04:37:33,919
really

6162
04:37:33,919 --> 04:37:35,520
tedious work

6163
04:37:35,520 --> 04:37:37,599
to to even support them

6164
04:37:37,599 --> 04:37:42,240
and attention to the tiniest of details

6165
04:37:42,240 --> 04:37:43,680
um

6166
04:37:43,680 --> 04:37:46,480
as i said in imperva we're interested in

6167
04:37:46,480 --> 04:37:48,160
this problem and and

6168
04:37:48,160 --> 04:37:50,160
an example is our client side protection

6169
04:37:50,160 --> 04:37:51,118
product

6170
04:37:51,118 --> 04:37:52,080
which

6171
04:37:52,080 --> 04:37:53,840
enables our customers to look on the

6172
04:37:53,840 --> 04:37:56,561
resources on the website and

6173
04:37:56,561 --> 04:37:59,919
and see which which ones are potentially

6174
04:37:59,919 --> 04:38:01,840
harmful and

6175
04:38:01,840 --> 04:38:03,680
we provide

6176
04:38:03,680 --> 04:38:06,958
several scores and several data for

6177
04:38:06,958 --> 04:38:08,799
those resources so the customers can

6178
04:38:08,799 --> 04:38:11,039
really understand what's going on

6179
04:38:11,039 --> 04:38:13,438
and as you saw in this really trivial

6180
04:38:13,438 --> 04:38:16,958
example um this this problem is very

6181
04:38:16,958 --> 04:38:19,278
real really difficult for humans

6182
04:38:19,278 --> 04:38:22,879
um and the question is whether it is

6183
04:38:22,879 --> 04:38:25,118
solvable at all for machines and and by

6184
04:38:25,118 --> 04:38:26,879
machines i mean of course in machine

6185
04:38:26,879 --> 04:38:28,639
learning sense

6186
04:38:28,639 --> 04:38:30,320
um

6187
04:38:30,320 --> 04:38:32,320
so

6188
04:38:32,320 --> 04:38:34,561
just one more word about this so

6189
04:38:34,561 --> 04:38:37,199
before this project uh the way we

6190
04:38:37,199 --> 04:38:39,520
tackled it was to use the best data we

6191
04:38:39,520 --> 04:38:42,400
have in a company and to calculate

6192
04:38:42,400 --> 04:38:45,919
reputation uh for ips and domains and

6193
04:38:45,919 --> 04:38:47,759
combine all this data in rule-based

6194
04:38:47,759 --> 04:38:51,359
method uh in rule-based techniques

6195
04:38:51,359 --> 04:38:53,919
and and that's how we we provided this

6196
04:38:53,919 --> 04:38:55,278
this course

6197
04:38:55,278 --> 04:38:56,480
um

6198
04:38:56,480 --> 04:38:57,278
so

6199
04:38:57,278 --> 04:39:00,080
now back to our story when we see uh you

6200
04:39:00,080 --> 04:39:02,879
know a difficult problem um

6201
04:39:02,879 --> 04:39:04,080
what do we do

6202
04:39:04,080 --> 04:39:06,080
well we search for an easier one and and

6203
04:39:06,080 --> 04:39:07,599
this is of course for dramatization

6204
04:39:07,599 --> 04:39:10,320
purposes only for this presentation so

6205
04:39:10,320 --> 04:39:12,879
and is your problem with uh which i'll

6206
04:39:12,879 --> 04:39:14,958
just explain in a second why it is at

6207
04:39:14,958 --> 04:39:17,759
all related is obfuscation so

6208
04:39:17,759 --> 04:39:19,359
for those of you who never heard of it

6209
04:39:19,359 --> 04:39:22,400
before obfuscation is uh is an

6210
04:39:22,400 --> 04:39:24,240
interesting thing

6211
04:39:24,240 --> 04:39:26,719
the theoretical foundations of it go

6212
04:39:26,719 --> 04:39:28,160
deep in computer science and the

6213
04:39:28,160 --> 04:39:30,639
computational complexity but

6214
04:39:30,639 --> 04:39:32,480
if you are down to earthquake it's just

6215
04:39:32,480 --> 04:39:35,278
a family of algorithms of techniques

6216
04:39:35,278 --> 04:39:37,760
that make transformation on your code

6217
04:39:37,760 --> 04:39:40,240
they take your code and then transform

6218
04:39:40,240 --> 04:39:42,718
it so it preserves the functionality and

6219
04:39:42,718 --> 04:39:44,718
hopefully the right time

6220
04:39:44,718 --> 04:39:47,280
but it really hides the inner structure

6221
04:39:47,280 --> 04:39:49,280
in a way that people find it very

6222
04:39:49,280 --> 04:39:51,280
difficult to understand and it makes it

6223
04:39:51,280 --> 04:39:53,680
almost unintelligible uh

6224
04:39:53,680 --> 04:39:55,680
to humans to to really understand what's

6225
04:39:55,680 --> 04:39:56,958
going on so

6226
04:39:56,958 --> 04:40:00,717
let's let's take an example

6227
04:40:00,798 --> 04:40:03,840
so this is like the most trivial piece

6228
04:40:03,840 --> 04:40:05,920
of of code in javascript you could think

6229
04:40:05,920 --> 04:40:08,718
of it's just uh you know printing hello

6230
04:40:08,718 --> 04:40:10,480
world to the console log

6231
04:40:10,480 --> 04:40:12,798
and when i take this piece of code and

6232
04:40:12,798 --> 04:40:14,798
obfuscate it using one of the readily

6233
04:40:14,798 --> 04:40:17,760
available tools in the internet

6234
04:40:17,760 --> 04:40:20,320
uh we end up with with

6235
04:40:20,320 --> 04:40:21,600
all this

6236
04:40:21,600 --> 04:40:24,320
and actually even

6237
04:40:24,320 --> 04:40:25,840
all this too

6238
04:40:25,840 --> 04:40:28,798
so you may say well this is ridiculous

6239
04:40:28,798 --> 04:40:31,680
this is probably some contrived example

6240
04:40:31,680 --> 04:40:34,400
but but uh but you are wrong

6241
04:40:34,400 --> 04:40:36,958
and and the reason is that i i just used

6242
04:40:36,958 --> 04:40:39,440
a tool with the lowest obfuscation

6243
04:40:39,440 --> 04:40:42,638
possible um in this specific tool which

6244
04:40:42,638 --> 04:40:46,160
is obfuscator io and if i would use uh

6245
04:40:46,160 --> 04:40:48,160
this tool with the highest level of

6246
04:40:48,160 --> 04:40:49,520
obfuscation

6247
04:40:49,520 --> 04:40:51,520
we would end up with many many pages

6248
04:40:51,520 --> 04:40:54,000
that i would have to show you here

6249
04:40:54,000 --> 04:40:54,878
so

6250
04:40:54,878 --> 04:40:56,878
this is this is a real world example and

6251
04:40:56,878 --> 04:40:59,600
this is really how fuscation work uh

6252
04:40:59,600 --> 04:41:01,920
just for for this trivial piece of code

6253
04:41:01,920 --> 04:41:03,440
imagine what happens when your code

6254
04:41:03,440 --> 04:41:05,440
really does something interesting

6255
04:41:05,440 --> 04:41:07,840
um

6256
04:41:07,840 --> 04:41:09,840
so

6257
04:41:09,840 --> 04:41:11,520
and of course the question is how is it

6258
04:41:11,520 --> 04:41:13,680
all this is related to maliciousness

6259
04:41:13,680 --> 04:41:15,520
because remember we started with

6260
04:41:15,520 --> 04:41:16,878
maliciousness

6261
04:41:16,878 --> 04:41:19,680
um so the answer is that it depends on

6262
04:41:19,680 --> 04:41:20,878
the language

6263
04:41:20,878 --> 04:41:22,958
uh so

6264
04:41:22,958 --> 04:41:24,080
um

6265
04:41:24,080 --> 04:41:26,480
the the thing with um

6266
04:41:26,480 --> 04:41:29,120
with obfuscation on our client side for

6267
04:41:29,120 --> 04:41:31,760
example in javascript is that sometimes

6268
04:41:31,760 --> 04:41:33,360
it can be used for legitimate purposes

6269
04:41:33,360 --> 04:41:35,680
for example for preserving intellectual

6270
04:41:35,680 --> 04:41:38,480
property if you want to to hide your

6271
04:41:38,480 --> 04:41:40,480
code because you invested

6272
04:41:40,480 --> 04:41:42,560
a lot of time developing it and there is

6273
04:41:42,560 --> 04:41:44,240
nothing malicious there

6274
04:41:44,240 --> 04:41:46,638
uh and there are a few more a few

6275
04:41:46,638 --> 04:41:50,240
additional reasons uh but uh on the

6276
04:41:50,240 --> 04:41:53,520
client on the server side uh this two

6277
04:41:53,520 --> 04:41:55,200
two problems are really uh closely

6278
04:41:55,200 --> 04:41:57,520
related because usually you don't have

6279
04:41:57,520 --> 04:42:00,080
to protect your code from hackers on the

6280
04:42:00,080 --> 04:42:02,000
server side if you don't you know move

6281
04:42:02,000 --> 04:42:04,400
it anywhere and do not give it to anyone

6282
04:42:04,400 --> 04:42:06,320
uh and still

6283
04:42:06,320 --> 04:42:08,480
if we look on these two uh domains

6284
04:42:08,480 --> 04:42:10,958
together client side and server side uh

6285
04:42:10,958 --> 04:42:13,520
still obfuscation is a very very

6286
04:42:13,520 --> 04:42:15,920
interesting signal that usually helps us

6287
04:42:15,920 --> 04:42:17,600
to determine maliciousness of the of

6288
04:42:17,600 --> 04:42:20,240
this piece of code

6289
04:42:20,240 --> 04:42:22,320
um

6290
04:42:22,320 --> 04:42:23,200
okay

6291
04:42:23,200 --> 04:42:25,440
so

6292
04:42:25,440 --> 04:42:28,160
so what we want to do from this point on

6293
04:42:28,160 --> 04:42:30,958
is to classify every javascript document

6294
04:42:30,958 --> 04:42:34,400
into clear text or obfuscated

6295
04:42:34,400 --> 04:42:35,520
um

6296
04:42:35,520 --> 04:42:37,120
and the question is

6297
04:42:37,120 --> 04:42:39,600
is it easy for humans

6298
04:42:39,600 --> 04:42:43,360
so let's look on another example

6299
04:42:43,360 --> 04:42:44,480
um

6300
04:42:44,480 --> 04:42:46,638
i hope you can see i hope it's not too

6301
04:42:46,638 --> 04:42:48,160
small i try to make it as large as

6302
04:42:48,160 --> 04:42:51,440
possible take a few moments to try to

6303
04:42:51,440 --> 04:42:54,798
understand what what it does if you

6304
04:42:54,798 --> 04:42:58,120
if you will

6305
04:43:06,320 --> 04:43:10,560
and then of course we have another piece

6306
04:43:12,240 --> 04:43:15,120
look pretty similar

6307
04:43:16,840 --> 04:43:19,920
andy okay so without you know torturing

6308
04:43:19,920 --> 04:43:21,200
you too much

6309
04:43:21,200 --> 04:43:22,240
um

6310
04:43:22,240 --> 04:43:25,200
this is uh a part of

6311
04:43:25,200 --> 04:43:28,080
uh of a malicious script that i took

6312
04:43:28,080 --> 04:43:33,200
um and and this is indeed obfuscated

6313
04:43:33,200 --> 04:43:36,000
uh and and this part the first one

6314
04:43:36,000 --> 04:43:38,480
is uh is actually a clear text this is a

6315
04:43:38,480 --> 04:43:41,440
part of a script from uh from youtube

6316
04:43:41,440 --> 04:43:42,718
that is uh

6317
04:43:42,718 --> 04:43:44,840
used to speed up

6318
04:43:44,840 --> 04:43:48,160
um the if you embed a piece of youtube

6319
04:43:48,160 --> 04:43:50,400
in your on your website so this is the

6320
04:43:50,400 --> 04:43:52,798
code that uh just just a small part of

6321
04:43:52,798 --> 04:43:55,600
this code that uses to speed it up and

6322
04:43:55,600 --> 04:43:58,718
and this is probably um calculate some

6323
04:43:58,718 --> 04:44:02,798
hash function or things like that

6324
04:44:02,798 --> 04:44:03,760
so

6325
04:44:03,760 --> 04:44:06,320
um as you saw it's not really uh it's

6326
04:44:06,320 --> 04:44:08,560
not really easy to to distinguish

6327
04:44:08,560 --> 04:44:10,878
between the two cases for humans and

6328
04:44:10,878 --> 04:44:12,878
actually it turns out that it might take

6329
04:44:12,878 --> 04:44:14,878
a lot of time for seasoned security

6330
04:44:14,878 --> 04:44:18,320
researcher and the reason is uh that in

6331
04:44:18,320 --> 04:44:20,718
order to decide if the code is

6332
04:44:20,718 --> 04:44:22,560
obfuscated or clear text what what this

6333
04:44:22,560 --> 04:44:25,600
researcher does usually is really trying

6334
04:44:25,600 --> 04:44:27,200
to understand what the code does it's

6335
04:44:27,200 --> 04:44:30,000
not just trying to see i mean

6336
04:44:30,000 --> 04:44:31,360
it's not written anywhere you know it's

6337
04:44:31,360 --> 04:44:33,040
not for scared or not we need to

6338
04:44:33,040 --> 04:44:35,280
understand what the code really does and

6339
04:44:35,280 --> 04:44:37,120
sometimes it takes time

6340
04:44:37,120 --> 04:44:38,160
so

6341
04:44:38,160 --> 04:44:40,080
uh it's clearly something that is

6342
04:44:40,080 --> 04:44:43,040
unscalable in any in any way

6343
04:44:43,040 --> 04:44:44,400
um

6344
04:44:44,400 --> 04:44:46,080
so the question is

6345
04:44:46,080 --> 04:44:47,120
is it

6346
04:44:47,120 --> 04:44:49,360
easy for machines and of course we

6347
04:44:49,360 --> 04:44:51,040
didn't jump into the machine learning

6348
04:44:51,040 --> 04:44:54,480
solution right away we we tried working

6349
04:44:54,480 --> 04:44:56,798
with heuristics and it turns out that

6350
04:44:56,798 --> 04:44:58,560
heuristics are not good enough simply

6351
04:44:58,560 --> 04:45:01,360
because they are too specific and we

6352
04:45:01,360 --> 04:45:03,680
will talk about the various obfuscators

6353
04:45:03,680 --> 04:45:06,400
in a few moments and you might then

6354
04:45:06,400 --> 04:45:07,920
understand why

6355
04:45:07,920 --> 04:45:11,760
um so the mission from this point on is

6356
04:45:11,760 --> 04:45:13,440
to build a machine learning classifier

6357
04:45:13,440 --> 04:45:16,000
for this problem

6358
04:45:16,000 --> 04:45:16,958
so

6359
04:45:16,958 --> 04:45:18,798
i'll tell you about several approaches

6360
04:45:18,798 --> 04:45:22,798
from the literature we could uh use

6361
04:45:22,798 --> 04:45:25,520
um so the first approach is a classical

6362
04:45:25,520 --> 04:45:26,560
one

6363
04:45:26,560 --> 04:45:29,200
uh there is a paper by er telenbach and

6364
04:45:29,200 --> 04:45:31,520
uh and several additional researchers

6365
04:45:31,520 --> 04:45:33,520
from 2016

6366
04:45:33,520 --> 04:45:35,680
where they proposed to do a classical

6367
04:45:35,680 --> 04:45:39,200
feature engineering meaning to extract

6368
04:45:39,200 --> 04:45:41,840
things like average length of line

6369
04:45:41,840 --> 04:45:44,080
frequency of specific words specific

6370
04:45:44,080 --> 04:45:45,360
characters

6371
04:45:45,360 --> 04:45:47,120
and then

6372
04:45:47,120 --> 04:45:49,840
build a decision tree so i guess you've

6373
04:45:49,840 --> 04:45:52,638
heard about this kind of trees

6374
04:45:52,638 --> 04:45:55,360
and here is a simple example

6375
04:45:55,360 --> 04:45:56,480
so

6376
04:45:56,480 --> 04:45:57,600
um

6377
04:45:57,600 --> 04:46:00,160
this this tree is checking whether the

6378
04:46:00,160 --> 04:46:02,240
average length of line is larger than

6379
04:46:02,240 --> 04:46:05,440
some threshold and if it is it then

6380
04:46:05,440 --> 04:46:06,798
checks the frequency of certain

6381
04:46:06,798 --> 04:46:09,760
character and if and if it exceeds the

6382
04:46:09,760 --> 04:46:11,440
threshold for example it says that the

6383
04:46:11,440 --> 04:46:13,680
script is obfuscated of course this is a

6384
04:46:13,680 --> 04:46:15,440
really simple example but just to get

6385
04:46:15,440 --> 04:46:18,840
you understand the principle

6386
04:46:18,840 --> 04:46:23,760
um another approach was suggested by um

6387
04:46:23,760 --> 04:46:25,440
skolka and

6388
04:46:25,440 --> 04:46:28,520
uh his friends in in

6389
04:46:28,520 --> 04:46:32,400
2019 they suggested to build a deep

6390
04:46:32,400 --> 04:46:35,200
learning classifier based on uh

6391
04:46:35,200 --> 04:46:36,718
convolutional neural networks and

6392
04:46:36,718 --> 04:46:38,560
abstract syntax trees

6393
04:46:38,560 --> 04:46:39,600
so

6394
04:46:39,600 --> 04:46:42,000
um convolutional neural network just in

6395
04:46:42,000 --> 04:46:44,718
a sentence is a is a

6396
04:46:44,718 --> 04:46:48,400
method used a lot in vision but today

6397
04:46:48,400 --> 04:46:50,480
it's also used in additional fields in

6398
04:46:50,480 --> 04:46:52,718
deep learning and the abstract syntax

6399
04:46:52,718 --> 04:46:55,760
trees is you can uh easily download a

6400
04:46:55,760 --> 04:46:58,320
tool that takes your script javascript

6401
04:46:58,320 --> 04:47:00,878
in this in our case and the compo and

6402
04:47:00,878 --> 04:47:04,080
builds out of it the syntax tree for uh

6403
04:47:04,080 --> 04:47:06,080
for the script where you can see the

6404
04:47:06,080 --> 04:47:08,240
structure and you can extract many

6405
04:47:08,240 --> 04:47:10,160
interesting features out of this tree

6406
04:47:10,160 --> 04:47:12,480
and then these features are fed into the

6407
04:47:12,480 --> 04:47:16,560
network um of these guys

6408
04:47:16,560 --> 04:47:18,718
and the last possible approach

6409
04:47:18,718 --> 04:47:21,520
is uh natural languages processing

6410
04:47:21,520 --> 04:47:22,638
so

6411
04:47:22,638 --> 04:47:25,680
in the recent years we we see a really

6412
04:47:25,680 --> 04:47:28,798
tremendous advances in this in this

6413
04:47:28,798 --> 04:47:31,840
field we we see uh um amazing models

6414
04:47:31,840 --> 04:47:34,320
that understand human language and

6415
04:47:34,320 --> 04:47:37,040
enable us to to solve a multitude of

6416
04:47:37,040 --> 04:47:40,080
tasks for example uh question answering

6417
04:47:40,080 --> 04:47:41,280
and and

6418
04:47:41,280 --> 04:47:44,240
um text classification and many more so

6419
04:47:44,240 --> 04:47:45,680
um so

6420
04:47:45,680 --> 04:47:47,520
in our case what we can do with it we

6421
04:47:47,520 --> 04:47:50,480
can take a model bert is just an example

6422
04:47:50,480 --> 04:47:53,760
to use the weights uh the the model was

6423
04:47:53,760 --> 04:47:55,920
trained on and then we train it on

6424
04:47:55,920 --> 04:47:59,520
downstream tasks and namely our task we

6425
04:47:59,520 --> 04:48:02,400
just fitted documents uh which are

6426
04:48:02,400 --> 04:48:04,718
javascript classified into clear text or

6427
04:48:04,718 --> 04:48:07,120
obfuscated ahead of time and then the

6428
04:48:07,120 --> 04:48:09,920
model learns it and adjust the weights

6429
04:48:09,920 --> 04:48:13,920
uh that it had learned uh previously

6430
04:48:13,920 --> 04:48:16,080
um

6431
04:48:16,080 --> 04:48:18,400
so our first approach

6432
04:48:18,400 --> 04:48:21,440
was uh inspired by the by the first work

6433
04:48:21,440 --> 04:48:24,080
we started simple we wanted to make to

6434
04:48:24,080 --> 04:48:26,560
build a simple model and we wanna to

6435
04:48:26,560 --> 04:48:28,878
benefit from decision trees that enable

6436
04:48:28,878 --> 04:48:32,560
us to gain explainability it can uh when

6437
04:48:32,560 --> 04:48:36,000
we use a decision tree it's very easy to

6438
04:48:36,000 --> 04:48:38,080
see really which features are affecting

6439
04:48:38,080 --> 04:48:41,120
the model and how um so we took

6440
04:48:41,120 --> 04:48:43,360
something about 40 features

6441
04:48:43,360 --> 04:48:44,080
and

6442
04:48:44,080 --> 04:48:46,638
we trained on a single obfuscator

6443
04:48:46,638 --> 04:48:49,600
and it turns out that this model didn't

6444
04:48:49,600 --> 04:48:50,878
generalize

6445
04:48:50,878 --> 04:48:53,360
um so

6446
04:48:53,360 --> 04:48:55,360
what went wrong

6447
04:48:55,360 --> 04:48:57,200
in order to understand that we have to

6448
04:48:57,200 --> 04:48:59,120
dive a bit deeper into the various

6449
04:48:59,120 --> 04:49:02,718
obfuscators for javascript

6450
04:49:03,920 --> 04:49:05,280
so here

6451
04:49:05,280 --> 04:49:08,320
i prepared a list of the most used

6452
04:49:08,320 --> 04:49:10,638
obfuscators for javascript

6453
04:49:10,638 --> 04:49:12,958
sorted by the popularity metric of

6454
04:49:12,958 --> 04:49:14,560
github which is the number of forks as

6455
04:49:14,560 --> 04:49:17,600
you can see uh ugly5.js and obfuscatorio

6456
04:49:17,600 --> 04:49:20,000
are the most used ones and there are

6457
04:49:20,000 --> 04:49:21,520
additional ones

6458
04:49:21,520 --> 04:49:23,600
here

6459
04:49:23,600 --> 04:49:24,638
so

6460
04:49:24,638 --> 04:49:26,400
what methods

6461
04:49:26,400 --> 04:49:28,240
do these obfuscators

6462
04:49:28,240 --> 04:49:30,000
employ

6463
04:49:30,000 --> 04:49:32,320
let's see a few examples so the first

6464
04:49:32,320 --> 04:49:34,480
thing people immediately think of when

6465
04:49:34,480 --> 04:49:36,958
they think of obfuscation is renaming of

6466
04:49:36,958 --> 04:49:38,958
variables and functions and indeed if

6467
04:49:38,958 --> 04:49:41,040
you think of your code if you name it a

6468
04:49:41,040 --> 04:49:43,040
bit sometimes it makes it clearly

6469
04:49:43,040 --> 04:49:44,798
unintelligible

6470
04:49:44,798 --> 04:49:47,360
even before it might be not really

6471
04:49:47,360 --> 04:49:49,120
easy to understand so

6472
04:49:49,120 --> 04:49:51,760
in this simple example you can see we

6473
04:49:51,760 --> 04:49:54,080
just rename a few things and it already

6474
04:49:54,080 --> 04:49:56,638
looks a bit more intimidating

6475
04:49:56,638 --> 04:49:59,120
um

6476
04:49:59,120 --> 04:50:00,958
additional technique is modification of

6477
04:50:00,958 --> 04:50:02,878
functions uh

6478
04:50:02,878 --> 04:50:05,440
function calls function arguments and

6479
04:50:05,440 --> 04:50:07,040
the return values

6480
04:50:07,040 --> 04:50:09,200
uh so in this simple example i just took

6481
04:50:09,200 --> 04:50:12,000
a function that just squares a number

6482
04:50:12,000 --> 04:50:13,680
and i show you a snippet of the code

6483
04:50:13,680 --> 04:50:15,520
it's not the whole code that was a

6484
04:50:15,520 --> 04:50:17,520
result that was produced up after

6485
04:50:17,520 --> 04:50:20,560
obfuscating it but you can clearly see

6486
04:50:20,560 --> 04:50:21,600
that

6487
04:50:21,600 --> 04:50:23,760
the function gets many parameters and

6488
04:50:23,760 --> 04:50:25,840
returns many things and it's really

6489
04:50:25,840 --> 04:50:29,040
complicated things a lot

6490
04:50:30,160 --> 04:50:32,958
additional key example is a modification

6491
04:50:32,958 --> 04:50:34,798
of strings

6492
04:50:34,798 --> 04:50:37,760
by using encoding encryption and string

6493
04:50:37,760 --> 04:50:39,040
generators

6494
04:50:39,040 --> 04:50:39,840
so

6495
04:50:39,840 --> 04:50:41,600
in this example we have a simple

6496
04:50:41,600 --> 04:50:45,760
variable and uh if we want to to find

6497
04:50:45,760 --> 04:50:47,600
the strings that were used inside of it

6498
04:50:47,600 --> 04:50:50,480
like it's you know the honda accord car

6499
04:50:50,480 --> 04:50:52,080
you can see that the strings are

6500
04:50:52,080 --> 04:50:55,760
splitted and then uh several um

6501
04:50:55,760 --> 04:50:57,840
arithmetic operations are used and if

6502
04:50:57,840 --> 04:50:59,920
you look on the resulting code without

6503
04:50:59,920 --> 04:51:03,040
having seen the clear text one ahead of

6504
04:51:03,040 --> 04:51:05,680
time it really takes time to understand

6505
04:51:05,680 --> 04:51:08,160
what's what happens there

6506
04:51:08,160 --> 04:51:10,320
and and the last example in this context

6507
04:51:10,320 --> 04:51:12,878
is the manipulation of constants so if

6508
04:51:12,878 --> 04:51:15,200
we have a simple constant we might end

6509
04:51:15,200 --> 04:51:18,638
up with some expression which we need to

6510
04:51:18,638 --> 04:51:20,878
calculate to to understand what the

6511
04:51:20,878 --> 04:51:22,878
constant is and there are additional

6512
04:51:22,878 --> 04:51:24,400
methods like changing the base of

6513
04:51:24,400 --> 04:51:27,520
integers and injecting dead or redundant

6514
04:51:27,520 --> 04:51:29,600
code which of course uh you know it's

6515
04:51:29,600 --> 04:51:32,160
clear what it does uh complicates things

6516
04:51:32,160 --> 04:51:34,480
a lot

6517
04:51:34,638 --> 04:51:36,240
so what are the differences between

6518
04:51:36,240 --> 04:51:38,240
those those are for skaters and in

6519
04:51:38,240 --> 04:51:40,240
general between those skaters so the

6520
04:51:40,240 --> 04:51:42,240
differences are as you might imagine

6521
04:51:42,240 --> 04:51:44,958
specific renaming methods the the the

6522
04:51:44,958 --> 04:51:47,120
encoding encryption functions that that

6523
04:51:47,120 --> 04:51:49,840
are used and some more so

6524
04:51:49,840 --> 04:51:51,680
moreover uh

6525
04:51:51,680 --> 04:51:54,160
most of these obfuscators can receive a

6526
04:51:54,160 --> 04:51:56,958
lot of parameters to tweak them and the

6527
04:51:56,958 --> 04:52:00,080
the resulting uh the resulting uh docu

6528
04:52:00,080 --> 04:52:03,200
the resulting code uh looks much looks

6529
04:52:03,200 --> 04:52:05,200
very different if you run a single

6530
04:52:05,200 --> 04:52:08,480
obfuscator in mode one versus mode two

6531
04:52:08,480 --> 04:52:11,280
so uh just an examples for for

6532
04:52:11,280 --> 04:52:12,958
javascript for skater it has 40

6533
04:52:12,958 --> 04:52:15,280
parameters and the ugly 5.js has 30

6534
04:52:15,280 --> 04:52:16,560
parameters so

6535
04:52:16,560 --> 04:52:20,080
uh as you might imagine uh when we uh

6536
04:52:20,080 --> 04:52:21,680
compare between different obfuscators

6537
04:52:21,680 --> 04:52:23,360
that clearly uh

6538
04:52:23,360 --> 04:52:25,120
distribute the output distribution looks

6539
04:52:25,120 --> 04:52:28,320
different and in in if we think about

6540
04:52:28,320 --> 04:52:29,920
distributions

6541
04:52:29,920 --> 04:52:30,958
so

6542
04:52:30,958 --> 04:52:33,440
uh we get different um

6543
04:52:33,440 --> 04:52:35,040
everything that you that you like

6544
04:52:35,040 --> 04:52:38,878
average length of line length of word

6545
04:52:38,878 --> 04:52:41,280
function size a proportion of encoded

6546
04:52:41,280 --> 04:52:42,480
characters

6547
04:52:42,480 --> 04:52:45,040
and in general this is just an example

6548
04:52:45,040 --> 04:52:46,400
if we want to

6549
04:52:46,400 --> 04:52:47,280
uh

6550
04:52:47,280 --> 04:52:49,280
measure the normalized backslash count

6551
04:52:49,280 --> 04:52:50,638
which is one of the features that was

6552
04:52:50,638 --> 04:52:52,240
proposed in the paper that i mentioned

6553
04:52:52,240 --> 04:52:53,200
before

6554
04:52:53,200 --> 04:52:55,680
or every length of line you can see that

6555
04:52:55,680 --> 04:52:57,920
the differences between the obfuscators

6556
04:52:57,920 --> 04:53:00,000
can be really big and this is log scale

6557
04:53:00,000 --> 04:53:02,480
by the way

6558
04:53:02,958 --> 04:53:05,760
so before uh telling you about the

6559
04:53:05,760 --> 04:53:08,160
approach that really worked for us i

6560
04:53:08,160 --> 04:53:10,080
just say a few words about the data we

6561
04:53:10,080 --> 04:53:12,320
train the model on

6562
04:53:12,320 --> 04:53:14,480
so we use the public data set

6563
04:53:14,480 --> 04:53:17,840
of about 150 000 javascripts all of them

6564
04:53:17,840 --> 04:53:19,280
are clear text

6565
04:53:19,280 --> 04:53:20,718
and we applied four different

6566
04:53:20,718 --> 04:53:23,280
obfuscators of them and and four because

6567
04:53:23,280 --> 04:53:26,160
we wanted to uh test the model on

6568
04:53:26,160 --> 04:53:28,958
additional three that the the model has

6569
04:53:28,958 --> 04:53:31,840
previously not seen

6570
04:53:31,840 --> 04:53:33,680
and we um

6571
04:53:33,680 --> 04:53:36,240
we got perfectly balanced data set of

6572
04:53:36,240 --> 04:53:39,520
about 100 000 clear tech javascript and

6573
04:53:39,520 --> 04:53:41,840
100 000 obfuscated javascripts equally

6574
04:53:41,840 --> 04:53:44,240
divided between the

6575
04:53:44,240 --> 04:53:45,680
uh

6576
04:53:45,680 --> 04:53:48,878
between the obfuscators

6577
04:53:48,878 --> 04:53:49,840
so

6578
04:53:49,840 --> 04:53:52,400
um our approach combined techni

6579
04:53:52,400 --> 04:53:54,080
approaches number one and three that i

6580
04:53:54,080 --> 04:53:55,280
mentioned

6581
04:53:55,280 --> 04:53:56,798
uh and

6582
04:53:56,798 --> 04:53:59,760
and the idea is as follows we tokenize

6583
04:53:59,760 --> 04:54:03,200
the input into words and we calculate

6584
04:54:03,200 --> 04:54:05,600
the most common words in the clear text

6585
04:54:05,600 --> 04:54:07,840
javascript so we take all the clear text

6586
04:54:07,840 --> 04:54:10,718
javascripts we extract the common words

6587
04:54:10,718 --> 04:54:12,878
out of it and look on several hundreds

6588
04:54:12,878 --> 04:54:15,280
of them and then for every input we

6589
04:54:15,280 --> 04:54:17,920
measure the difference between this

6590
04:54:17,920 --> 04:54:19,520
input and this

6591
04:54:19,520 --> 04:54:21,600
up and this calculated distribution so

6592
04:54:21,600 --> 04:54:24,160
let me give you a small example

6593
04:54:24,160 --> 04:54:27,200
so assume that the top three words in

6594
04:54:27,200 --> 04:54:29,520
javascript are function document and

6595
04:54:29,520 --> 04:54:32,160
input and assume that like function

6596
04:54:32,160 --> 04:54:34,958
appears about once in every 20 words

6597
04:54:34,958 --> 04:54:37,280
document once in every like 33 words and

6598
04:54:37,280 --> 04:54:40,480
input like once in every 100 words

6599
04:54:40,480 --> 04:54:43,360
so if we have following javascript and

6600
04:54:43,360 --> 04:54:45,600
and if it's too small i'm sorry but you

6601
04:54:45,600 --> 04:54:47,280
don't have to see the exact details i

6602
04:54:47,280 --> 04:54:50,878
will just read them out for you

6603
04:54:51,040 --> 04:54:54,000
so here we have 71 words

6604
04:54:54,000 --> 04:54:55,120
and

6605
04:54:55,120 --> 04:54:57,040
if we look on the word function it

6606
04:54:57,040 --> 04:54:58,400
appears twice

6607
04:54:58,400 --> 04:54:59,920
meaning it appears in three percent of

6608
04:54:59,920 --> 04:55:02,718
the cases the word document appears once

6609
04:55:02,718 --> 04:55:05,360
and the word input appears and never

6610
04:55:05,360 --> 04:55:07,600
appears so if we calculate the

6611
04:55:07,600 --> 04:55:09,920
difference between the clear test

6612
04:55:09,920 --> 04:55:12,000
occurrence we calculated as i showed you

6613
04:55:12,000 --> 04:55:14,000
in the previous slide and the actual

6614
04:55:14,000 --> 04:55:16,240
occurrence we can see the differences in

6615
04:55:16,240 --> 04:55:18,320
red

6616
04:55:18,320 --> 04:55:19,520
so

6617
04:55:19,520 --> 04:55:21,200
um

6618
04:55:21,200 --> 04:55:23,840
what do we do with these differences so

6619
04:55:23,840 --> 04:55:24,638
we

6620
04:55:24,638 --> 04:55:27,680
feed them into a boosted decision tree

6621
04:55:27,680 --> 04:55:29,760
and this is very similar to the example

6622
04:55:29,760 --> 04:55:31,440
that i gave you before

6623
04:55:31,440 --> 04:55:32,638
uh

6624
04:55:32,638 --> 04:55:34,638
and then we just look on the differences

6625
04:55:34,638 --> 04:55:35,920
between

6626
04:55:35,920 --> 04:55:38,718
the specific word how how

6627
04:55:38,718 --> 04:55:41,440
many times it appears and then

6628
04:55:41,440 --> 04:55:43,760
we can know whether the text is

6629
04:55:43,760 --> 04:55:46,638
obfuscated or clear text so i hope this

6630
04:55:46,638 --> 04:55:48,160
this this is clear

6631
04:55:48,160 --> 04:55:49,920
this is just the example of decision

6632
04:55:49,920 --> 04:55:52,080
tree with the different features every

6633
04:55:52,080 --> 04:55:55,120
feature corresponds to a top word we

6634
04:55:55,120 --> 04:55:56,480
extracted from

6635
04:55:56,480 --> 04:55:59,280
the clear text javascript

6636
04:55:59,280 --> 04:56:01,200
so it turned out that the performance of

6637
04:56:01,200 --> 04:56:03,840
a model is is pretty good

6638
04:56:03,840 --> 04:56:06,400
we were mainly interested in this case

6639
04:56:06,400 --> 04:56:08,638
in false negatives and false positives

6640
04:56:08,638 --> 04:56:10,798
you can see that both of them are less

6641
04:56:10,798 --> 04:56:13,760
than one percent uh about that that this

6642
04:56:13,760 --> 04:56:14,718
was the

6643
04:56:14,718 --> 04:56:17,680
uh product requirement and specifically

6644
04:56:17,680 --> 04:56:19,920
uh we wanted uh

6645
04:56:19,920 --> 04:56:21,840
so what's false negative in this case

6646
04:56:21,840 --> 04:56:23,600
false negative means that we are

6647
04:56:23,600 --> 04:56:25,920
classifying some document as

6648
04:56:25,920 --> 04:56:28,638
a clear text when in reality it is

6649
04:56:28,638 --> 04:56:31,280
obfuscated and false positive means we

6650
04:56:31,280 --> 04:56:33,920
calc we classify document as obfuscated

6651
04:56:33,920 --> 04:56:36,638
where in reality it's clear text so

6652
04:56:36,638 --> 04:56:38,480
we were interested in in

6653
04:56:38,480 --> 04:56:40,958
a case where false negative rate is

6654
04:56:40,958 --> 04:56:42,878
smaller than the false positive rate and

6655
04:56:42,878 --> 04:56:46,160
the meaning is uh since remember uh as

6656
04:56:46,160 --> 04:56:48,240
you as you recall as i said it's related

6657
04:56:48,240 --> 04:56:50,638
to maliciousness so we do not want to

6658
04:56:50,638 --> 04:56:54,718
flag uh cases where uh people would look

6659
04:56:54,718 --> 04:56:58,000
and say oh in reality not obfuscated

6660
04:56:58,000 --> 04:56:59,920
so we don't want to

6661
04:56:59,920 --> 04:57:01,360
you know to increase the number of these

6662
04:57:01,360 --> 04:57:04,360
cases

6663
04:57:04,878 --> 04:57:08,718
and the next question we asked whether

6664
04:57:08,718 --> 04:57:10,400
our approach is generalizable to

6665
04:57:10,400 --> 04:57:11,760
additional languages

6666
04:57:11,760 --> 04:57:14,160
and it turns out that that the answer is

6667
04:57:14,160 --> 04:57:15,120
yes

6668
04:57:15,120 --> 04:57:17,520
so we looked on python and php for

6669
04:57:17,520 --> 04:57:18,480
example

6670
04:57:18,480 --> 04:57:20,160
as i mentioned before

6671
04:57:20,160 --> 04:57:23,280
they are uh closer to um

6672
04:57:23,280 --> 04:57:25,040
so so the case for these languages since

6673
04:57:25,040 --> 04:57:28,000
there are server side is um that

6674
04:57:28,000 --> 04:57:29,680
obfuscation and maliciousness are

6675
04:57:29,680 --> 04:57:33,360
closely related to one another and um

6676
04:57:33,360 --> 04:57:34,160
and

6677
04:57:34,160 --> 04:57:36,638
this is why in this in this case is it's

6678
04:57:36,638 --> 04:57:38,798
even more interesting

6679
04:57:38,798 --> 04:57:40,638
and we got really good results of course

6680
04:57:40,638 --> 04:57:43,200
we trained these uh models on on the

6681
04:57:43,200 --> 04:57:45,520
specific data set that were chosen for

6682
04:57:45,520 --> 04:57:47,600
these languages

6683
04:57:47,600 --> 04:57:49,200
so let me show you

6684
04:57:49,200 --> 04:57:51,760
just a very very short demo

6685
04:57:51,760 --> 04:57:53,920
this is the qr code you can scan so we

6686
04:57:53,920 --> 04:57:55,520
set up a website

6687
04:57:55,520 --> 04:57:58,400
uh that you can use it's publicly

6688
04:57:58,400 --> 04:58:00,240
available

6689
04:58:00,240 --> 04:58:04,080
with some version of our model

6690
04:58:04,480 --> 04:58:05,280
and

6691
04:58:05,280 --> 04:58:07,200
you can just play with it

6692
04:58:07,200 --> 04:58:08,798
and see

6693
04:58:08,798 --> 04:58:11,280
and see what's uh what's what's what's

6694
04:58:11,280 --> 04:58:12,320
going on

6695
04:58:12,320 --> 04:58:16,400
so if we take uh this script as example

6696
04:58:16,400 --> 04:58:20,400
you can see it's uh non-obfuscated

6697
04:58:20,400 --> 04:58:21,360
okay

6698
04:58:21,360 --> 04:58:24,000
so we can just take it

6699
04:58:24,000 --> 04:58:26,560
we can feed it into our model this is by

6700
04:58:26,560 --> 04:58:30,638
the way a live demo

6701
04:58:32,718 --> 04:58:33,890
so

6702
04:58:33,890 --> 04:58:35,440
[Music]

6703
04:58:35,440 --> 04:58:37,360
you can see that the model says that

6704
04:58:37,360 --> 04:58:39,280
this is a clear text with probably

6705
04:58:39,280 --> 04:58:40,840
probability

6706
04:58:40,840 --> 04:58:44,240
0.95 meaning the model is pretty certain

6707
04:58:44,240 --> 04:58:47,680
and here you can see shop values uh i'm

6708
04:58:47,680 --> 04:58:49,280
don't have time to explain what what

6709
04:58:49,280 --> 04:58:50,878
they really are they are just the

6710
04:58:50,878 --> 04:58:53,440
significance of features that affected

6711
04:58:53,440 --> 04:58:56,000
the decision so in this case you can see

6712
04:58:56,000 --> 04:58:58,718
uh an example of one gram model which is

6713
04:58:58,718 --> 04:59:00,080
a little bit different of what i

6714
04:59:00,080 --> 04:59:02,798
described before it's one of our models

6715
04:59:02,798 --> 04:59:04,320
that we uh

6716
04:59:04,320 --> 04:59:06,480
built during the development of this

6717
04:59:06,480 --> 04:59:07,520
project

6718
04:59:07,520 --> 04:59:11,040
and um if we take another example just

6719
04:59:11,040 --> 04:59:12,480
just a quick one

6720
04:59:12,480 --> 04:59:13,680
um

6721
04:59:13,680 --> 04:59:14,480
so

6722
04:59:14,480 --> 04:59:17,200
i took i took

6723
04:59:17,200 --> 04:59:18,798
a piece of code

6724
04:59:18,798 --> 04:59:22,798
and uh obfuscated it so you can see that

6725
04:59:22,798 --> 04:59:24,560
i'm not sure you can see unfortunately

6726
04:59:24,560 --> 04:59:27,680
the window is a bit small here but

6727
04:59:27,680 --> 04:59:30,878
you have to trust me on that

6728
04:59:30,878 --> 04:59:36,040
so if we fit the code here

6729
04:59:40,958 --> 04:59:44,080
then um it says that it's obfuscated of

6730
04:59:44,080 --> 04:59:47,440
course the probability is rounded um

6731
04:59:47,440 --> 04:59:48,160
and

6732
04:59:48,160 --> 04:59:50,480
you can also see the various features

6733
04:59:50,480 --> 04:59:54,000
and how they affected the decision so

6734
04:59:54,000 --> 04:59:56,878
um i i cannot promise

6735
04:59:56,878 --> 04:59:57,760
that

6736
04:59:57,760 --> 04:59:59,360
this um

6737
04:59:59,360 --> 05:00:01,680
this website will will remain in this in

6738
05:00:01,680 --> 05:00:04,878
this exact form but if people are uh you

6739
05:00:04,878 --> 05:00:06,958
know interested and and will use it we

6740
05:00:06,958 --> 05:00:09,520
might enhance it and we might uh

6741
05:00:09,520 --> 05:00:10,958
continue uh

6742
05:00:10,958 --> 05:00:12,958
maintaining it

6743
05:00:12,958 --> 05:00:14,240
so

6744
05:00:14,240 --> 05:00:17,040
what are uh what what have we learned in

6745
05:00:17,040 --> 05:00:19,440
this uh in this

6746
05:00:19,440 --> 05:00:21,520
project

6747
05:00:21,520 --> 05:00:23,600
so the first thing is

6748
05:00:23,600 --> 05:00:25,200
about the relationship between

6749
05:00:25,200 --> 05:00:26,718
maliciousness and obfuscation in

6750
05:00:26,718 --> 05:00:28,160
different languages

6751
05:00:28,160 --> 05:00:30,480
as i mentioned it's not a one-to-one

6752
05:00:30,480 --> 05:00:31,600
relation

6753
05:00:31,600 --> 05:00:34,560
but usually obfuscation is a strong

6754
05:00:34,560 --> 05:00:37,600
signal for maliciousness and

6755
05:00:37,600 --> 05:00:40,400
it's really cool because uh i think that

6756
05:00:40,400 --> 05:00:42,638
solving the obfuscation uh

6757
05:00:42,638 --> 05:00:44,638
classification problem is much easier

6758
05:00:44,638 --> 05:00:46,958
than solving the the maliciousness one

6759
05:00:46,958 --> 05:00:50,080
in terms of machine learning of course

6760
05:00:50,080 --> 05:00:51,360
um

6761
05:00:51,360 --> 05:00:55,040
so we saw that uh classifying code we

6762
05:00:55,040 --> 05:00:57,280
saw many problems that are difficult for

6763
05:00:57,280 --> 05:01:00,798
humans uh but even the co even the

6764
05:01:00,798 --> 05:01:03,920
problem which which mine which might uh

6765
05:01:03,920 --> 05:01:06,240
seem simple of classifying the code into

6766
05:01:06,240 --> 05:01:09,520
obfuscated or clear text uh is not is

6767
05:01:09,520 --> 05:01:10,798
not so easy

6768
05:01:10,798 --> 05:01:13,040
and um

6769
05:01:13,040 --> 05:01:15,440
and as we saw building a machine

6770
05:01:15,440 --> 05:01:17,840
learning model that solves it is

6771
05:01:17,840 --> 05:01:20,718
relatively and not very sophisticated

6772
05:01:20,718 --> 05:01:23,680
and not too hard

6773
05:01:23,680 --> 05:01:25,760
another thing is about the obfuscators

6774
05:01:25,760 --> 05:01:27,360
so we had

6775
05:01:27,360 --> 05:01:29,680
several choices here building a machine

6776
05:01:29,680 --> 05:01:31,600
learning model per obfuscator is not

6777
05:01:31,600 --> 05:01:34,080
scalable and looking on the internals of

6778
05:01:34,080 --> 05:01:36,560
each of the skater is not scalable so we

6779
05:01:36,560 --> 05:01:37,760
use this

6780
05:01:37,760 --> 05:01:40,240
you can call it a trick or approach of

6781
05:01:40,240 --> 05:01:42,560
looking on the clear text extracting the

6782
05:01:42,560 --> 05:01:44,958
top words out of them which is inspired

6783
05:01:44,958 --> 05:01:47,520
by natural languages processing

6784
05:01:47,520 --> 05:01:51,120
uh approach and um and and this this is

6785
05:01:51,120 --> 05:01:52,958
uh really enabled us to solve this

6786
05:01:52,958 --> 05:01:54,080
problem

6787
05:01:54,080 --> 05:01:56,878
and another nice thing is that that this

6788
05:01:56,878 --> 05:01:58,638
framework seems general so we didn't

6789
05:01:58,638 --> 05:02:00,560
test it on all languages but i think

6790
05:02:00,560 --> 05:02:02,560
python php and javascript are like the

6791
05:02:02,560 --> 05:02:04,638
more the most interesting interesting

6792
05:02:04,638 --> 05:02:08,240
one in terms of obfuscation um and there

6793
05:02:08,240 --> 05:02:09,920
is no reason to believe that this

6794
05:02:09,920 --> 05:02:11,840
wouldn't work for additional languages

6795
05:02:11,840 --> 05:02:14,958
of course if you train uh the model on a

6796
05:02:14,958 --> 05:02:17,520
large enough data set that is

6797
05:02:17,520 --> 05:02:20,160
properly balanced

6798
05:02:20,160 --> 05:02:22,560
so thank you so much i uh i'm looking

6799
05:02:22,560 --> 05:02:25,440
forward to your questions hope you enjoy

6800
05:02:25,440 --> 05:02:26,580
the talk

6801
05:02:26,580 --> 05:02:30,340

[Applause]

6825
05:11:52,060 --> 05:13:18,939
[Music]

6826
05:13:22,300 --> 05:13:26,450
[Music]

6827
05:13:28,160 --> 05:13:31,160
so

6828
05:13:31,790 --> 05:13:52,080
[Music]

6829
05:13:52,080 --> 05:13:54,400
so it's time for the last talk of the

6830
05:13:54,400 --> 05:13:55,600
day

6831
05:13:55,600 --> 05:13:56,638
by

6832
05:13:56,638 --> 05:13:58,080
maya

6833
05:13:58,080 --> 05:13:59,840
i forgot how to ask you to pronounce

6834
05:13:59,840 --> 05:14:02,160
your name

6835
05:14:02,400 --> 05:14:05,440
and eric chang

6836
05:14:05,440 --> 05:14:07,120
so maya is a product manager at

6837
05:14:07,120 --> 05:14:08,878
tailscale providing

6838
05:14:08,878 --> 05:14:11,760
secure networking for the longtail she

6839
05:14:11,760 --> 05:14:14,160
was previously at github in software

6840
05:14:14,160 --> 05:14:16,718
supply chain security and before that at

6841
05:14:16,718 --> 05:14:18,718
google working on the container security

6842
05:14:18,718 --> 05:14:21,280
and encryption key management prior to

6843
05:14:21,280 --> 05:14:23,440
google maya worked at mckinsey and

6844
05:14:23,440 --> 05:14:27,920
studied mathematics at mcgill university

6845
05:14:28,718 --> 05:14:30,400
eric is an engineer at google's

6846
05:14:30,400 --> 05:14:32,080
enterprise infrastructure protection

6847
05:14:32,080 --> 05:14:34,798
team where he builds system to scale

6848
05:14:34,798 --> 05:14:36,878
internal security processes

6849
05:14:36,878 --> 05:14:38,798
he's previously worked on linux fleet

6850
05:14:38,798 --> 05:14:42,240
security at google upstream communities

6851
05:14:42,240 --> 05:14:44,080
kubernetes

6852
05:14:44,080 --> 05:14:48,600
and cloud authentication systems

6853
05:14:49,040 --> 05:14:50,638
amazing

6854
05:14:50,638 --> 05:14:52,718
so we're here to talk about is your

6855
05:14:52,718 --> 05:14:54,260
michael my mic is not

6856
05:14:54,260 --> 05:14:57,680
[Applause]

6857
05:14:57,680 --> 05:14:59,440
can you hear me we can great we're here

6858
05:14:59,440 --> 05:15:01,360
to talk about uh the road to beyond corp

6859
05:15:01,360 --> 05:15:04,160
and how to get to beyondcorp

6860
05:15:04,160 --> 05:15:07,120
um so as we just introduced i'm maya i

6861
05:15:07,120 --> 05:15:09,440
am a product manager at tailscale uh

6862
05:15:09,440 --> 05:15:12,240
tailskill is a wireguard-based meshvpn

6863
05:15:12,240 --> 05:15:14,160
and yes i do have stickers

6864
05:15:14,160 --> 05:15:17,520
lots of stickers lots of stickers yeah

6865
05:15:17,520 --> 05:15:18,798
uh and i'm

6866
05:15:18,798 --> 05:15:21,200
i'm eric i'm a security engineer on the

6867
05:15:21,200 --> 05:15:22,480
enterprise infrastructure protection

6868
05:15:22,480 --> 05:15:24,718
team at google we deal with google's

6869
05:15:24,718 --> 05:15:27,200
corporate security which

6870
05:15:27,200 --> 05:15:29,040
relatively relevant to what we're about

6871
05:15:29,040 --> 05:15:31,440
to talk about today yeah exactly um so

6872
05:15:31,440 --> 05:15:33,440
what are we going to talk about today

6873
05:15:33,440 --> 05:15:35,680
first we'll cover what we mean when we

6874
05:15:35,680 --> 05:15:38,480
say both the words beyond corp and xero

6875
05:15:38,480 --> 05:15:39,840
trust and why those are important and

6876
05:15:39,840 --> 05:15:41,600
particularly poignant right now

6877
05:15:41,600 --> 05:15:44,638
then we'll dig into what beyond corp is

6878
05:15:44,638 --> 05:15:46,878
to better understand its components and

6879
05:15:46,878 --> 05:15:48,560
how and what is needed for that to

6880
05:15:48,560 --> 05:15:50,400
function we'll talk about what companies

6881
05:15:50,400 --> 05:15:52,638
have typically done or tried to try to

6882
05:15:52,638 --> 05:15:54,080
do to adopt controls like beyond corp

6883
05:15:54,080 --> 05:15:56,080
and what steps you can take towards a

6884
05:15:56,080 --> 05:15:58,160
zero trust architecture and we'll wrap

6885
05:15:58,160 --> 05:15:59,760
up with going over the long tail of

6886
05:15:59,760 --> 05:16:01,680
problems we're going to hit by trying to

6887
05:16:01,680 --> 05:16:04,000
make something truly zero trust so to

6888
05:16:04,000 --> 05:16:04,958
jump in

6889
05:16:04,958 --> 05:16:07,440
um zero trust zero trust is a very

6890
05:16:07,440 --> 05:16:10,240
trendy phrase these days but in addition

6891
05:16:10,240 --> 05:16:12,240
to coming from you know lots of vendors

6892
05:16:12,240 --> 05:16:13,920
and analysts firms and yes conference

6893
05:16:13,920 --> 05:16:16,480
talks um it really does seem to like the

6894
05:16:16,480 --> 05:16:18,000
concept of zero trust has become

6895
05:16:18,000 --> 05:16:19,760
particularly trendy and mainstream like

6896
05:16:19,760 --> 05:16:20,958
very recently

6897
05:16:20,958 --> 05:16:22,560
and that's probably due to what just

6898
05:16:22,560 --> 05:16:24,718
happened south of the border uh in late

6899
05:16:24,718 --> 05:16:27,120
january 2022 the us government published

6900
05:16:27,120 --> 05:16:30,080
a memorandum on zero trust principles

6901
05:16:30,080 --> 05:16:31,760
and about moving the us government's

6902
05:16:31,760 --> 05:16:33,280
institutions and networks towards zero

6903
05:16:33,280 --> 05:16:34,638
trust

6904
05:16:34,638 --> 05:16:36,638
and this was kind of surprising like

6905
05:16:36,638 --> 05:16:38,080
although maybe not that surprising

6906
05:16:38,080 --> 05:16:40,798
because after this was after in may 2021

6907
05:16:40,798 --> 05:16:42,080
the us government also published the

6908
05:16:42,080 --> 05:16:43,480
executive order

6909
05:16:43,480 --> 05:16:46,000
14028 for improving the nation's cyber

6910
05:16:46,000 --> 05:16:48,560
security and this is a fall onto that so

6911
05:16:48,560 --> 05:16:50,638
as a result of this memorandum

6912
05:16:50,638 --> 05:16:53,520
by now u.s federal agencies have adopted

6913
05:16:53,520 --> 05:16:55,680
their zero trust plans

6914
05:16:55,680 --> 05:16:58,160
into their cyber plans and they have to

6915
05:16:58,160 --> 05:16:59,520
implement what they've decided they're

6916
05:16:59,520 --> 05:17:01,600
going to do by the end of 2024.

6917
05:17:01,600 --> 05:17:02,878
so i guess i guess this is just how we

6918
05:17:02,878 --> 05:17:05,120
do security trends now

6919
05:17:05,120 --> 05:17:07,360
so how are xerotrust and beyondcorp

6920
05:17:07,360 --> 05:17:08,560
related

6921
05:17:08,560 --> 05:17:10,560
let's start with traditional networks in

6922
05:17:10,560 --> 05:17:12,798
a traditional network um you're in the

6923
05:17:12,798 --> 05:17:14,480
traditional network architecture you you

6924
05:17:14,480 --> 05:17:16,240
rely on network perimeter to delineate

6925
05:17:16,240 --> 05:17:18,638
between trusted and untrusted users such

6926
05:17:18,638 --> 05:17:20,400
as trusted employees inside a firewall

6927
05:17:20,400 --> 05:17:22,320
versus potentially

6928
05:17:22,320 --> 05:17:23,840
untrusted employees outside for

6929
05:17:23,840 --> 05:17:25,600
untrusted actors outside of it

6930
05:17:25,600 --> 05:17:27,840
by moving to a zero trust architecture

6931
05:17:27,840 --> 05:17:29,680
the location of an individual

6932
05:17:29,680 --> 05:17:31,680
specifically what network they're on is

6933
05:17:31,680 --> 05:17:33,760
no longer solely what determines whether

6934
05:17:33,760 --> 05:17:35,760
that individual is trusted but other

6935
05:17:35,760 --> 05:17:37,520
context is used to determine whether or

6936
05:17:37,520 --> 05:17:39,440
not they can access a given application

6937
05:17:39,440 --> 05:17:40,798
so with the zero trust architecture

6938
05:17:40,798 --> 05:17:42,638
there's no longer such a thing as a

6939
05:17:42,638 --> 05:17:43,840
privileged

6940
05:17:43,840 --> 05:17:46,000
physical corporate network

6941
05:17:46,000 --> 05:17:47,600
one thing that zero trust doesn't mean

6942
05:17:47,600 --> 05:17:48,878
though and people get confused about

6943
05:17:48,878 --> 05:17:51,280
this is that vpns are bad um and i have

6944
05:17:51,280 --> 05:17:52,560
to say that despite you know the fact

6945
05:17:52,560 --> 05:17:54,878
that i that i work at a vpn company um

6946
05:17:54,878 --> 05:17:56,160
there's nothing inherently wrong with

6947
05:17:56,160 --> 05:17:58,560
vpn but there is something wrong with

6948
05:17:58,560 --> 05:17:59,920
assuming that because someone's on the

6949
05:17:59,920 --> 05:18:02,080
vpn they're trusted or you know that

6950
05:18:02,080 --> 05:18:03,200
they're on the corporate network they're

6951
05:18:03,200 --> 05:18:04,480
trusted

6952
05:18:04,480 --> 05:18:06,638
so if it's more like you know vpns that

6953
05:18:06,638 --> 05:18:08,718
have no application level you know

6954
05:18:08,718 --> 05:18:11,200
access controls are bad sure

6955
05:18:11,200 --> 05:18:12,638
beyond corp

6956
05:18:12,638 --> 05:18:14,320
introduced in a paper in 2014 is

6957
05:18:14,320 --> 05:18:16,718
google's specific implementation

6958
05:18:16,718 --> 05:18:18,240
from which the broader zero trust

6959
05:18:18,240 --> 05:18:19,840
principles emerge and zero trust

6960
05:18:19,840 --> 05:18:22,320
architecture emerges yeah

6961
05:18:22,320 --> 05:18:24,560
and so beyond corp is fundamentally an

6962
05:18:24,560 --> 05:18:26,638
access question um this could be an

6963
05:18:26,638 --> 05:18:29,040
access to something like your internal

6964
05:18:29,040 --> 05:18:30,718
corporate wiki

6965
05:18:30,718 --> 05:18:33,520
and the way it determines if you the

6966
05:18:33,520 --> 05:18:35,920
user making that request have access is

6967
05:18:35,920 --> 05:18:38,480
it considers two primary principles one

6968
05:18:38,480 --> 05:18:40,638
is pretty classic right it's who you are

6969
05:18:40,638 --> 05:18:42,080
you know what are your credentials can

6970
05:18:42,080 --> 05:18:44,320
you can you get into this wiki and then

6971
05:18:44,320 --> 05:18:47,200
more novelly it also considers what

6972
05:18:47,200 --> 05:18:49,520
device you're coming from so a really

6973
05:18:49,520 --> 05:18:52,000
good example might be a personal versus

6974
05:18:52,000 --> 05:18:54,080
a corporate device right you might be

6975
05:18:54,080 --> 05:18:56,000
able to have your credentials on your

6976
05:18:56,000 --> 05:18:58,320
personal device but that doesn't mean we

6977
05:18:58,320 --> 05:19:00,400
necessarily still want you to be able to

6978
05:19:00,400 --> 05:19:02,160
access the corporate wiki from that

6979
05:19:02,160 --> 05:19:03,280
device

6980
05:19:03,280 --> 05:19:05,040
a really important thing that's just not

6981
05:19:05,040 --> 05:19:06,718
even in this slide is any discussion of

6982
05:19:06,718 --> 05:19:08,240
networking you know you were talking

6983
05:19:08,240 --> 05:19:10,320
about vpns a little bit before and

6984
05:19:10,320 --> 05:19:11,760
that's kind of dominated the

6985
05:19:11,760 --> 05:19:14,160
conversation and i think that networking

6986
05:19:14,160 --> 05:19:16,560
is interesting and your network topology

6987
05:19:16,560 --> 05:19:18,638
kind of falls out of trying to get these

6988
05:19:18,638 --> 05:19:20,798
core things but ultimately what we're

6989
05:19:20,798 --> 05:19:22,560
going to be talking about today is

6990
05:19:22,560 --> 05:19:24,400
access to users and devices and trying

6991
05:19:24,400 --> 05:19:27,120
to harden those as much as possible

6992
05:19:27,120 --> 05:19:29,680
so first you know i said this before

6993
05:19:29,680 --> 05:19:31,360
users we're all kind of familiar with

6994
05:19:31,360 --> 05:19:33,440
that right you are the user you've done

6995
05:19:33,440 --> 05:19:35,440
an oauth dance you have some credentials

6996
05:19:35,440 --> 05:19:37,200
and so on and so forth so it's pretty

6997
05:19:37,200 --> 05:19:39,120
much what you'd expect out of any

6998
05:19:39,120 --> 05:19:41,920
normal application level access question

6999
05:19:41,920 --> 05:19:43,920
um a thing a few things we will be

7000
05:19:43,920 --> 05:19:45,600
talking about today is how to harden

7001
05:19:45,600 --> 05:19:48,240
that so you know how do we actually get

7002
05:19:48,240 --> 05:19:51,680
strong user first identity and then what

7003
05:19:51,680 --> 05:19:53,200
are the properties of a strong

7004
05:19:53,200 --> 05:19:54,798
credential because this is fundamental

7005
05:19:54,798 --> 05:19:56,400
to the access question

7006
05:19:56,400 --> 05:19:58,718
having a strong credential results in

7007
05:19:58,718 --> 05:20:02,480
stronger access or access decisions

7008
05:20:02,480 --> 05:20:04,320
um and then the next one is we're going

7009
05:20:04,320 --> 05:20:06,320
to talk about devices so

7010
05:20:06,320 --> 05:20:08,560
um we've discussed stuff like you know

7011
05:20:08,560 --> 05:20:10,000
is this a personal but it's a corporate

7012
05:20:10,000 --> 05:20:12,160
device but once you start thinking in

7013
05:20:12,160 --> 05:20:14,240
that direction there's a whole kind of

7014
05:20:14,240 --> 05:20:16,240
different set of questions that you

7015
05:20:16,240 --> 05:20:18,718
might be interested in asking right what

7016
05:20:18,718 --> 05:20:20,718
is the patch level of that device is a

7017
05:20:20,718 --> 05:20:22,080
really good example

7018
05:20:22,080 --> 05:20:23,840
and then how do you store this

7019
05:20:23,840 --> 05:20:25,520
information what kind of inventory do

7020
05:20:25,520 --> 05:20:27,520
you have and then once you have all of

7021
05:20:27,520 --> 05:20:28,558
this

7022
05:20:28,558 --> 05:20:30,638
how do we again in the same way that

7023
05:20:30,638 --> 05:20:31,600
we're going to think about user's

7024
05:20:31,600 --> 05:20:34,160
credentials how do we think about device

7025
05:20:34,160 --> 05:20:36,240
credentials how do we harden the

7026
05:20:36,240 --> 05:20:37,840
identity of those device credentials and

7027
05:20:37,840 --> 05:20:39,360
the storage of them and so on and so

7028
05:20:39,360 --> 05:20:40,878
forth

7029
05:20:40,878 --> 05:20:43,600
and then finally access is the the

7030
05:20:43,600 --> 05:20:46,798
terrible nitty-gritty of given these two

7031
05:20:46,798 --> 05:20:48,558
pairs of credentials how do we actually

7032
05:20:48,558 --> 05:20:50,718
make an access decision this looks

7033
05:20:50,718 --> 05:20:52,160
totally different depending on what

7034
05:20:52,160 --> 05:20:54,718
protocol you're actually using so as an

7035
05:20:54,718 --> 05:20:56,400
example if you're going to go visit the

7036
05:20:56,400 --> 05:20:58,080
corporate wiki that's going to look like

7037
05:20:58,080 --> 05:21:00,000
a very different access decision from a

7038
05:21:00,000 --> 05:21:01,680
technical perspective of if you're going

7039
05:21:01,680 --> 05:21:04,160
to ssh to a prod box but we actually

7040
05:21:04,160 --> 05:21:06,638
really do still care about that

7041
05:21:06,638 --> 05:21:08,558
combination no matter what protocol

7042
05:21:08,558 --> 05:21:11,120
you're using and then again

7043
05:21:11,120 --> 05:21:13,440
because we now magically

7044
05:21:13,440 --> 05:21:15,680
have all of this device information what

7045
05:21:15,680 --> 05:21:18,480
kind of device information can we use to

7046
05:21:18,480 --> 05:21:21,840
make an access decision

7047
05:21:22,160 --> 05:21:24,400
so if you're trying to get to beyond

7048
05:21:24,400 --> 05:21:26,958
corp or zero trust architecture how can

7049
05:21:26,958 --> 05:21:28,400
you actually go about doing it and how

7050
05:21:28,400 --> 05:21:30,160
do you know how far along you are

7051
05:21:30,160 --> 05:21:31,680
so eric and i have put together a

7052
05:21:31,680 --> 05:21:33,440
roadmap or a maturity model or whatever

7053
05:21:33,440 --> 05:21:35,120
you want to call it for how you get to

7054
05:21:35,120 --> 05:21:37,360
zero trust as you go higher from left to

7055
05:21:37,360 --> 05:21:38,240
right

7056
05:21:38,240 --> 05:21:40,000
your organization has more capabilities

7057
05:21:40,000 --> 05:21:42,320
in terms of how it secures its users

7058
05:21:42,320 --> 05:21:44,878
devices and access to applications on

7059
05:21:44,878 --> 05:21:46,080
the network

7060
05:21:46,080 --> 05:21:47,440
basically the more that you harden the

7061
05:21:47,440 --> 05:21:49,440
more you're doing zero trust

7062
05:21:49,440 --> 05:21:51,120
so your first step on the road to be on

7063
05:21:51,120 --> 05:21:53,040
corpus level one is having an inventory

7064
05:21:53,040 --> 05:21:55,360
of your users and your devices

7065
05:21:55,360 --> 05:21:57,200
at level two you have a way to measure

7066
05:21:57,200 --> 05:21:58,558
most of your security controls and

7067
05:21:58,558 --> 05:22:00,080
enforce some of them

7068
05:22:00,080 --> 05:22:01,520
you're able to segment access to

7069
05:22:01,520 --> 05:22:03,280
specific applications

7070
05:22:03,280 --> 05:22:05,200
at level three we have what's typically

7071
05:22:05,200 --> 05:22:07,600
called zero trust in the market today

7072
05:22:07,600 --> 05:22:10,240
it's tiering users and devices based on

7073
05:22:10,240 --> 05:22:12,558
measurements and enforcing access based

7074
05:22:12,558 --> 05:22:14,638
on these measurements so like eric said

7075
05:22:14,638 --> 05:22:16,080
a device that's patched might be treated

7076
05:22:16,080 --> 05:22:17,360
differently from a device that's not

7077
05:22:17,360 --> 05:22:18,400
patched

7078
05:22:18,400 --> 05:22:20,080
and lastly level four is what people

7079
05:22:20,080 --> 05:22:21,840
think they're being sold

7080
05:22:21,840 --> 05:22:23,360
it's being able to have dynamically

7081
05:22:23,360 --> 05:22:25,040
changing risk-based access to

7082
05:22:25,040 --> 05:22:27,440
applications this is incredibly hard and

7083
05:22:27,440 --> 05:22:29,040
something that's not really available in

7084
05:22:29,040 --> 05:22:30,240
the market today because there are a lot

7085
05:22:30,240 --> 05:22:31,520
of edge cases

7086
05:22:31,520 --> 05:22:32,798
it's what we should be aspiring to as an

7087
05:22:32,798 --> 05:22:34,320
industry but we're all still working on

7088
05:22:34,320 --> 05:22:35,920
the details so we're going to go through

7089
05:22:35,920 --> 05:22:38,400
each of these level by level

7090
05:22:38,400 --> 05:22:39,920
so level one as i mentioned it's about

7091
05:22:39,920 --> 05:22:41,360
having an inventory of your users and

7092
05:22:41,360 --> 05:22:42,480
devices

7093
05:22:42,480 --> 05:22:44,400
to inventory users who are accessing

7094
05:22:44,400 --> 05:22:45,760
applications in your environment the

7095
05:22:45,760 --> 05:22:48,000
easiest thing to do is to use a single

7096
05:22:48,000 --> 05:22:50,400
sign-on identity provider sso it's also

7097
05:22:50,400 --> 05:22:52,240
a great simple security improvement for

7098
05:22:52,240 --> 05:22:53,600
your organization

7099
05:22:53,600 --> 05:22:55,200
this is typically tied to your hr

7100
05:22:55,200 --> 05:22:56,638
information system so when a new

7101
05:22:56,638 --> 05:22:59,200
employee joins changes teams or leaves

7102
05:22:59,200 --> 05:23:00,958
then their identity and so their access

7103
05:23:00,958 --> 05:23:02,480
to business applications can easily be

7104
05:23:02,480 --> 05:23:03,600
updated

7105
05:23:03,600 --> 05:23:05,440
even if you have an sso you might not be

7106
05:23:05,440 --> 05:23:07,680
using it consistently unfortunately a

7107
05:23:07,680 --> 05:23:10,000
lot of sas tools charge you extra for

7108
05:23:10,000 --> 05:23:11,280
the ability to use sso with their

7109
05:23:11,280 --> 05:23:14,080
application known as the sso tax

7110
05:23:14,080 --> 05:23:15,520
or sometimes charge you extra just for

7111
05:23:15,520 --> 05:23:17,840
the ability to enforce sso for their

7112
05:23:17,840 --> 05:23:19,280
application

7113
05:23:19,280 --> 05:23:21,600
and so for applications where you're not

7114
05:23:21,600 --> 05:23:23,920
using sso you should ask employees to

7115
05:23:23,920 --> 05:23:25,360
say use a password manager but that's

7116
05:23:25,360 --> 05:23:27,520
also not something that you can enforce

7117
05:23:27,520 --> 05:23:29,200
at this level you probably also treat

7118
05:23:29,200 --> 05:23:32,160
employees and contractors identities the

7119
05:23:32,160 --> 05:23:33,520
same way although you might not give

7120
05:23:33,520 --> 05:23:35,040
contractors access to all of the same

7121
05:23:35,040 --> 05:23:37,040
applications

7122
05:23:37,040 --> 05:23:38,798
in terms of devices at level one you

7123
05:23:38,798 --> 05:23:40,958
have a device inventory and some way to

7124
05:23:40,958 --> 05:23:42,400
manage devices

7125
05:23:42,400 --> 05:23:43,920
this can actually be pretty complicated

7126
05:23:43,920 --> 05:23:45,760
depending on if you have a you know a

7127
05:23:45,760 --> 05:23:47,680
mix of both company and employee owned

7128
05:23:47,680 --> 05:23:49,680
or byod devices

7129
05:23:49,680 --> 05:23:51,440
you probably have a wide mix of

7130
05:23:51,440 --> 05:23:53,280
operating systems especially if you

7131
05:23:53,280 --> 05:23:55,520
support byod devices i think one of my

7132
05:23:55,520 --> 05:23:58,320
colleagues runs his own os

7133
05:23:58,320 --> 05:24:00,878
you might also support mobile devices so

7134
05:24:00,878 --> 05:24:02,080
that makes your makes your life a little

7135
05:24:02,080 --> 05:24:03,200
bit harder

7136
05:24:03,200 --> 05:24:04,638
so although your corporate policy might

7137
05:24:04,638 --> 05:24:06,480
be to give employees you know company

7138
05:24:06,480 --> 05:24:07,760
owned macbooks

7139
05:24:07,760 --> 05:24:09,440
if you if you let them byod their own

7140
05:24:09,440 --> 05:24:10,798
mobile devices you've already added a

7141
05:24:10,798 --> 05:24:12,240
ton of complexity to what you need to

7142
05:24:12,240 --> 05:24:13,520
manage

7143
05:24:13,520 --> 05:24:14,958
in terms of keeping track of

7144
05:24:14,958 --> 05:24:17,360
company-owned devices you ideally have a

7145
05:24:17,360 --> 05:24:19,840
device inventory of who you've bought

7146
05:24:19,840 --> 05:24:21,760
what device for um though this is not

7147
05:24:21,760 --> 05:24:23,200
necessarily more complex than a

7148
05:24:23,200 --> 05:24:24,240
spreadsheet

7149
05:24:24,240 --> 05:24:25,840
and before you let a user connect to a

7150
05:24:25,840 --> 05:24:28,080
network then you might have some manual

7151
05:24:28,080 --> 05:24:29,520
verification that that's actually the

7152
05:24:29,520 --> 05:24:31,920
expected device

7153
05:24:31,920 --> 05:24:34,000
and then at level one in terms of access

7154
05:24:34,000 --> 05:24:35,840
it's that flat sort of traditional

7155
05:24:35,840 --> 05:24:37,200
network where if you're on the network

7156
05:24:37,200 --> 05:24:39,920
you're trusted like a traditional vpn

7157
05:24:39,920 --> 05:24:41,840
you know and ideally can control what

7158
05:24:41,840 --> 05:24:43,840
users and devices are on the network

7159
05:24:43,840 --> 05:24:45,920
given that you have these inventories

7160
05:24:45,920 --> 05:24:47,840
even if it's manual but you're not

7161
05:24:47,840 --> 05:24:50,878
segmenting users or devices any further

7162
05:24:50,878 --> 05:24:52,080
if you're only dealing with corporate

7163
05:24:52,080 --> 05:24:53,760
devices and only self-hosted

7164
05:24:53,760 --> 05:24:56,240
applications then this like having a vpn

7165
05:24:56,240 --> 05:24:58,160
plus an sso is a pretty good initial set

7166
05:24:58,160 --> 05:25:00,160
of tools to limit access to your

7167
05:25:00,160 --> 05:25:03,040
internal applications

7168
05:25:03,200 --> 05:25:04,718
and now we're going to start talking

7169
05:25:04,718 --> 05:25:06,798
about not just knowing and enumerating

7170
05:25:06,798 --> 05:25:08,878
but actually measuring and starting to

7171
05:25:08,878 --> 05:25:11,040
ask questions from i don't want to say

7172
05:25:11,040 --> 05:25:12,798
our users but you know our devices at

7173
05:25:12,798 --> 05:25:14,798
the very least

7174
05:25:14,798 --> 05:25:16,558
so uh this is the slide where i just

7175
05:25:16,558 --> 05:25:18,958
tell you to use security keys um there

7176
05:25:18,958 --> 05:25:21,360
was a conversation this morning

7177
05:25:21,360 --> 05:25:23,440
and wave uh this is a conversation this

7178
05:25:23,440 --> 05:25:26,160
morning about passwords and all of the

7179
05:25:26,160 --> 05:25:27,840
you know terribleness and i think the

7180
05:25:27,840 --> 05:25:29,520
password list phrase got thrown out or

7181
05:25:29,520 --> 05:25:31,520
something like that

7182
05:25:31,520 --> 05:25:34,320
security keys are effectively unfishable

7183
05:25:34,320 --> 05:25:36,638
from a browser context right you can go

7184
05:25:36,638 --> 05:25:38,400
in the technical details of like

7185
05:25:38,400 --> 05:25:41,520
everything but in terms of producing a

7186
05:25:41,520 --> 05:25:43,040
good

7187
05:25:43,040 --> 05:25:45,280
security control that ensures that the

7188
05:25:45,280 --> 05:25:47,520
initial authentication of your users is

7189
05:25:47,520 --> 05:25:49,840
strong there is nothing that compares to

7190
05:25:49,840 --> 05:25:52,480
just using web authent based solutions

7191
05:25:52,480 --> 05:25:54,400
so please i think that's the whole slide

7192
05:25:54,400 --> 05:25:56,638
right just use your keys oh wait no oh

7193
05:25:56,638 --> 05:25:58,958
yeah and so then we also have things

7194
05:25:58,958 --> 05:26:01,600
like user properties right so

7195
05:26:01,600 --> 05:26:03,360
this is more classic right you want some

7196
05:26:03,360 --> 05:26:04,480
sort of

7197
05:26:04,480 --> 05:26:06,400
grouping system like active directory

7198
05:26:06,400 --> 05:26:08,480
you want a way to say

7199
05:26:08,480 --> 05:26:10,000
the property is a particular user are

7200
05:26:10,000 --> 05:26:12,000
they you know an engineer are they an

7201
05:26:12,000 --> 05:26:14,080
sre so on and so forth because we're

7202
05:26:14,080 --> 05:26:15,440
going to want to use that access

7203
05:26:15,440 --> 05:26:17,200
information or for access decisions

7204
05:26:17,200 --> 05:26:19,520
later

7205
05:26:19,680 --> 05:26:22,480
and then at level two for devices we're

7206
05:26:22,480 --> 05:26:24,240
going to start thinking about management

7207
05:26:24,240 --> 05:26:27,120
of devices now you can initially start

7208
05:26:27,120 --> 05:26:29,280
talking about things like mdms mdm

7209
05:26:29,280 --> 05:26:32,080
solutions for mobile devices um but it

7210
05:26:32,080 --> 05:26:33,520
doesn't actually need to be that

7211
05:26:33,520 --> 05:26:35,920
complicated i know plenty of people in

7212
05:26:35,920 --> 05:26:37,600
plain organizations where it's like yeah

7213
05:26:37,600 --> 05:26:39,200
we just have a script that we run and it

7214
05:26:39,200 --> 05:26:41,760
checks in occasionally or maybe they use

7215
05:26:41,760 --> 05:26:43,840
something like puppet

7216
05:26:43,840 --> 05:26:46,718
the ability to just say ask your device

7217
05:26:46,718 --> 05:26:50,000
what its patch level is or say later on

7218
05:26:50,000 --> 05:26:53,600
you might want to force it to update

7219
05:26:53,600 --> 05:26:56,480
having those basic capabilities

7220
05:26:56,480 --> 05:26:58,400
is fundamental because if you don't you

7221
05:26:58,400 --> 05:27:00,558
just can't advance past this particular

7222
05:27:00,558 --> 05:27:01,440
point

7223
05:27:01,440 --> 05:27:02,798
and then yeah

7224
05:27:02,798 --> 05:27:04,878
there's someone else on our panel today

7225
05:27:04,878 --> 05:27:05,680
who

7226
05:27:05,680 --> 05:27:06,798
is going to

7227
05:27:06,798 --> 05:27:08,878
i think of a os query

7228
05:27:08,878 --> 05:27:10,400
sort of training

7229
05:27:10,400 --> 05:27:12,718
os query is a great example of a tool

7230
05:27:12,718 --> 05:27:14,718
that is open source that you can use

7231
05:27:14,718 --> 05:27:16,160
that you can install an agent on your

7232
05:27:16,160 --> 05:27:17,680
devices and then you can start asking

7233
05:27:17,680 --> 05:27:19,360
questions of your devices

7234
05:27:19,360 --> 05:27:20,958
you also want to start thinking about

7235
05:27:20,958 --> 05:27:24,240
less of like here's this key that i you

7236
05:27:24,240 --> 05:27:25,840
know gave you that may be shared between

7237
05:27:25,840 --> 05:27:26,878
a bunch of things that lets you on the

7238
05:27:26,878 --> 05:27:28,798
vpn and start thinking about per device

7239
05:27:28,798 --> 05:27:29,840
credentials that you can actually

7240
05:27:29,840 --> 05:27:31,600
associate with the device

7241
05:27:31,600 --> 05:27:33,440
um this is also where the spreadsheet

7242
05:27:33,440 --> 05:27:35,760
isn't going to cut it right like you do

7243
05:27:35,760 --> 05:27:37,680
need at this point to not think of your

7244
05:27:37,680 --> 05:27:39,680
inventory as something you only update

7245
05:27:39,680 --> 05:27:41,440
when you onboard or off-board a device

7246
05:27:41,440 --> 05:27:42,958
but as something that is continuously

7247
05:27:42,958 --> 05:27:44,558
living because you're going to be

7248
05:27:44,558 --> 05:27:46,958
profiling and gathering information from

7249
05:27:46,958 --> 05:27:49,760
all of your devices

7250
05:27:50,558 --> 05:27:53,120
and then uh level two is of access

7251
05:27:53,120 --> 05:27:54,240
management

7252
05:27:54,240 --> 05:27:55,760
is now we have to start thinking about

7253
05:27:55,760 --> 05:27:58,080
not just having one single policy for

7254
05:27:58,080 --> 05:27:59,760
all of our applications but we might

7255
05:27:59,760 --> 05:28:02,000
want to start doing this at a per

7256
05:28:02,000 --> 05:28:03,840
application level and there are plenty

7257
05:28:03,840 --> 05:28:06,240
of open source sort of solutions that do

7258
05:28:06,240 --> 05:28:07,760
something like this

7259
05:28:07,760 --> 05:28:10,160
you know some nginx plug-ins go quite a

7260
05:28:10,160 --> 05:28:11,360
long way there's also things like the

7261
05:28:11,360 --> 05:28:13,600
oauth proxy but

7262
05:28:13,600 --> 05:28:14,718
the

7263
05:28:14,718 --> 05:28:17,200
level 7 http proxy is a really good way

7264
05:28:17,200 --> 05:28:18,878
of achieving this because you can't

7265
05:28:18,878 --> 05:28:20,160
always make the assumption that all your

7266
05:28:20,160 --> 05:28:21,680
apps are going to perfectly understand

7267
05:28:21,680 --> 05:28:23,600
you know your format for your user's

7268
05:28:23,600 --> 05:28:25,600
credentials or your format for your

7269
05:28:25,600 --> 05:28:27,840
device credentials um and then you also

7270
05:28:27,840 --> 05:28:28,878
have to start thinking about what are

7271
05:28:28,878 --> 05:28:30,638
your strategies for non-browser traffic

7272
05:28:30,638 --> 05:28:32,718
so this again might be ssh or command

7273
05:28:32,718 --> 05:28:35,600
line tools while we generally think of

7274
05:28:35,600 --> 05:28:38,160
beyond corp as a solution for like your

7275
05:28:38,160 --> 05:28:40,000
browser-based traffic

7276
05:28:40,000 --> 05:28:40,878
the

7277
05:28:40,878 --> 05:28:42,958
being able to ssh to a broadbox is also

7278
05:28:42,958 --> 05:28:44,320
something you definitely want to have a

7279
05:28:44,320 --> 05:28:46,400
strong authorization decision for and

7280
05:28:46,400 --> 05:28:48,480
you can't just ignore these sort of

7281
05:28:48,480 --> 05:28:50,240
access requests because they're not you

7282
05:28:50,240 --> 05:28:52,638
know your classic http browser traffic

7283
05:28:52,638 --> 05:28:54,240
and then this is where we also are going

7284
05:28:54,240 --> 05:28:57,200
to start consuming device credentials so

7285
05:28:57,200 --> 05:28:59,120
mtls is a really good place to start

7286
05:28:59,120 --> 05:29:01,200
here right give your devices a client

7287
05:29:01,200 --> 05:29:02,878
certificate you can

7288
05:29:02,878 --> 05:29:04,080
there are a lot of solutions for like

7289
05:29:04,080 --> 05:29:05,680
android phones or that kind of thing

7290
05:29:05,680 --> 05:29:07,120
that will allow you to

7291
05:29:07,120 --> 05:29:09,600
through a enterprise enrollment install

7292
05:29:09,600 --> 05:29:10,878
client certificates that you use for

7293
05:29:10,878 --> 05:29:13,520
your corporation

7294
05:29:13,840 --> 05:29:15,360
and now we're going to finally get to

7295
05:29:15,360 --> 05:29:17,280
level three which is sort of where we

7296
05:29:17,280 --> 05:29:22,239
see as like zero trust today or whatever

7297
05:29:22,320 --> 05:29:23,120
um

7298
05:29:23,120 --> 05:29:23,840
so

7299
05:29:23,840 --> 05:29:26,558
a very very common pattern

7300
05:29:26,558 --> 05:29:27,360
is

7301
05:29:27,360 --> 05:29:29,840
you have a user and they have a security

7302
05:29:29,840 --> 05:29:31,600
key and they have a really strong

7303
05:29:31,600 --> 05:29:33,920
initial authentication and then they

7304
05:29:33,920 --> 05:29:36,080
exchanged it for some

7305
05:29:36,080 --> 05:29:39,040
token that is valid till the end of time

7306
05:29:39,040 --> 05:29:40,878
that just goes on disk or gets thrown at

7307
05:29:40,878 --> 05:29:43,760
some third-party service right so imap

7308
05:29:43,760 --> 05:29:45,680
is a great example right you have this

7309
05:29:45,680 --> 05:29:47,440
strong initial authentication and then

7310
05:29:47,440 --> 05:29:48,958
this device just have a

7311
05:29:48,958 --> 05:29:50,638
credential that can read the email

7312
05:29:50,638 --> 05:29:52,638
forever so

7313
05:29:52,638 --> 05:29:55,120
the the really important part of user

7314
05:29:55,120 --> 05:29:56,558
authentication is not just to think

7315
05:29:56,558 --> 05:29:58,320
about the initial authentication but

7316
05:29:58,320 --> 05:29:59,680
thinking about

7317
05:29:59,680 --> 05:30:01,920
what are all of the other credentials

7318
05:30:01,920 --> 05:30:03,840
that a user might have right your ssh

7319
05:30:03,840 --> 05:30:06,958
keys your access tokens so on and so

7320
05:30:06,958 --> 05:30:08,958
forth and thinking about time bounding

7321
05:30:08,958 --> 05:30:10,958
those right if you have some initial

7322
05:30:10,958 --> 05:30:12,400
login and you give somebody a cookie

7323
05:30:12,400 --> 05:30:14,638
that lasts for 24 hours that's great but

7324
05:30:14,638 --> 05:30:16,718
what other credentials have they also

7325
05:30:16,718 --> 05:30:19,680
been able to grab from your institution

7326
05:30:19,680 --> 05:30:21,600
api access keys another great example

7327
05:30:21,600 --> 05:30:24,000
where these things just live forever

7328
05:30:24,000 --> 05:30:25,280
what we found

7329
05:30:25,280 --> 05:30:27,200
very useful

7330
05:30:27,200 --> 05:30:29,920
is to take weak credentials maybe

7331
05:30:29,920 --> 05:30:31,360
bearer tokens are problematic because

7332
05:30:31,360 --> 05:30:32,958
you can't really hide the secret key

7333
05:30:32,958 --> 05:30:34,480
right there's no secret key you throw it

7334
05:30:34,480 --> 05:30:36,798
at someone you check it into github and

7335
05:30:36,798 --> 05:30:39,200
it you know gets on the open internet we

7336
05:30:39,200 --> 05:30:40,718
found very useful is to take weak

7337
05:30:40,718 --> 05:30:42,638
credentials and bind them to strong ones

7338
05:30:42,638 --> 05:30:44,240
so for example if you have a device

7339
05:30:44,240 --> 05:30:46,400
credential you might when you issue

7340
05:30:46,400 --> 05:30:48,240
someone an api token

7341
05:30:48,240 --> 05:30:49,760
put the hash of that device credential

7342
05:30:49,760 --> 05:30:51,360
in that api token and now when you're

7343
05:30:51,360 --> 05:30:53,360
making access decisions you can sort of

7344
05:30:53,360 --> 05:30:54,718
force a binding between a weak

7345
05:30:54,718 --> 05:30:56,718
credential and a strong one

7346
05:30:56,718 --> 05:30:58,480
and speaking of strong device

7347
05:30:58,480 --> 05:31:00,240
credentials

7348
05:31:00,240 --> 05:31:01,520
first off we're going to talk about

7349
05:31:01,520 --> 05:31:03,440
active management so this is where

7350
05:31:03,440 --> 05:31:04,958
beyond just measuring we actually want

7351
05:31:04,958 --> 05:31:07,200
to start enforcing things so forced

7352
05:31:07,200 --> 05:31:09,760
patching great example uh force reboots

7353
05:31:09,760 --> 05:31:11,920
are another great example where you

7354
05:31:11,920 --> 05:31:14,160
might patch but until you reboot there's

7355
05:31:14,160 --> 05:31:15,440
nothing that's

7356
05:31:15,440 --> 05:31:16,718
available

7357
05:31:16,718 --> 05:31:17,920
this is also where you can start

7358
05:31:17,920 --> 05:31:19,120
thinking about what are the other

7359
05:31:19,120 --> 05:31:21,040
security specific configuration on your

7360
05:31:21,040 --> 05:31:22,638
devices right and

7361
05:31:22,638 --> 05:31:24,558
do you want to force these clients to do

7362
05:31:24,558 --> 05:31:26,958
this uh device based firewalls another

7363
05:31:26,958 --> 05:31:28,958
great example

7364
05:31:28,958 --> 05:31:31,280
this is also where we can start thinking

7365
05:31:31,280 --> 05:31:32,080
more

7366
05:31:32,080 --> 05:31:34,000
ambitiously about how we are

7367
05:31:34,000 --> 05:31:36,718
provisioning credentials to devices so

7368
05:31:36,718 --> 05:31:39,280
basically all modern devices right my

7369
05:31:39,280 --> 05:31:42,080
laptop my phone so on and so forth has

7370
05:31:42,080 --> 05:31:44,718
some sort of hardware identity that you

7371
05:31:44,718 --> 05:31:46,320
know magic pixie box

7372
05:31:46,320 --> 05:31:47,280
magic

7373
05:31:47,280 --> 05:31:48,558
pixie dust

7374
05:31:48,558 --> 05:31:51,840
doesn't change um so this device has a

7375
05:31:51,840 --> 05:31:54,878
tpm in it my phone has a strong bot is

7376
05:31:54,878 --> 05:31:57,680
an android phone so it has a strong box

7377
05:31:57,680 --> 05:32:00,718
as a device a hardware based identity

7378
05:32:00,718 --> 05:32:02,400
for the device uh iphones have the

7379
05:32:02,400 --> 05:32:04,798
secure enclave these are great because

7380
05:32:04,798 --> 05:32:06,798
you can generally challenge them for the

7381
05:32:06,798 --> 05:32:10,000
identity and then issue

7382
05:32:10,000 --> 05:32:11,760
corporate credentials based off of them

7383
05:32:11,760 --> 05:32:12,798
and that's great because you're no

7384
05:32:12,798 --> 05:32:14,400
longer like physically and manually

7385
05:32:14,400 --> 05:32:15,760
going and doing this but you might

7386
05:32:15,760 --> 05:32:16,878
actually be able to automate some of

7387
05:32:16,878 --> 05:32:17,680
this

7388
05:32:17,680 --> 05:32:19,360
also all of these hardware-based

7389
05:32:19,360 --> 05:32:21,120
identity mechanisms generally have the

7390
05:32:21,120 --> 05:32:23,600
ability to store private keys so now

7391
05:32:23,600 --> 05:32:25,280
you're taking your mtls certificate that

7392
05:32:25,280 --> 05:32:26,480
just had a

7393
05:32:26,480 --> 05:32:28,878
private key that was on disk and you are

7394
05:32:28,878 --> 05:32:31,680
able to back it by one of these

7395
05:32:31,680 --> 05:32:33,440
hardware-based solutions and now you

7396
05:32:33,440 --> 05:32:35,920
have real strong confidence about when

7397
05:32:35,920 --> 05:32:38,480
that device comes in to my network that

7398
05:32:38,480 --> 05:32:40,798
it is that device and the request is

7399
05:32:40,798 --> 05:32:43,600
coming from that device

7400
05:32:43,600 --> 05:32:44,718
and finally

7401
05:32:44,718 --> 05:32:46,400
we're going to talk about access

7402
05:32:46,400 --> 05:32:48,558
and there's a general term that google

7403
05:32:48,558 --> 05:32:50,240
has published called tiered access and

7404
05:32:50,240 --> 05:32:52,320
the the sort of summary i want to give

7405
05:32:52,320 --> 05:32:54,400
is this we've talked about personal book

7406
05:32:54,400 --> 05:32:55,760
versus corporate

7407
05:32:55,760 --> 05:32:57,600
but anything beyond that we're not going

7408
05:32:57,600 --> 05:32:59,600
to start talking about device tiers

7409
05:32:59,600 --> 05:33:01,920
right a personal device is interesting

7410
05:33:01,920 --> 05:33:03,760
in a corporate device but what about the

7411
05:33:03,760 --> 05:33:05,680
patch level of that corporate device

7412
05:33:05,680 --> 05:33:07,840
what about other security relevant

7413
05:33:07,840 --> 05:33:09,680
configuration if it hasn't you know

7414
05:33:09,680 --> 05:33:11,840
taken up these particular things we've

7415
05:33:11,840 --> 05:33:14,000
prescribed to it do we want to continue

7416
05:33:14,000 --> 05:33:16,320
to allow it access so

7417
05:33:16,320 --> 05:33:17,600
when we talk about tiered access we

7418
05:33:17,600 --> 05:33:19,280
generally talk about devices losing

7419
05:33:19,280 --> 05:33:21,040
trust so this is a device that is a

7420
05:33:21,040 --> 05:33:23,120
corporate device that should have access

7421
05:33:23,120 --> 05:33:24,958
but doesn't because it hasn't done

7422
05:33:24,958 --> 05:33:27,040
something we want of it for example it

7423
05:33:27,040 --> 05:33:29,840
hasn't patched recently and critically

7424
05:33:29,840 --> 05:33:32,240
the most important tier is the tier that

7425
05:33:32,240 --> 05:33:34,400
your devices get placed in when they

7426
05:33:34,400 --> 05:33:36,320
lose access because if they just

7427
05:33:36,320 --> 05:33:38,080
suddenly lose access

7428
05:33:38,080 --> 05:33:39,520
um

7429
05:33:39,520 --> 05:33:41,920
and your user has no way of actually

7430
05:33:41,920 --> 05:33:43,920
regaining that back that's an extremely

7431
05:33:43,920 --> 05:33:45,440
bad user experience and you're going to

7432
05:33:45,440 --> 05:33:47,840
get some angry messages

7433
05:33:47,840 --> 05:33:49,440
so level four so what we're gonna

7434
05:33:49,440 --> 05:33:51,120
describe at level four is what people

7435
05:33:51,120 --> 05:33:52,480
think they're getting right so they

7436
05:33:52,480 --> 05:33:53,680
think that something that implementing a

7437
05:33:53,680 --> 05:33:55,360
zero trust architecture means that you

7438
05:33:55,360 --> 05:33:56,638
have dynamic

7439
05:33:56,638 --> 05:33:58,160
risk-based access to all of your

7440
05:33:58,160 --> 05:34:00,798
applications for all of your users on

7441
05:34:00,798 --> 05:34:03,760
all of your devices and that's not real

7442
05:34:03,760 --> 05:34:05,920
that's not possible today there's a long

7443
05:34:05,920 --> 05:34:07,840
tail of things that are hard to get

7444
05:34:07,840 --> 05:34:09,360
right or that are not yet solved for

7445
05:34:09,360 --> 05:34:11,360
like a normal company to have a zero

7446
05:34:11,360 --> 05:34:12,878
trust architecture

7447
05:34:12,878 --> 05:34:14,080
specifically there's a couple of things

7448
05:34:14,080 --> 05:34:15,840
at the long tail that are hard

7449
05:34:15,840 --> 05:34:18,718
sas applications uh truly risk-based

7450
05:34:18,718 --> 05:34:21,840
access device state and just random

7451
05:34:21,840 --> 05:34:24,718
network devices so let's dig in

7452
05:34:24,718 --> 05:34:26,480
uh so this is a friend of ours matthew

7453
05:34:26,480 --> 05:34:27,760
garrett who

7454
05:34:27,760 --> 05:34:29,280
left google to go you know work at a

7455
05:34:29,280 --> 05:34:32,000
startup and realized oh my god all of

7456
05:34:32,000 --> 05:34:34,718
the services my customer my clients use

7457
05:34:34,718 --> 05:34:37,040
are now hosted web services and starts

7458
05:34:37,040 --> 05:34:40,240
to think how do i do xero trust there

7459
05:34:40,240 --> 05:34:42,558
and the reality is that this is really

7460
05:34:42,558 --> 05:34:44,718
hard when you can't put a service behind

7461
05:34:44,718 --> 05:34:45,840
the proxy

7462
05:34:45,840 --> 05:34:49,200
and i think based off the second tweet

7463
05:34:49,200 --> 05:34:51,200
matthew's solution which i think is a

7464
05:34:51,200 --> 05:34:54,080
good you know if unsatisfying one is

7465
05:34:54,080 --> 05:34:56,958
that oftentimes your sso that you know

7466
05:34:56,958 --> 05:34:59,200
corporate sso that you paid extra to get

7467
05:34:59,200 --> 05:35:01,680
now becomes the access point so when you

7468
05:35:01,680 --> 05:35:03,200
go and log in through this and get

7469
05:35:03,200 --> 05:35:05,280
bounced to your sso provider that's run

7470
05:35:05,280 --> 05:35:07,200
by your corporation it now needs to make

7471
05:35:07,200 --> 05:35:09,280
intelligent decisions about when i issue

7472
05:35:09,280 --> 05:35:11,440
you that you know saml i forget the

7473
05:35:11,440 --> 05:35:14,718
assertion or the oidc token

7474
05:35:14,718 --> 05:35:18,320
what you know can it is does this device

7475
05:35:18,320 --> 05:35:21,040
have a client certificate does it have

7476
05:35:21,040 --> 05:35:23,520
is it correctly patched and do i want to

7477
05:35:23,520 --> 05:35:25,600
now allow this to access the third-party

7478
05:35:25,600 --> 05:35:27,760
sas app for some you know given amount

7479
05:35:27,760 --> 05:35:29,840
of time

7480
05:35:29,840 --> 05:35:31,360
yeah and and one workaround that i've

7481
05:35:31,360 --> 05:35:33,200
heard and i really don't like it but

7482
05:35:33,200 --> 05:35:35,840
it's a workaround is to is to have them

7483
05:35:35,840 --> 05:35:37,440
uh pure have the sass apps peer to your

7484
05:35:37,440 --> 05:35:39,600
network so that ingress traffic to the

7485
05:35:39,600 --> 05:35:41,440
app is only coming from allow lists at

7486
05:35:41,440 --> 05:35:43,200
ip addresses that are presumably your

7487
05:35:43,200 --> 05:35:45,520
corporate network um so an employee

7488
05:35:45,520 --> 05:35:47,200
who's trying to access you know workday

7489
05:35:47,200 --> 05:35:48,798
or benefits whatever it happens to be

7490
05:35:48,798 --> 05:35:50,000
needs to pass through traffic through

7491
05:35:50,000 --> 05:35:51,920
your corporate network out the other end

7492
05:35:51,920 --> 05:35:53,920
to that to that third application

7493
05:35:53,920 --> 05:35:55,360
some security teams like this because

7494
05:35:55,360 --> 05:35:56,958
they want to inspect the traffic or

7495
05:35:56,958 --> 05:35:58,958
enforce certain things on that traffic

7496
05:35:58,958 --> 05:36:00,718
but it is kind of shitty for the user

7497
05:36:00,718 --> 05:36:02,400
right it's like much slower

7498
05:36:02,400 --> 05:36:04,718
um you have yeah anyways so in addition

7499
05:36:04,718 --> 05:36:06,160
to being slow there's a couple of

7500
05:36:06,160 --> 05:36:08,160
security downsides that are not great um

7501
05:36:08,160 --> 05:36:09,920
this is completely a step backwards in

7502
05:36:09,920 --> 05:36:11,280
time right like you're going back to

7503
05:36:11,280 --> 05:36:13,200
having a flat network and you're saying

7504
05:36:13,200 --> 05:36:14,718
that anyone who's on the network can

7505
05:36:14,718 --> 05:36:16,558
access these sas applications which is

7506
05:36:16,558 --> 05:36:18,240
not what we're trying to do

7507
05:36:18,240 --> 05:36:19,920
it requires a sas app to have this

7508
05:36:19,920 --> 05:36:22,240
functionality not every sas application

7509
05:36:22,240 --> 05:36:24,480
lets you have ipl listing to a set of

7510
05:36:24,480 --> 05:36:25,680
ips

7511
05:36:25,680 --> 05:36:26,958
and you probably also want a way to

7512
05:36:26,958 --> 05:36:29,040
correlate audit logs from the sas app to

7513
05:36:29,040 --> 05:36:30,718
your audit logs know who's actually

7514
05:36:30,718 --> 05:36:31,920
accessing the application what they're

7515
05:36:31,920 --> 05:36:33,200
doing

7516
05:36:33,200 --> 05:36:35,120
and you also don't necessarily have

7517
05:36:35,120 --> 05:36:38,240
fixed ips right your network changes you

7518
05:36:38,240 --> 05:36:39,840
migrate data centers or more likely

7519
05:36:39,840 --> 05:36:41,760
you're using a cloud provider and then

7520
05:36:41,760 --> 05:36:43,440
you're allow listing like all of

7521
05:36:43,440 --> 05:36:45,680
google's public ips or all of amazon's

7522
05:36:45,680 --> 05:36:47,840
public ips and that's not really

7523
05:36:47,840 --> 05:36:49,680
closed anymore to anything that's like

7524
05:36:49,680 --> 05:36:50,958
you've allowed listed like a lot of the

7525
05:36:50,958 --> 05:36:52,320
internet to talk to your to your

7526
05:36:52,320 --> 05:36:54,240
internal applications so relying on

7527
05:36:54,240 --> 05:36:56,638
iptrust isn't the best way to deal with

7528
05:36:56,638 --> 05:36:59,360
sas apps either

7529
05:36:59,360 --> 05:37:03,200
and i think the temptation with tiers

7530
05:37:03,200 --> 05:37:05,680
is to have a lot of them

7531
05:37:05,680 --> 05:37:06,558
people

7532
05:37:06,558 --> 05:37:08,160
want to do this they want to say you

7533
05:37:08,160 --> 05:37:10,958
know more than just you have you know

7534
05:37:10,958 --> 05:37:13,040
privileged access plus some middle

7535
05:37:13,040 --> 05:37:15,120
ground plus no access

7536
05:37:15,120 --> 05:37:18,240
and um this slide is sort of one of my

7537
05:37:18,240 --> 05:37:19,920
friends who used to work in mozilla was

7538
05:37:19,920 --> 05:37:22,480
working on some of the ways in which

7539
05:37:22,480 --> 05:37:24,718
they were going to allow they allow

7540
05:37:24,718 --> 05:37:26,558
individual applications to prescribe

7541
05:37:26,558 --> 05:37:28,638
what the p what the requirements are for

7542
05:37:28,638 --> 05:37:30,558
their own service so there's two main

7543
05:37:30,558 --> 05:37:32,878
things that you hit one is that every

7544
05:37:32,878 --> 05:37:35,280
service now has to be aware of like what

7545
05:37:35,280 --> 05:37:37,760
tier level it accepts this gets really

7546
05:37:37,760 --> 05:37:39,200
messy when you think about things that

7547
05:37:39,200 --> 05:37:40,878
also might have different levels of tier

7548
05:37:40,878 --> 05:37:43,280
a bug system is a great example where

7549
05:37:43,280 --> 05:37:45,360
some of these might be extra restricted

7550
05:37:45,360 --> 05:37:47,200
additionally the more you measure

7551
05:37:47,200 --> 05:37:48,958
particularly from operating systems the

7552
05:37:48,958 --> 05:37:50,480
more you realize that everything is

7553
05:37:50,480 --> 05:37:52,160
broken and filled with like held

7554
05:37:52,160 --> 05:37:54,400
together with duct tape

7555
05:37:54,400 --> 05:37:56,480
you know the version number changed and

7556
05:37:56,480 --> 05:37:58,718
suddenly all these people lost their

7557
05:37:58,718 --> 05:38:00,480
access these type of things happen

7558
05:38:00,480 --> 05:38:03,360
regularly because ultimately os query is

7559
05:38:03,360 --> 05:38:04,878
cool but like the operating system

7560
05:38:04,878 --> 05:38:06,400
vendor should be providing us that

7561
05:38:06,400 --> 05:38:08,400
information in a way that isn't going to

7562
05:38:08,400 --> 05:38:10,400
break because somebody tweaked you know

7563
05:38:10,400 --> 05:38:12,878
a string

7564
05:38:14,080 --> 05:38:16,080
and then i put this in basically all of

7565
05:38:16,080 --> 05:38:18,480
my slides as well

7566
05:38:18,480 --> 05:38:20,638
this is the nsa

7567
05:38:20,638 --> 05:38:22,558
taking over a cisco router and doing god

7568
05:38:22,558 --> 05:38:25,600
knows what to it um

7569
05:38:25,600 --> 05:38:27,840
state is great until your device starts

7570
05:38:27,840 --> 05:38:30,480
lying to you right hey i'm patched and

7571
05:38:30,480 --> 05:38:33,120
i'm cool and you can let me in

7572
05:38:33,120 --> 05:38:34,080
um

7573
05:38:34,080 --> 05:38:36,480
the reality is that there are device

7574
05:38:36,480 --> 05:38:38,638
state attestation mechanisms we talked

7575
05:38:38,638 --> 05:38:40,480
about stuff like tpm's

7576
05:38:40,480 --> 05:38:42,798
um they work really well for closed

7577
05:38:42,798 --> 05:38:44,958
ecosystems right um

7578
05:38:44,958 --> 05:38:47,280
iphones can are pretty good at detecting

7579
05:38:47,280 --> 05:38:49,680
if they're broken or not for when you

7580
05:38:49,680 --> 05:38:51,840
get into more open ecosystems like

7581
05:38:51,840 --> 05:38:53,440
microsoft where they have to support all

7582
05:38:53,440 --> 05:38:55,520
of these random devices

7583
05:38:55,520 --> 05:38:57,200
i've looked at tpm event logs and i have

7584
05:38:57,200 --> 05:38:58,480
no idea like

7585
05:38:58,480 --> 05:39:00,000
is this thing hacked or is it not

7586
05:39:00,000 --> 05:39:02,000
because to know that information you'd

7587
05:39:02,000 --> 05:39:04,240
have to work with one or two or three

7588
05:39:04,240 --> 05:39:06,240
vendors just to get the right hashes as

7589
05:39:06,240 --> 05:39:08,718
an example

7590
05:39:09,040 --> 05:39:09,760
and the last challenge we're going to

7591
05:39:09,760 --> 05:39:12,958
talk about is random network devices

7592
05:39:12,958 --> 05:39:14,558
some devices like thinking of you

7593
05:39:14,558 --> 05:39:16,718
printers are just a pain to deal with

7594
05:39:16,718 --> 05:39:19,200
and manage on your network the same way

7595
05:39:19,200 --> 05:39:20,638
i'm not talking again i'm still not

7596
05:39:20,638 --> 05:39:21,920
talking about production network still

7597
05:39:21,920 --> 05:39:23,280
talking about the corporate network it

7598
05:39:23,280 --> 05:39:24,958
has a lot of devices

7599
05:39:24,958 --> 05:39:27,040
printers don't have secure boot printers

7600
05:39:27,040 --> 05:39:29,440
you know can't be managed by mdms uh the

7601
05:39:29,440 --> 05:39:30,480
easiest way for you to set up your

7602
05:39:30,480 --> 05:39:32,320
printer is with a fixed ip address and

7603
05:39:32,320 --> 05:39:33,920
then scan your lan to find your printer

7604
05:39:33,920 --> 05:39:35,280
and then use it

7605
05:39:35,280 --> 05:39:37,680
but i i can't you know you know if it's

7606
05:39:37,680 --> 05:39:38,878
still a device on the network and i

7607
05:39:38,878 --> 05:39:40,240
still want to be able to verify and

7608
05:39:40,240 --> 05:39:41,840
manage access to it the same way but i

7609
05:39:41,840 --> 05:39:42,958
can't

7610
05:39:42,958 --> 05:39:44,320
this comes up

7611
05:39:44,320 --> 05:39:46,320
more in brownfield than in greenfield

7612
05:39:46,320 --> 05:39:47,680
deployments because you know maybe if

7613
05:39:47,680 --> 05:39:49,200
you're at a startup you can just if

7614
05:39:49,200 --> 05:39:50,480
you're trying to adopt a zero trust

7615
05:39:50,480 --> 05:39:52,798
model you can just not have printers um

7616
05:39:52,798 --> 05:39:54,958
but existing legacy networks will have a

7617
05:39:54,958 --> 05:39:56,160
harder time

7618
05:39:56,160 --> 05:39:57,520
with dealing with these random other

7619
05:39:57,520 --> 05:39:58,798
devices

7620
05:39:58,798 --> 05:40:01,200
so then kind of waving a magic wand and

7621
05:40:01,200 --> 05:40:02,480
looking at you know ignoring those

7622
05:40:02,480 --> 05:40:03,840
challenges we just talked about if you

7623
05:40:03,840 --> 05:40:05,520
could if you could have level four what

7624
05:40:05,520 --> 05:40:06,638
would that be

7625
05:40:06,638 --> 05:40:08,400
um it would there would be a decent way

7626
05:40:08,400 --> 05:40:10,400
to manage users and user access to sas

7627
05:40:10,400 --> 05:40:12,480
applications and correlate logs for when

7628
05:40:12,480 --> 05:40:14,798
users access those applications

7629
05:40:14,798 --> 05:40:17,200
probably there's only two okay partial

7630
05:40:17,200 --> 05:40:18,558
solutions today

7631
05:40:18,558 --> 05:40:20,638
one is to host everything yourself

7632
05:40:20,638 --> 05:40:21,600
which is

7633
05:40:21,600 --> 05:40:23,600
not super realistic but you do see

7634
05:40:23,600 --> 05:40:24,718
becoming more and more common with like

7635
05:40:24,718 --> 05:40:26,320
larger infrastructure tools that offer

7636
05:40:26,320 --> 05:40:29,680
on-prem solutions or the second one i'll

7637
05:40:29,680 --> 05:40:31,280
add on to

7638
05:40:31,280 --> 05:40:32,798
to matthew's list is you can be google

7639
05:40:32,798 --> 05:40:34,558
or you can be microsoft

7640
05:40:34,558 --> 05:40:36,160
and you can use your single sign-on to

7641
05:40:36,160 --> 05:40:38,000
access everything

7642
05:40:38,000 --> 05:40:39,440
fundamentally as an industry we don't

7643
05:40:39,440 --> 05:40:40,638
have a way to deal with this and we need

7644
05:40:40,638 --> 05:40:42,080
a better way to deal with portable

7645
05:40:42,080 --> 05:40:44,638
credentials for third-party sas apps um

7646
05:40:44,638 --> 05:40:45,920
ideally also including device

7647
05:40:45,920 --> 05:40:48,400
credentials as eric has pointed out

7648
05:40:48,400 --> 05:40:50,400
in terms of devices you would need to

7649
05:40:50,400 --> 05:40:51,760
include all the devices that are on your

7650
05:40:51,760 --> 05:40:52,958
corporate network because they're all a

7651
05:40:52,958 --> 05:40:54,798
point of entry to your network

7652
05:40:54,798 --> 05:40:56,240
usually the easiest way to address this

7653
05:40:56,240 --> 05:40:58,638
is actually to move these devices off of

7654
05:40:58,638 --> 05:41:00,160
the corporate network rather than do

7655
05:41:00,160 --> 05:41:01,440
whatever they need to do and meet the

7656
05:41:01,440 --> 05:41:03,600
requirements to remain on the corporate

7657
05:41:03,600 --> 05:41:04,638
network

7658
05:41:04,638 --> 05:41:06,000
and as eric explained you know having

7659
05:41:06,000 --> 05:41:07,680
hardware-based device out of station

7660
05:41:07,680 --> 05:41:08,718
from a root of trust that you can

7661
05:41:08,718 --> 05:41:11,280
actually trust that's still a very hard

7662
05:41:11,280 --> 05:41:12,400
problem

7663
05:41:12,400 --> 05:41:14,160
and lastly with all that info making

7664
05:41:14,160 --> 05:41:16,000
real-time decisions that aren't just

7665
05:41:16,000 --> 05:41:18,000
rule-based but that change based on what

7666
05:41:18,000 --> 05:41:19,840
you know about the user device quickly

7667
05:41:19,840 --> 05:41:21,680
enough that the user doesn't notice or

7668
05:41:21,680 --> 05:41:23,840
get frustrated and so that's it right

7669
05:41:23,840 --> 05:41:25,360
but as you've learned that's that's not

7670
05:41:25,360 --> 05:41:27,760
exactly easy

7671
05:41:27,760 --> 05:41:29,680
so to recap what we talked about today

7672
05:41:29,680 --> 05:41:32,400
uh we proposed different capabilities on

7673
05:41:32,400 --> 05:41:34,160
your roadmap to adopting a zero trust

7674
05:41:34,160 --> 05:41:35,440
architecture that looks a little bit

7675
05:41:35,440 --> 05:41:37,360
like google's beyond corp

7676
05:41:37,360 --> 05:41:40,000
at level one you are treating the vpn as

7677
05:41:40,000 --> 05:41:41,200
an access control point for the

7678
05:41:41,200 --> 05:41:42,878
applications on your network you can

7679
05:41:42,878 --> 05:41:45,520
enumerate users and devices

7680
05:41:45,520 --> 05:41:47,360
you're using an sso to inventory users

7681
05:41:47,360 --> 05:41:48,558
and you have a manual way to list

7682
05:41:48,558 --> 05:41:50,080
devices

7683
05:41:50,080 --> 05:41:52,798
these are table stakes i.t and security

7684
05:41:52,798 --> 05:41:54,080
capabilities

7685
05:41:54,080 --> 05:41:56,400
at level two you have per service

7686
05:41:56,400 --> 05:41:58,080
authorization

7687
05:41:58,080 --> 05:42:00,080
for example by using a proxy you can

7688
05:42:00,080 --> 05:42:02,160
measure and enforce you can measure most

7689
05:42:02,160 --> 05:42:04,638
and enforce some security controls you

7690
05:42:04,638 --> 05:42:06,558
have a vpn for your network and mdm to

7691
05:42:06,558 --> 05:42:08,400
track and manage your devices and your

7692
05:42:08,400 --> 05:42:10,878
users use sso and mfa ideally security

7693
05:42:10,878 --> 05:42:11,840
keys

7694
05:42:11,840 --> 05:42:13,680
this is where most security focused

7695
05:42:13,680 --> 05:42:15,360
enterprises are today

7696
05:42:15,360 --> 05:42:17,440
at level three you're all in on what the

7697
05:42:17,440 --> 05:42:20,000
market calls zero trust architecture and

7698
05:42:20,000 --> 05:42:21,680
you've maybe even bought a solution that

7699
05:42:21,680 --> 05:42:23,440
builds itself that way

7700
05:42:23,440 --> 05:42:25,520
what you can do is enforce tiered access

7701
05:42:25,520 --> 05:42:27,120
to applications based on device

7702
05:42:27,120 --> 05:42:28,480
characteristics

7703
05:42:28,480 --> 05:42:29,760
and level four is what many people

7704
05:42:29,760 --> 05:42:31,600
aspire to but no one has yet to fully

7705
05:42:31,600 --> 05:42:32,718
achieve

7706
05:42:32,718 --> 05:42:34,320
you want to be able to dynamically

7707
05:42:34,320 --> 05:42:35,840
enforce risk-based access to

7708
05:42:35,840 --> 05:42:38,320
applications and there's a long list of

7709
05:42:38,320 --> 05:42:40,558
user device and access issues such as

7710
05:42:40,558 --> 05:42:42,718
sas apps that are very hard to get right

7711
05:42:42,718 --> 05:42:45,040
today

7712
05:42:45,520 --> 05:42:46,798
i think

7713
05:42:46,798 --> 05:42:48,798
the wrong take away from this talk is to

7714
05:42:48,798 --> 05:42:50,718
look at this list and say

7715
05:42:50,718 --> 05:42:52,958
i'm going to do a check mark and get to

7716
05:42:52,958 --> 05:42:55,040
level x right

7717
05:42:55,040 --> 05:42:56,958
beyond corp is never really done it's

7718
05:42:56,958 --> 05:42:58,798
more the friends you make along the way

7719
05:42:58,798 --> 05:43:02,240
right like we're friends

7720
05:43:02,240 --> 05:43:05,120
you want to be focusing on these core

7721
05:43:05,120 --> 05:43:07,760
pillars and it's that's not a vpn it's

7722
05:43:07,760 --> 05:43:10,400
users devices and the way you combine

7723
05:43:10,400 --> 05:43:12,480
those two pieces of information to

7724
05:43:12,480 --> 05:43:14,718
determine their access and

7725
05:43:14,718 --> 05:43:16,400
that in and of itself

7726
05:43:16,400 --> 05:43:18,160
brings a huge wealth of security

7727
05:43:18,160 --> 05:43:20,240
benefits regardless of what level you're

7728
05:43:20,240 --> 05:43:22,240
at or if you ever claim that you've

7729
05:43:22,240 --> 05:43:25,200
accomplished beyond

7730
05:43:26,638 --> 05:43:28,558
and that's it thanks so much for joining

7731
05:43:28,558 --> 05:43:32,400
us and drop questions in the slider

7732
05:43:37,760 --> 05:43:40,320
thanks so those were three great talks

7733
05:43:40,320 --> 05:43:42,558
in about 10 minutes we're gonna set up

7734
05:43:42,558 --> 05:43:45,520
the q a you can still ask questions on

7735
05:43:45,520 --> 05:43:48,320
slido and we have many questions it's

7736
05:43:48,320 --> 05:43:49,680
going to be a really interesting

7737
05:43:49,680 --> 05:43:50,718
discussion

7738
05:43:50,718 --> 05:43:53,200
stay tuned

7776
05:57:25,920 --> 05:57:27,440
hello

7777
05:57:27,440 --> 05:57:30,760
all right

7778
05:57:30,798 --> 05:57:33,360
so welcome to the q a we have 30 minutes

7779
05:57:33,360 --> 05:57:35,760
of uh of questions and we have a lot of

7780
05:57:35,760 --> 05:57:39,120
them so uh i won't go into too much of

7781
05:57:39,120 --> 05:57:41,600
an introduction but i'll still introduce

7782
05:57:41,600 --> 05:57:42,718
guillaume

7783
05:57:42,718 --> 05:57:45,520
who was doing the workshop on the fleet

7784
05:57:45,520 --> 05:57:47,760
and os query

7785
05:57:47,760 --> 05:57:49,680
so guillaume is the head of security at

7786
05:57:49,680 --> 05:57:51,520
fleet device management the company

7787
05:57:51,520 --> 05:57:53,120
behind the open source fleet management

7788
05:57:53,120 --> 05:57:54,958
platform for managing and using eos

7789
05:57:54,958 --> 05:57:55,840
query

7790
05:57:55,840 --> 05:57:57,680
while he prefers working in startups

7791
05:57:57,680 --> 05:57:59,600
he's been working in security forever in

7792
05:57:59,600 --> 05:58:01,680
organizations of all types and prefers

7793
05:58:01,680 --> 05:58:04,080
working at the bright side of things and

7794
05:58:04,080 --> 05:58:05,878
things that work instead of repeating

7795
05:58:05,878 --> 05:58:08,320
30-year-old best practices that never

7796
05:58:08,320 --> 05:58:10,558
have

7797
05:58:10,878 --> 05:58:13,200
all right so the first question the most

7798
05:58:13,200 --> 05:58:16,718
upvoted uh is uh i think mostly for

7799
05:58:16,718 --> 05:58:17,760
caspian

7800
05:58:17,760 --> 05:58:19,920
what is the impact on mental health

7801
05:58:19,920 --> 05:58:22,798
accumulating incident response and what

7802
05:58:22,798 --> 05:58:24,840
can be done to better handle

7803
05:58:24,840 --> 05:58:27,040
it um

7804
05:58:27,040 --> 05:58:28,638
that's a it's a great that's a great

7805
05:58:28,638 --> 05:58:30,000
question i

7806
05:58:30,000 --> 05:58:31,200
so

7807
05:58:31,200 --> 05:58:33,200
it kind of depends on what the level of

7808
05:58:33,200 --> 05:58:35,120
incident response people are working at

7809
05:58:35,120 --> 05:58:37,040
uh and how often they're dealing with it

7810
05:58:37,040 --> 05:58:38,558
but in a lot of cases

7811
05:58:38,558 --> 05:58:39,680
your first incident's going to be

7812
05:58:39,680 --> 05:58:41,200
stressful if you're dealing with a lot

7813
05:58:41,200 --> 05:58:42,798
of incidents it's going to be stressful

7814
05:58:42,798 --> 05:58:44,080
and sometimes you're going to see things

7815
05:58:44,080 --> 05:58:45,600
that you absolutely do not want to see

7816
05:58:45,600 --> 05:58:47,280
hear things you don't want to hear and

7817
05:58:47,280 --> 05:58:49,440
experiencing things you know that you

7818
05:58:49,440 --> 05:58:51,520
won't want to be there for so

7819
05:58:51,520 --> 05:58:52,878
i think the mental health impacts can be

7820
05:58:52,878 --> 05:58:55,360
kind of high and it's important both for

7821
05:58:55,360 --> 05:58:56,558
employers

7822
05:58:56,558 --> 05:58:57,920
and people running security teams and

7823
05:58:57,920 --> 05:58:59,840
managers to understand that the folks

7824
05:58:59,840 --> 05:59:00,798
that they're putting on the line to do

7825
05:59:00,798 --> 05:59:02,320
this actually do

7826
05:59:02,320 --> 05:59:03,920
you know experience that and to have

7827
05:59:03,920 --> 05:59:05,440
that awareness and have that support in

7828
05:59:05,440 --> 05:59:08,798
place when it's possible

7829
05:59:08,798 --> 05:59:10,320
all right thanks

7830
05:59:10,320 --> 05:59:11,760
um

7831
05:59:11,760 --> 05:59:14,480
any tips for capturing momentum after an

7832
05:59:14,480 --> 05:59:16,080
incident to guess to get better

7833
05:59:16,080 --> 05:59:18,558
practices in place so so like a

7834
05:59:18,558 --> 05:59:21,120
input post incident oh my god are these

7835
05:59:21,120 --> 05:59:23,280
all for me

7836
05:59:23,280 --> 05:59:25,840
i feel really special right now um

7837
05:59:25,840 --> 05:59:28,400
yeah a couple one uh

7838
05:59:28,400 --> 05:59:30,400
post incident basically take what you've

7839
05:59:30,400 --> 05:59:32,240
learned from the incident uh it's gonna

7840
05:59:32,240 --> 05:59:33,680
make a huge difference if you can say

7841
05:59:33,680 --> 05:59:35,440
okay you know let's not waste this

7842
05:59:35,440 --> 05:59:37,520
incident let's learn something uh and

7843
05:59:37,520 --> 05:59:38,798
let's build from there

7844
05:59:38,798 --> 05:59:40,958
um and in terms of capturing momentum

7845
05:59:40,958 --> 05:59:43,120
from the teams like it also kind of goes

7846
05:59:43,120 --> 05:59:44,718
back to a mental health thing right you

7847
05:59:44,718 --> 05:59:46,558
basically got knocked down you have to

7848
05:59:46,558 --> 05:59:49,360
get up again oh wait that wasn't yeah

7849
05:59:49,360 --> 05:59:51,040
i i was going to go on with this song

7850
05:59:51,040 --> 05:59:52,558
but uh

7851
05:59:52,558 --> 05:59:53,360
it's

7852
05:59:53,360 --> 05:59:56,320
not a great situation and a lot of times

7853
05:59:56,320 --> 05:59:57,840
you know you can use the incident as a

7854
05:59:57,840 --> 05:59:59,840
rallying point for people but the most i

7855
05:59:59,840 --> 06:00:02,240
think the most important point is to not

7856
06:00:02,240 --> 06:00:03,920
point fingers you know did not turn this

7857
06:00:03,920 --> 06:00:05,440
into a situation where like yeah

7858
06:00:05,440 --> 06:00:06,798
so-and-so is responsible for this so

7859
06:00:06,798 --> 06:00:08,240
they should you know they should get

7860
06:00:08,240 --> 06:00:10,080
fired or demoted or whatever that's

7861
06:00:10,080 --> 06:00:11,280
not something you should ever do in

7862
06:00:11,280 --> 06:00:12,878
these situations

7863
06:00:12,878 --> 06:00:14,798
yeah and i think

7864
06:00:14,798 --> 06:00:16,080
this this

7865
06:00:16,080 --> 06:00:18,798
the blue teams in general they

7866
06:00:18,798 --> 06:00:20,718
we have a reputation of pointing fingers

7867
06:00:20,718 --> 06:00:21,440
that

7868
06:00:21,440 --> 06:00:23,760
maybe we shouldn't be doing or maybe we

7869
06:00:23,760 --> 06:00:25,520
don't do it but

7870
06:00:25,520 --> 06:00:27,840
i think people external to the the

7871
06:00:27,840 --> 06:00:30,160
security people they they see security

7872
06:00:30,160 --> 06:00:33,440
as pointing fingers and it's bad for the

7873
06:00:33,440 --> 06:00:35,600
the business or the industry as a whole

7874
06:00:35,600 --> 06:00:37,760
yeah and and i think so i've worked with

7875
06:00:37,760 --> 06:00:40,000
guillaume in the past in a couple of in

7876
06:00:40,000 --> 06:00:41,920
a really fun role at a former employer

7877
06:00:41,920 --> 06:00:44,000
and i've heard a lot of his stories of

7878
06:00:44,000 --> 06:00:45,680
kind of like losing it and getting angry

7879
06:00:45,680 --> 06:00:47,120
but being positive and i think that's

7880
06:00:47,120 --> 06:00:48,638
actually kind of important in these

7881
06:00:48,638 --> 06:00:50,878
situations like be angry at the incident

7882
06:00:50,878 --> 06:00:53,040
not at the individual

7883
06:00:53,040 --> 06:00:55,040
i think to add on to some of what you're

7884
06:00:55,040 --> 06:00:56,320
saying about you know not blaming a

7885
06:00:56,320 --> 06:00:58,320
particular person or et cetera um like

7886
06:00:58,320 --> 06:00:59,920
google has a culture on sres of

7887
06:00:59,920 --> 06:01:01,840
blameless post-mortems after an incident

7888
06:01:01,840 --> 06:01:03,920
happens yeah and i think as much as

7889
06:01:03,920 --> 06:01:05,520
possible that that also applies to

7890
06:01:05,520 --> 06:01:08,000
security like something bad happens

7891
06:01:08,000 --> 06:01:09,680
document what you should have done

7892
06:01:09,680 --> 06:01:10,638
instead

7893
06:01:10,638 --> 06:01:11,920
there's something that's critical that

7894
06:01:11,920 --> 06:01:13,600
you absolutely have to go fix

7895
06:01:13,600 --> 06:01:16,000
and it's not someone's fault that i

7896
06:01:16,000 --> 06:01:17,680
don't know the alert system failed or

7897
06:01:17,680 --> 06:01:20,480
whatever right there's nothing more

7898
06:01:20,480 --> 06:01:21,680
there's nothing that'll get a proof of

7899
06:01:21,680 --> 06:01:24,718
concept built faster than some terrible

7900
06:01:24,718 --> 06:01:26,840
all hands on deck like

7901
06:01:26,840 --> 06:01:30,400
security something happening right

7902
06:01:30,400 --> 06:01:32,240
it wouldn't point to specific things but

7903
06:01:32,240 --> 06:01:33,520
over the past few years like you could

7904
06:01:33,520 --> 06:01:34,798
imagine

7905
06:01:34,798 --> 06:01:36,878
those moments where it's like everybody

7906
06:01:36,878 --> 06:01:38,160
stop what you're doing we're working on

7907
06:01:38,160 --> 06:01:40,480
this one thing like those are often

7908
06:01:40,480 --> 06:01:42,080
times where you end up getting to proof

7909
06:01:42,080 --> 06:01:43,760
of concept of things that you wanted to

7910
06:01:43,760 --> 06:01:45,760
all along and you know suddenly it's

7911
06:01:45,760 --> 06:01:47,120
running on every machine and you're like

7912
06:01:47,120 --> 06:01:49,120
okay maybe we could do more of that and

7913
06:01:49,120 --> 06:01:50,798
that's a much easier place when you've

7914
06:01:50,798 --> 06:01:52,638
kind of proven that out out of

7915
06:01:52,638 --> 06:01:54,160
uh panic

7916
06:01:54,160 --> 06:01:56,000
more than anything and then going from

7917
06:01:56,000 --> 06:01:58,480
the the proof of concept to actually

7918
06:01:58,480 --> 06:02:00,718
implementing correctly is another topic

7919
06:02:00,718 --> 06:02:03,360
but it's really complicated as well um i

7920
06:02:03,360 --> 06:02:05,920
have a question for either eric or maya

7921
06:02:05,920 --> 06:02:08,878
so you talked about the the security

7922
06:02:08,878 --> 06:02:12,798
security keys and web and so uh it's a

7923
06:02:12,798 --> 06:02:15,520
fairly new technology but the technology

7924
06:02:15,520 --> 06:02:18,638
is there it works um

7925
06:02:18,638 --> 06:02:21,760
and i think the the adoption is quite

7926
06:02:21,760 --> 06:02:22,840
slow

7927
06:02:22,840 --> 06:02:25,520
um and

7928
06:02:25,520 --> 06:02:28,480
my question is i think i think people uh

7929
06:02:28,480 --> 06:02:30,160
a lot of people even security people are

7930
06:02:30,160 --> 06:02:32,638
not aware of the the benefits so the

7931
06:02:32,638 --> 06:02:34,480
biggest one being it's basically

7932
06:02:34,480 --> 06:02:36,638
unfishable so

7933
06:02:36,638 --> 06:02:39,840
how do we speed up this process of

7934
06:02:39,840 --> 06:02:42,320
getting people to know

7935
06:02:42,320 --> 06:02:45,280
it exists it's very good you should

7936
06:02:45,280 --> 06:02:47,520
you should get to that at some point so

7937
06:02:47,520 --> 06:02:49,120
i would say that i have a much easier

7938
06:02:49,120 --> 06:02:50,878
job because i work in a corporate

7939
06:02:50,878 --> 06:02:52,400
environment where you can sort of just

7940
06:02:52,400 --> 06:02:55,360
say like hey we're going to use these

7941
06:02:55,360 --> 06:02:56,480
like you know

7942
06:02:56,480 --> 06:02:57,920
we start enumerating all the places

7943
06:02:57,920 --> 06:02:58,958
where we don't use them we have

7944
06:02:58,958 --> 06:03:01,200
exception processes for that but if you

7945
06:03:01,200 --> 06:03:02,878
look at like what the fido alliance is

7946
06:03:02,878 --> 06:03:04,480
trying to do they're trying to get the

7947
06:03:04,480 --> 06:03:06,240
whole world to get onto that and you've

7948
06:03:06,240 --> 06:03:07,920
seen things like their white papers of

7949
06:03:07,920 --> 06:03:09,120
trying to have

7950
06:03:09,120 --> 06:03:11,840
even like soft phyto tokens that you can

7951
06:03:11,840 --> 06:03:13,680
move around between devices and back up

7952
06:03:13,680 --> 06:03:16,080
to your like cloud right um

7953
06:03:16,080 --> 06:03:18,480
so i think that these are kind of two

7954
06:03:18,480 --> 06:03:20,878
different topics right like a corporate

7955
06:03:20,878 --> 06:03:22,400
entity is going to have all of their

7956
06:03:22,400 --> 06:03:23,840
weird little things that you're gonna

7957
06:03:23,840 --> 06:03:25,040
have to

7958
06:03:25,040 --> 06:03:27,200
know that okay this doesn't use

7959
06:03:27,200 --> 06:03:28,958
web authn or it wasn't used to security

7960
06:03:28,958 --> 06:03:30,718
key to get the entire world to use

7961
06:03:30,718 --> 06:03:32,080
security is key is something i'm

7962
06:03:32,080 --> 06:03:34,480
dramatically under prepared to

7963
06:03:34,480 --> 06:03:36,160
to speak about yeah i'll add a couple

7964
06:03:36,160 --> 06:03:38,878
things um one is that your sso probably

7965
06:03:38,878 --> 06:03:40,240
has a control that says something like

7966
06:03:40,240 --> 06:03:42,080
require security keys

7967
06:03:42,080 --> 06:03:45,040
uh so yeah you just like prep your your

7968
06:03:45,040 --> 06:03:46,480
employees to be ready for that and send

7969
06:03:46,480 --> 06:03:48,000
them all security keys and all that kind

7970
06:03:48,000 --> 06:03:49,120
of stuff explain that you can put

7971
06:03:49,120 --> 06:03:51,360
multiple credentials on the same key

7972
06:03:51,360 --> 06:03:52,638
like that they don't that they can have

7973
06:03:52,638 --> 06:03:54,080
lots of keys they all work like all that

7974
06:03:54,080 --> 06:03:55,280
kind of stuff

7975
06:03:55,280 --> 06:03:56,718
so you need to spend the money up front

7976
06:03:56,718 --> 06:03:58,558
on those keys and flip that switch but

7977
06:03:58,558 --> 06:03:59,600
that's absolutely something that an

7978
06:03:59,600 --> 06:04:01,360
enterprise can do

7979
06:04:01,360 --> 06:04:03,040
the other thing i will say is i think

7980
06:04:03,040 --> 06:04:04,480
some of it's going to be forced on us in

7981
06:04:04,480 --> 06:04:07,200
a good way so github announced a couple

7982
06:04:07,200 --> 06:04:08,320
months ago that they're going to force

7983
06:04:08,320 --> 06:04:10,320
all developers to have 2fa not security

7984
06:04:10,320 --> 06:04:12,958
keys but just 2fa baby steps uh i think

7985
06:04:12,958 --> 06:04:15,920
in 2024 or 2023 i got it

7986
06:04:15,920 --> 06:04:17,760
it's time it's like really really time

7987
06:04:17,760 --> 06:04:19,280
like i'm i'm shocked this hasn't

7988
06:04:19,280 --> 06:04:21,120
happened before but a lot more people

7989
06:04:21,120 --> 06:04:22,718
are going to just start using second

7990
06:04:22,718 --> 06:04:25,200
factors and security keys and

7991
06:04:25,200 --> 06:04:28,320
adoption will continue

7992
06:04:28,558 --> 06:04:30,400
and about to get github i think i think

7993
06:04:30,400 --> 06:04:33,680
they said that that uh i think 15 of the

7994
06:04:33,680 --> 06:04:36,798
users have 2fa which i thought was

7995
06:04:36,798 --> 06:04:38,160
really low because

7996
06:04:38,160 --> 06:04:39,920
their developers

7997
06:04:39,920 --> 06:04:42,080
they they're closer to security than

7998
06:04:42,080 --> 06:04:44,000
most people and they should be aware of

7999
06:04:44,000 --> 06:04:45,520
the the benefits

8000
06:04:45,520 --> 06:04:47,200
of it but but

8001
06:04:47,200 --> 06:04:48,878
i don't know but the 15 but the last

8002
06:04:48,878 --> 06:04:51,600
public number i saw was 11 of projects

8003
06:04:51,600 --> 06:04:53,680
that have over 100 developers

8004
06:04:53,680 --> 06:04:54,638
um

8005
06:04:54,638 --> 06:04:55,680
have

8006
06:04:55,680 --> 06:04:57,600
developers who use security keys

8007
06:04:57,600 --> 06:04:59,120
or sorry use 2fa because i don't think

8008
06:04:59,120 --> 06:05:00,958
github tracks which ones which that

8009
06:05:00,958 --> 06:05:04,320
you're from that they publish yeah

8010
06:05:04,320 --> 06:05:06,638
all right a question for yuri

8011
06:05:06,638 --> 06:05:08,798
can you successfully distinguish

8012
06:05:08,798 --> 06:05:11,120
obfuscated javascripts

8013
06:05:11,120 --> 06:05:14,080
from minified ones because i think uh

8014
06:05:14,080 --> 06:05:17,120
minified javascript is pretty common in

8015
06:05:17,120 --> 06:05:19,920
the in the web as a whole because it

8016
06:05:19,920 --> 06:05:22,558
reduces payload size and there are lots

8017
06:05:22,558 --> 06:05:25,280
of benefits so how does your

8018
06:05:25,280 --> 06:05:27,280
your uh model

8019
06:05:27,280 --> 06:05:28,320
do with that

8020
06:05:28,320 --> 06:05:30,558
yeah it's a great question so let me

8021
06:05:30,558 --> 06:05:32,320
first explain a few words for those who

8022
06:05:32,320 --> 06:05:34,558
are not sure what are the differences so

8023
06:05:34,558 --> 06:05:38,080
unification uh means that you do not

8024
06:05:38,080 --> 06:05:41,040
intend to hide the code but rather

8025
06:05:41,040 --> 06:05:43,840
compact it so usually the purpose of

8026
06:05:43,840 --> 06:05:45,520
magnification to make the code run

8027
06:05:45,520 --> 06:05:48,160
faster and and then it just changes the

8028
06:05:48,160 --> 06:05:50,480
names of variables mostly and like

8029
06:05:50,480 --> 06:05:52,160
compresses the code to be on a single

8030
06:05:52,160 --> 06:05:54,878
line uh so

8031
06:05:54,878 --> 06:05:57,360
as you one of the examples i showed was

8032
06:05:57,360 --> 06:05:59,440
indeed minified so

8033
06:05:59,440 --> 06:06:02,240
uh in our case first of all uh the

8034
06:06:02,240 --> 06:06:04,320
minification of itself

8035
06:06:04,320 --> 06:06:07,360
we didn't see um an interesting cause to

8036
06:06:07,360 --> 06:06:10,160
distinguish between the cases so uh from

8037
06:06:10,160 --> 06:06:12,320
our point of view minification is just

8038
06:06:12,320 --> 06:06:16,958
clear text um and and this is why um

8039
06:06:16,958 --> 06:06:20,000
we did so so i did try uh to create a

8040
06:06:20,000 --> 06:06:21,920
model that do a multi-class

8041
06:06:21,920 --> 06:06:23,760
classification like three classes

8042
06:06:23,760 --> 06:06:26,000
minified clear text and obfuscated and i

8043
06:06:26,000 --> 06:06:28,160
didn't see that this model performs uh

8044
06:06:28,160 --> 06:06:29,200
better

8045
06:06:29,200 --> 06:06:31,040
but but again the point of view was to

8046
06:06:31,040 --> 06:06:33,120
distinguish ultimately between obfuscate

8047
06:06:33,120 --> 06:06:36,798
and clear text and this is why um so so

8048
06:06:36,798 --> 06:06:38,400
in this case it didn't work better than

8049
06:06:38,400 --> 06:06:41,520
that or but in general to sum up

8050
06:06:41,520 --> 06:06:45,680
it's possible to um to you know spot

8051
06:06:45,680 --> 06:06:47,120
minification

8052
06:06:47,120 --> 06:06:48,958
by machine learning very similarly to

8053
06:06:48,958 --> 06:06:52,080
what i described before in my uh in my

8054
06:06:52,080 --> 06:06:54,480
presentation and if if you really want

8055
06:06:54,480 --> 06:06:56,798
to then just you know just use a

8056
06:06:56,798 --> 06:06:59,520
minifier create the data

8057
06:06:59,520 --> 06:07:02,240
the data set as you like and just run a

8058
06:07:02,240 --> 06:07:06,160
similar model and i guess it will work

8059
06:07:06,320 --> 06:07:07,440
thanks

8060
06:07:07,440 --> 06:07:10,160
um question for i guess anybody that

8061
06:07:10,160 --> 06:07:12,958
worked in incident response or in a blue

8062
06:07:12,958 --> 06:07:15,040
team given an incident have you ever

8063
06:07:15,040 --> 06:07:17,040
considered letting the threat actor

8064
06:07:17,040 --> 06:07:19,680
operate in the hopes of capturing more

8065
06:07:19,680 --> 06:07:21,920
tools and tradecraft

8066
06:07:21,920 --> 06:07:23,600
is there someone who has a story to

8067
06:07:23,600 --> 06:07:25,440
share about that can you talk about the

8068
06:07:25,440 --> 06:07:27,600
story

8069
06:07:27,600 --> 06:07:29,280
um

8070
06:07:29,280 --> 06:07:30,718
i don't have a lot of stories to share

8071
06:07:30,718 --> 06:07:33,280
about that that i can talk about but i

8072
06:07:33,280 --> 06:07:35,360
that is definitely a thing people do yes

8073
06:07:35,360 --> 06:07:36,480
i

8074
06:07:36,480 --> 06:07:38,480
i mean i currently work at a place that

8075
06:07:38,480 --> 06:07:40,718
mostly handles ransomware incidents so

8076
06:07:40,718 --> 06:07:42,080
tools and tradecraft we have a really

8077
06:07:42,080 --> 06:07:43,840
big intel team for that we've got you

8078
06:07:43,840 --> 06:07:46,000
know we're basically that's what we do

8079
06:07:46,000 --> 06:07:47,040
uh

8080
06:07:47,040 --> 06:07:49,520
but yes i have seen that done

8081
06:07:49,520 --> 06:07:50,400
the

8082
06:07:50,400 --> 06:07:52,000
game that you're playing with that is a

8083
06:07:52,000 --> 06:07:54,798
dangerous one because you are basically

8084
06:07:54,798 --> 06:07:55,760
saying

8085
06:07:55,760 --> 06:07:58,080
let's let this roll out further and

8086
06:07:58,080 --> 06:08:00,718
you're doing that hopefully with legal

8087
06:08:00,718 --> 06:08:02,480
oversight because

8088
06:08:02,480 --> 06:08:04,240
there are a lot of questions that are

8089
06:08:04,240 --> 06:08:05,680
going to be asked after the fact if you

8090
06:08:05,680 --> 06:08:07,760
basically let any threat actor wander

8091
06:08:07,760 --> 06:08:09,040
around in your network and start messing

8092
06:08:09,040 --> 06:08:10,320
with things

8093
06:08:10,320 --> 06:08:12,320
yeah and it it's a big

8094
06:08:12,320 --> 06:08:15,200
it's a big gamble because uh i i guess

8095
06:08:15,200 --> 06:08:17,440
one uh one of the good reasons you would

8096
06:08:17,440 --> 06:08:19,760
want to do that is if you

8097
06:08:19,760 --> 06:08:21,840
if you suspect the trade actor has many

8098
06:08:21,840 --> 06:08:24,000
footholds you want to identify them

8099
06:08:24,000 --> 06:08:26,718
before uh before notifying the threat

8100
06:08:26,718 --> 06:08:28,480
actor that you're on to them

8101
06:08:28,480 --> 06:08:29,840
so it's a

8102
06:08:29,840 --> 06:08:31,520
really tricky questions and i don't

8103
06:08:31,520 --> 06:08:32,240
think

8104
06:08:32,240 --> 06:08:33,840
you can have a general answer it's

8105
06:08:33,840 --> 06:08:35,840
really going to depend incidentally no i

8106
06:08:35,840 --> 06:08:37,200
i mean really this comes down to a

8107
06:08:37,200 --> 06:08:38,958
visibility piece again and this is one

8108
06:08:38,958 --> 06:08:40,638
of the things that i think a lot of blue

8109
06:08:40,638 --> 06:08:42,400
teams struggle with is kind of being

8110
06:08:42,400 --> 06:08:44,160
able to see as much as they can on the

8111
06:08:44,160 --> 06:08:46,000
network and you know

8112
06:08:46,000 --> 06:08:47,760
there's also the controls which i know

8113
06:08:47,760 --> 06:08:48,718
you guys were talking about because i

8114
06:08:48,718 --> 06:08:50,718
got to see that so there are elements of

8115
06:08:50,718 --> 06:08:51,760
this where

8116
06:08:51,760 --> 06:08:53,040
we're only just now getting to the point

8117
06:08:53,040 --> 06:08:54,558
where we have the technology to maybe

8118
06:08:54,558 --> 06:08:55,760
see this as well as we want to but

8119
06:08:55,760 --> 06:08:56,958
there's a lot of resistance to putting

8120
06:08:56,958 --> 06:08:59,680
that in in places

8121
06:09:00,638 --> 06:09:03,200
all right a question for guillaume

8122
06:09:03,200 --> 06:09:05,520
at what size of company does something

8123
06:09:05,520 --> 06:09:09,120
like os query and fleet i guess

8124
06:09:09,120 --> 06:09:11,840
start to make sense

8125
06:09:12,240 --> 06:09:14,080
i would say if you're um if you're

8126
06:09:14,080 --> 06:09:16,000
remote and you have computers that are

8127
06:09:16,000 --> 06:09:19,280
owned by the company as opposed to byod

8128
06:09:19,280 --> 06:09:21,600
like 50 people 30 people 50 people it

8129
06:09:21,600 --> 06:09:23,120
probably starts to make sense i think as

8130
06:09:23,120 --> 06:09:24,400
soon as

8131
06:09:24,400 --> 06:09:27,440
you start having enough systems that um

8132
06:09:27,440 --> 06:09:29,120
you're wondering what's happening on

8133
06:09:29,120 --> 06:09:30,798
them right so if you've if you're like a

8134
06:09:30,798 --> 06:09:32,320
dentist's office and you've got three

8135
06:09:32,320 --> 06:09:34,400
computers it probably doesn't make sense

8136
06:09:34,400 --> 06:09:36,400
but you don't need to have

8137
06:09:36,400 --> 06:09:38,638
a thousand yeah definitely under 100

8138
06:09:38,638 --> 06:09:39,760
makes sense

8139
06:09:39,760 --> 06:09:42,080
and is there a would there be an upper

8140
06:09:42,080 --> 06:09:44,080
bound like if we have uh

8141
06:09:44,080 --> 06:09:46,400
sixty thousand machines is is it too

8142
06:09:46,400 --> 06:09:49,280
much or should we go another solution

8143
06:09:49,280 --> 06:09:51,120
no i mean um

8144
06:09:51,120 --> 06:09:54,400
the thing with uh with osquery is

8145
06:09:54,400 --> 06:09:56,798
there's like 300 different types 300

8146
06:09:56,798 --> 06:09:58,878
different tables with data that you can

8147
06:09:58,878 --> 06:10:00,080
get from

8148
06:10:00,080 --> 06:10:03,120
some of them can be extremely

8149
06:10:03,120 --> 06:10:04,480
generate a lot of data for example

8150
06:10:04,480 --> 06:10:06,000
there's a table that will tell you about

8151
06:10:06,000 --> 06:10:07,360
every single connection that's

8152
06:10:07,360 --> 06:10:08,638
established

8153
06:10:08,638 --> 06:10:10,958
if you run that on a linux server that's

8154
06:10:10,958 --> 06:10:12,958
a load balancer and and like you're

8155
06:10:12,958 --> 06:10:14,878
you're on the internet and you get a

8156
06:10:14,878 --> 06:10:16,958
billion connections every like it's

8157
06:10:16,958 --> 06:10:19,520
probably not the right tool um

8158
06:10:19,520 --> 06:10:20,558
but

8159
06:10:20,558 --> 06:10:22,798
i've seen a lot of deployments with you

8160
06:10:22,798 --> 06:10:26,080
know 100 200 300 000 servers

8161
06:10:26,080 --> 06:10:27,520
and it scales really well it's more

8162
06:10:27,520 --> 06:10:28,400
about

8163
06:10:28,400 --> 06:10:30,480
where you put the data after

8164
06:10:30,480 --> 06:10:32,878
but it lets you be very

8165
06:10:32,878 --> 06:10:34,638
precise about what you're collecting you

8166
06:10:34,638 --> 06:10:36,240
don't have to

8167
06:10:36,240 --> 06:10:37,920
grab everything and then decide what

8168
06:10:37,920 --> 06:10:40,160
you're gonna do with the data later

8169
06:10:40,160 --> 06:10:42,320
right you can decide uh

8170
06:10:42,320 --> 06:10:44,240
okay we have a new use case we need this

8171
06:10:44,240 --> 06:10:46,080
table we're going to collect that every

8172
06:10:46,080 --> 06:10:48,400
15 minutes every hour every week

8173
06:10:48,400 --> 06:10:49,840
and then start using it so it's not the

8174
06:10:49,840 --> 06:10:51,360
same type of uh

8175
06:10:51,360 --> 06:10:52,718
you know let's grab everything and

8176
06:10:52,718 --> 06:10:54,638
figure out what we want to do with it

8177
06:10:54,638 --> 06:10:56,480
later which can be very expensive i

8178
06:10:56,480 --> 06:10:57,440
guess

8179
06:10:57,440 --> 06:11:00,000
you know whoever sells a license based

8180
06:11:00,000 --> 06:11:02,000
on how much you can index or sells hard

8181
06:11:02,000 --> 06:11:04,400
drives loves that model but we don't

8182
06:11:04,400 --> 06:11:05,520
think that's the right model in most

8183
06:11:05,520 --> 06:11:06,798
cases especially if it's a big

8184
06:11:06,798 --> 06:11:08,718
environment

8185
06:11:08,718 --> 06:11:11,280
all right thanks

8186
06:11:12,160 --> 06:11:14,400
maya or eric i guess

8187
06:11:14,400 --> 06:11:16,080
what level of lugging do you think

8188
06:11:16,080 --> 06:11:19,920
should be in place for each level of

8189
06:11:19,920 --> 06:11:22,000
zero trust so i guess this references

8190
06:11:22,000 --> 06:11:23,250
risk based

8191
06:11:23,250 --> 06:11:25,120
[Music]

8192
06:11:25,120 --> 06:11:27,040
access

8193
06:11:27,040 --> 06:11:29,440
i mean

8194
06:11:29,600 --> 06:11:30,958
i don't know exactly where we put it but

8195
06:11:30,958 --> 06:11:32,798
like i think the a lot of what we were

8196
06:11:32,798 --> 06:11:35,120
trying to explain in the talk is that

8197
06:11:35,120 --> 06:11:38,160
this is so complicated and like logging

8198
06:11:38,160 --> 06:11:39,760
when you talk about logging is not one

8199
06:11:39,760 --> 06:11:42,080
thing right like device logging endpoint

8200
06:11:42,080 --> 06:11:44,480
you know um with like stuff like or you

8201
06:11:44,480 --> 06:11:45,840
know and you have stuff like osquery

8202
06:11:45,840 --> 06:11:48,240
which is kind of logging but kind of not

8203
06:11:48,240 --> 06:11:52,000
visibility is hard yeah yeah and um

8204
06:11:52,000 --> 06:11:53,600
yeah so i don't know if i have a great

8205
06:11:53,600 --> 06:11:55,600
answer of like what you should log i

8206
06:11:55,600 --> 06:11:56,320
mean

8207
06:11:56,320 --> 06:11:58,320
experience wise there's also this kind

8208
06:11:58,320 --> 06:11:59,440
of weird

8209
06:11:59,440 --> 06:12:01,360
interaction between like you need

8210
06:12:01,360 --> 06:12:03,120
different kinds of logs now right

8211
06:12:03,120 --> 06:12:05,760
because you're not just gonna have

8212
06:12:05,760 --> 06:12:07,040
all of your things on the corporate

8213
06:12:07,040 --> 06:12:08,638
infrastructure and you can do that right

8214
06:12:08,638 --> 06:12:10,558
where you can you know say oh yeah

8215
06:12:10,558 --> 06:12:12,320
here's all the ips that came in and out

8216
06:12:12,320 --> 06:12:13,120
so

8217
06:12:13,120 --> 06:12:14,638
i would say that logging is just like

8218
06:12:14,638 --> 06:12:15,920
another one of these wonderful

8219
06:12:15,920 --> 06:12:19,040
challenges that you'll experience

8220
06:12:19,040 --> 06:12:20,958
and is not really a good answer i mean

8221
06:12:20,958 --> 06:12:23,520
log everything i think that's the answer

8222
06:12:23,520 --> 06:12:25,360
i mean is it a

8223
06:12:25,360 --> 06:12:26,958
caspian is there an incision response

8224
06:12:26,958 --> 06:12:31,199
where you you had too many lugs like

8225
06:12:31,680 --> 06:12:34,000
yes yeah absolutely and and the thing is

8226
06:12:34,000 --> 06:12:34,718
like

8227
06:12:34,718 --> 06:12:36,878
i will always say log everything like it

8228
06:12:36,878 --> 06:12:38,638
is

8229
06:12:38,638 --> 06:12:40,160
we have too many logs sometimes that

8230
06:12:40,160 --> 06:12:42,320
takes us a little bit of time there are

8231
06:12:42,320 --> 06:12:44,480
really good data engineering tools

8232
06:12:44,480 --> 06:12:45,760
they're really good databases for this

8233
06:12:45,760 --> 06:12:47,120
stuff so if you've got the right tooling

8234
06:12:47,120 --> 06:12:48,878
in place it's not a problem

8235
06:12:48,878 --> 06:12:50,798
uh i have been in places where you know

8236
06:12:50,798 --> 06:12:53,280
i keep making this joke about grep like

8237
06:12:53,280 --> 06:12:56,240
it i've done it it sucks uh and it takes

8238
06:12:56,240 --> 06:12:58,160
a long time but

8239
06:12:58,160 --> 06:12:59,200
i

8240
06:12:59,200 --> 06:13:00,638
too many logs operationally has a

8241
06:13:00,638 --> 06:13:02,000
problem too many logs in terms of an

8242
06:13:02,000 --> 06:13:03,760
investigation never is there's there's

8243
06:13:03,760 --> 06:13:04,958
there's no such thing as too much

8244
06:13:04,958 --> 06:13:06,798
evidence

8245
06:13:06,798 --> 06:13:10,080
grip is the best tool ever

8246
06:13:10,080 --> 06:13:12,798
i also say too like

8247
06:13:12,798 --> 06:13:14,080
logging

8248
06:13:14,080 --> 06:13:14,798
like

8249
06:13:14,798 --> 06:13:16,958
on traffic on the network

8250
06:13:16,958 --> 06:13:17,680
is

8251
06:13:17,680 --> 06:13:19,040
maybe a little less interesting than

8252
06:13:19,040 --> 06:13:21,680
like i have an application proxy and it

8253
06:13:21,680 --> 06:13:23,600
knows exactly who is connecting and what

8254
06:13:23,600 --> 06:13:25,920
device they're coming from and

8255
06:13:25,920 --> 06:13:27,680
so you know i don't think it's a matter

8256
06:13:27,680 --> 06:13:29,360
of like more logging or less logging

8257
06:13:29,360 --> 06:13:30,718
it's like sometimes you just get better

8258
06:13:30,718 --> 06:13:31,920
quality logs out of these kind of

8259
06:13:31,920 --> 06:13:33,600
solutions too i will add on to that i

8260
06:13:33,600 --> 06:13:34,718
feel like a lot of people have built

8261
06:13:34,718 --> 06:13:37,120
these like proxies or load balancer

8262
06:13:37,120 --> 06:13:38,638
proxies whatever they happen to be and

8263
06:13:38,638 --> 06:13:40,400
they're like wow now that all my traffic

8264
06:13:40,400 --> 06:13:41,600
goes through here i'm gonna do all kinds

8265
06:13:41,600 --> 06:13:43,520
of other stuff to it too you're like

8266
06:13:43,520 --> 06:13:45,520
that's not that wasn't the point like

8267
06:13:45,520 --> 06:13:47,520
you can solve that problem in other ways

8268
06:13:47,520 --> 06:13:49,440
it's harder but that's not you you

8269
06:13:49,440 --> 06:13:50,718
solved a problem in the same way because

8270
06:13:50,718 --> 06:13:52,080
you already had somewhere to put the

8271
06:13:52,080 --> 06:13:53,200
logging

8272
06:13:53,200 --> 06:13:54,400
um

8273
06:13:54,400 --> 06:13:55,280
i mean if

8274
06:13:55,280 --> 06:13:56,558
you what you really need at the end of

8275
06:13:56,558 --> 06:13:57,440
the day is going to be some sort of

8276
06:13:57,440 --> 06:13:59,280
audit log of like this user accessed

8277
06:13:59,280 --> 06:14:00,798
this application at this time and did

8278
06:14:00,798 --> 06:14:02,080
these things

8279
06:14:02,080 --> 06:14:04,400
and there's lots of ways to do that uh

8280
06:14:04,400 --> 06:14:06,958
it happens to be easy with a proxy

8281
06:14:06,958 --> 06:14:10,239
but there's lots of ways to do that

8282
06:14:11,040 --> 06:14:12,718
um for yuri

8283
06:14:12,718 --> 06:14:13,920
have you found that a lot of

8284
06:14:13,920 --> 06:14:16,320
non-malicious javascript is obfuscated

8285
06:14:16,320 --> 06:14:19,760
to for uh intellectual property reasons

8286
06:14:19,760 --> 06:14:21,440
so

8287
06:14:21,440 --> 06:14:23,520
do you do you have like

8288
06:14:23,520 --> 06:14:26,080
numbers or something

8289
06:14:26,080 --> 06:14:28,080
you you said it's a valid use case but

8290
06:14:28,080 --> 06:14:30,878
how how widespread is it do you know

8291
06:14:30,878 --> 06:14:33,280
you mean the the intellectual property

8292
06:14:33,280 --> 06:14:34,958
thing

8293
06:14:34,958 --> 06:14:37,760
um so i think in one of the papers the

8294
06:14:37,760 --> 06:14:39,440
w19

8295
06:14:39,440 --> 06:14:43,520
they really did a deep analysis of of uh

8296
06:14:43,520 --> 06:14:46,000
of the distributions of javascript in

8297
06:14:46,000 --> 06:14:49,200
terms of what happened there

8298
06:14:49,200 --> 06:14:52,240
for our data in imperva as i mentioned

8299
06:14:52,240 --> 06:14:54,958
it wasn't really feasible to

8300
06:14:54,958 --> 06:14:56,080
take it

8301
06:14:56,080 --> 06:14:58,080
manually so we

8302
06:14:58,080 --> 06:14:59,600
used some

8303
06:14:59,600 --> 06:15:02,240
some heuristics just for just to test

8304
06:15:02,240 --> 06:15:04,400
the model but it's not it's not

8305
06:15:04,400 --> 06:15:05,760
something that we can you know

8306
06:15:05,760 --> 06:15:07,760
accomplish in any way if we have just an

8307
06:15:07,760 --> 06:15:11,680
example like uh almost half a half of

8308
06:15:11,680 --> 06:15:15,280
a hundred thousand scripts as a test set

8309
06:15:15,280 --> 06:15:18,798
uh i have no way to take security

8310
06:15:18,798 --> 06:15:21,040
research i mean we have many but i can't

8311
06:15:21,040 --> 06:15:22,958
really ask them to tag to target and to

8312
06:15:22,958 --> 06:15:25,920
say which one are by chance you know

8313
06:15:25,920 --> 06:15:28,638
intellectual property so

8314
06:15:28,638 --> 06:15:31,680
obfuscation type yeah you would have to

8315
06:15:31,680 --> 06:15:33,280
reverse them and then

8316
06:15:33,280 --> 06:15:35,520
steal their intellectual property or

8317
06:15:35,520 --> 06:15:38,160
something like that

8318
06:15:38,480 --> 06:15:41,280
about machine learning in security we

8319
06:15:41,280 --> 06:15:42,718
have a comment here it seems that

8320
06:15:42,718 --> 06:15:44,558
everyone wants to use machine learning

8321
06:15:44,558 --> 06:15:47,200
for stuff like id system security

8322
06:15:47,200 --> 06:15:50,240
is it worth it or can can it be just a

8323
06:15:50,240 --> 06:15:52,000
waste instead of borrowing things like

8324
06:15:52,000 --> 06:15:54,638
good logs so i'm gonna rephrase it where

8325
06:15:54,638 --> 06:15:56,480
do you think uh

8326
06:15:56,480 --> 06:16:00,878
machine learning fits into security uh

8327
06:16:00,878 --> 06:16:02,240
as a whole

8328
06:16:02,240 --> 06:16:05,200
as an industry as a as a part of uh

8329
06:16:05,200 --> 06:16:06,558
doing business

8330
06:16:06,558 --> 06:16:09,200
yeah it's a good question so so

8331
06:16:09,200 --> 06:16:12,320
generally if you ask data scientists

8332
06:16:12,320 --> 06:16:14,638
is machine learning good for something

8333
06:16:14,638 --> 06:16:16,480
he will tell that most probably yeah it

8334
06:16:16,480 --> 06:16:17,920
is it's very good

8335
06:16:17,920 --> 06:16:19,360
um so

8336
06:16:19,360 --> 06:16:21,680
so i think there are many applications

8337
06:16:21,680 --> 06:16:24,160
for machine learning today as as you

8338
06:16:24,160 --> 06:16:26,080
know the algorithms become more more

8339
06:16:26,080 --> 06:16:27,920
sophisticated and more and more

8340
06:16:27,920 --> 06:16:29,680
libraries you can just download and

8341
06:16:29,680 --> 06:16:32,160
easily use and then you don't really

8342
06:16:32,160 --> 06:16:33,760
need to understand the inner working of

8343
06:16:33,760 --> 06:16:36,000
the models

8344
06:16:36,000 --> 06:16:39,440
so but indeed there are cases where uh

8345
06:16:39,440 --> 06:16:41,360
you don't you you cannot use machine

8346
06:16:41,360 --> 06:16:43,360
learning let's maybe talk about this

8347
06:16:43,360 --> 06:16:45,760
negative and a negative example so when

8348
06:16:45,760 --> 06:16:47,360
when can't we use

8349
06:16:47,360 --> 06:16:49,760
so there are some cases that we don't

8350
06:16:49,760 --> 06:16:51,440
have enough data

8351
06:16:51,440 --> 06:16:52,958
and there are

8352
06:16:52,958 --> 06:16:55,920
cases where the data is too dirty so you

8353
06:16:55,920 --> 06:16:58,718
need to make uh you know to

8354
06:16:58,718 --> 06:17:00,878
it always starts with the data when we

8355
06:17:00,878 --> 06:17:03,200
look on the data we can see if it has to

8356
06:17:03,200 --> 06:17:05,600
be cleaned if we have enough of it if we

8357
06:17:05,600 --> 06:17:08,080
have a very unbalanced data set

8358
06:17:08,080 --> 06:17:10,718
so these are maybe like the corner cases

8359
06:17:10,718 --> 06:17:12,240
where uh

8360
06:17:12,240 --> 06:17:14,400
if you just take an out-of-the-box

8361
06:17:14,400 --> 06:17:16,718
algorithm and apply it on on on such

8362
06:17:16,718 --> 06:17:17,840
data

8363
06:17:17,840 --> 06:17:18,558
you

8364
06:17:18,558 --> 06:17:21,600
may be come up with something strange

8365
06:17:21,600 --> 06:17:23,440
so there is no

8366
06:17:23,440 --> 06:17:25,520
you cannot really replace uh this

8367
06:17:25,520 --> 06:17:28,320
pipeline of of gathering the data and

8368
06:17:28,320 --> 06:17:30,798
and a good amount of it if if you want

8369
06:17:30,798 --> 06:17:32,718
to solve like anomaly detection and you

8370
06:17:32,718 --> 06:17:35,200
have 10 examples then you know you don't

8371
06:17:35,200 --> 06:17:37,600
have to use machine learning so that's i

8372
06:17:37,600 --> 06:17:40,958
think my take on this as a rule of thumb

8373
06:17:40,958 --> 06:17:42,798
i'll add on to that because i think the

8374
06:17:42,798 --> 06:17:44,160
we talked a little bit like risk-based

8375
06:17:44,160 --> 06:17:46,000
access i think people like oh yeah you

8376
06:17:46,000 --> 06:17:47,680
can just decide whether or not someone

8377
06:17:47,680 --> 06:17:48,958
can have access this application and

8378
06:17:48,958 --> 06:17:51,280
just use sprinkle some ml on top and

8379
06:17:51,280 --> 06:17:52,080
like

8380
06:17:52,080 --> 06:17:53,040
it's exactly what you're saying though

8381
06:17:53,040 --> 06:17:54,638
like anomaly detection is a great

8382
06:17:54,638 --> 06:17:56,480
example that's actually kind of bad for

8383
06:17:56,480 --> 06:17:58,718
machine learning right like if machine

8384
06:17:58,718 --> 06:18:00,000
learn is learning is good at a couple

8385
06:18:00,000 --> 06:18:01,120
things one of the things that's really

8386
06:18:01,120 --> 06:18:02,400
good at is sorting things into two

8387
06:18:02,400 --> 06:18:06,480
categories a and b um that works well if

8388
06:18:06,480 --> 06:18:09,040
a and b both have lots of data if you

8389
06:18:09,040 --> 06:18:10,718
only have 10 examples of attrition

8390
06:18:10,718 --> 06:18:12,240
attempts to your system like you just

8391
06:18:12,240 --> 06:18:14,320
can't train a model on that right it's

8392
06:18:14,320 --> 06:18:15,920
not possible and so something like

8393
06:18:15,920 --> 06:18:17,600
risk-based access you don't want to put

8394
06:18:17,600 --> 06:18:19,520
that in front of a user who's going to

8395
06:18:19,520 --> 06:18:21,200
like get even more upset if they can't

8396
06:18:21,200 --> 06:18:23,200
access their email or do their job or

8397
06:18:23,200 --> 06:18:25,040
whatever it happens to be like

8398
06:18:25,040 --> 06:18:26,000
sometimes

8399
06:18:26,000 --> 06:18:27,360
you can do some of that stuff after the

8400
06:18:27,360 --> 06:18:29,360
fact to like look at logs but even then

8401
06:18:29,360 --> 06:18:31,520
like you don't have enough data to train

8402
06:18:31,520 --> 06:18:34,320
a model there's just nothing to go on

8403
06:18:34,320 --> 06:18:36,878
yeah i think this thinking comes from

8404
06:18:36,878 --> 06:18:38,558
the fact that a lot of security people

8405
06:18:38,558 --> 06:18:40,558
have very little experience in machine

8406
06:18:40,558 --> 06:18:41,840
learning and

8407
06:18:41,840 --> 06:18:42,798
they

8408
06:18:42,798 --> 06:18:45,040
they either go the site of

8409
06:18:45,040 --> 06:18:47,760
ml can't do anything or ml can't solve

8410
06:18:47,760 --> 06:18:50,240
everything and it's a

8411
06:18:50,240 --> 06:18:52,160
we need to talk more to data scientists

8412
06:18:52,160 --> 06:18:54,400
about the about this stuff so

8413
06:18:54,400 --> 06:18:57,200
so so so we can know that ml can do this

8414
06:18:57,200 --> 06:18:59,040
but it can't do that

8415
06:18:59,040 --> 06:19:01,280
and just trying to maintain

8416
06:19:01,280 --> 06:19:03,280
even getting your signals to fire in a

8417
06:19:03,280 --> 06:19:06,160
big system like i talked about the

8418
06:19:06,160 --> 06:19:08,478
the quality of you know stuff you get

8419
06:19:08,478 --> 06:19:10,240
from an operating system

8420
06:19:10,240 --> 06:19:11,760
even just

8421
06:19:11,760 --> 06:19:13,760
ensuring you're like like i do a lot of

8422
06:19:13,760 --> 06:19:14,878
development where you have like nice

8423
06:19:14,878 --> 06:19:16,958
hermetic tests and you can say like you

8424
06:19:16,958 --> 06:19:18,638
know does this run if i run it against

8425
06:19:18,638 --> 06:19:21,280
this other system like a big

8426
06:19:21,280 --> 06:19:23,360
corporate infrastructure you're not

8427
06:19:23,360 --> 06:19:25,120
really going to have those intent tests

8428
06:19:25,120 --> 06:19:27,520
very often and you know signals rot

8429
06:19:27,520 --> 06:19:29,920
pretty quickly so even just

8430
06:19:29,920 --> 06:19:31,600
getting signals to fire that's like

8431
06:19:31,600 --> 06:19:33,760
before you even can take that structured

8432
06:19:33,760 --> 06:19:35,280
data and do machine learning on it

8433
06:19:35,280 --> 06:19:37,200
that's already a hard enough problem

8434
06:19:37,200 --> 06:19:38,638
right

8435
06:19:38,638 --> 06:19:40,718
but i still think that we don't need to

8436
06:19:40,718 --> 06:19:42,320
discourage people from from doing

8437
06:19:42,320 --> 06:19:44,558
machine learning i think that it's a

8438
06:19:44,558 --> 06:19:46,798
on the contrary so um i encourage

8439
06:19:46,798 --> 06:19:49,440
everyone to you know download some some

8440
06:19:49,440 --> 06:19:52,240
libraries to to be uh proficient with

8441
06:19:52,240 --> 06:19:54,400
pandas and scikit-learn and stuff like

8442
06:19:54,400 --> 06:19:56,878
that and you can see many many examples

8443
06:19:56,878 --> 06:19:59,040
when you can do really cool things

8444
06:19:59,040 --> 06:20:01,360
pretty easily and i think that will help

8445
06:20:01,360 --> 06:20:02,958
you to understand

8446
06:20:02,958 --> 06:20:05,280
what machine learning is good at and

8447
06:20:05,280 --> 06:20:08,080
what not really and it's much better

8448
06:20:08,080 --> 06:20:10,478
than you know just like using buzzwords

8449
06:20:10,478 --> 06:20:13,360
as as maya said just sprinkling them

8450
06:20:13,360 --> 06:20:14,400
yeah

8451
06:20:14,400 --> 06:20:16,400
that's a great advice even though

8452
06:20:16,400 --> 06:20:18,160
it's spooky i don't want to pip install

8453
06:20:18,160 --> 06:20:20,718
so i get learned

8454
06:20:20,718 --> 06:20:22,000
you just have to wait a little bit right

8455
06:20:22,000 --> 06:20:23,840
for everything yeah yeah yeah it's it's

8456
06:20:23,840 --> 06:20:26,478
kind of a big package um

8457
06:20:26,478 --> 06:20:28,878
all right probably last question maybe

8458
06:20:28,878 --> 06:20:31,600
another one after that um

8459
06:20:31,600 --> 06:20:34,558
i i need to ask because i saw on the on

8460
06:20:34,558 --> 06:20:36,558
on twitter uh two weeks ago

8461
06:20:36,558 --> 06:20:37,520
uh

8462
06:20:37,520 --> 06:20:40,400
interview questions for a suck analyst

8463
06:20:40,400 --> 06:20:41,440
role

8464
06:20:41,440 --> 06:20:45,760
and the interview questions were like uh

8465
06:20:45,760 --> 06:20:48,400
you see on the windows even log event id

8466
06:20:48,400 --> 06:20:50,638
46 24.

8467
06:20:50,638 --> 06:20:51,840
what do you do

8468
06:20:51,840 --> 06:20:54,320
what what does this indicate or you see

8469
06:20:54,320 --> 06:20:58,240
error code windows 11701

8470
06:20:58,240 --> 06:21:01,040
what is it and i thought

8471
06:21:01,040 --> 06:21:02,558
this was really nice you didn't know

8472
06:21:02,558 --> 06:21:04,878
what these things mean oh come on

8473
06:21:04,878 --> 06:21:06,878
yeah i've been i've been working two

8474
06:21:06,878 --> 06:21:08,958
years in a second i would google these

8475
06:21:08,958 --> 06:21:11,280
questions i actually if someone asked

8476
06:21:11,280 --> 06:21:13,440
asked me this in an interview for this

8477
06:21:13,440 --> 06:21:16,320
role i would probably walk away from the

8478
06:21:16,320 --> 06:21:18,478
interview so so i have actually asked

8479
06:21:18,478 --> 06:21:19,920
that in interviews but it's usually

8480
06:21:19,920 --> 06:21:21,520
what's your favorite event code not you

8481
06:21:21,520 --> 06:21:22,558
know you see this and then what do you

8482
06:21:22,558 --> 06:21:23,840
do because

8483
06:21:23,840 --> 06:21:25,920
it's not fun to put people on the spot

8484
06:21:25,920 --> 06:21:26,958
and

8485
06:21:26,958 --> 06:21:28,478
i think i didn't mention it was for a

8486
06:21:28,478 --> 06:21:30,840
junior analyst role

8487
06:21:30,840 --> 06:21:36,558
so so yeah so my question would be uh

8488
06:21:36,558 --> 06:21:39,200
four four blue team roles uh what would

8489
06:21:39,200 --> 06:21:42,478
be or analysis role or ir roles stuff

8490
06:21:42,478 --> 06:21:44,240
that requires uh

8491
06:21:44,240 --> 06:21:46,638
analysis and a deep technical knowledge

8492
06:21:46,638 --> 06:21:48,320
sometimes uh

8493
06:21:48,320 --> 06:21:49,920
what would be your your

8494
06:21:49,920 --> 06:21:50,718
your

8495
06:21:50,718 --> 06:21:53,760
good interview questions

8496
06:21:53,760 --> 06:21:56,798
i love that you're all looking at me now

8497
06:21:56,798 --> 06:21:58,798
what's your favorite event code

8498
06:21:58,798 --> 06:22:03,360
uh 4624 really honestly it's yeah um

8499
06:22:03,360 --> 06:22:04,878
i'm going to stall and give you all some

8500
06:22:04,878 --> 06:22:06,558
time so a couple things that are bad

8501
06:22:06,558 --> 06:22:08,320
with that interview question is a test

8502
06:22:08,320 --> 06:22:10,240
specific knowledge that someone has to

8503
06:22:10,240 --> 06:22:13,040
already know which is um it

8504
06:22:13,040 --> 06:22:14,558
doesn't show that the employer is like

8505
06:22:14,558 --> 06:22:16,000
willing to train you on the job or like

8506
06:22:16,000 --> 06:22:17,520
help you learn anything again which is

8507
06:22:17,520 --> 06:22:18,638


8508
06:22:18,638 --> 06:22:20,718
um and like the only like we we

8509
06:22:20,718 --> 06:22:22,080
literally went to trivia i don't know

8510
06:22:22,080 --> 06:22:23,520
two weeks ago and one of the trivia

8511
06:22:23,520 --> 06:22:25,280
categories this is the eff trivia so

8512
06:22:25,280 --> 06:22:26,958
like take that with a great assault one

8513
06:22:26,958 --> 06:22:29,120
of the categories was like cli commands

8514
06:22:29,120 --> 06:22:31,360
for deprecated systems

8515
06:22:31,360 --> 06:22:32,878
and like i think our team got every

8516
06:22:32,878 --> 06:22:34,718
question but that was embarrassing and i

8517
06:22:34,718 --> 06:22:36,638
contributed nothing to that absolutely

8518
06:22:36,638 --> 06:22:38,718
nothing to that anyway so i stalled now

8519
06:22:38,718 --> 06:22:42,520
you have some interview questions

8520
06:22:43,920 --> 06:22:45,440
to me it's more about the process that

8521
06:22:45,440 --> 06:22:47,520
someone's going to follow to

8522
06:22:47,520 --> 06:22:50,240
get more information right so okay so

8523
06:22:50,240 --> 06:22:51,920
what would you do if you saw that like

8524
06:22:51,920 --> 06:22:53,760
even if you told me well i'm going to

8525
06:22:53,760 --> 06:22:55,680
google the event codes because obviously

8526
06:22:55,680 --> 06:22:57,600
that's what someone's going to do

8527
06:22:57,600 --> 06:23:00,160
that's a that's a good answer but then

8528
06:23:00,160 --> 06:23:01,520
maybe i'll tell you what the event code

8529
06:23:01,520 --> 06:23:03,360
means where are you going to find more

8530
06:23:03,360 --> 06:23:06,320
information about that

8531
06:23:06,320 --> 06:23:08,080
and then i feel like even

8532
06:23:08,080 --> 06:23:10,240
questions around networking sometimes

8533
06:23:10,240 --> 06:23:12,160
can be useful just to know if if someone

8534
06:23:12,160 --> 06:23:14,320
has like a decent understanding of how

8535
06:23:14,320 --> 06:23:15,520
networks

8536
06:23:15,520 --> 06:23:17,920
work and it doesn't have to be like oh

8537
06:23:17,920 --> 06:23:19,920
calculate the subnet of whatever you've

8538
06:23:19,920 --> 06:23:22,958
got three seconds that doesn't really

8539
06:23:22,958 --> 06:23:23,600
an matter

8540
06:23:23,600 --> 06:23:25,920
an iep packet what's the checksum yeah

8541
06:23:25,920 --> 06:23:28,798
exactly uh but it's more about just like

8542
06:23:28,798 --> 06:23:30,798
the basics and then you're you're

8543
06:23:30,798 --> 06:23:32,558
curious and your process for getting

8544
06:23:32,558 --> 06:23:35,200
down to uh finding it is is good like

8545
06:23:35,200 --> 06:23:37,280
troubleshooting is the same thing right

8546
06:23:37,280 --> 06:23:38,718
like if you just want to troubleshoot

8547
06:23:38,718 --> 06:23:40,798
something you need to eliminate

8548
06:23:40,798 --> 06:23:42,958
uh theories until you get to

8549
06:23:42,958 --> 06:23:44,878
what's the thing that's broken and when

8550
06:23:44,878 --> 06:23:46,638
you're investigating it's uh it's pretty

8551
06:23:46,638 --> 06:23:48,478
similar so to me i'd rather hire someone

8552
06:23:48,478 --> 06:23:49,200
with

8553
06:23:49,200 --> 06:23:51,200
less experience that seems to know how

8554
06:23:51,200 --> 06:23:53,760
to look for things and come up with

8555
06:23:53,760 --> 06:23:55,520
theories and look at that than someone

8556
06:23:55,520 --> 06:23:58,558
who can recite uh windows event ids uh

8557
06:23:58,558 --> 06:24:00,878
by heart right so let's just say that

8558
06:24:00,878 --> 06:24:02,878
that's right you know what i actually

8559
06:24:02,878 --> 06:24:04,958
think so yeah i agree completely with

8560
06:24:04,958 --> 06:24:06,558
this because

8561
06:24:06,558 --> 06:24:08,000
typically if i'm doing this if i'm

8562
06:24:08,000 --> 06:24:10,478
running the ir team or the sock i'm not

8563
06:24:10,478 --> 06:24:12,558
going to be looking for somebody who is

8564
06:24:12,558 --> 06:24:14,160
going to be able to calculate packets

8565
06:24:14,160 --> 06:24:16,320
like this is what google is for right

8566
06:24:16,320 --> 06:24:17,120
you know

8567
06:24:17,120 --> 06:24:19,360
skill testing questions are nice

8568
06:24:19,360 --> 06:24:21,360
process is more interesting so don't you

8569
06:24:21,360 --> 06:24:23,120
know don't be able to answer things by

8570
06:24:23,120 --> 06:24:25,920
heart but understand how you're working

8571
06:24:25,920 --> 06:24:28,000
i also say as when we do a lot of

8572
06:24:28,000 --> 06:24:30,320
interviews for my employer like

8573
06:24:30,320 --> 06:24:33,200
we this this sounds like advice that

8574
06:24:33,200 --> 06:24:34,400
you'd be giving to like somebody who's

8575
06:24:34,400 --> 06:24:36,798
newer but like we've read your resume

8576
06:24:36,798 --> 06:24:39,120
like we know about what level you're

8577
06:24:39,120 --> 06:24:40,958
supposed to be we've assigned someone to

8578
06:24:40,958 --> 06:24:42,798
you who like knows a little bit about

8579
06:24:42,798 --> 06:24:44,160
that domain so they're like there to

8580
06:24:44,160 --> 06:24:46,080
have a conversation with you so i think

8581
06:24:46,080 --> 06:24:48,160
the the biggest advice for that is just

8582
06:24:48,160 --> 06:24:49,920
like if you put something on your resume

8583
06:24:49,920 --> 06:24:52,160
please be ready to talk about it because

8584
06:24:52,160 --> 06:24:54,638
weirdly that's like how we determine how

8585
06:24:54,638 --> 06:24:55,840
we're going to have a conversation with

8586
06:24:55,840 --> 06:24:57,120
you to figure out all these things of

8587
06:24:57,120 --> 06:24:58,638
like you know okay here's what you know

8588
06:24:58,638 --> 06:25:00,638
but like you know are you interested in

8589
06:25:00,638 --> 06:25:02,160
this or you know are you clever if like

8590
06:25:02,160 --> 06:25:03,280
we give you these two pieces of

8591
06:25:03,280 --> 06:25:04,718
information and you know something about

8592
06:25:04,718 --> 06:25:06,558
this domain like you know can you put

8593
06:25:06,558 --> 06:25:08,798
that together and yeah

8594
06:25:08,798 --> 06:25:11,280
in one of my first interview for an

8595
06:25:11,280 --> 06:25:13,820
internship when i was in university i uh

8596
06:25:13,820 --> 06:25:15,360
[Music]

8597
06:25:15,360 --> 06:25:17,200
someone asked me about a personal

8598
06:25:17,200 --> 06:25:18,958
project i put on my resume and i was

8599
06:25:18,958 --> 06:25:22,000
like pikachu face surprise

8600
06:25:22,000 --> 06:25:24,558
and uh well i was glad someone i was

8601
06:25:24,558 --> 06:25:25,840
ready to talk about it but i didn't

8602
06:25:25,840 --> 06:25:28,718
expect someone to uh to uh to ask

8603
06:25:28,718 --> 06:25:30,878
questions about about

8604
06:25:30,878 --> 06:25:33,120
all the aspects of my resume but it

8605
06:25:33,120 --> 06:25:34,958
makes sense once you're uh

8606
06:25:34,958 --> 06:25:37,040
you're

8607
06:25:37,040 --> 06:25:39,520
you're used to interviews

8608
06:25:39,520 --> 06:25:41,600
so uh this is all the time that we have

8609
06:25:41,600 --> 06:25:44,160
so thanks everyone for the great q a

8610
06:25:44,160 --> 06:25:46,160
session

8611
06:25:46,160 --> 06:25:48,090
and we'll see you tomorrow

8612
06:25:48,090 --> 06:25:55,599
[Applause]

8613
06:26:01,920 --> 06:26:04,000
you
