1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
Transformer that's already efficient we

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,799
just get rid of all the one by one steps

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,379
but unfortunately we lose position of

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,720
the word when you pass one word at the

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,580
time you could say first word second

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,259
word third word fourth board if you pass

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,260
everything you can do that right so what

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,480
Transformers brought to the conversation

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,000
was positional encoding where you can

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,699
have the embeddings of the words add the

11
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,680
concept of where they're actually uh

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,619
need to be and that becomes a position

13
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:31,260
aware encoding for example something

14
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,780
simple just get the word get the

15
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,460
numerical value of the word understand

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,200
the semantics of the word understand

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,239
where is position and that's what we

18
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,480
call position aware employee something

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,879
that I did not know what that even was

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,620
and maybe there is of course more

21
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,480
context to this but

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,160
I don't want to have a headache going

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,020
through all these things self-attention

24
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,300
just the basic concept of attention is

25
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,980
that when you have a sequence of words

26
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,379
you can actually understand how one word

27
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,600
can be related to the rest and how

28
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,219
strong their relationship is with

29
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,339
certain words that's the concept and

30
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,439
Transformers actually do that on their

31
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,520
own

32
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,740
this is another example where if when

33
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,960
you translate English to French by the

34
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,420
way don't ask me to say the French word

35
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,880
here because I'm not that good at it but

36
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,500
you can see how in the in the two

37
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,439
English sentences the word it

38
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,200
in the first one meant animal or refers

39
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,119
to the animal and the second one refers

40
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,700
to the street found a mistaken yeah

41
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,340
yep so you can see how the encode the

42
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,640
this model allows us to understand the

43
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,159
relationship with other words and

44
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,159
without needing to have all this one by

45
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,619
one you know processing and large amount

46
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,000
of memory it actually could understand

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,439
this this

48
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,740
so Transformers now are becoming a thing

49
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,140
not just for text it was built once

50
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,240
again for translation but now the

51
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,799
architecture and the concepts are being

52
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,960
used by more than just text so it's

53
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,299
becoming this cross model General

54
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,159
architecture

55
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,500
so when it comes to text we can talk

56
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,719
about large language models now in a

57
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,818
large language model is a neural network

58
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:12,300
that for example could use a Transformer

59
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,480
architecture

60
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,400
process large amounts of data and be

61
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,520
able to produce parameters and those

62
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,140
parameters are the ones that would help

63
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,300
us then to understand for example

64
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,580
statistical relationships in a language

65
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,060
and this would be at scale right with a

66
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,760
lot of information

67
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,040
so one interesting part in here that

68
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,440
we're missing is wait a minute but so

69
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,000
far you're talking about training

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,800
something but you were talking about

71
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,260
that you need to somehow know the actual

72
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,720
Target value so when you predict

73
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,160
something you can tell it where it was

74
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,800
wrong when we talk about large amount of

75
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,980
data you cannot just do that because you

76
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,900
cannot label every single thing that is

77
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,640
out there in the internet right so

78
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,040
there's this concept of self-supervised

79
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,500
learning that allows the model to

80
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,239
actually learn based on the information

81
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,120
that is processing as an input but at

82
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,580
the same time it's actually for example

83
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,879
trying to predict a word after a

84
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,040
sentence is trying to mask a few words

85
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,540
and that's how we started learning on

86
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,080
its own for example so

87
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,959
now when we talk about training free

88
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:23,700
training it's very important to

89
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,819
understand as well you can have a model

90
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:29,760
that would go through a lot of data a

91
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,860
lot of money a lot of computation a lot

92
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,280
of so many days months and you will get

93
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,379
from a large language model perspective

94
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,239
you will get a pre-trained model

95
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,959
something that is just there has a lot

96
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,360
of knowledge of the language but you

97
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,940
will have to actually tweak it fine tune

98
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,420
it in order to be on a specific

99
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,480
um uh to be useful for a specific or a

100
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,760
special action for example you can still

101
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,920
use it for certain things that I'm going

102
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,420
to show you in a little bit but if you

103
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,459
want to be very specialized and maybe

104
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,500
reduce the amount of errors that this

105
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,840
base model pre-train model now can have

106
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,120
you have to fine tune it and that's what

107
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,780
we mean with pre-train and fine tune

108
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,819
so think about this for a second

109
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,820
base large language models like for

110
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,839
example GPT 3 and 3.5 when you tell it

111
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,419
to predict the next word it would do it

112
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,639
for you but if you actually ask it

113
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,800
something directly it will get a little

114
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,060
confused it'll be like wait you're

115
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,220
asking me for similar

116
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,960
um questions I can do that I can just

117
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,300
provide similar you will have to

118
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,639
fine-tune that in order to be able to

119
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,280
hold that type of conversation so there

120
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,919
is a concept of instruction tune llm or

121
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,139
large language model that it's a

122
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,680
pre-trained model that you can actually

123
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,479
fine-tune in order to interact with you

124
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:54,360
as if it was actually a conversation and

125
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,100
you know understanding instructions

126
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,840
right

127
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,400
so GPT models now that we understand

128
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,840
some of this

129
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,780
are a

130
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,800
generative pre-trained Transformer model

131
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,720
so I hope that that's clear now what GPT

132
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,759
is so rather than telling you what it is

133
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,680
in the first slide I hope that the

134
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,000
explanation kind of helped a little bit

135
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and the concept here is that this model

136
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,400
was was trained to predict the next word

137
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,500
went through processing a lot amount of

138
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,660
data and then the interesting part in

139
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,780
here of course is Transformer base but

140
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,060
it's the the concepts in here now I hope

141
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,280
that they make more sense it's 175

142
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,400
billion parameters

143
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,039
96 hidden layers so layers of neurons

144
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,560
and it was trained on apparently 500

145
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,960
billion words or tokens is what I was

146
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,600
also reading this type of model is what

147
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,520
we also called a foundational model

148
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,919
because it's a model that now you can

149
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,620
use you can adapt that model and you can

150
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,720
perform other tasks or you can fine tune

151
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,280
it as I mentioned before

152
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,259
and the concept of foundation or general

153
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:01,620
models means that before we had all this

154
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,900
knowledge about language there were

155
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,759
specific models that were being created

156
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,520
for one specific task you would collect

157
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,759
label data not large amount of data but

158
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,259
you will collect enough data you will

159
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:14,880
build the model you will try to solve

160
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,580
the problem let's solve fishing let's

161
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,800
solve ransomware so you build specific

162
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,500
models for each specific task a

163
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,560
foundation model because it has this

164
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,600
knowledge foundational knowledge it

165
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,060
could actually be super useful to then

166
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,180
be able to be fine-tuned with some small

167
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,400
amount of data as I showed before and

168
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,319
then be able to even achieve better

169
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:41,280
results than a regular task model

170
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,680
if it doesn't make sense

171
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,979
let's talk about my dog's TV so Stevie

172
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:49,860
using mid-journey now it becomes that

173
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,500
the cartoon so think about Stevie my dog

174
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,539
is a foundation model because my dog

175
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,419
actually knows it could be adapted it

176
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:59,699
has enough knowledge as a dog of the

177
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,860
things that he could do sit come stay

178
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,900
right all the stuff but if I wanted to

179
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,280
be a special specific task I need to

180
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,639
fine-tune Stevie and if I wanted to be a

181
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,979
rescue dog it's not as easy as say come

182
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:16,860
sit right stay right it has to go

183
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,919
through a really more than just trying

184
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,360
to

185
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,639
say a word and then expect the dog to do

186
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,960
something right so that that's the

187
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,240
concept of foundation models that so you

188
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,280
can talk about it if somebody wants this

189
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,099
to be explained in uh in other terms

190
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:34,740
now these models as I mentioned before

191
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,919
because they do have enough foundational

192
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,220
foundational knowledge you can adapt him

193
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,400
to do things such as tell me based on

194
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,479
your knowledge

195
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:48,060
a poem write something for me you can

196
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,819
adapt it without fine-tune it and that

197
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:52,680
is changing the way how we think about

198
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,139
traditional ml now it has turned into

199
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,080
prompt base ml up front is something

200
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,919
that you ask a query that you run

201
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,080
against the model in order to perform a

202
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,300
task right so that's pretty interesting

203
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,000
how we went from the typical to now if

204
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,919
you're a prompt engineering that that's

205
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,620
going to be a thing soon a job about

206
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,319
brand engineering and out of the box

207
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,960
capabilities of these type of models you

208
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,879
have to understand that exists the

209
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,500
understanding of language and

210
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,940
degeneration

211
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,220
of something text

212
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,599
because that's how you can start

213
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,639
categorizing what use cases you can

214
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,020
actually use it for

215
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,700
on the top you're talking about

216
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,320
understanding code for example

217
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,479
understanding commands that command

218
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,219
lines and you just want to wanted to

219
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:39,479
tell you exactly what's going on

220
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,279
sentiment analysis what I showed before

221
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,200
a phishing email you can use these

222
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,300
models to you know provide that type of

223
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,140
task

224
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,660
on the bottom the generation piece you

225
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,820
start talking about text summarization a

226
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,920
bunch of incidents summarize that maybe

227
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,740
summarize it with these other incident

228
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,620
um uh stack and you know tell me what's

229
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,080
going on right away right this also

230
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,120
helps to dialogue systems as well right

231
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,680
because you can start going back and

232
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,300
forth and create some type of

233
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,740
conversations

234
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,899
text generation because you can tell it

235
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,399
to write things for you and text

236
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,860
translation also and this applies not

237
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,820
only to English to French that type of

238
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,140
translation you can actually have

239
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,200
language to code for example like SQL

240
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,600
queries Etc right

241
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,800
so

242
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,180
now that we went through all of this

243
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,660
this is all the foundations of what the

244
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,360
basics of these models are starting from

245
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,360
neuron neural networks we now know about

246
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,060
GPT some of the basics of GPT as well

247
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,860
some of the capabilities so what can we

248
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,540
do with something like this so my goal

249
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,519
is to share some of the experiments that

250
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:48,120
I did to be able to inspire you

251
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,980
hopefully so you can do your own

252
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,080
an idea here we can just jump directly

253
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,980
to the code so that way oh and yeah okay

254
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,560
I put together this um Jupiter book

255
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,600
which I'm going to be releasing today

256
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,300
um this is not complete this is just the

257
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,279
first iteration and in here what we're

258
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,839
trying to do is show you that the first

259
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,640
step and hopefully you guys can see it

260
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,120
yes is that good okay maybe I can do one

261
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,019
more

262
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:15,300
maybe that that all right

263
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,620
um so the first thing we need to do is

264
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,240
import our libraries to start

265
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,240
interacting with some of the companies

266
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,180
like open AI that allows you to use

267
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:29,519
their GPT models via an API right you

268
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,860
can also use other models as well but

269
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,160
let's just do open AI for now you need

270
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,160
to Define your open AI key like set it I

271
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,160
usually set it as an environment part of

272
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,060
a DOT EMV file and then I just use the

273
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,360
dot m in order to load those environment

274
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,220
variables and then I set it to a

275
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,660
variable so that way I don't disclose my

276
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,700
key while I'm talking to you guys right

277
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,399
so the next step is to create a function

278
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,800
that would allows us to interact with

279
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,899
this API and the first thing we need to

280
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:03,060
do is Define the model so now we know

281
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,040
that we're dealing with GPT models GPT

282
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,720
3.5 turbo is the model before gpt4 4 is

283
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,180
the current one used by some

284
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,920
applications that this chatbot that

285
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,220
exists out there and but 3.5 is the one

286
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,360
where we actually have enough

287
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,740
documentation

288
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,500
now so we Define the model we also want

289
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,620
to pass messages to this call and then

290
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,420
we have the temperature temperature

291
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,200
tells you can tell the the the the model

292
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,720
how creative how much Randomness you

293
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,060
would like to add to the responses if

294
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,940
you set it to 567 that that might start

295
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,160
hallucinating a little bit more for you

296
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,019
so the first concept would be simple

297
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:44,700
something very simple let's start

298
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,320
interacting with this let's create a

299
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,060
prompt and say classify the email

300
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,700
subject text below you have to the the

301
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,700
the key imprompting is you have to be

302
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,700
very specific right so I wanted to be

303
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,680
between those three single quotes and I

304
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,079
just give it that name right away this

305
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:03,480
one says goes and says this is benign

306
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,880
it's just an email subject text appears

307
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,100
to be legitimate request whatever

308
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,440
but now what we can do is Implement

309
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,420
Concepts such as

310
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,940
few short learning which is how you

311
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,760
adapt the model a little bit to be able

312
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,519
to respond in a certain way so in this

313
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,140
case what I'm saying is

314
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,120
I'm going to give you a few examples so

315
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,760
few shot learning will just provide

316
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,519
context before it tries to ask the

317
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,279
question so I'm giving it some subjects

318
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:35,600
and that's that's misspelled by the way

319
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,579
and then I give it a label and I say

320
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:40,980
look if you see this this is malicious

321
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,440
if you see something like this is benign

322
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,660
if I run this again it tells me oh yeah

323
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,519
that's malicious by the way the same

324
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,459
subject right the same email subject as

325
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:54,000
the one before this basic exercise

326
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,360
that's the concept of be able to adapt

327
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,940
the model to do something else that

328
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,339
probably it couldn't do before

329
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:04,079
and if you start interacting with this

330
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,000
of course this is a basic example but

331
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,220
just imagine this at scale you can build

332
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,320
an email classifier right

333
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,000
um with something with a with a

334
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,820
foundational model like an llm

335
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,040
the next one is going to be summarizing

336
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,860
so let me just make this bigger

337
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,440
same concept import libraries get the

338
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,079
key get my function to interact with

339
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:27,240
open Ai and then I give it another

340
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,880
prompt so in this prompt I'm saying hey

341
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,820
and this is also uh let me make sure

342
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,839
that we can yeah

343
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:40,740
there you go that was much better

344
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,540
um we can actually play a little bit

345
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,940
with the prompt we can actually have the

346
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,800
text that we would like the model to

347
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,320
actually uh process right to tell me

348
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,300
something about and then I can create a

349
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,700
an initial prompt where I can actually

350
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,899
tell it your task is to do this you

351
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:00,240
today are going to be a cyber security

352
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,279
professional specialized in reverse

353
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:03,899
engineering for example so you can

354
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:04,700
actually

355
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,139
provide some of that context and because

356
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,000
the model has this foundational

357
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,420
knowledge of language it will be able to

358
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,160
provide some of that context in the

359
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,500
responses as well so in here we pass the

360
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,240
evidence and then it's going to tell us

361
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,160
oh the actor is disabling Windows

362
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,899
Defender is deleting files he's doing

363
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:23,880
all this stuff is missing a few things

364
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,620
in there but that's okay just for the

365
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,779
example but you can see how powerful it

366
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:30,180
could be for security analysts that

367
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,720
don't have much of that probably

368
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,980
knowledge because they're juniors right

369
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,540
probably they are coming from a

370
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,480
different background different field so

371
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,279
it would be super helpful right

372
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,720
and the last thing that I want to talk

373
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,360
about and hopefully we still have enough

374
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,600
time in there is this last experiment

375
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,180
that was super cool that I just was

376
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,220
thinking what else can I do with this

377
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,760
right what else can I do with this llm

378
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,339
can I maybe start asking questions about

379
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:02,579
my own data because

380
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:06,240
the model will respond up to the date

381
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,880
where it was trained all the knowledge

382
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,860
all the things that he knows is up to

383
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,720
when you finish training

384
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,420
whatever happens after that it won't be

385
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,699
able to answer we can actually ask hey

386
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:20,339
how is northseek 2023 and it would be

387
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:22,139
like I don't know I finished training in

388
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:23,579
2021 so I don't know what happened in

389
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:25,380
the past two years that that's exactly

390
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,380
what you will get so in this scenario

391
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,639
we're going to use the concept of

392
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,500
retrieval augmentation where you can

393
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,560
actually provide also your data and now

394
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,360
be able to ask questions based on that

395
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,760
data and that's also how you can adapt

396
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,860
the model a little bit to be able to

397
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,360
interact with knowledge that doesn't

398
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,180
exist anywhere else now granted this

399
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,060
example is using apis so some of the

400
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,800
data is going out but this is just an

401
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,620
example right and in here the

402
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,360
interesting piece as I mentioned before

403
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,720
is that the world exists at a static

404
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,800
snapshot

405
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,800
and then the idea behind is actually to

406
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,220
be able to ask a question and maybe this

407
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,959
next image will

408
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,240
make more sense but you ask a question

409
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,980
you

410
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:14,279
um start understanding how similar your

411
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:16,260
question is to the knowledge that you

412
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,779
have in a vector in a vectorized

413
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,000
database and then you can pass that

414
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,699
context to the model so what does that

415
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:24,480
mean

416
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,480
so what I did is I wanted to replicate

417
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,060
what it would be in a threat Intel team

418
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:33,000
in a company that has in Intel and then

419
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,380
it has all this knowledge about the

420
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,000
reactors that you cannot share with

421
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,500
anybody else because it's your Intel

422
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,420
maybe you want to share some yes with

423
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,680
other partners but there is some

424
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,800
knowledge that you cannot share right

425
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,500
so I was thinking you know what what

426
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,600
public knowledge has some of that

427
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,600
context in the world minor attack groups

428
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,000
does have the type of information where

429
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,740
they collect information about groups

430
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,320
public information and they map all this

431
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,139
knowledge to all the groups so there you

432
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:04,919
are that's my Intel database from for my

433
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:07,919
POC so why not do that so what I did is

434
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,199
I have this python library that I wrote

435
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:13,559
It's a GitHub project that allows me to

436
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:16,559
query data from miter attack in an

437
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,959
Instax format miter attack does have a

438
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,540
database it's a taxi server database

439
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,119
where you can just get the data so I

440
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,280
wrote some code with this Library

441
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,780
I create documents I tokenize my data I

442
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,360
hope that tokenize now makes sense right

443
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,140
and then I create the embeddings I hope

444
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,000
that also makes sense again right of

445
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,160
every single document so we tokenize

446
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,020
embeddings and then I put it into a

447
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,880
database that understands numerical

448
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,520
values that will represent a document

449
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,679
and the semantics of the document right

450
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,860
so now when I run my query and I say hey

451
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,080
I would like to know more about these

452
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,120
threat actors that exist in minor attack

453
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,460
but if I go to the minor attack search

454
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,740
capability through the website all I can

455
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,220
do is keyword based search right all you

456
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,260
can do is type phishing process

457
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,780
injection Discovery and then it tries to

458
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,120
find the documents but what if I want to

459
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,200
ask

460
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,539
what are the top

461
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:17,700
fishing techniques or what are the most

462
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,679
common fishing techniques in your whole

463
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,720
database the whole website goes down

464
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,160
right because it can it doesn't

465
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,460
understand that type of conversation so

466
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,320
we start with our query

467
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,799
our query is going to be embedded

468
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:35,460
that embedding is going to be compared

469
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,340
with whatever we have in the database so

470
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,340
it knows what's similar my query and the

471
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,380
documents and it brings me the top five

472
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,860
top 10 documents then I can just have

473
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,980
that and pass it to the llm and say here

474
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,960
is my context I would like to know what

475
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,820
are the most common techniques that are

476
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,840
used

477
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,280
um in the world right something like

478
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,039
that so let's do that

479
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,380
and that's the last example so just

480
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,000
making sure I want to

481
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,780
go over that oh

482
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,400
sorry

483
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,360
by accident I click other buttons

484
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,679
and then let's get rid of this all right

485
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,360
so this is going to work through the

486
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,460
whole thing and once again the

487
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,020
code

488
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,440
is going to be there you go

489
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,740
so we import our attack python client

490
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,640
Library

491
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,799
we Define some some variables we

492
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,260
initialize that the attack client

493
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,440
I wrote a give me all the groups

494
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,500
function right give me all the groups

495
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,120
that's pretty much what it does and then

496
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,740
I start getting information about all

497
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,480
the groups that exist at miter attack

498
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,760
and all some of the information such as

499
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,000
techniques Etc of minor attack then I

500
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,460
create the way how I want to structure

501
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,020
my documents because the way I was

502
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,760
before it just has information that I

503
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,140
don't want I just want to have specific

504
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,700
things in there so that's what it does

505
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,620
it just allows me to pick what it is

506
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,780
that I want my documents to be like

507
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,840
and I'll I'll uh go down so I start

508
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,780
processing creating markdown files for

509
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,120
every single thread actor and that's

510
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,740
what you see in companies that are

511
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,539
tracking Intel you have a thread actor

512
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:14,400
you have a summary of the thread actor

513
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,020
and you have connections of course to

514
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,940
evidence and things like that but the

515
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,740
the the primary overview of the third

516
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,780
actor is super important right

517
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,720
so we go through all this and now we use

518
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,840
a tool called land chain super useful if

519
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,240
you want to dive into these examples it

520
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,880
simplifies a lot of these things it has

521
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,500
a lot of wrappers around some of these

522
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,600
apis that I was showing you before

523
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,980
and then

524
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,419
we start

525
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:40,260
um

526
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,880
capturing information from all these

527
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,740
documents with Lang chain

528
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,100
and then we start actually

529
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,020
loading every single group

530
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,200
into its token representations to

531
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,059
understand how many tokens we have so

532
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:55,320
pretty much this is telling me that

533
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,840
there are documents that do have 176

534
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,240
tokens there are documents that have

535
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,600
over 7 000 tokens in the document when

536
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,340
you interact with these models there is

537
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,100
also a limit of how many tokens you can

538
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,140
pass when you interact with that model

539
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,200
that's what I do this right here so in

540
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,200
order to avoid these large tokens per

541
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,179
document we start splitting the

542
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:20,880
documents and this is also an art I

543
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,740
didn't know splitting a document it's an

544
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,200
art when you try to pass it to an llm

545
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,140
why is that and maybe I could show you

546
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,640
here yeah

547
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,760
you can actually split documents in

548
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,679
chunks of 500 for example let's say

549
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:35,880
tokens

550
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,820
and then the overlap is 50. what does

551
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,720
that mean

552
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,120
that if I have a document that ends on

553
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,720
thread actor X

554
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,000
and then the other one starts with

555
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,620
something else not related to that

556
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,600
threat actor especially when you have

557
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,659
long documents of Intel of a thread

558
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:56,220
actor sometimes you don't keep the

559
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,780
thread actor names all the way at the

560
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,520
bottom so maybe the information at the

561
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,340
bottom might not be pointing to the top

562
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,620
and it's important to have some of that

563
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,320
context in every single chunk so the

564
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,539
first thing you can do is say I'm going

565
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:12,120
to take the first chunk overlap that

566
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,280
chunk and try to capture maybe some of

567
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,080
that information so that way I start

568
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,799
making my my chunks more similar another

569
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:22,620
technique is in every single chunk you

570
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,720
just put the name of the thread actor

571
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,539
and now you have context of one chunk

572
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:29,159
Associated to the third actor so that's

573
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:31,620
another technique that you can do right

574
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,640
so

575
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,200
once we do that

576
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,299
we're gonna just uh splitting all the

577
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:38,820
data and then I'm going to export it as

578
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:43,380
a DOT Json L file and why is that

579
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,840
it's because if you truly want to

580
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,419
collaborate with people

581
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:50,159
if you really want to share your

582
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,559
information uh like something like this

583
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,500
what I did is I created this document

584
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,039
that what it does it gives you the ID of

585
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,620
the chunks it tells you that this chunk

586
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:05,700
is zero uh in zero one like one two so

587
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,700
zero one index zero index one those two

588
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,520
chunks belong to one document and then I

589
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,980
provide that text how the the text was

590
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,320
split so now that I'm talking to data

591
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,059
scientists they want a they want to know

592
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:20,760
how I prepare my data now I could tell

593
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,799
them this is exactly how I would I would

594
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,539
do it and maybe you can use it on your

595
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:26,580
own and that's better because some of

596
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,020
them don't understand some of this

597
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,740
information but our role as a security

598
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:33,419
researcher is to be able to share our

599
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:34,799
knowledge and that's what this

600
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,360
presentation was about right to be able

601
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,400
to take some of this knowledge that they

602
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,140
know and how we're going to start using

603
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,780
it to start even parsing what we know so

604
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,820
they can use it right so this whole

605
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,860
document has that splitting how many

606
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,780
chunks some chunks all the way to even

607
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,640
seven chunks for example

608
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,780
Etc

609
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,980
okay

610
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,919
so then we um

611
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,960
almost done in there yeah

612
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,659
yeah and then we create a database with

613
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:02,820
all these chunks right

614
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,440
I want to skip that one over there what

615
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,179
I do there I just simply save all that

616
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:08,400
in a pickle file for those that right do

617
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,960
Python Programming or just I've just

618
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,520
saved all that information

619
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,919
now I can start querying this knowledge

620
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,840
right so I do the same thing as before

621
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,960
import my variables set my key

622
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,100
and now I set my database as a retriever

623
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:23,820
um

624
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,700
object so it would allow me to retrieve

625
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,200
information from there

626
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,659
and then I just pass one query my query

627
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:32,460
is what are some of the fishing

628
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,500
techniques to use by thread actors when

629
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,240
I pass this through the retriever it's

630
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,059
going to give me documents that are

631
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:41,520
related to my question now

632
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,440
so now I can enable question and

633
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,780
answering also with this information

634
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,000
so now I take all these documents that I

635
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,299
received and then I pass that as context

636
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:53,700
and then I ask the same question

637
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,700
and the response was threat actors have

638
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,500
used spearfishing emails with malicious

639
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,120
attachments links to HTML application

640
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,039
files embedded with and you get the idea

641
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:04,679
right so it was able to generate content

642
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:05,460
uh

643
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,700
new text right generate text that now

644
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,460
allows me to simplify the way how I

645
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,440
interact with my Intel database for

646
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,480
example so if you're an Intel analyst

647
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,980
you might want to do that right just to

648
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,480
get some more insights that you might

649
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,780
miss because you cannot read thousands

650
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,100
of documents

651
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,440
splitting chunks and then ask questions

652
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,260
right we can't do that right so this is

653
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,760
what this is about and you can apply

654
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,580
this idea to anything any type of

655
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,620
knowledge in the security realm there's

656
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,840
a lot of stuff that I'm super excited to

657
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,080
dive into the next couple of weeks

658
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,279
so that at the End by the way I took my

659
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:47,220
Json file and now I contributed it to

660
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:50,220
the hugging phase Hub so now that uh

661
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,380
it's a file that people can use download

662
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,659
directly interact with it so that's my

663
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:57,299
contribution to the community of of the

664
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:58,679
AI community

665
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:02,640
and that's all we have this is the link

666
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,520
for the GitHub repo which by the way I

667
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,340
just want to make sure that it is it is

668
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,919
private no yeah so

669
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:13,679
hopefully lets me do that

670
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,559
and uh

671
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,520
okay real quick sorry oh my God see

672
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,620
that's inconvenience

673
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,520
um

674
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,700
and just making it uh let's see

675
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,860
and of course I need to

676
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,080
I need to disconnect this right so

677
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,500
otherwise

678
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:40,200
all right I'll do it when I'm done

679
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,799
um but what a way to finish the keynote

680
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:45,240
with a contribution to the community and

681
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,740
share some of these Concepts so that you

682
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,140
can take him back experiment Inspire

683
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,820
yourself and just share your your

684
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,700
knowledge this GitHub repo is to do that

685
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,320
is to share some of these experiments

686
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,820
and then you can take them and then make

687
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,440
them your own repos and all that thank

688
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,140
you very much for your time and hope it

689
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,630
was useful thank you

690
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:09,159
[Applause]

691
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,320
thank you

692
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,279
hey thank you brother

693
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:42,419
it's called negative and trying to

694
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:45,539
figure out how to yep reduce the number

695
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:47,220
of false negatives while not blowing up

696
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:50,100
false sauces yeah basically

697
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,020
and um

698
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,940
I'm looking forward to the Q a it's

699
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,539
going to feel like

700
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,659
all right

701
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,140
hey Louie Lou

702
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,840
good uh so we got we took a shorter

703
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,059
break we're already a little bit behind

704
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:23,240
schedule as with every good conference

705
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,460
uh so uh for our next block we have the

706
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,980
detection block uh our moderator is

707
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,140
Jared Atkinson is a security researcher

708
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,840
who specializes in digital forensics and

709
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,000
incidence response he previously LED

715
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,080
blogging about detection engineering so

716
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,580
please welcome Jared Atkinson

717
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,520
Perfect all righty thanks everybody who

718
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,620
here's detection Engineers blue teamers

719
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,960
I assume most people right that's why

720
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,159
you're interested in the in the

721
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:07,620
detection block uh the next talk that we

722
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,779
have is going to be a talk that's really

723
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:10,980
really quite interesting one of the

724
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,779
biggest problems that we have in

725
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:14,460
detection engineering is this this

726
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,559
dichotomy of false pauses versus false

727
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,539
negatives right so we have this issue to

728
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:20,519
where there's two types of error that we

729
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:22,500
have to deal with right so what we don't

730
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,640
want to do is we don't want to detect

731
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,799
benign things and report them as

732
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:27,659
malicious and then you know destroy our

733
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:29,220
networks as a result of that waste

734
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,380
resources but we also want to make sure

735
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,000
that we're not missing malicious things

736
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,740
and the problem is is that those two

737
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,659
things are inversely related right so as

738
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:38,880
we reduce the number of false negatives

739
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,980
that we're going to uh encounter right

740
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:45,000
we're going to start to really deal with

741
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,279
deal with trying to find things cast a

742
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,140
wider Nets we end up creating a bunch

743
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,279
more alerts and we have this problem

744
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:52,380
with alert fatigue and things like that

745
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,760
and so our next presentation is going to

746
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,260
really get into that and our speakers

747
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:58,320
are a Emilio Gonzalez who works in a

748
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,399
blue team in a large Canadian

749
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:01,260
organization he loves to participate in

750
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,299
ctfs and create challenges to introduce

751
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:05,159
people to some defensive aspects of

752
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:07,500
cyber security and he's a co-organizer

753
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,199
for mantra hack a monthly CTF Workshop

754
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:13,320
in Montreal and then I told uh Remy that

755
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,000
I'm probably going to mess up his name a

756
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,918
little bit because it's very French but

757
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:19,260
we have Remy longevoir

758
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,899
was that right okay cool and uh Remy's

759
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:23,699
been working in a blue team for a few

760
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:25,139
years as a threat Hunter and developer

761
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:27,540
in addition to threat hunting uh they

762
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,940
both like to talk about indenting their

763
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,399
codes so apparently their zealots Are

764
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:37,460
You tab or two space tab Okay so

765
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,580
oh

766
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,800
now

767
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,000
that was something we should have saved

768
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,379
for after the talk because now you have

769
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:44,879
an uphill battle going against everybody

770
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,159
but uh welcome Remy and Emilio to the

771
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,480
stage and we'll go ahead and take it

772
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,839
away guys

773
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:06,240
test yeah hi everyone it's good to be

774
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,220
here so today we're going to talk about

775
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:11,700
detection engineering edit fatigue and

776
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,160
dealing with a security operations

777
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,440
centers limited resources

778
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,980
and how we try to overcome that

779
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,440
my name is Emilio but I've already been

780
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,720
presented so let's skip that part

781
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,900
and same goes for baby

782
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,480
so for the presentation we're going to

783
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,640
talk about our contexts and the problems

784
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,260
we were trying to solve

785
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,980
indicators what they are why they're

786
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,160
cool and when not to use them we're then

787
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,740
going to show our implementation of a

788
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,720
platform that leverages the concept of

789
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,780
indicators which we call Yamaha we're

790
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,280
going to suggest a free and open

791
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,740
implementation for people who wants to

792
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,380
try the concept without having to pay

793
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,300
and we're going to close with takeaways

794
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,480
and the future of Yamaha

795
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,720
so context and problems

796
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,119
about our organization we're a fairly

797
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:08,640
big organization with about 50 000

798
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,040
employees which means we manage lots of

799
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,320
endpoints both workstations and servers

800
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,780
more than 70 000.

801
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,300
for the workstations it's mostly windows

802
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,060
with a small amount of mac and Linux for

803
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,339
the servers we have both cloud and

804
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:25,680
on-premises infrastructure with a good

805
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,460
mix

806
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,520
a Windows servers and unique servers we

807
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,960
have an EDR installed on the vast

808
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,060
majority of machines and a TLS

809
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,339
inspecting corporate proxy that sends

810
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:38,220
logs directly to the Sim which means we

811
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,619
have lots of telemetry to build

812
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:42,240
detections on

813
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,460
for the stock we're a fairly big suck

814
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,400
with more than 20 sock analysts slash

815
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,339
thread Hunters slash detection engineers

816
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:52,740
and we have a very heterogeneous Network

817
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,800
that carries Decades of I.T work at a

818
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,540
time where security wasn't a main

819
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,880
concern and this is kind of important

820
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,980
when doing the technical engineering to

821
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,500
be aware of that

822
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,960
so let's say you wake up today you say I

823
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,060
want to build a good detection so what

824
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,040
are the characteristics that detection

825
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,540
should have

826
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,300
first you want no false negative so you

827
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,099
want to detect all malicious behavior

828
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:19,859
you want to detect but you also want no

829
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:21,660
false positive so you never want to

830
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,000
detect a legitimate Behavior

831
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,740
you want the detection to have a small

832
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,839
time footprint which means you don't

833
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,640
want to exceed the sucks capacity to

834
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,500
respond to all of the alerts of that

835
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,800
detection which either means

836
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,099
not many alerts or the alerts can be

837
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:40,260
investigated quite fast or in the best

838
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,040
world both

839
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,700
you want the detection to be fully

840
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,619
actionable which means an analyst will

841
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:48,359
know what to do to investigate and

842
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:50,640
respond to that alert and can actually

843
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,700
do it and finally you want the detection

844
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,800
to be maintainable so not bloated with

845
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,440
exclusions and overly complex Logics so

846
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,720
when you look at the detection it's

847
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,240
clear what it does so you just did a

848
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,280
good detection is more like a perfect

849
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,500
detection you're never gonna get a

850
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,359
perfect detection but you want to

851
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,599
approach these characteristics

852
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:15,060
it's not worried about 150 because this

853
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,160
is really important alert fatigue is a

854
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,839
phenomenon that occurs when cyber

855
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,099
Security Professionals become

856
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:22,500
desensitized after dealing with an

857
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,480
overwhelming number of alerts so they

858
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,940
start to overlook or ignore them and

859
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:30,240
have slower response times so if you

860
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,740
work in a slug this is really important

861
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,020
to understand and if you haven't worked

862
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,300
as an analyst dealing with a large

863
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,000
number of alerts which all look the same

864
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,760
and are all false positives it might not

865
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,800
be obvious that this is something real

866
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,040
but it is believe me and if you build

867
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,420
detections and you don't take into

868
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:51,540
account alert fatigue you might have a

869
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,599
false sense of coverage or security

870
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,220
because you said well my detection is

871
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,160
built it detects the stuff

872
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,339
but if you don't consider that

873
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,980
analysts have alert fatigue or can have

874
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,740
alert fatigue you might believe that if

875
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,839
something malicious happens it's going

876
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,480
to get detected whereas if the detection

877
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,060
is like

878
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,700
99.99 false positives analysts perhaps

879
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:21,240
will take mental shortcuts and ignore

880
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,940
stuff that's actually malicious

881
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,520
so usually we want to address that and

882
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,020
one of the main way

883
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,940
to address alert fatigue is reducing the

884
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,579
number of false positives so how can we

885
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:35,460
handle false positives in a suck

886
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,200
the most obvious answer is ADD

887
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,900
extrusions to your detection and this is

888
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,520
usually good

889
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,380
it lowers the amount of false positives

890
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,859
but the more exclusions you add

891
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:48,839
the higher the chance that you're going

892
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:49,859
to miss something that's actually

893
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:52,680
malicious so meaning increasing the

894
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,720
number of false negatives so you need to

895
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,720
be careful you can have a triage here

896
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,700
and not everybody uses the term triage

897
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,380
the same way but for this presentation

898
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,560
triage means having either analysts or

899
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,380
automations that look at alerts and

900
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:10,320
close quickly obvious false positives

901
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,260
and this is usually good to do

902
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,180
but we need to be careful because it

903
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,280
actually increases the likelihood of

904
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,740
alert fatigue for the analysts that look

905
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:22,560
at the alert first

906
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,839
you can hire more analysts but this

907
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,180
costs lots of money doesn't address

908
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:30,599
alert fatigue and in a talent and labor

909
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:34,079
shortage it's harder than ever to do

910
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,420
you can automate contextualization and

911
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,700
response with a sore and that helps

912
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,380
greatly but it requires a lot of time to

913
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,020
do correctly and resources and it's not

914
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,820
a silver bullet some stuff is still

915
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,820
going to have to be done by humans and

916
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,440
it's okay like that

917
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,720
and perhaps the most common is not using

918
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,820
the detection for detection Engineers

919
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:57,720
out there probably happen at least once

920
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,220
you looked at the technique you said

921
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,500
well this is so easy to detect I'm going

922
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,599
to build a detection looking at process

923
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,300
creations with that filter you build a

924
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,240
detection you say I love this detection

925
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,500
it's going to fit so well in our

926
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,200
environment you put it to to prod you

927
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,300
wait a day and what happens it triggers

928
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,099
300 times that day

929
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,140
and you're like

930
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,359
that's too much for my suck of three

931
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:22,980
people to handle I'm gonna add

932
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,680
exclusions and you add exclusions

933
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,040
and then it triggers it's better it

934
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,500
triggers 30 times every day which is

935
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,359
still too much so what do you end up

936
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,180
doing you take the detection you cry a

937
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,760
bit and you throw it in the garbage

938
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,880
which keeps your blind spots which means

939
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,060
infinite false negatives but what if

940
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,619
there was a way of keeping that

941
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:48,480
detection instead of throwing it in the

942
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,619
garbage

943
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:52,079
so yeah we decided to

944
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,320
um to uh to turn to indicators and what

945
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,359
are the indicators what do we mean by

946
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,359
and getter it's um the output of a

947
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:03,000
detection logic of a rule our content

948
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,400
match whatever you want to call it but

949
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,220
it's mainly the output uh the main

950
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:11,099
output you know is probably the alert so

951
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:12,540
there's a stock analysis that will

952
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:15,000
investigate the output of this detection

953
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,300
logic but we added one that is an

954
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,619
indicator

955
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:22,560
so what what is an indicator

956
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,020
and what do we do with them

957
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,260
feedback all right um so yeah what do we

958
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,700
do with them we correlate them to

959
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,680
trigger incidents so let's say you have

960
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,839
a phishing attempt like an indicator for

961
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,240
a phishing attempt but it's not uh like

962
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,579
precise enough to uh to get an alert for

963
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:40,560
it and then you have the same thing for

964
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,839
persistence afterward and something else

965
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:45,839
and then you uh you might just tag them

966
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,760
and build an alert for the whole

967
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,119
incident

968
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,320
you might also use them for additional

969
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,820
context so let's say you have a ticket

970
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:57,420
to investigate you want to see for a

971
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:00,119
host what else has happened on the same

972
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:03,119
host during the same time period well

973
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,280
you can just use what has already

974
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,099
triggered as an indicator on the same

975
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:09,839
host

976
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:12,000
you can also use them as thread hunting

977
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,880
leads so if you just put them like in

978
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,880
some UI or some data store and your

979
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,680
Challengers want to

980
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,680
um to just like browse them and find

981
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:26,160
malicious stuff well that's a good one

982
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,740
and also uh you can use a entity model

983
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,859
to score the entities

984
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:33,619
to just like help the trending

985
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:39,500
prioritize their leads or use them for

986
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,420
triggering triggering alerts with high

987
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,339
scores and you can use do that for

988
00:43:44,339 --> 00:43:47,339
machines users domains and especially

989
00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:48,960
cats because they are kind of malicious

990
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,960
or at least suspicious

991
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,200
so um yeah what are the benefits of of

992
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,060
using them well

993
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:59,160
when we don't have one detection equals

994
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,680
one alert we uh we may bypass some of

995
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,960
the negative side effects of the false

996
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,680
positives so what does that mean we can

997
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,960
do like detection Logics that we would

998
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,700
have just thrown away like Emilio said

999
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,140
or

1000
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:16,920
um otherwise yeah just it will have done

1001
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,079
some error fatigue for the second list

1002
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:21,240
so we can Implement them they are less

1003
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,339
precise but it's fine because there are

1004
00:44:23,339 --> 00:44:27,000
not action done for like in a one-to-one

1005
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,020
manner

1006
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,359
uh it also enables us to detect

1007
00:44:30,359 --> 00:44:32,940
suspicious stuff but not really uh

1008
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,680
abnormal so let's say you have a net

1009
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,319
users your system means do that you may

1010
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:39,660
be your developers or somebody that

1011
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:41,220
knows a bit of command line might do

1012
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,859
that but it's not malicious but you want

1013
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:48,000
maybe to get an indicator for this for

1014
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,099
if there's an incident you might just

1015
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:54,119
use that as to help you contextualize

1016
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:56,540
and the often stack together to build

1017
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:59,280
some incident or a story that helps you

1018
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,760
investigate or trigger alerts

1019
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,640
but can you put anything in things no

1020
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:09,359
garbage and garbage out as they say they

1021
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,460
should be meaningful they should be

1022
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,180
um

1023
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:15,540
and tune also if you have like for false

1024
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,220
positive you should do your exclusion

1025
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,140
and everything

1026
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,300
um like something that triggers 10 000

1027
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,859
times a day might be fine for

1028
00:45:22,859 --> 00:45:24,900
informational landscaler just like

1029
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,640
there's no scoring it's only there for

1030
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,220
contextualization but maybe not for a

1031
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,960
high severity because you don't want to

1032
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,339
score on some on a lot of noise

1033
00:45:34,339 --> 00:45:36,420
and um

1034
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,160
this should be an indicator of attacks

1035
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,960
so let's say you have a process making a

1036
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,839
lot of DNS queries maybe Chrome is not a

1037
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:45,420
good process for that because it's

1038
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:46,920
basically the

1039
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,560
the main thing that Trump's does is DNS

1040
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,920
request

1041
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:55,680
okay so maybe you're taking these are

1042
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,480
cools I want to implement and skillers

1043
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,359
but uh there are there is basic stuff to

1044
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:01,980
do before that

1045
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,140
um well you need a good budget like

1046
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,119
anything in security

1047
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:08,400
you need a security-minded developers to

1048
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,380
leverage these indicators build platform

1049
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:14,819
around it and make this uh valuable

1050
00:46:14,819 --> 00:46:17,400
your basic uh basic stuff like proper

1051
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,880
assets and software management

1052
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:23,220
the Sim EDR for walls anything that the

1053
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,780
log Source basically because you need

1054
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,339
them to build detection Logics if you

1055
00:46:26,339 --> 00:46:27,720
don't have this you won't build

1056
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,900
detection logic at all and they have

1057
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,359
built-in the detections if you don't

1058
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:34,339
have

1059
00:46:34,339 --> 00:46:37,380
people to work on the detection logic

1060
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,020
theme so this is the basic then you Ma

1061
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:43,319
you want people to just investigate

1062
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:45,660
those alerts if there are alerts and

1063
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:48,359
nobody is there to uh answer them that's

1064
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:49,619
not good

1065
00:46:49,619 --> 00:46:51,660
another word the detection logic team

1066
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,640
and the most critical detection before

1067
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,619
and skaters because and skaters are just

1068
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:57,020
there to

1069
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:59,579
circumvent the blind spot you have with

1070
00:46:59,579 --> 00:47:02,339
the the critical detections

1071
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:04,920
and also a challenging team maybe that

1072
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,940
can just leverage other more

1073
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:11,220
yeah more like to get more leverage on

1074
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:14,160
these these indicators so let's say

1075
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,839
let's go to the implementation what do

1076
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:18,780
what do did we do so there's four blocks

1077
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,599
there are the log sources the enrichment

1078
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,760
sources the analytic platform which is

1079
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,380
databricks and the outputs so first in

1080
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:31,380
the log Source you want a Sim they are

1081
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,780
probably already some detection logic

1082
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,400
implemented there you can put some

1083
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,819
simple indicators there and for them to

1084
00:47:38,819 --> 00:47:40,700
the analytic platform

1085
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:43,440
the other log management tool the EDR

1086
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,480
firewalls everything you can maybe pull

1087
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,540
directly the data from your analytics

1088
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:49,920
platform

1089
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,599
there's also

1090
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:53,040
um sorry

1091
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,960
there's also the enrichment sources like

1092
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,660
driver's Tuttle for domains binaries

1093
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:00,680
just to get contacts for something known

1094
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:04,680
top 1 million domains uip Etc

1095
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,720
and then there's the in the analytic

1096
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,760
platform there's the hunting data which

1097
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,599
is

1098
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:12,780
um like what are the binaries we have

1099
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:15,540
seen uh what are when were they first

1100
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:18,240
seen on home and how many hosts same for

1101
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,780
users binary domains Etc

1102
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,819
and then all of this goes into the

1103
00:48:23,819 --> 00:48:26,220
notebook magic where the scoring and the

1104
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:28,680
indicator logic happens and we output

1105
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,540
this in a data store

1106
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,599
and from there we have three type of

1107
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,400
outputs we can open directly a ticket

1108
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,920
into the ticketing system to get an

1109
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,319
investigation the source can pull the

1110
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,319
data and contextualize investigation

1111
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,420
automatically or there is the power bi

1112
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:48,060
for manual user queries that want to

1113
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:50,960
explore the data

1114
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,900
so yeah in the notebook magic we explore

1115
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,660
the three main scoring algorithm

1116
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:02,700
um the which we one we call TF IDF which

1117
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,400
is a frequency analysis basically so uh

1118
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,619
on if there are many entities that

1119
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:09,660
trigger the same indicator you get less

1120
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,640
information from the indicator so the

1121
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:15,599
score is uh is just like lessened and

1122
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,960
um yeah if it scores on like a small

1123
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,940
subset of machine then the score just

1124
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,280
get boosted

1125
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,619
um there are the indicator severity that

1126
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:28,500
we might just like security knowledge if

1127
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,319
we want we say this is a critical we put

1128
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:33,540
we give it a thousand point and then a

1129
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:35,160
high we give it a hundred point and so

1130
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,800
on uh this is like the simple simple

1131
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,319
score and then the inertia analysis it's

1132
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:43,200
more like a baseline if a host or an

1133
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,619
entity gets uh like the score it's

1134
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:48,839
stable for a week and then get a spike

1135
00:49:48,839 --> 00:49:51,180
and score then we can just boost its

1136
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:56,118
core with the using like the delta

1137
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,280
so yeah so time for a demo

1138
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,819
so

1139
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,140
one level

1140
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:13,740
all right so it looks like this for an

1141
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:15,540
analysis and this is the main page so

1142
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:18,180
this is mostly for threat hunting so

1143
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:21,300
it's a power API Report with many pages

1144
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,040
a power bi application I think it's

1145
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,680
called so as you can see there's a

1146
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,800
slider here to determine the the date

1147
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,680
range you want to examine and the data

1148
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,500
gets updated uh quite fast so we can see

1149
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,839
here this the indicators that I've

1150
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:38,700
triggered their severity so critical

1151
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:41,460
high medium low and informational and

1152
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:44,099
here you have for a given date and a

1153
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:47,160
given computer a score so the score Remy

1154
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,859
talked about one minute ago you can

1155
00:50:49,859 --> 00:50:51,599
filter easily so if you click it's going

1156
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,520
to filter for that specific computer day

1157
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,559
and you can see which indicator

1158
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:57,359
triggered

1159
00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:00,420
for that machine so you can go into into

1160
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:02,579
the details here for example the command

1161
00:51:02,579 --> 00:51:04,619
line

1162
00:51:04,619 --> 00:51:06,960
power bi has a feature that's called a

1163
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,400
drill through which is pretty

1164
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,760
interesting to go to another report by

1165
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,099
passing arguments so we can have here a

1166
00:51:14,099 --> 00:51:16,500
better view of the given day for the

1167
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,180
given computer

1168
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,920
and you can see the indicators that I

1169
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,440
figured with a bit more space so it's

1170
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:26,040
easier to threat hunt and this might be

1171
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,500
a bit confusing this is anonymized data

1172
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,619
and the indicator name are taken from

1173
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:34,980
the sigma repository on GitHub

1174
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:37,800
you can also drill through to show that

1175
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,540
the all the detections for that computer

1176
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:41,460
so it's interesting because you have

1177
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:44,339
this now and the slider to determine the

1178
00:51:44,339 --> 00:51:46,559
date and you can see how many indicators

1179
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:49,319
have triggered for that specific machine

1180
00:51:49,319 --> 00:51:51,720
every day so you can see spikes and

1181
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,400
potentially suspicious activity and you

1182
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,800
can filter in the same way that power bi

1183
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,680
allows and you can see what triggered

1184
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,279
and when

1185
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,180
but

1186
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,859
it's not only for a thread I don't think

1187
00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:07,800
as we said we can use them to Pivot from

1188
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,280
ongoing investigation so let's say we

1189
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,980
there's an EDR alerts that gets

1190
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:17,099
triggered the analysts that looks at the

1191
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:19,859
alert they want to

1192
00:52:19,859 --> 00:52:21,599
see what kind of indicators have

1193
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:22,859
triggered so we have a page for that

1194
00:52:22,859 --> 00:52:25,800
where you can input a machine and see

1195
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,140
basically the same stuff that we've seen

1196
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,880
a wild threat hunting so you can see

1197
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,040
which indicators have triggered and this

1198
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,260
might be helpful to Pivot during an

1199
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:37,440
investigation and we actually have a

1200
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,300
success story with this we had a server

1201
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,760
that has been that had a web application

1202
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,920
that was compromised and during the

1203
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,280
investigation an EDR alert triggered and

1204
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,099
by going into Yamaha we had a small but

1205
00:52:50,099 --> 00:52:54,180
noisy indicator which was a rare domain

1206
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:55,800
was accessed on the small amount of

1207
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,800
machines and by looking at the domains

1208
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,859
and pivoting further we we were able to

1209
00:53:01,859 --> 00:53:03,780
confirm that this machine was indeed

1210
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:07,020
compromised and Yamaha was a key part in

1211
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,200
that

1212
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,819
returning to threat hunting

1213
00:53:11,819 --> 00:53:14,160
as we've said we have multiple scoring

1214
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,020
algorithms so we have multiple views for

1215
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:17,160
them

1216
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,980
so this one is the TF IDF so as Remy

1217
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:22,260
said the the more an indicator triggers

1218
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,900
the less the score and the more rare the

1219
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,599
indicator the higher the score so if you

1220
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:29,700
notice those are different machines they

1221
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,740
are scored by score

1222
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:35,099
TF IDF so different algorithms are going

1223
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:37,200
to give different machines so four

1224
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,180
thread hunting having multiple views is

1225
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:41,760
really is really great for

1226
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,460
um for all hunting activities

1227
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:46,920
we've talked about scoring machines but

1228
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,680
we're not required to look by machines

1229
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,900
so we have a page here looking for

1230
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,780
domains so indicators can be triggered

1231
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:57,599
for domains and if we look here we can

1232
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:00,300
filter for a specific domain that we're

1233
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:02,339
domain.windows.net

1234
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:04,500
we can see that three file names

1235
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,839
triggered

1236
00:54:06,839 --> 00:54:09,839
that indicators for that specific domain

1237
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:12,300
so this is EDR Telemetry so we look at

1238
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:14,400
DNS requests and we map it to the

1239
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,920
process creation to see what's the the

1240
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,540
file name and what's the command line so

1241
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:23,220
again very helpful to uh to threat hunt

1242
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:26,099
we can also filter by miter attack

1243
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:28,220
tactics so when we build our indicators

1244
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:32,280
we associate them with miter tactics so

1245
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,040
if we for example want to do a thread

1246
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,440
hunting for only defensive Vision well

1247
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,420
we can filter that and it's very fast

1248
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,579
with power bi we can filter only for

1249
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:42,839
specific

1250
00:54:42,839 --> 00:54:44,640
tactics

1251
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,280
and finally that page which is not for

1252
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,960
investigation nor for threat hunting

1253
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,540
it's for the detection Engineers so you

1254
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:53,099
can look at indicators that have

1255
00:54:53,099 --> 00:54:54,839
triggered so you can see how many

1256
00:54:54,839 --> 00:54:57,420
indicators have triggered every day

1257
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:59,940
and you can see for how many computers

1258
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:01,619
for example

1259
00:55:01,619 --> 00:55:03,480
a given indicator has triggered so we

1260
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:06,720
can see here the node process execution

1261
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,180
indicator it has triggered for 48 000

1262
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,800
computers and it's a medium severity

1263
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,559
indicator so perhaps we show that the

1264
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:15,900
exclusions or lower the severity for

1265
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,180
that indicator because it triggers way

1266
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:20,280
too much and we can filter and as we can

1267
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,800
see we can we can look at how many

1268
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,780
indicators have been triggered each day

1269
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:28,500
so for example 12 000 here and then it

1270
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:32,640
drops to 392 a day so actually we added

1271
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,680
an exclusion to that indicator using

1272
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,200
that page because we saw that it was way

1273
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,098
way too noisy

1274
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,260
so back to

1275
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:47,300
regularly scheduled programming

1276
00:55:48,059 --> 00:55:50,400
all right so if you want to try this at

1277
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,280
home or just like not spend a huge

1278
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,520
Budget on this uh we uh we just list for

1279
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,099
you some uh open and uh free

1280
00:55:59,099 --> 00:56:00,660
Alternatives

1281
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:03,180
um yeah so for the job orchestration you

1282
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:05,460
need something to uh coordinate the the

1283
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:07,440
execution of the notebooks to tell which

1284
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,480
one is first and then the like there are

1285
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,540
dependencies and when should they run uh

1286
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:15,240
we use data Factory aperture flow is

1287
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,520
more than capable of this

1288
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,500
um yeah so

1289
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:22,020
um when the the new books runs in

1290
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:24,540
databricks and Jupiter notebook is

1291
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:26,280
pretty much the same in the free and

1292
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:29,579
open world but it doesn't have a managed

1293
00:56:29,579 --> 00:56:32,220
data store neither it has managed

1294
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:35,400
clusters you have to do this by your on

1295
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,040
your own in Jupiter

1296
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,920
for the data store we use Delta tables

1297
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,540
it is also free and open I just didn't

1298
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:45,540
put in there put it put it in there but

1299
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,700
you can use like a positive resql or a

1300
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:50,280
file system whatever you want that the

1301
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:54,240
analytic engine can parse uh which for

1302
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,420
instance is the Apache spark and

1303
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:59,760
it is also free and open

1304
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,400
so uh yeah and for the presentation UI

1305
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,880
we use power bi as you saw but I don't I

1306
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,319
don't think there's anything that

1307
00:57:07,319 --> 00:57:09,900
matches power bi in the free and open

1308
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,940
world so you might just use Jupiter

1309
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:14,280
notebooks with ipyton widgets and some

1310
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,800
graphing libraries or kibana from the

1311
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,540
elastic stack

1312
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:19,200
um

1313
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:22,980
yeah and you need data data source so we

1314
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:25,859
use a SIM and EDR but in the elastic

1315
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:27,599
stack you have also elasticsearch and

1316
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:30,240
elastic defense that is built in and

1317
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:33,720
maybe susman or other D4 Linux and you

1318
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,880
should be able to get going and do some

1319
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,780
some of this stuff

1320
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,859
what are the takeaways and the future of

1321
00:57:40,859 --> 00:57:41,700
it

1322
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:42,540
um

1323
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:46,020
well they are cool it's pretty nice we

1324
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:48,059
use them every day

1325
00:57:48,059 --> 00:57:49,800
you need a good tactic and environment

1326
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,200
coverage like anything but especially a

1327
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,640
good taxi coverage if you want to build

1328
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,099
up incident from different step of the

1329
00:57:56,099 --> 00:57:58,559
kill chain or something like that you

1330
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,780
need to uh like don't just focus on the

1331
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:03,540
execution or defensivision you need like

1332
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:06,119
to get all the way uh all the tactic of

1333
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:07,980
the Mario attack

1334
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:10,500
um it does not replace alerts it's just

1335
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:13,260
for uh like the blind spot you have with

1336
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:15,180
alerts that you cannot like just trigger

1337
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:17,520
every time an alert you're using care

1338
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,859
instead but you should fall back like

1339
00:58:19,859 --> 00:58:22,700
it's only a fallback

1340
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,420
um you need a good maintenance uh like

1341
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:27,480
Mio I just show you uh showed you

1342
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,140
um

1343
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:30,359
if you don't do this maybe node is going

1344
00:58:30,359 --> 00:58:32,339
crazy and then you will have like a

1345
00:58:32,339 --> 00:58:34,160
forty thousand uh

1346
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:37,319
indicators per day and that's not good

1347
00:58:37,319 --> 00:58:38,579
so you have to tune them your

1348
00:58:38,579 --> 00:58:40,140
environment is changing your data

1349
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:42,299
sources are changing so yeah

1350
00:58:42,299 --> 00:58:46,740
and many views many scoring because some

1351
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:49,740
scoring or um just don't show up like

1352
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:52,559
some small noisy and attackers or

1353
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:55,440
traductor so you need the other way to

1354
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,760
just make them pop up

1355
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,559
the next steps we want automated

1356
00:59:01,559 --> 00:59:03,660
alerting based on like a certain

1357
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:05,280
increase in score

1358
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,160
um it's a host is behaving abnormally

1359
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,799
and it has like a spike and

1360
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:12,839
suspiciousness we want to open an alert

1361
00:59:12,839 --> 00:59:14,339
from this

1362
00:59:14,339 --> 00:59:16,799
we would want also an analyst feedback

1363
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:18,900
loop so um

1364
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:21,180
you know um if there's an indicator that

1365
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:22,980
is not quite good enough and the

1366
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:25,380
analysts just like say yes or no this is

1367
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:27,720
good this is not it labels data we can

1368
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:30,240
it help us tune the end scalers but also

1369
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,819
we might just use that for automated

1370
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:36,359
tuning or suggestion for exclusions and

1371
00:59:36,359 --> 00:59:38,520
um that would be great

1372
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,440
better end skaters and coverage just

1373
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:43,680
like any detection logic stuff

1374
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:47,220
and something like exploring a new

1375
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:48,480
scoring algorithm like something

1376
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,660
something ml or machinery

1377
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:54,660
and I hope this has inspired you for

1378
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,339
your detection Logics so thank you

1379
00:59:56,339 --> 00:59:57,810
thanks

1380
00:59:57,810 --> 01:00:06,570
[Applause]

1381
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:23,000
two two three

1382
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:31,939
wow

1383
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:36,559
I'm on

1384
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:43,260
testing testing there we go

1385
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:45,420
okay

1386
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:48,480
that was a great talk by Emilio and Remy

1387
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:49,980
that's a really cool project I'm really

1388
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:52,380
interested after Olaf's talk we're gonna

1389
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:54,059
have a little panel discussion and I I

1390
01:06:54,059 --> 01:06:55,200
want to try to dig into some of those

1391
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,760
some of the questions that I had during

1392
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,619
the presentation things like how are

1393
01:06:58,619 --> 01:07:00,660
they developing the scoring

1394
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:03,660
um you know certain topics like that our

1395
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:05,880
next speaker is Olaf Hartung all the way

1396
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,920
from from the Netherlands he's a

1397
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,960
security researcher at Falcon force and

1398
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:13,079
at Microsoft security MVP he specializes

1399
01:07:13,079 --> 01:07:14,940
in understanding the attacker tradecraft

1400
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:16,559
and thereby improving detection

1401
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:17,819
capabilities

1402
01:07:17,819 --> 01:07:19,799
he has a varied background in blue and

1403
01:07:19,799 --> 01:07:21,000
purple team operations network

1404
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,559
engineering and security transformation

1405
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:25,440
projects one of the things so Olaf's

1406
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,240
going to be talking about how they

1407
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:28,920
manage detection pipelines at

1408
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:31,200
falconforce and I think uh one of the

1409
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,780
really cool things that's uh about what

1410
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:34,619
they're doing is they're

1411
01:07:34,619 --> 01:07:36,059
professionalizing kind of detection

1412
01:07:36,059 --> 01:07:38,160
engineering so one of the big problems

1413
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,559
I'm a consultant in my day job and one

1414
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:41,460
of the problems that we run into

1415
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:43,319
especially with threat hunting who here

1416
01:07:43,319 --> 01:07:45,480
does threat hunting or interacts with

1417
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:47,339
threat Hunters one of the the big

1418
01:07:47,339 --> 01:07:48,960
problems my original background in the

1419
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:50,460
Air Force was I was on the Air Force

1420
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:52,619
hunt team and so I'm kind of kind of

1421
01:07:52,619 --> 01:07:54,660
been around that for you know 15 years

1422
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:56,880
or something and the the thing that we

1423
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,319
run into is there's a lot of ad hoc

1424
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:00,480
nature and threat hunting and there's oh

1425
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,640
there's often a lot of tension between

1426
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,920
the sock and threat hunters and the the

1427
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:06,539
problem comes in that the sock is

1428
01:08:06,539 --> 01:08:08,760
responsible for security all the time

1429
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:10,619
and threat hunters get to kind of take

1430
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:13,319
this you know smaller scope problem and

1431
01:08:13,319 --> 01:08:15,960
be more focused right and one of the the

1432
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:18,359
big issues that from my experience that

1433
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:21,620
causes that tension is this issue where

1434
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:24,540
they're not feeding their output back

1435
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:26,939
into the steady state right and so one

1436
01:08:26,939 --> 01:08:28,198
of the things that Olaf's going to be

1437
01:08:28,198 --> 01:08:29,819
talking about is how do you manage the

1438
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:31,380
steady state how do you make sure that

1439
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:32,580
things are working how do you make sure

1440
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:35,040
that uh everything that you've deployed

1441
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,380
is operating as expected and so I'll let

1442
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:38,939
you take it away from there buddy thanks

1443
01:08:38,939 --> 01:08:40,140
man

1444
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:43,259
right so this is the longest title that

1445
01:08:43,259 --> 01:08:44,759
could fit on the slide

1446
01:08:44,759 --> 01:08:46,560
um basically they thought we're talking

1447
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,839
about detection as code

1448
01:08:48,839 --> 01:08:51,600
um so already Jared introduced me so

1449
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,000
I'll keep it very short

1450
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,679
um my name is Olaf

1451
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,719
I like warm hugs

1452
01:08:57,719 --> 01:08:59,939
um I'm a father of two boys and I used

1453
01:08:59,939 --> 01:09:01,560
to be a documentary photographer so I

1454
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:03,839
never went to school for cyber

1455
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:06,899
um doesn't really matter I guess

1456
01:09:06,899 --> 01:09:08,520
um it proves what you do with it so I

1457
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:09,899
I'm a tax engineering security

1458
01:09:09,899 --> 01:09:11,939
researcher and that's kind of important

1459
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:14,420
for the rest of the contacts as well

1460
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:17,640
and I work at work at Falcon Force I'm

1461
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,380
actually one of the founders of it it's

1462
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:21,359
a Dutch based company but we provide

1463
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:23,460
services globally where we

1464
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:27,000
are one team as red and blue so we're

1465
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,698
short of a purple company

1466
01:09:28,698 --> 01:09:31,380
and that allows us to do a lot of the

1467
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:34,319
things that we that we do also in this

1468
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:36,660
talk so what you can expect here is

1469
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:38,580
basically why we started doing the

1470
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:40,439
detection s code bit

1471
01:09:40,439 --> 01:09:43,198
what does it mean to us

1472
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:46,380
um how we document a store and process

1473
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:49,198
and analyze everything what are some of

1474
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:51,000
the benefits of that and then I'll also

1475
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,819
how that can enable you to do automatic

1476
01:09:53,819 --> 01:09:56,040
validation and

1477
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:59,160
to start off a little bit there is is we

1478
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:01,560
we have a division that's called Falcon

1479
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:03,600
for Sentry and basically that's doing

1480
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,620
the

1481
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:07,020
the tech analyze and response bit for

1482
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:09,840
our clients and that starts out with the

1483
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,880
most basic model that everybody knows

1484
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:13,980
right so you have all kinds of stuff

1485
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:16,260
that generates Telemetry there's all

1486
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:17,760
kinds of automated detection Logic on

1487
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,500
top of that that generates alerts or

1488
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:22,679
indicators and they boil down into an

1489
01:10:22,679 --> 01:10:25,380
incident hopefully

1490
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:27,000
um but there's there's some issues with

1491
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,560
that that's what's already alluded to in

1492
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,239
the previous talk

1493
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:32,460
um so stock content is relatively easy

1494
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:34,380
to bypass every red teamer can buy an

1495
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:37,320
EDR test whatever he wants to do and

1496
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:39,480
knows that he can't be he can bypass

1497
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:42,000
everything that's also what we do

1498
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:42,719
um

1499
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:44,340
and then on top of that there's all

1500
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:45,900
kinds of time Wasted by repetitive

1501
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:48,719
alerts alert fatiguez was explained to

1502
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:50,280
the previous talk so that saves me some

1503
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:51,179
time

1504
01:10:51,179 --> 01:10:53,340
but we're also not utilizing all of the

1505
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:55,500
Telemetry that all of these tools

1506
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,840
provide us and we don't know how well

1507
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,520
it's working and if it's even working at

1508
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:02,400
all so that's why we started expanding

1509
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,560
that model into all of those additional

1510
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,179
green blocks that we're doing right so

1511
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:07,679
we're building a lot of custom content

1512
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:09,480
we're doing risk-based analysis and

1513
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:12,179
scoring on top of that we're building an

1514
01:11:12,179 --> 01:11:14,040
engine that can automatically enrich

1515
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,620
everything based on entities but also on

1516
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:19,080
context so maybe Bloodhounds or other

1517
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:21,239
stuff will be used into those factors

1518
01:11:21,239 --> 01:11:23,460
but that's not why I'm here right I'm

1519
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:25,380
talking about the automatic deployments

1520
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:28,380
and the replay of attack bit today

1521
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:30,480
so it's one of the aspects in our whole

1522
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:33,179
ecosystem that we provide so the

1523
01:11:33,179 --> 01:11:36,300
detection is code is basically removing

1524
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:38,159
some of the challenges that I alluded to

1525
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:42,300
earlier so who changed this Rule and

1526
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:43,860
what was actually changed right because

1527
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:46,380
an analyst if it runs in a Sim can

1528
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:49,440
relatively easily make a modification

1529
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:52,080
that Tunes something which might

1530
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,000
actually break the whole detection or

1531
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,640
create all kinds of false negatives for

1532
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,320
that matter

1533
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,420
um but also if if I want to make a

1534
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:02,340
change what will it actually work will

1535
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:04,620
it break these kind of things so those

1536
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:06,420
uncertainties will be partially

1537
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:09,000
addressed there and also knowing like

1538
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,460
hey when was this rule implemented and

1539
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,440
what was actually changed the last time

1540
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,239
we made a modification and what was that

1541
01:12:15,239 --> 01:12:17,640
and when was that

1542
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:19,800
um and it allows you to also ensure some

1543
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:22,500
of the quality of the detections uh

1544
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,780
follow best practices you might want to

1545
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:27,000
follow and also keep the documentation

1546
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,440
up to date because nobody does that

1547
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:31,140
right so we all want to do it but we're

1548
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:32,699
all too busy to actually keep track of

1549
01:12:32,699 --> 01:12:34,860
it and if it's still working that's

1550
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:36,600
maybe even more important are the data

1551
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,219
source is still there is the detection

1552
01:12:38,219 --> 01:12:40,020
actually detecting the attack that I

1553
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:42,060
wrote it for so all these kind of things

1554
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:43,800
we want to address

1555
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,679
so detection has code to us as Falcon

1556
01:12:46,679 --> 01:12:47,940
Force but basically most of the

1557
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:49,679
community will probably follow a Sim

1558
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:52,020
similar thing is we we follow an agile

1559
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:53,400
process just to keep everything

1560
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:54,659
organized

1561
01:12:54,659 --> 01:12:56,880
we use a simple language as a markup

1562
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:00,120
language for all of our detection logic

1563
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,640
and we plan for reusability and this is

1564
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,500
very important to us because we provide

1565
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:06,420
a service test Consultants but even in

1566
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:08,360
an internal organization you might have

1567
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:11,159
multiple levels of detections running in

1568
01:13:11,159 --> 01:13:13,080
different environments or you did an

1569
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:15,120
acquisition and you got merch or Sims

1570
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:16,800
yet so you have to deploy it on two

1571
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,780
places and you don't want to copy paste

1572
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:20,040
everything

1573
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,620
Version Control as I started talking

1574
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:25,100
about earlier is super important

1575
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:29,040
and it's driven by automation because

1576
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,920
we're a small company we're also

1577
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:33,300
um yeah kind of

1578
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:35,640
tending to over engineer things for the

1579
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,260
better because we want to do cool stuff

1580
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:39,659
instead of replicating basic basic

1581
01:13:39,659 --> 01:13:41,880
actions the whole time and the unit

1582
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,020
testing

1583
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:45,840
based on realistic alerts so we're not

1584
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,940
generating base Telemetry we're actually

1585
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:50,540
executing attacks constantly

1586
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:53,940
automatically because then we actually

1587
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:55,800
know that it's doing what we expect it

1588
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,960
to be doing instead of triggering on a

1589
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:59,640
base set that we generated at some

1590
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,440
points that might not be realistic for

1591
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:04,679
the new way of attacking it

1592
01:14:04,679 --> 01:14:07,260
so from that agile process it's it's

1593
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:09,960
it's mostly common uh as everything

1594
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:12,239
right so we have a backlog we prioritize

1595
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:15,420
we write dedicated documentation per

1596
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:16,940
detection

1597
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:19,560
then we test and review all these

1598
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:21,540
changes so we test it in our lab

1599
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,159
environment where we have basically a

1600
01:14:23,159 --> 01:14:25,620
small Enterprise that we simulate

1601
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:28,500
and we review all the changes so if I

1602
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:29,880
write a new detection or make a

1603
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:31,560
modification then one of my colleagues

1604
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:33,900
actually has to look at what I did to

1605
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:35,540
make sure that we're just

1606
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:38,159
doing the right things and not missing

1607
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:39,600
anything

1608
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,640
and like every agile process we have

1609
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,320
some stand-ups which is like 15 minutes

1610
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:45,120
twice a week so it's not it's not over

1611
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,340
over complicated there where we also

1612
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:49,440
track progress have some discussions and

1613
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,179
and some planning sessions

1614
01:14:51,179 --> 01:14:53,340
and then we also organize our

1615
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:55,020
maintenance there because feedback from

1616
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:56,940
research or from developing detections

1617
01:14:56,940 --> 01:14:58,440
is actually super important for the

1618
01:14:58,440 --> 01:14:59,820
maintenance of the whole stack because

1619
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:01,020
they might have found a new way of

1620
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:02,640
detecting something or have a more

1621
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,080
optimized way of the query language

1622
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,520
these kind of things that we can then

1623
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:08,400
factor in into all of our other ones if

1624
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,620
we want so from a

1625
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:13,020
very simplified example I have a new

1626
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:14,760
idea for a detection I put it on the

1627
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:17,159
backlog that gets planned in the

1628
01:15:17,159 --> 01:15:19,199
planning session and there we might

1629
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:21,179
during a detection or a discussion

1630
01:15:21,179 --> 01:15:22,980
already figure out hey this is not

1631
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:24,600
feasible we're not going to be able to

1632
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:27,659
do that so we abandoned it immediately

1633
01:15:27,659 --> 01:15:29,520
um otherwise it moves on to the r d

1634
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:31,620
phase where we are starting to replicate

1635
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:34,320
that attack looking at the Telemetry and

1636
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:37,140
and basically writing a detection for

1637
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:39,179
that which still can go wrong right

1638
01:15:39,179 --> 01:15:40,920
there can be all kinds of reasons why we

1639
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:42,780
can either abandon it because we can't

1640
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:44,880
have the Telemetry for it in a feasible

1641
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:48,360
way or it gets blocked because

1642
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:51,060
for whatever reason the Telemetry is not

1643
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:54,000
there yet but it will be so then it gets

1644
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,820
blocked and we put it on a backlog later

1645
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:58,980
or we abandon it at some point because

1646
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:00,480
it takes too long or it's not that

1647
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:01,980
prevalent anymore

1648
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:04,199
but let's say we actually succeed which

1649
01:16:04,199 --> 01:16:06,600
usually is the case fortunately

1650
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:09,300
um we write our detection and we commit

1651
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:12,480
uh to get do a pull requests and it goes

1652
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,100
into the review and testing mode so

1653
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:15,480
basically we already automatically

1654
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:16,980
deploy it which I'll show you in a sec

1655
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:19,860
to our test environment where some

1656
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:22,560
colleague can actually review it look at

1657
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,120
the outputs look at how it's running

1658
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,460
look at the performance and the quality

1659
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:29,340
of the code and the documentation

1660
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:32,040
and in some cases there might be some

1661
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:34,020
feedback where it has to go back into r

1662
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:37,980
d to improve or modify or make some

1663
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:39,960
altercation and then it can still be

1664
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,280
abandoned right so that's always the

1665
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:44,100
case and if it's okay then everything is

1666
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:46,440
Happy everything is fine it gets

1667
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:48,900
accepted into the main repo and it gets

1668
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:52,560
deployed to one or multiple environments

1669
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:55,440
so no surprise there we use a kanban

1670
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:56,940
board where we have

1671
01:16:56,940 --> 01:16:59,159
the whole the whole flow that I just

1672
01:16:59,159 --> 01:17:01,560
alluded to into multiple slim Lanes so

1673
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:04,260
we have a swim Lane for use cases we

1674
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:06,420
have one for our Tech scripts we have

1675
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:08,820
one for maintenance and we have one for

1676
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:12,120
our enrichments and Analysis pipeline

1677
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:14,659
which didn't fit the screenshot

1678
01:17:14,659 --> 01:17:18,120
and then we go into that file format so

1679
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:20,940
make it as simple to maintain as

1680
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:23,040
possible you can have Json and all kinds

1681
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,980
of funky stuff we work in the Azure

1682
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:28,080
environment primarily so we use custo as

1683
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,300
a language and they use Arm templates to

1684
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:33,420
deploy it which is a huge Json file

1685
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:35,880
which is horrible to maintain so we we

1686
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:37,739
chose the ammo because it's super simple

1687
01:17:37,739 --> 01:17:40,500
we can still programmatically look at it

1688
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:42,420
and process it

1689
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:45,420
so from there try to be as expressive

1690
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:47,699
and simple as possible and plan for the

1691
01:17:47,699 --> 01:17:49,620
code to reuse that's also give an

1692
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:51,480
example for

1693
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:54,300
and we can we can have like codes we

1694
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:56,820
reuse but also all kinds of lookup lists

1695
01:17:56,820 --> 01:17:58,320
so we have a list of the low batch

1696
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:00,420
projects we can just have that in a

1697
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:02,219
single place and not put it into all of

1698
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:04,080
our detections because that's way much

1699
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,520
more work to maintain than if you have

1700
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,560
it in the central place you only have to

1701
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:09,420
maintain it once but these kind of

1702
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:12,239
simple things are super nice and then

1703
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:14,340
since we use yamo we can actually build

1704
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:18,000
a schema for our whole documents so we

1705
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,100
can validate it programmatically but

1706
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:22,440
also it's super easy to maintain it

1707
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,120
because you can only choose from a

1708
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:26,640
couple of options on some of the fields

1709
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:27,659
foreign

1710
01:18:27,659 --> 01:18:29,820
and then the next one is also designed

1711
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:32,100
for the ability to to deploy to multiple

1712
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:34,080
environments even if you only have one

1713
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:37,080
sim now as I explained earlier you might

1714
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,120
acquire a company or merge or whatever

1715
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:42,480
wanted to run in test and prods you can

1716
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:45,420
you can actually do that easier if you

1717
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:47,760
do that this way so what does it look

1718
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,679
like so so we have some identifiers in

1719
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:51,179
our in our document right you need to

1720
01:18:51,179 --> 01:18:53,280
give it a name you need to give an ID

1721
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:54,900
and the ID is basically what it will

1722
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:57,300
look like in the Sim in the end

1723
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:59,340
then we tag it with all kinds of stuff

1724
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:01,800
so we we call boosted back or suspicious

1725
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,120
Behavior you can you can basically make

1726
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,560
up the list yourself

1727
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,480
we have some qualifiers in which

1728
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:09,900
operating system are for expected false

1729
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:12,120
positive rate based on on our experience

1730
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:14,100
the severity if we want to give to it

1731
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:16,679
and of course miter tags for tactic

1732
01:19:16,679 --> 01:19:19,260
technique and sub techniques

1733
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:21,960
next we also provide a list of data

1734
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:24,179
sources that the query utilizes so that

1735
01:19:24,179 --> 01:19:27,120
we can validate fairly easily if if the

1736
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:29,520
data is even available so we we do a

1737
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:31,140
little provider so where does it come

1738
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:34,620
from which event ID or event name or

1739
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:37,380
action type whatever it's called which

1740
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:39,179
table it goes into

1741
01:19:39,179 --> 01:19:41,940
and then also again the moderate Tech

1742
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:44,460
data source components that they that

1743
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:45,900
they classify with that

1744
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:47,820
so that we can generate overviews which

1745
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:50,100
I'll show you later then the the

1746
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:51,960
everybody's favorite bit is the

1747
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,460
documentation especially the analysts

1748
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:55,380
will love you if you do it as well where

1749
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:57,300
we have a brief technical description of

1750
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:59,820
what the query actually tries to do a

1751
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:01,860
description of the attack so what does

1752
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:04,199
the attacker want to achieve with its

1753
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:06,120
attacks or what do are we looking at

1754
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:08,219
some considerations which could be

1755
01:20:08,219 --> 01:20:11,580
anything for the analysts to be aware of

1756
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:13,620
some known false positive so that's

1757
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:16,380
easier to to classify some known blind

1758
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:18,179
spots because you can you can tailor a

1759
01:20:18,179 --> 01:20:19,380
detection in a specific Direction

1760
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:21,900
knowing that you're not looking at that

1761
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:22,800
bit

1762
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,719
so you can classify that there right so

1763
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:26,760
we know that we're only focusing on this

1764
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:28,980
the other thing is addressed in either

1765
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:30,840
that detection or we don't do it because

1766
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:32,580
of x y z

1767
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:34,679
and then a basic response plan and of

1768
01:20:34,679 --> 01:20:36,500
course that depends on your

1769
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:39,480
internal requirements what you want to

1770
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:41,880
do with this for one client we build

1771
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,860
even a whole Playbook design in there

1772
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:46,380
which was automatically be deployed into

1773
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:48,300
their Confluence instances with graphs

1774
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:50,280
and everything so this can be very

1775
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:52,500
flexible

1776
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:54,420
um we also maintain a change log within

1777
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:56,880
the detection so that we know what was

1778
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,219
changed when and what the impact of that

1779
01:20:59,219 --> 01:21:01,380
change might be again this is for

1780
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:03,120
multiple environment tracking extremely

1781
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,880
useful but even for generic overview so

1782
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:07,500
you can at least have some basic

1783
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:09,540
indication what was changed without

1784
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:10,980
having to go through the whole commit

1785
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:13,159
log

1786
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:14,580
um then some basic deployment

1787
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:15,960
information so where do we want to

1788
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:17,520
deploy it so the language in this case

1789
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,380
is custom but it could also be SPL or

1790
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:20,760
whatever you like

1791
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:23,340
the platform that we intended it to be

1792
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:24,659
deployed to so in this case it's

1793
01:21:24,659 --> 01:21:27,239
Defender for endpoints but we can also

1794
01:21:27,239 --> 01:21:29,040
deploy it to Sentinel and then we can

1795
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:31,440
have some some of the how often should

1796
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,000
it run which entities should be

1797
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,620
extracted these kind of information to

1798
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:36,000
it

1799
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,440
and then of course the most important

1800
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,600
bit is the query so this is a relatively

1801
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,159
simple example just to make it a bit

1802
01:21:41,159 --> 01:21:43,980
legible and we use some some ginger

1803
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:46,320
formatting that I'll show you later and

1804
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,380
I'll explain why

1805
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:50,219
because this is where it becomes

1806
01:21:50,219 --> 01:21:52,800
powerful with the detection as code

1807
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,780
and then you get basically a structure

1808
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:56,880
like this so I mentioned the schema

1809
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,800
support already and this is kind of nice

1810
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,780
because in vs code there's already a way

1811
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:03,300
that it knows hey for permissions

1812
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:05,520
required you can only use this so if you

1813
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,320
type anything else you'll get an error

1814
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:10,500
so you can't even fully commit it yet

1815
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:13,320
and it also makes it easier right so you

1816
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:16,140
know I can type this you can just select

1817
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:17,520
it and click

1818
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,860
so that Ginger templating that I

1819
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:21,179
mentioned

1820
01:22:21,179 --> 01:22:22,860
um this is where I this is what I really

1821
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:25,679
really like is is so Ginger is basically

1822
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:28,260
about a python module that you can use

1823
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:30,420
and allows you for templating so all the

1824
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:32,520
green bits are basically template blocks

1825
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:35,699
which we can automatically replace in

1826
01:22:35,699 --> 01:22:37,920
our Pipeline and we can even specify

1827
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:40,320
defaults so in the that doesn't work but

1828
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:41,760
in the Top Line you see a time frame

1829
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:44,219
with a default of one hour

1830
01:22:44,219 --> 01:22:47,100
so if I don't specify this at all it

1831
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:48,420
will take the default that's basically

1832
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:49,800
sort of what you have to get from that

1833
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,739
and then we can we can have also even if

1834
01:22:52,739 --> 01:22:54,300
else statements if we want to make it

1835
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:56,100
really fancy so we can we can actually

1836
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:59,460
be super flexible so in example one we

1837
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:01,620
have a customer that doesn't want to

1838
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:03,420
exclude or does want to exclude the

1839
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:05,880
servers and there's some filtering for

1840
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,800
their environment there

1841
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:09,780
so when we run the pipeline we basically

1842
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:11,699
get output like this so the time frame

1843
01:23:11,699 --> 01:23:13,560
wasn't specified here so it uses the

1844
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:15,480
default

1845
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:17,760
um also the initiators one uses the

1846
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:20,040
defaults and then it adds those two

1847
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:22,199
green lines that were mentioned here as

1848
01:23:22,199 --> 01:23:23,460
a post filter

1849
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:25,020
and it will generate the rest of it

1850
01:23:25,020 --> 01:23:28,140
because the the exclusive service is

1851
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:31,020
true so this whole block gets added too

1852
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:32,820
for client two

1853
01:23:32,820 --> 01:23:35,880
they want it to only run every four

1854
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:38,460
hours they don't want to exclude the

1855
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:40,140
servers

1856
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:42,239
and they have Powershell added to it so

1857
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:44,640
basically when we ran it there it looks

1858
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:46,020
very different right even though the

1859
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:48,120
same base query is there we can make it

1860
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:51,239
extremely flexible this way which makes

1861
01:23:51,239 --> 01:23:53,400
it also way easier to maintain because

1862
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:55,560
we only have to maintain this bit and

1863
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:57,060
then two clients get a new detection

1864
01:23:57,060 --> 01:24:00,420
that's sort of why we started doing this

1865
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:02,340
and this is also where Version Control

1866
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:05,100
becomes very useful because we can track

1867
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:07,400
all changes for your commits we can

1868
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:10,980
enforce or at least have peer reviews so

1869
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:12,360
we can yeah depending on your

1870
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:14,159
organization and your procedures you can

1871
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:15,659
enforce it or not but you can also make

1872
01:24:15,659 --> 01:24:19,260
the sort of agreement that hey you never

1873
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:21,300
push your own

1874
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:23,520
stuff into the master Branch or main

1875
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:24,679
branch

1876
01:24:24,679 --> 01:24:27,480
unless it's extremely important whatever

1877
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:30,840
there should be a fallback mechanism

1878
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:33,300
and this allows also so if I make a

1879
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:36,480
mistake actually instantly push it I can

1880
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:39,320
roll it back as well

1881
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:43,199
and the awesome bit here is we have one

1882
01:24:43,199 --> 01:24:45,179
single source of Truth now so

1883
01:24:45,179 --> 01:24:47,640
if an analyst for whatever reason makes

1884
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:49,380
an adjustment in production

1885
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:52,800
our pipeline will override it

1886
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:56,100
so the the the chance of faultiness is

1887
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:57,960
way lower this way

1888
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:00,179
and that also allows all kinds of cool

1889
01:25:00,179 --> 01:25:02,699
stuff because now we have it in gits we

1890
01:25:02,699 --> 01:25:05,040
can do cicd based stuff where we can do

1891
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:06,679
all kinds of actions automatic

1892
01:25:06,679 --> 01:25:10,020
deployments but also validations on it

1893
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:11,880
so yeah this is basically what it looks

1894
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,080
like right you have all kinds of nice

1895
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:14,520
plugins for vs codes where you can

1896
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,320
actually see who made that commits and

1897
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:19,020
what they did when they did it and this

1898
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:21,060
is basically how it looks on our end so

1899
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:23,460
we can see that syntax validation and

1900
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:25,800
the deployment was successful so the

1901
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:27,420
review already knows how to code at

1902
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:29,880
least ran and is up to our standards and

1903
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,440
then still has a look at it to see if

1904
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,840
also the detection is

1905
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:36,000
and this is where we go more into the

1906
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,640
automatic validation and deployment bit

1907
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:41,820
so from a pipeline perspective it's kind

1908
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:43,800
of nice because it enforces or it

1909
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:46,380
enables us I'm not sure reinforces but

1910
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:48,840
it enables us to do static and dynamic

1911
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:51,179
testing of every detection that we built

1912
01:25:51,179 --> 01:25:53,219
so we can do linting we have a language

1913
01:25:53,219 --> 01:25:55,560
Surfer and we can have all kinds of

1914
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:58,159
practice checks built into our

1915
01:25:58,159 --> 01:26:00,179
validation so that we don't have to do

1916
01:26:00,179 --> 01:26:01,739
that manually every time because people

1917
01:26:01,739 --> 01:26:05,780
Overlook stuff everybody's busy

1918
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:08,219
and it also allows us to be sure that

1919
01:26:08,219 --> 01:26:10,620
all environments that we talk to are

1920
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:13,620
running the version that we want

1921
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:15,420
and and of course best of all it

1922
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:17,520
generates all kinds of documentation

1923
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:19,679
playbooks whatever and puts into the

1924
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:21,600
place that you wanted

1925
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:25,739
so and last but not least is also that

1926
01:26:25,739 --> 01:26:27,719
it allows for automatic detection

1927
01:26:27,719 --> 01:26:30,360
validation in most cases and in most

1928
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:32,880
cases some attacks are very hard to

1929
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:35,699
script you can't sometimes script it or

1930
01:26:35,699 --> 01:26:37,199
it requires security permissions that

1931
01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:38,760
you don't want to have a pipeline have

1932
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,860
like nobody wants Global admin on their

1933
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:43,860
pipeline in Azure devops because there's

1934
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:45,480
all kinds of nice Tech techniques that

1935
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:47,760
you can then apply to it

1936
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,739
so basically per environment we have

1937
01:26:49,739 --> 01:26:52,739
four separate pipelines so one that does

1938
01:26:52,739 --> 01:26:55,440
the test cases so does the attacks one

1939
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,480
that analyzes the attacks

1940
01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:01,440
one does a standard outputs to get and

1941
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:04,679
one that is doing all of the other magic

1942
01:27:04,679 --> 01:27:06,659
uh we called Hatchery because we're

1943
01:27:06,659 --> 01:27:08,639
Falcon force and we have a lot of eggs

1944
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:10,620
so

1945
01:27:10,620 --> 01:27:12,600
um basically what what we have is every

1946
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:14,760
pipeline has multiple stages so in the

1947
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:16,920
first stage we validate the syntax the

1948
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:18,840
second stage we deploy it

1949
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:21,060
to our ball pits basically our lab

1950
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:23,159
environments and we do a dry run

1951
01:27:23,159 --> 01:27:24,600
deployment to our production

1952
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:27,120
environments where we only

1953
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:29,280
feed it and see if it's not complaining

1954
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,199
basically because sometimes the data I

1955
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:32,880
brought is different than the lab so we

1956
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,199
want to make sure that it works on both

1957
01:27:34,199 --> 01:27:37,320
sides then there's a boss that currently

1958
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:38,820
visualize but basically they are just a

1959
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:42,060
refill bit if the review is accepted the

1960
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:44,880
wiki is deployed or updated and is

1961
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,860
deployed into production and enabled and

1962
01:27:46,860 --> 01:27:48,239
these kind of things

1963
01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:50,760
so from a from a pipeline perspective

1964
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:52,980
there's all kinds of steps so you can

1965
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:55,679
see that it's validated all detections

1966
01:27:55,679 --> 01:27:57,780
and no warnings so on a warning it will

1967
01:27:57,780 --> 01:28:00,179
be complain but it will move on but we

1968
01:28:00,179 --> 01:28:01,860
can also generate errors based on

1969
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:05,159
whatever is in there

1970
01:28:05,159 --> 01:28:06,540
um and that's the same on the deployment

1971
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:09,179
side so nowadays it checks whether the

1972
01:28:09,179 --> 01:28:11,460
rules already there and it's the same as

1973
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:13,739
what we wanted to deploy and then

1974
01:28:13,739 --> 01:28:15,480
skipping it if it's a new one it will

1975
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:17,460
just deploy what's new if there's

1976
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:19,199
something different it will actually

1977
01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:20,520
pull it

1978
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:22,260
store it in the log

1979
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:24,659
and then push the new stuff because

1980
01:28:24,659 --> 01:28:27,420
that's what we agreed right the get bit

1981
01:28:27,420 --> 01:28:29,520
is our single source of truth but at

1982
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,560
least we record what was there we've got

1983
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:33,780
so even if it's a small change we know

1984
01:28:33,780 --> 01:28:35,820
that somebody made a change we can have

1985
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:38,820
a look at it and we can actually yeah we

1986
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:40,199
can either decide whether we want to

1987
01:28:40,199 --> 01:28:42,360
include it into our into our git repo or

1988
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:44,760
not or talk to the person who's like hey

1989
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:46,500
why did you do it there we

1990
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:48,659
so it's just a nice check

1991
01:28:48,659 --> 01:28:50,639
and then the same goes for the update of

1992
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:52,620
the wiki and the deployment of the

1993
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:54,120
production environment so those are are

1994
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:55,920
way simpler because we already checked

1995
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:56,760
everything

1996
01:28:56,760 --> 01:29:00,120
so some of the errors are are there not

1997
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:02,280
not the easiest to read but once you get

1998
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:03,840
used to this flow

1999
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:06,480
uh where uh we're we're actually quite

2000
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:08,760
flexible there and it will already tell

2001
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:10,320
you like hey some of the things are

2002
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:12,600
missing or whatever so we made some

2003
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:13,860
changes to that to make it more

2004
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:15,300
user-friendly

2005
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:17,040
one of the other things that we have in

2006
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:19,679
the pipeline next to a linting bit is we

2007
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:21,600
built a language server for Cousteau

2008
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:24,480
which is the query language that we use

2009
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:27,000
and we can do offline schema validation

2010
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,860
and it enables us to do some other

2011
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:30,120
things so basically what it does it

2012
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:31,500
automatically gets all the documentation

2013
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:33,060
for Microsoft

2014
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:35,280
updates a schema that it's actually

2015
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:36,540
working against so it's sort of

2016
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:39,179
emulating a sentinel or a Defender for

2017
01:29:39,179 --> 01:29:40,940
endpoint instance

2018
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:44,280
which allows us to build some additional

2019
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:46,260
custom parcels and things in in it as

2020
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:46,980
well

2021
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:49,080
and that's what I just said

2022
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:50,940
so we open sourced it and we also host

2023
01:29:50,940 --> 01:29:52,800
an instance which you can run in your

2024
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,780
own pipeline if you want we don't log

2025
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:55,760
anything

2026
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:58,080
so we don't want to know what you're

2027
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:59,940
doing with it

2028
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:01,620
um and basically what that does is it

2029
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:03,480
uses those arm templates that I started

2030
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:05,460
out with so how you deploy it to

2031
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:08,219
Microsoft you also push it against this

2032
01:30:08,219 --> 01:30:09,620
API

2033
01:30:09,620 --> 01:30:12,179
which basically says with environment in

2034
01:30:12,179 --> 01:30:14,880
it the query itself and and of course a

2035
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:16,980
lot of other stuff but it ignores that

2036
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:19,440
and you can just feed it into the API

2037
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:22,080
with the simplest query ever

2038
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:24,120
and it gives a lot of outputs so we

2039
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:26,280
can't read this so one of the things it

2040
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:28,260
does is it tells you which columns are

2041
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:30,120
coming out of your query so what is the

2042
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:33,120
result in fields that you get back and

2043
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:35,280
why do you want that is basically if if

2044
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:37,080
I

2045
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:39,960
expect something as an analyst or I have

2046
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:43,199
entity mappings or other stuff in my in

2047
01:30:43,199 --> 01:30:45,179
my detection logic

2048
01:30:45,179 --> 01:30:47,340
and in my documentation then you want to

2049
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:49,139
make sure that's actually there

2050
01:30:49,139 --> 01:30:51,900
but it will also do all kinds of parsing

2051
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:53,400
errors so if there's an error in your

2052
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:55,980
query it will already tell you here

2053
01:30:55,980 --> 01:30:57,719
before it actually goes into a

2054
01:30:57,719 --> 01:31:00,300
production instance or test instance and

2055
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:02,100
also it tells you some some other nice

2056
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:04,199
things is which which tables you're

2057
01:31:04,199 --> 01:31:07,380
working with and which reference columns

2058
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:09,420
basically which columns are you querying

2059
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:11,699
so so if you don't have that data then

2060
01:31:11,699 --> 01:31:14,400
it will start complaining about it and

2061
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:16,380
afterwards it will start generating all

2062
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:18,300
kinds of documentation overview so we

2063
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:20,580
have a sort of a list of all of our

2064
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:22,380
detections which platforms they're using

2065
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:23,940
and these kind of things it's not the

2066
01:31:23,940 --> 01:31:26,100
most pretty but it's super efficient

2067
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:28,320
and per clients we also generated an

2068
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:31,080
overview of which version are they

2069
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:34,020
running what is the latest version

2070
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:36,000
um what how it's called in their

2071
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,679
environment when was it published what's

2072
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:39,780
the status of it and does it need

2073
01:31:39,780 --> 01:31:42,060
updating because in some cases the

2074
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:43,739
client actually might want to have an

2075
01:31:43,739 --> 01:31:45,659
older version because they're still

2076
01:31:45,659 --> 01:31:48,480
running I know 40 Nets from five years

2077
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:49,620
ago where the scheme is actually

2078
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:52,080
different than the one that is in our

2079
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:53,820
current detection so we want to have

2080
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:56,699
that flexibility there

2081
01:31:56,699 --> 01:31:58,199
um and then what we started adding as

2082
01:31:58,199 --> 01:32:01,679
well because Wiki is nice but Bordeaux

2083
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:03,600
is nicer so we built a portal that

2084
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,580
automatically generated every time we

2085
01:32:05,580 --> 01:32:07,620
merge something into the main branch

2086
01:32:07,620 --> 01:32:10,080
where we can have all kinds of easier

2087
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:12,420
dissections so we can quickly see hey do

2088
01:32:12,420 --> 01:32:14,880
we have a detection for AWS and they can

2089
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:16,440
just click it and get a list of an

2090
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:18,659
overview and you get a prettier version

2091
01:32:18,659 --> 01:32:21,060
of the documentation just rendered this

2092
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:23,639
way it's all marked down on the back end

2093
01:32:23,639 --> 01:32:26,040
so it's it's the same and might be a bit

2094
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:28,020
familiar but it's a little bit

2095
01:32:28,020 --> 01:32:30,000
friendlier to look at

2096
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,860
and of course we can also generate all

2097
01:32:31,860 --> 01:32:34,440
these nice fancy heat maps and we color

2098
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:37,860
it based on prevalence of detections so

2099
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:39,780
the darker the color the more detections

2100
01:32:39,780 --> 01:32:41,580
we have for it because you can't always

2101
01:32:41,580 --> 01:32:44,639
cover everything in one detection right

2102
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:47,040
and then last bit is basically the unit

2103
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:48,780
testing so now we build all these

2104
01:32:48,780 --> 01:32:51,000
detections we roll them out but how do

2105
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,100
we know they're working

2106
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:55,080
so that we had we had a couple of goals

2107
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:57,060
in mind so we want to make sure that the

2108
01:32:57,060 --> 01:32:59,100
agent actually is logging

2109
01:32:59,100 --> 01:33:01,679
the events that we expect when an attack

2110
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:03,719
is happening because otherwise how can

2111
01:33:03,719 --> 01:33:06,420
you detect it the format of the logging

2112
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:08,760
is still consistent like the 49 example

2113
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:10,440
but it can be for anything also

2114
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:12,480
Microsoft has a tendency to sometimes

2115
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:15,659
change schemas and not always be super

2116
01:33:15,659 --> 01:33:18,179
exact in their way of logging so we want

2117
01:33:18,179 --> 01:33:19,739
to yeah make sure that it's actually

2118
01:33:19,739 --> 01:33:22,020
still doing what we expect it to do

2119
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:24,300
but also if are they even arriving so

2120
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:25,980
yeah if it doesn't arrive there and it's

2121
01:33:25,980 --> 01:33:28,739
generated what's the point of having it

2122
01:33:28,739 --> 01:33:30,780
um and and then the last one is also if

2123
01:33:30,780 --> 01:33:33,060
is there an out of the box it's kind of

2124
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:34,980
doing weird is there an out-of-the-box

2125
01:33:34,980 --> 01:33:37,080
detection coming from the Dr for

2126
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:38,880
instance now on a detection that we also

2127
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:41,040
wrote so that we can have a difference

2128
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:43,500
to see hey does it actually make sense

2129
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:45,540
to keep it because maybe

2130
01:33:45,540 --> 01:33:47,580
out of the box detection is is equally

2131
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:49,260
good so we can deprecate one of our own

2132
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:51,480
detections savings on compute time and

2133
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:53,760
maintenance hassle

2134
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:55,260
um and ideally

2135
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:57,960
each use case can have like at least one

2136
01:33:57,960 --> 01:33:59,880
of the test cases that we have sometimes

2137
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:01,620
it has multiple because an attack can be

2138
01:34:01,620 --> 01:34:03,360
executed in various ways and it's

2139
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:05,100
incorporated into the detection but we

2140
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:06,600
flag that all

2141
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:09,060
so some design principles that we had is

2142
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:12,120
is where possible actually do the attack

2143
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:15,199
so don't mimic it

2144
01:34:15,199 --> 01:34:18,000
but also most importantly and this is

2145
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,980
where a lot of the other tools miss it I

2146
01:34:19,980 --> 01:34:22,320
think in my opinion is where if when I

2147
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:23,820
execute an attack I also want to make

2148
01:34:23,820 --> 01:34:26,100
sure that the attack succeeded so I want

2149
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:28,080
to measure that because I can run a

2150
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:28,920
script

2151
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:30,900
and move on and then see hey the

2152
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:32,460
detection didn't work and then you're

2153
01:34:32,460 --> 01:34:35,040
looking at the problem and at the wrong

2154
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:36,540
end maybe right if the attack already

2155
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:37,920
failed then the detection will never

2156
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:41,100
trigger so how do you validate that

2157
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:42,719
um and have variables that can can

2158
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:44,040
differ in every environment like a

2159
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:46,199
domain name file name location username

2160
01:34:46,199 --> 01:34:47,760
these kind of things so you can be a

2161
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:50,280
little bit more flexible there

2162
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:52,679
and if you do an endpoint based thing

2163
01:34:52,679 --> 01:34:55,080
focus on the EDR and not the AV because

2164
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:58,020
AV is Trivial everybody can bypass that

2165
01:34:58,020 --> 01:35:00,480
with a little bit of effort so are the

2166
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,100
textures usually aren't incorporating

2167
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:03,900
that so

2168
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:06,000
um and that's where we started designing

2169
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,940
our own yemo format again which is based

2170
01:35:08,940 --> 01:35:11,760
on Atomic retin which is awesome uh just

2171
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:13,380
extended it a bit with the things that

2172
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:15,480
we were missing from it

2173
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:18,120
so from a logical flow perspective we

2174
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:19,560
have a detection rule that might have an

2175
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:21,719
attack script that goes into that the

2176
01:35:21,719 --> 01:35:24,000
deck script pipeline that we run every

2177
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,560
15 minutes

2178
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:27,659
but you shouldn't do that you should do

2179
01:35:27,659 --> 01:35:29,340
it once a month or whatever if you do it

2180
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:31,460
on an internal basis

2181
01:35:31,460 --> 01:35:33,900
we just do it a lot so that we can

2182
01:35:33,900 --> 01:35:36,300
quicker see results and have better

2183
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:38,460
maintenance that way

2184
01:35:38,460 --> 01:35:40,320
um from there that the text script can

2185
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:43,440
execute it directly on a host via SSH or

2186
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:45,360
some other agents that we have built

2187
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:47,280
ourselves but we can also integrate with

2188
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:49,020
some of the commercial breaching attack

2189
01:35:49,020 --> 01:35:51,600
tools like uh Prelude but we can also

2190
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:53,880
work with a code era or some other some

2191
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:56,280
other tools as long as they can work

2192
01:35:56,280 --> 01:35:58,620
with that yaml format that we that we

2193
01:35:58,620 --> 01:36:01,260
have so that that then executes it on a

2194
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:02,880
target the target reports the status

2195
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:05,520
back including did it succeed or not

2196
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:07,380
because that's very important to us and

2197
01:36:07,380 --> 01:36:09,480
the two or actually a pipeline depending

2198
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:11,639
on where we run it feedsense results

2199
01:36:11,639 --> 01:36:14,219
into Sentinel

2200
01:36:14,219 --> 01:36:16,139
but the Target also has a role there

2201
01:36:16,139 --> 01:36:18,060
because they have an agent running and

2202
01:36:18,060 --> 01:36:21,360
they log stuff so they either alert or

2203
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:25,080
lock to Sentinel alert gets generated

2204
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:26,639
and from there we can actually start

2205
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:29,040
correlating hey the attack ran it was

2206
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:32,040
successful and it was detected or not

2207
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:35,340
so that goes all into dashboards which

2208
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:37,800
is the manual bit of looking at it we

2209
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:39,780
can also run it from the pipeline that I

2210
01:36:39,780 --> 01:36:42,300
showed you earlier and we can generate

2211
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:44,880
the slack alerts and say hey discrepancy

2212
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:47,400
from what I expected and what is

2213
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:49,199
actually there so for instance the

2214
01:36:49,199 --> 01:36:51,000
attack is failing now where it used to

2215
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,460
work or the other way around where the

2216
01:36:53,460 --> 01:36:54,840
attack is still succeeding but it's not

2217
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:56,460
detected anymore so we need to look at

2218
01:36:56,460 --> 01:36:59,520
it and do some maintenance and that can

2219
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:02,100
be either on the attack side or on the

2220
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:04,860
the texture logic where either one of

2221
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:07,320
them is failing

2222
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:09,060
and then to to have a very simple

2223
01:37:09,060 --> 01:37:12,480
example uh to what it looks like

2224
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,580
um this is just again a yaml format

2225
01:37:14,580 --> 01:37:18,540
where we show where it's linked to which

2226
01:37:18,540 --> 01:37:20,699
detection we expect to trigger so this

2227
01:37:20,699 --> 01:37:22,500
is tied to one of ours but that can be

2228
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:24,659
many so sometimes we trigger multiple

2229
01:37:24,659 --> 01:37:27,420
detections with one attack and that also

2230
01:37:27,420 --> 01:37:30,000
includes out of the box stuff from the

2231
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,000
EDR or the the Sim so we look at those

2232
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,600
as well because why not

2233
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:38,520
um where we can run it from so that in

2234
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:40,139
this case is only one variable but it

2235
01:37:40,139 --> 01:37:42,300
can also be many from a domain name and

2236
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:43,320
these kind of things from Global

2237
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:45,540
dependencies so we built one hijacking

2238
01:37:45,540 --> 01:37:47,639
dll which we run in multiple attacks

2239
01:37:47,639 --> 01:37:50,580
it's just easier than that tailoring it

2240
01:37:50,580 --> 01:37:52,980
completely and then a basic script where

2241
01:37:52,980 --> 01:37:54,659
it's also checking did it succeed or not

2242
01:37:54,659 --> 01:37:56,880
and it cleans up after itself because we

2243
01:37:56,880 --> 01:38:00,060
want to have a clean system afterwards

2244
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:01,620
and now some of those dashboards

2245
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:03,780
examples are are relatively simple where

2246
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:06,420
we have a lot of detonations and we can

2247
01:38:06,420 --> 01:38:08,940
also see over time how well is it doing

2248
01:38:08,940 --> 01:38:11,400
and I have an overall success rate that

2249
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:13,920
we calculate so we basically know okay

2250
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:16,320
this 100 of the time ran

2251
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:18,540
and the two the two red forms we need to

2252
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:21,179
do something about uh preferably sooner

2253
01:38:21,179 --> 01:38:23,100
than after a couple of weeks right but

2254
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:24,719
that that can happen

2255
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:27,360
and then on the flip side we also have a

2256
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:29,820
dashboard for all the detections which

2257
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:33,179
are tied to the tech script but we can

2258
01:38:33,179 --> 01:38:34,920
basically measure hey it executed 50

2259
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:38,400
times and we detected it I know 37 times

2260
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:42,179
so why and of course you can click

2261
01:38:42,179 --> 01:38:44,040
everything and drill down into the raw

2262
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:46,580
logs and see what was actually

2263
01:38:46,580 --> 01:38:49,860
executed and and why it's not detected

2264
01:38:49,860 --> 01:38:51,659
so in some cases we actually ran into

2265
01:38:51,659 --> 01:38:54,360
some issues where alert grouping and

2266
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:56,100
these kind of things are also occurring

2267
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:58,020
uh which might be either a

2268
01:38:58,020 --> 01:39:00,540
misconfiguration in the Sim or nde in

2269
01:39:00,540 --> 01:39:02,699
this case also wants to be smart and

2270
01:39:02,699 --> 01:39:04,440
just group everything into one single

2271
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:05,880
incident and then it's not detected

2272
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:07,560
anymore so that's sometimes also where

2273
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:09,780
these numbers come from

2274
01:39:09,780 --> 01:39:11,940
but this only occurs if you do it in our

2275
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:14,280
way where we run it every 15 minutes

2276
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:16,500
which in a production or a logical

2277
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:18,900
Enterprise doesn't always make sense so

2278
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:21,780
then you do it once a week once a month

2279
01:39:21,780 --> 01:39:23,520
um and then you just have a pipeline

2280
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:25,800
that deploys in environments you run all

2281
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:27,600
your stuff

2282
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:29,639
um you let it sit for a bit and then you

2283
01:39:29,639 --> 01:39:31,620
kill the environments and you start off

2284
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:34,020
with a clean slate next time and then

2285
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:35,699
somebody actually has a look at the

2286
01:39:35,699 --> 01:39:37,260
results because otherwise yeah you can

2287
01:39:37,260 --> 01:39:38,580
you can test it but if nobody's

2288
01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:40,980
validating what is tested then you're

2289
01:39:40,980 --> 01:39:43,980
wasting a lot of resources

2290
01:39:43,980 --> 01:39:48,179
so to to wrap up because time is up

2291
01:39:48,179 --> 01:39:50,400
um just some simple simple things right

2292
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,739
so so detections code provides a lot of

2293
01:39:52,739 --> 01:39:55,139
quality control automation it's usually

2294
01:39:55,139 --> 01:39:56,639
ease of life for most of the detection

2295
01:39:56,639 --> 01:39:58,560
Engineers or the people maintaining this

2296
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:01,199
and and you have a lot of opportunities

2297
01:40:01,199 --> 01:40:04,100
for review and improvements there

2298
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:06,900
ensures a single sources through it

2299
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:08,820
allows for automated deployments even

2300
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:10,380
across a lot of

2301
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:12,060
environments and doesn't really matter

2302
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:16,260
how much that just config and it's it's

2303
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:18,480
self-documenting

2304
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:20,040
we are provided that the detection

2305
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:22,139
Engineers do a good job and they get

2306
01:40:22,139 --> 01:40:25,679
flagged with reviews if they don't

2307
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:27,540
um and and the best thing here that I

2308
01:40:27,540 --> 01:40:28,980
like about is that there's some

2309
01:40:28,980 --> 01:40:31,560
certainty into the from the validation

2310
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:33,239
perspectives like you actually know

2311
01:40:33,239 --> 01:40:35,639
that's working and it's doing the stuff

2312
01:40:35,639 --> 01:40:37,139
that you want

2313
01:40:37,139 --> 01:40:38,400
so

2314
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:40,620
not the most technical talk but if

2315
01:40:40,620 --> 01:40:42,420
you're if you're curious about more we

2316
01:40:42,420 --> 01:40:44,159
can we can discuss a bit on the panel

2317
01:40:44,159 --> 01:40:46,199
but we're also having a booth behind

2318
01:40:46,199 --> 01:40:48,000
there so if you want to see a little bit

2319
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,739
more or ask some questions I'm more than

2320
01:40:49,739 --> 01:40:51,300
happy to answer them there

2321
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:54,500
but uh thanks for coming out

2322
01:40:54,790 --> 01:40:58,180
[Applause]

2323
01:41:29,239 --> 01:41:32,040
all right well we're going to do the

2324
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:33,659
panel discussion in a few minutes but

2325
01:41:33,659 --> 01:41:36,000
the slido allows you to ask questions

2326
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,739
for the panel so if you have questions

2327
01:41:37,739 --> 01:41:39,900
and you want us to discuss them when is

2328
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:42,300
the panel discussion starts

2329
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:43,560
and

2330
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:45,719
in the panel's in five minutes yeah the

2331
01:41:45,719 --> 01:41:46,980
panel will start in about five minutes

2332
01:41:46,980 --> 01:41:48,239
so if you have any questions for the

2333
01:41:48,239 --> 01:41:50,340
speakers feel free to add them to the

2334
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:52,380
slido it's in Discord and then you'll be

2335
01:41:52,380 --> 01:41:54,420
able to make sure that it gets included

2336
01:41:54,420 --> 01:41:56,100
and here's the QR code if you want to

2337
01:41:56,100 --> 01:41:59,300
get access to it

2338
01:45:16,020 --> 01:45:19,020
foreign

2339
01:50:41,300 --> 01:50:44,480
should be

2340
01:50:46,380 --> 01:50:48,179
all right we're going to go ahead and

2341
01:50:48,179 --> 01:50:52,100
get started with the panel discussion

2342
01:50:55,199 --> 01:50:58,080
oh I think you might have uh

2343
01:50:58,080 --> 01:50:59,820
the mic's coming

2344
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:01,679
all right just a reminder before we get

2345
01:51:01,679 --> 01:51:02,460
going

2346
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:04,860
um if you scan this QR code you'll get

2347
01:51:04,860 --> 01:51:06,960
access to the slidu and that will allow

2348
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:08,699
you to ask questions so if audience

2349
01:51:08,699 --> 01:51:10,260
members want to ask questions you could

2350
01:51:10,260 --> 01:51:11,699
direct it at any of the members of the

2351
01:51:11,699 --> 01:51:13,860
panel feel free to connect there we

2352
01:51:13,860 --> 01:51:15,360
already have two questions that will

2353
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:16,619
that will go ahead and make sure that we

2354
01:51:16,619 --> 01:51:19,199
we deliver but we'll have conversations

2355
01:51:19,199 --> 01:51:20,820
if you don't have any questions we can

2356
01:51:20,820 --> 01:51:22,139
make them up

2357
01:51:22,139 --> 01:51:24,719
um I'm happy to ask and then we'll go

2358
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:27,239
from there so feel free to hook up into

2359
01:51:27,239 --> 01:51:29,520
slidu make sure you select the proper

2360
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:32,239
room I'm not even

2361
01:51:32,239 --> 01:51:34,440
somebody somebody French please tell me

2362
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:37,860
how to say that there we go okay so go

2363
01:51:37,860 --> 01:51:39,780
to that and then we'll uh we'll go from

2364
01:51:39,780 --> 01:51:41,340
there so

2365
01:51:41,340 --> 01:51:44,340
um we had two really great discussions

2366
01:51:44,340 --> 01:51:46,139
two really great presentations that I

2367
01:51:46,139 --> 01:51:48,480
think really kind of touched on really

2368
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:50,760
important factors of detection

2369
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:53,100
engineering so one is this juxtaposition

2370
01:51:53,100 --> 01:51:56,460
of false pauses and false negatives and

2371
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:59,219
how you can go towards reducing false

2372
01:51:59,219 --> 01:52:02,119
negatives while maintaining a reasonable

2373
01:52:02,119 --> 01:52:05,159
false like false positive approach and

2374
01:52:05,159 --> 01:52:06,239
the way that they they talked about

2375
01:52:06,239 --> 01:52:08,100
doing that is to

2376
01:52:08,100 --> 01:52:11,219
disconnect detection

2377
01:52:11,219 --> 01:52:12,119
um

2378
01:52:12,119 --> 01:52:14,639
detection firings with alerts and

2379
01:52:14,639 --> 01:52:16,440
investigations right so the the idea is

2380
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:18,480
is that just because your detection

2381
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:21,179
fires or there's an event that matches

2382
01:52:21,179 --> 01:52:22,920
your detection rule that doesn't mean

2383
01:52:22,920 --> 01:52:24,480
that you need to fire up the entire

2384
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:26,760
investigation process and that allows

2385
01:52:26,760 --> 01:52:29,460
you to maintain resources

2386
01:52:29,460 --> 01:52:31,500
one of the things that is really

2387
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:33,540
interesting to me when I'm kind of

2388
01:52:33,540 --> 01:52:35,400
looking into signal detection Theory

2389
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:38,460
which is the kind of psychological or

2390
01:52:38,460 --> 01:52:41,420
the overarching theory behind detection

2391
01:52:41,420 --> 01:52:43,980
is this is this juxtaposition of false

2392
01:52:43,980 --> 01:52:45,480
positives and false negatives and the

2393
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:47,699
the idea that different detection

2394
01:52:47,699 --> 01:52:50,280
problems right so in cyber security we

2395
01:52:50,280 --> 01:52:51,780
have one detection problem but for

2396
01:52:51,780 --> 01:52:53,340
instance the criminal justice system is

2397
01:52:53,340 --> 01:52:55,619
a detection problem the question is is

2398
01:52:55,619 --> 01:52:57,960
did the person commit the crime right

2399
01:52:57,960 --> 01:53:00,719
and uh and like medical testing is

2400
01:53:00,719 --> 01:53:03,420
another detection problem which is uh

2401
01:53:03,420 --> 01:53:05,460
does this person have the disease right

2402
01:53:05,460 --> 01:53:07,800
for instance and different detection

2403
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:09,900
problems are going to prioritize the

2404
01:53:09,900 --> 01:53:12,060
reduction of either false positives or

2405
01:53:12,060 --> 01:53:13,980
false negatives differently right and so

2406
01:53:13,980 --> 01:53:15,420
in the criminal justice system we have

2407
01:53:15,420 --> 01:53:17,219
this situation to where we want to

2408
01:53:17,219 --> 01:53:19,619
reduce false positives right because for

2409
01:53:19,619 --> 01:53:22,020
instance convicting an innocent person

2410
01:53:22,020 --> 01:53:24,239
of a crime is worse than letting a

2411
01:53:24,239 --> 01:53:27,179
letting a guilty person free right but

2412
01:53:27,179 --> 01:53:28,739
in medical testing you could say that

2413
01:53:28,739 --> 01:53:30,239
false negatives are viewed as being

2414
01:53:30,239 --> 01:53:33,360
worse because for instance not detecting

2415
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:36,360
cancer early on for instance is worse

2416
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:38,159
than telling somebody that they're fine

2417
01:53:38,159 --> 01:53:40,380
when they're actually not and so one of

2418
01:53:40,380 --> 01:53:42,119
the questions that I think they kind of

2419
01:53:42,119 --> 01:53:43,500
touched on this from their perspective

2420
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:45,360
but I'll go ahead and ask everybody just

2421
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:47,100
to kind of get the juices flowing you

2422
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:48,119
could say

2423
01:53:48,119 --> 01:53:50,280
um in detection Engineering in the

2424
01:53:50,280 --> 01:53:51,960
context of cyber security do you think

2425
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:53,699
that false positives or false negatives

2426
01:53:53,699 --> 01:53:55,320
are worse and maybe give us a little

2427
01:53:55,320 --> 01:53:57,060
explanation of why and I'll start with

2428
01:53:57,060 --> 01:53:58,380
Olaf

2429
01:53:58,380 --> 01:54:01,800
oh great so um to think about it yeah

2430
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:03,300
now I have to do it on live right but

2431
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:06,060
it's um I think I face forward it stands

2432
01:54:06,060 --> 01:54:07,440
for reason that false negatives are

2433
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:09,420
worse because not knowing that you got

2434
01:54:09,420 --> 01:54:11,840
breached is always worse than having

2435
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:14,940
noise I think noise can be dealt with

2436
01:54:14,940 --> 01:54:16,860
up to a certain extent I think they had

2437
01:54:16,860 --> 01:54:17,940
a great example where they used

2438
01:54:17,940 --> 01:54:21,540
indicators on top of detections or in

2439
01:54:21,540 --> 01:54:23,219
parallel to detection so so the stuff

2440
01:54:23,219 --> 01:54:25,020
you know that you want to make sure that

2441
01:54:25,020 --> 01:54:26,520
it always alerts you build a detection

2442
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:29,699
for that's also how I approach it and

2443
01:54:29,699 --> 01:54:31,320
the other stuff is

2444
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:34,199
it could be bad or not and therefore's

2445
01:54:34,199 --> 01:54:36,000
positive rates are

2446
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,179
I wouldn't tune it as much because yeah

2447
01:54:39,179 --> 01:54:40,560
an attacker is smart enough that he

2448
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:42,420
knows how to mimic

2449
01:54:42,420 --> 01:54:44,219
whatever is happening in your

2450
01:54:44,219 --> 01:54:45,719
environment if they spend the time and

2451
01:54:45,719 --> 01:54:49,739
effort to do so so those indicators what

2452
01:54:49,739 --> 01:54:51,060
we built as well is the sort of

2453
01:54:51,060 --> 01:54:53,900
framework around it where we can

2454
01:54:53,900 --> 01:54:57,239
quantify every indicator based on all of

2455
01:54:57,239 --> 01:54:59,340
their entities and and their contexts

2456
01:54:59,340 --> 01:55:02,159
around it so we look not only is this a

2457
01:55:02,159 --> 01:55:04,260
user in our environment but also which

2458
01:55:04,260 --> 01:55:06,420
which rights do they have do they have a

2459
01:55:06,420 --> 01:55:09,119
path to any sensitive resources in In

2460
01:55:09,119 --> 01:55:11,159
Blood Out or all these kind of things we

2461
01:55:11,159 --> 01:55:13,080
looked them up externally and based on

2462
01:55:13,080 --> 01:55:16,380
that that context we give them a rating

2463
01:55:16,380 --> 01:55:18,600
and then we do correlation on all of

2464
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:21,139
those ratings over multiple time frames

2465
01:55:21,139 --> 01:55:23,880
and so their false positives don't

2466
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:26,219
really make a lot of sense because in

2467
01:55:26,219 --> 01:55:29,219
correlation they get they get evaporated

2468
01:55:29,219 --> 01:55:33,260
anyway cool thank you Emilio

2469
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:41,960
there are many ways

2470
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:54,800
you're not going to detect

2471
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:04,400
Ive

2472
01:56:07,679 --> 01:56:11,400
yep for sure for sure thank you

2473
01:56:11,400 --> 01:56:13,380
um I think it's it depends on the the

2474
01:56:13,380 --> 01:56:14,520
context

2475
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:17,639
um well if you're uh you have limited

2476
01:56:17,639 --> 01:56:20,820
resources uh maybe false positive are

2477
01:56:20,820 --> 01:56:22,440
the worst because you want at least to

2478
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:24,960
treat uh the most critical things first

2479
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:27,719
and if you have a way to handle the fast

2480
01:56:27,719 --> 01:56:29,699
negative then maybe the false negative

2481
01:56:29,699 --> 01:56:32,580
is the worst but if you don't have the

2482
01:56:32,580 --> 01:56:35,580
these resources resources well then I

2483
01:56:35,580 --> 01:56:37,679
I'd say the false positive are are the

2484
01:56:37,679 --> 01:56:40,380
worst okay thank you thank you yeah I

2485
01:56:40,380 --> 01:56:42,600
think it context matters right I think

2486
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:45,119
me has a very good point

2487
01:56:45,119 --> 01:56:47,880
um so it depends what you are as well

2488
01:56:47,880 --> 01:56:50,159
I'm the only one here who works for a

2489
01:56:50,159 --> 01:56:53,340
Sim vendor so my team deploys rules that

2490
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:56,100
goes to all of our customers so

2491
01:56:56,100 --> 01:56:57,780
generating a lot of false positive

2492
01:56:57,780 --> 01:57:01,139
impact many many lives

2493
01:57:01,139 --> 01:57:03,540
well analysis lives not not threaten

2494
01:57:03,540 --> 01:57:04,699
lives

2495
01:57:04,699 --> 01:57:07,260
and there's also the impact if we make a

2496
01:57:07,260 --> 01:57:08,820
bad rules that generate thousands of

2497
01:57:08,820 --> 01:57:11,460
false positive per customers that

2498
01:57:11,460 --> 01:57:13,500
generate lots of problems so false

2499
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:15,900
positive are big problems

2500
01:57:15,900 --> 01:57:18,719
um false negative if they're known if we

2501
01:57:18,719 --> 01:57:21,540
have assumptions or if you know our

2502
01:57:21,540 --> 01:57:23,580
blind spots but then they're less

2503
01:57:23,580 --> 01:57:27,480
dangerous as well so if we follow um

2504
01:57:27,480 --> 01:57:30,659
like the adcs framework from palantir

2505
01:57:30,659 --> 01:57:33,840
that can help you negate a little bit

2506
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:35,699
the false negatives but in general yes

2507
01:57:35,699 --> 01:57:38,880
not the missing an attack is more

2508
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:42,360
impactful than having a bit of a flood

2509
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:45,599
of alerts awesome awesome okay actually

2510
01:57:45,599 --> 01:57:47,280
it looks like we've had quite a few

2511
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:49,320
questions come in so thank you to all of

2512
01:57:49,320 --> 01:57:51,659
you in the audience I'm gonna

2513
01:57:51,659 --> 01:57:53,280
pick one I was going to pick them in

2514
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:55,080
order that they came in but I don't

2515
01:57:55,080 --> 01:57:56,280
think

2516
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:58,679
um I don't think it's in chronological

2517
01:57:58,679 --> 01:58:02,699
order anymore so uh one easy one is does

2518
01:58:02,699 --> 01:58:05,280
is Yamaha an acronym or what did that

2519
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:06,599
name come from

2520
01:58:06,599 --> 01:58:11,099
well um yes you know um like uh yes yet

2521
01:58:11,099 --> 01:58:12,719
another system tool or something like

2522
01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:14,760
that there's a like a trend and I was

2523
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:16,560
thinking about yet another something and

2524
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:19,679
I have a Yamaha base so I had to make an

2525
01:58:19,679 --> 01:58:23,699
acronym with Yamaha so it's a Yamaha yet

2526
01:58:23,699 --> 01:58:25,920
another mainly aggregated hunt activity

2527
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:28,020
okay you're going with like the yaml yet

2528
01:58:28,020 --> 01:58:29,760
another okay

2529
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:32,040
awesome thank you for that

2530
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:33,659
um okay I just realized that they're

2531
01:58:33,659 --> 01:58:36,420
being upvoted and so it's an order of uh

2532
01:58:36,420 --> 01:58:39,780
kind of most upvoted so uh again for

2533
01:58:39,780 --> 01:58:41,940
Remy and Emilio what is your favorite

2534
01:58:41,940 --> 01:58:44,639
indicator have are there any that are

2535
01:58:44,639 --> 01:58:46,739
kind of like your child like do you have

2536
01:58:46,739 --> 01:58:50,159
any uh baby baby indicator and it based

2537
01:58:50,159 --> 01:58:51,480
on that reaction I think there probably

2538
01:58:51,480 --> 01:58:54,799
is one at least

2539
01:58:55,260 --> 01:58:58,260
uh

2540
01:59:14,460 --> 01:59:18,080
you know this is a very very

2541
01:59:36,739 --> 01:59:39,900
small noises that are different on each

2542
01:59:39,900 --> 01:59:44,000
machine but might give contention

2543
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:54,199
but during theater

2544
01:59:56,400 --> 01:59:59,219
yeah one of the things I liked about uh

2545
01:59:59,219 --> 02:00:00,540
at least one of the you said there's

2546
02:00:00,540 --> 02:00:02,099
multiple scoring methodologies but one

2547
02:00:02,099 --> 02:00:03,300
of the scoring methodologies was

2548
02:00:03,300 --> 02:00:04,679
basically

2549
02:00:04,679 --> 02:00:07,500
um less frequent has a higher higher

2550
02:00:07,500 --> 02:00:09,780
score right and I uh that reminded me of

2551
02:00:09,780 --> 02:00:11,940
uh not same Nicholas taleb's Black Swan

2552
02:00:11,940 --> 02:00:14,699
uh book so it's a it's a book by NASA

2553
02:00:14,699 --> 02:00:17,159
Nicholas talebin the the general idea

2554
02:00:17,159 --> 02:00:19,619
that the philosophy is is that things

2555
02:00:19,619 --> 02:00:21,840
that are things that are going to have a

2556
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:23,880
major impact on You Are by definition

2557
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:25,980
statistically rare and the idea is is

2558
02:00:25,980 --> 02:00:28,260
that in general we live in an organized

2559
02:00:28,260 --> 02:00:30,480
and ordered uh world right so everything

2560
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:32,099
kind of makes sense and things that

2561
02:00:32,099 --> 02:00:34,199
happen frequently half like almost

2562
02:00:34,199 --> 02:00:36,420
certainly have to have very small

2563
02:00:36,420 --> 02:00:38,639
impacts on us otherwise we just live in

2564
02:00:38,639 --> 02:00:40,800
chaos all the time and so the idea is is

2565
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:42,420
that if something happens all the time

2566
02:00:42,420 --> 02:00:45,179
it's by definition not bad right and so

2567
02:00:45,179 --> 02:00:46,920
all the bad things that that are

2568
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:48,540
possible to happen are like the worst

2569
02:00:48,540 --> 02:00:50,580
things like the his example is like the

2570
02:00:50,580 --> 02:00:52,619
financial crash in 2008 right the real

2571
02:00:52,619 --> 02:00:55,199
estate market market crash those are

2572
02:00:55,199 --> 02:00:56,400
going to be things that are going to be

2573
02:00:56,400 --> 02:00:58,920
rare so that that seems to be if you're

2574
02:00:58,920 --> 02:01:00,960
going to take like a starting position

2575
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:02,940
of how do you start to score things it's

2576
02:01:02,940 --> 02:01:04,199
all about

2577
02:01:04,199 --> 02:01:06,060
you know least frequency of occurrence

2578
02:01:06,060 --> 02:01:07,440
or prevalence right seems like a really

2579
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:09,480
good good start

2580
02:01:09,480 --> 02:01:12,179
yeah and it also limits the it increases

2581
02:01:12,179 --> 02:01:14,040
the feasibility of actually analyzing it

2582
02:01:14,040 --> 02:01:16,199
properly right because it's

2583
02:01:16,199 --> 02:01:18,420
yeah so Olaf's talking about the ability

2584
02:01:18,420 --> 02:01:21,179
to actually analyze things so the are

2585
02:01:21,179 --> 02:01:23,460
you can you expand on that a little bit

2586
02:01:23,460 --> 02:01:25,920
Well yeah if if the if the domain name

2587
02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:28,860
is anomalous then and it comes from a

2588
02:01:28,860 --> 02:01:31,500
small set of processes it's easier for

2589
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:33,060
an analyst to determine hey this is

2590
02:01:33,060 --> 02:01:35,820
weird I should look into it whereas if

2591
02:01:35,820 --> 02:01:38,400
you see teams connecting to Microsoft

2592
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:43,440
it's 95 or 99.99 whatever percent it's

2593
02:01:43,440 --> 02:01:46,380
legitimate unless a sophisticated Decker

2594
02:01:46,380 --> 02:01:48,719
found a way to actually piggyback off

2595
02:01:48,719 --> 02:01:49,619
that

2596
02:01:49,619 --> 02:01:51,300
um determining if that is actually

2597
02:01:51,300 --> 02:01:53,219
malicious or not is very harder than the

2598
02:01:53,219 --> 02:01:55,440
normally that that stands out yeah so

2599
02:01:55,440 --> 02:01:57,480
okay so that now you're making me think

2600
02:01:57,480 --> 02:02:00,119
of something different so the in uh I

2601
02:02:00,119 --> 02:02:01,500
don't even know if it's machine learning

2602
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:03,780
would be the proper proper field of

2603
02:02:03,780 --> 02:02:05,159
study to talk about this but there's

2604
02:02:05,159 --> 02:02:06,360
this concept called the manifold

2605
02:02:06,360 --> 02:02:08,460
hypothesis which is you can analyze

2606
02:02:08,460 --> 02:02:10,080
things in like an infinite number of

2607
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:13,020
different uh from different perspectives

2608
02:02:13,020 --> 02:02:15,360
basically and so the the idea of this

2609
02:02:15,360 --> 02:02:18,179
like the least the less frequent

2610
02:02:18,179 --> 02:02:19,920
something is the more likely it is to

2611
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:21,960
have a major impact the interesting

2612
02:02:21,960 --> 02:02:23,820
question is is how do we know that we're

2613
02:02:23,820 --> 02:02:26,340
looking at it along the proper uh

2614
02:02:26,340 --> 02:02:28,199
looking at the proper features maybe or

2615
02:02:28,199 --> 02:02:30,420
like the proper very variables of that

2616
02:02:30,420 --> 02:02:32,760
thing to know so like teams connecting

2617
02:02:32,760 --> 02:02:34,260
to Microsoft that may not be the

2618
02:02:34,260 --> 02:02:36,420
appropriate way to be looking at that

2619
02:02:36,420 --> 02:02:38,219
interaction maybe there's some other

2620
02:02:38,219 --> 02:02:39,780
feature that maybe we just don't even

2621
02:02:39,780 --> 02:02:41,340
know about maybe we don't have Telemetry

2622
02:02:41,340 --> 02:02:43,380
on that's actually the thing that makes

2623
02:02:43,380 --> 02:02:45,540
it statistically rare relative to all

2624
02:02:45,540 --> 02:02:47,699
the others and so that's a

2625
02:02:47,699 --> 02:02:49,020
that's something that I constantly

2626
02:02:49,020 --> 02:02:50,400
struggle with is like how do I know that

2627
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:52,739
I'm looking at the right things

2628
02:02:52,739 --> 02:02:55,020
um instead of just what is apparent

2629
02:02:55,020 --> 02:02:57,440
right

2630
02:03:16,560 --> 02:03:20,300
so it's the same kind of

2631
02:03:22,320 --> 02:03:23,880
yeah

2632
02:03:23,880 --> 02:03:25,980
there's this uh there's this concept

2633
02:03:25,980 --> 02:03:27,300
called the snake snake detection

2634
02:03:27,300 --> 02:03:29,760
hypothesis and the idea is that uh

2635
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:31,739
humans or primates in general have

2636
02:03:31,739 --> 02:03:34,560
evolved uh with snakes as their primary

2637
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:36,179
Predator right and so the idea is is

2638
02:03:36,179 --> 02:03:38,699
that human human like humans dedicate a

2639
02:03:38,699 --> 02:03:40,619
large portion of their brain to to

2640
02:03:40,619 --> 02:03:43,080
visual at like their visual Acuity and

2641
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:45,179
so the the question is is why do we see

2642
02:03:45,179 --> 02:03:46,739
better like dogs for instance don't see

2643
02:03:46,739 --> 02:03:49,139
as well and that type of thing and the

2644
02:03:49,139 --> 02:03:52,619
hypothesis kind of posits this idea that

2645
02:03:52,619 --> 02:03:54,300
um the reason is is that snakes were our

2646
02:03:54,300 --> 02:03:55,679
predator and snakes are relatively

2647
02:03:55,679 --> 02:03:58,440
camouflaged and so it's very difficult

2648
02:03:58,440 --> 02:04:00,540
to see snakes and so the our ancestors

2649
02:04:00,540 --> 02:04:02,340
which survived in rougher times

2650
02:04:02,340 --> 02:04:04,920
basically they were able to see snakes

2651
02:04:04,920 --> 02:04:06,360
and actually differentiate them from

2652
02:04:06,360 --> 02:04:08,099
their environment and one of the things

2653
02:04:08,099 --> 02:04:10,139
is that we we prioritize movements so

2654
02:04:10,139 --> 02:04:11,400
there's all these different things like

2655
02:04:11,400 --> 02:04:13,500
uh for instance you go on the street

2656
02:04:13,500 --> 02:04:15,599
corner in a busy City and point up in

2657
02:04:15,599 --> 02:04:17,040
the sky and then people will stand next

2658
02:04:17,040 --> 02:04:18,360
to you and like look at where you're

2659
02:04:18,360 --> 02:04:20,099
pointing even if there's nothing there

2660
02:04:20,099 --> 02:04:21,960
and that's because there's this like

2661
02:04:21,960 --> 02:04:23,880
kind of lizard brain thing to where we

2662
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:25,679
start to think oh if this person's

2663
02:04:25,679 --> 02:04:27,659
wasting their most valuable resource on

2664
02:04:27,659 --> 02:04:28,980
looking up in the sky then there must be

2665
02:04:28,980 --> 02:04:31,260
something to see there's this there's

2666
02:04:31,260 --> 02:04:33,420
this question that I have of like how do

2667
02:04:33,420 --> 02:04:35,820
we that's a biologically or evolved

2668
02:04:35,820 --> 02:04:38,099
process like our visual perception but

2669
02:04:38,099 --> 02:04:40,199
imagine that edrs are our perception

2670
02:04:40,199 --> 02:04:42,900
right in the Cyber realm so the question

2671
02:04:42,900 --> 02:04:46,800
is is how do we know that what edrs are

2672
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:48,960
seeing is actually what we should be

2673
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:50,940
seeing because it's not evolved in the

2674
02:04:50,940 --> 02:04:52,560
same way it's artificial

2675
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:55,020
does anybody have any thoughts on that

2676
02:04:55,020 --> 02:04:58,080
I'll let them go

2677
02:04:58,080 --> 02:05:01,340
Scooby come on buddy

2678
02:05:01,639 --> 02:05:05,639
I think you yeah so EDR and in specific

2679
02:05:05,639 --> 02:05:09,119
uh and like all other tools uh you

2680
02:05:09,119 --> 02:05:11,400
cannot blindly trust any vendor right

2681
02:05:11,400 --> 02:05:13,080
there's some vendor that you might trust

2682
02:05:13,080 --> 02:05:15,360
more some vendors that you might trust

2683
02:05:15,360 --> 02:05:17,099
less

2684
02:05:17,099 --> 02:05:19,199
um but I think Olaf kind of talked about

2685
02:05:19,199 --> 02:05:21,300
a little bit in his in his talk

2686
02:05:21,300 --> 02:05:23,580
um but you built a detection for

2687
02:05:23,580 --> 02:05:25,860
something that that you are aware of and

2688
02:05:25,860 --> 02:05:28,500
at some point the EDR might catch up and

2689
02:05:28,500 --> 02:05:31,679
then you can retire your detection

2690
02:05:31,679 --> 02:05:34,139
um so so that's one of one kind of

2691
02:05:34,139 --> 02:05:36,000
going in in the direction you were

2692
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,400
talking about uh but yeah I think it's

2693
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:42,360
very important to know your your

2694
02:05:42,360 --> 02:05:44,239
tread models

2695
02:05:44,239 --> 02:05:47,400
test your your security software and

2696
02:05:47,400 --> 02:05:49,860
make sure that they are responding to

2697
02:05:49,860 --> 02:05:51,420
the way you're expecting them and if

2698
02:05:51,420 --> 02:05:53,460
they're not you should all your vendors

2699
02:05:53,460 --> 02:05:56,159
accountable as well they are the one who

2700
02:05:56,159 --> 02:05:58,320
provide the detections and the other one

2701
02:05:58,320 --> 02:06:00,360
who can improve their product so in

2702
02:06:00,360 --> 02:06:03,360
general if if you're if the tool you're

2703
02:06:03,360 --> 02:06:04,619
using are not detecting what you're

2704
02:06:04,619 --> 02:06:06,719
expecting you need to go back to them if

2705
02:06:06,719 --> 02:06:08,760
you're building your own tool then you

2706
02:06:08,760 --> 02:06:10,500
you talk to yourself and you prioritize

2707
02:06:10,500 --> 02:06:12,060
those things

2708
02:06:12,060 --> 02:06:15,179
cool and uh I I would balance on the

2709
02:06:15,179 --> 02:06:17,760
lizard or any stuff because this is

2710
02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:22,619
actually something I love using as

2711
02:06:22,619 --> 02:06:25,880
one of the my other

2712
02:06:30,900 --> 02:06:33,559
one of the things I

2713
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:40,980
think yeah so I know put in colors in

2714
02:06:40,980 --> 02:06:43,320
the condition for important stuff

2715
02:06:43,320 --> 02:06:44,760
and stuff for example

2716
02:06:44,760 --> 02:06:47,940
um translation when we add a domain

2717
02:06:47,940 --> 02:06:50,480
artifact so we're

2718
02:06:55,739 --> 02:06:58,260
here and for how many days it was in our

2719
02:06:58,260 --> 02:07:02,699
environment so if the domain has been in

2720
02:07:02,699 --> 02:07:06,440
our environment for a very short time so

2721
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:08,880
I'm going to

2722
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:11,580
get it before all your domains that uh

2723
02:07:11,580 --> 02:07:13,679
when I want

2724
02:07:13,679 --> 02:07:14,880
they're gonna be in white like

2725
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:17,599
everything else

2726
02:07:17,639 --> 02:07:19,380
you're gonna see

2727
02:07:19,380 --> 02:07:22,619
this one is sending out to you might

2728
02:07:22,619 --> 02:07:25,040
I

2729
02:07:26,280 --> 02:07:30,119
yeah Orient analyst into the stuff that

2730
02:07:30,119 --> 02:07:31,980
might actually remember

2731
02:07:31,980 --> 02:07:34,080
yeah for sure I live in Las Vegas so of

2732
02:07:34,080 --> 02:07:36,719
course uh leveraging color to force

2733
02:07:36,719 --> 02:07:37,920
people to do things that they otherwise

2734
02:07:37,920 --> 02:07:40,619
wouldn't do is like right now all right

2735
02:07:40,619 --> 02:07:43,980
so trying to stay on the soar topic so

2736
02:07:43,980 --> 02:07:45,300
maybe this is a perfect question for you

2737
02:07:45,300 --> 02:07:46,500
but this is another audience question

2738
02:07:46,500 --> 02:07:48,659
that says uh what are some tips to

2739
02:07:48,659 --> 02:07:50,460
enrich existing detections with

2740
02:07:50,460 --> 02:07:52,260
sufficient context to make the triage

2741
02:07:52,260 --> 02:07:53,520
easier

2742
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:55,500
does anybody have like a favorite data

2743
02:07:55,500 --> 02:07:58,320
source or maybe a little trick to try to

2744
02:07:58,320 --> 02:07:59,699
make sure that you're giving the analyst

2745
02:07:59,699 --> 02:08:01,560
as much information as possible or

2746
02:08:01,560 --> 02:08:04,460
anything along those lines

2747
02:08:34,080 --> 02:08:35,580
so

2748
02:08:35,580 --> 02:08:36,840
you

2749
02:08:36,840 --> 02:08:39,980
you need to pick the information

2750
02:08:41,280 --> 02:08:42,719
and

2751
02:08:42,719 --> 02:08:44,820
still show them a way to have the full

2752
02:08:44,820 --> 02:08:48,080
information but not necessarily

2753
02:08:56,280 --> 02:09:01,460
of your analyzer and some specific

2754
02:09:02,699 --> 02:09:04,500
questions

2755
02:09:04,500 --> 02:09:07,940
the domain was seen

2756
02:09:19,500 --> 02:09:22,020
the best kind of

2757
02:09:22,020 --> 02:09:24,780
gotcha yeah I think one of the things

2758
02:09:24,780 --> 02:09:26,820
I fully agree and I think I think one of

2759
02:09:26,820 --> 02:09:28,679
the things I would add on top of that is

2760
02:09:28,679 --> 02:09:31,560
is a sort of historical overview of the

2761
02:09:31,560 --> 02:09:32,880
entities that you're analyzing so if

2762
02:09:32,880 --> 02:09:35,219
you're looking at a machine a user and a

2763
02:09:35,219 --> 02:09:37,619
domain I would add the machine and the

2764
02:09:37,619 --> 02:09:39,960
user at least as a historical overview

2765
02:09:39,960 --> 02:09:41,820
how many alerts have triggered on that

2766
02:09:41,820 --> 02:09:43,980
machine that user because

2767
02:09:43,980 --> 02:09:46,739
if you have a larger sock it's quite

2768
02:09:46,739 --> 02:09:49,260
likely that that like like material

2769
02:09:49,260 --> 02:09:51,599
looked at alert one you look at the

2770
02:09:51,599 --> 02:09:53,760
alert two an hour later you're not aware

2771
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:55,739
of each other looking at it and in

2772
02:09:55,739 --> 02:09:57,900
context in or in correlation those two

2773
02:09:57,900 --> 02:09:59,880
actually might not be false positives

2774
02:09:59,880 --> 02:10:01,820
and and lead to a bigger story yeah

2775
02:10:01,820 --> 02:10:04,739
clarifying relations between entities is

2776
02:10:04,739 --> 02:10:07,440
really important yeah I agree one

2777
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:08,820
question I have about how you're doing

2778
02:10:08,820 --> 02:10:11,699
uh the grouping have you considered

2779
02:10:11,699 --> 02:10:13,980
um the idea so there's this idea called

2780
02:10:13,980 --> 02:10:15,840
composability which is how things

2781
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:17,880
provide like one thing will provide

2782
02:10:17,880 --> 02:10:19,560
output that's then an input to another

2783
02:10:19,560 --> 02:10:21,719
thing and so imagine that you have some

2784
02:10:21,719 --> 02:10:24,119
alert that's based on some some behavior

2785
02:10:24,119 --> 02:10:26,219
and that behavior can't stand alone it

2786
02:10:26,219 --> 02:10:28,099
requires some sort of

2787
02:10:28,099 --> 02:10:31,320
prerequisite to be to be achieved so for

2788
02:10:31,320 --> 02:10:32,840
instance

2789
02:10:32,840 --> 02:10:35,159
kerberosting is a is the example that I

2790
02:10:35,159 --> 02:10:37,199
like to use so it's like if I curb roast

2791
02:10:37,199 --> 02:10:39,239
I'm not just first of all you can't

2792
02:10:39,239 --> 02:10:41,340
necessarily just curb roast you probably

2793
02:10:41,340 --> 02:10:44,760
need to enumerate service accounts first

2794
02:10:44,760 --> 02:10:46,920
right and then you and then you can run

2795
02:10:46,920 --> 02:10:48,179
curb roasting but then I don't just

2796
02:10:48,179 --> 02:10:50,699
Kerberos for no reason I then intend to

2797
02:10:50,699 --> 02:10:53,280
like log on with the user that I

2798
02:10:53,280 --> 02:10:54,960
requested a service ticket for and so

2799
02:10:54,960 --> 02:10:57,480
there's this this idea that's

2800
02:10:57,480 --> 02:10:59,280
kind of what you're what you suggested

2801
02:10:59,280 --> 02:11:00,960
in your talk is that we can potentially

2802
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:02,580
look for things that with a broader

2803
02:11:02,580 --> 02:11:04,500
scope which is somebody requested a

2804
02:11:04,500 --> 02:11:05,760
Kerberos service ticket which

2805
02:11:05,760 --> 02:11:07,619
potentially happens all the time right

2806
02:11:07,619 --> 02:11:10,380
but now I'm waiting for other things to

2807
02:11:10,380 --> 02:11:11,400
happen that are going to be relevant

2808
02:11:11,400 --> 02:11:13,860
that gives me context but uh have you

2809
02:11:13,860 --> 02:11:15,179
considered thinking about it from the

2810
02:11:15,179 --> 02:11:16,380
perspective of

2811
02:11:16,380 --> 02:11:18,599
other things that are relevant to that

2812
02:11:18,599 --> 02:11:20,760
particular Behavior as opposed to other

2813
02:11:20,760 --> 02:11:23,900
potentially bad things

2814
02:11:29,179 --> 02:11:32,340
we have some indicators that are like

2815
02:11:32,340 --> 02:11:34,739
um super indicators they are built like

2816
02:11:34,739 --> 02:11:37,260
it's a correlation between indicators

2817
02:11:37,260 --> 02:11:40,440
and it uh it triggers if they are like

2818
02:11:40,440 --> 02:11:43,440
five of these in the same hour or

2819
02:11:43,440 --> 02:11:46,380
something like that and then you get uh

2820
02:11:46,380 --> 02:11:49,679
like uh it's a reason alert with all the

2821
02:11:49,679 --> 02:11:51,179
indicators that triggered and the

2822
02:11:51,179 --> 02:11:52,860
secondaries can say okay this happened

2823
02:11:52,860 --> 02:11:55,860
and in this sequence and yeah we have

2824
02:11:55,860 --> 02:11:57,960
things like that it and it's pretty

2825
02:11:57,960 --> 02:12:00,860
pretty nice we don't have uh

2826
02:12:00,860 --> 02:12:03,360
scratching the surface on the yeah on

2827
02:12:03,360 --> 02:12:05,699
this concept but it's it's a goal for us

2828
02:12:05,699 --> 02:12:07,679
to to be able to leverage that concept

2829
02:12:07,679 --> 02:12:11,820
that something uh a b c if they happen

2830
02:12:11,820 --> 02:12:13,199
independently

2831
02:12:13,199 --> 02:12:15,980
we don't care if a then B then C happens

2832
02:12:15,980 --> 02:12:18,780
it's probably like something that's very

2833
02:12:18,780 --> 02:12:21,480
bad so it's it's something that we're

2834
02:12:21,480 --> 02:12:24,480
it's a go but we're not quite there yet

2835
02:12:24,480 --> 02:12:28,260
so Yamaha is is kinda new so we're still

2836
02:12:28,260 --> 02:12:30,599
doing r d on that it's coming yeah

2837
02:12:30,599 --> 02:12:32,880
that's awesome there's two things there

2838
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:34,920
um so there's the chain rule so things

2839
02:12:34,920 --> 02:12:37,560
that you know should not happen in a

2840
02:12:37,560 --> 02:12:39,300
certain

2841
02:12:39,300 --> 02:12:43,560
order or just together but there's also

2842
02:12:43,560 --> 02:12:45,599
you talked in your you you mentioned

2843
02:12:45,599 --> 02:12:46,800
that I think in your talk as well

2844
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:50,760
there's the entity uh scoring so

2845
02:12:50,760 --> 02:12:52,739
um today you're doing this maybe you

2846
02:12:52,739 --> 02:12:54,900
have a score of two because you've done

2847
02:12:54,900 --> 02:12:56,880
I don't know your request a Kerberos

2848
02:12:56,880 --> 02:13:00,179
ticket but tomorrow uh you start logging

2849
02:13:00,179 --> 02:13:03,900
to this SSL SQL database that you've

2850
02:13:03,900 --> 02:13:07,619
never connected to you start uh maybe

2851
02:13:07,619 --> 02:13:09,420
targeting things that you've never

2852
02:13:09,420 --> 02:13:10,920
touched before you go to some

2853
02:13:10,920 --> 02:13:13,380
sharepoints so every time you do one of

2854
02:13:13,380 --> 02:13:15,599
those things the score on your entity or

2855
02:13:15,599 --> 02:13:17,880
the danger of the the likelihood that

2856
02:13:17,880 --> 02:13:20,400
what you're doing is bad increase and I

2857
02:13:20,400 --> 02:13:21,780
think you mentioned that in your talk

2858
02:13:21,780 --> 02:13:25,199
and that's also uh yeah we called it uh

2859
02:13:25,199 --> 02:13:27,239
inertia analysis I'm not sure if it's

2860
02:13:27,239 --> 02:13:29,400
the scientific term

2861
02:13:29,400 --> 02:13:31,739
there must be a better term for this but

2862
02:13:31,739 --> 02:13:36,480
yeah basically if if the The Entity has

2863
02:13:36,480 --> 02:13:39,239
a kind of

2864
02:13:39,239 --> 02:13:42,239
static score and in the next week it

2865
02:13:42,239 --> 02:13:45,119
increases the tenfold and

2866
02:13:45,119 --> 02:13:47,280
stays like that well perhaps we should

2867
02:13:47,280 --> 02:13:49,500
investigate that because something new

2868
02:13:49,500 --> 02:13:51,360
his app is happening on that machine and

2869
02:13:51,360 --> 02:13:53,760
it triggers indicators which are

2870
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:56,000
indicators of

2871
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:59,219
abnormal activity yeah I actually for

2872
02:13:59,219 --> 02:14:01,619
what it's worth I liked the term inertia

2873
02:14:01,619 --> 02:14:05,340
analysis so yeah that was good

2874
02:14:05,340 --> 02:14:06,780
cool

2875
02:14:06,780 --> 02:14:08,099
um

2876
02:14:08,099 --> 02:14:09,900
I'm going to switch to another audience

2877
02:14:09,900 --> 02:14:12,480
question this one for Olaf so a little

2878
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:14,400
bit of a switch of topics but how do you

2879
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:16,260
convince management to invest resources

2880
02:14:16,260 --> 02:14:20,159
and detection as code yeah anyway he is

2881
02:14:20,159 --> 02:14:22,199
management so he doesn't have to they

2882
02:14:22,199 --> 02:14:25,040
pay him for that

2883
02:14:26,460 --> 02:14:28,500
it's a good question I never had to

2884
02:14:28,500 --> 02:14:31,920
convince Management's of it because they

2885
02:14:31,920 --> 02:14:33,960
in most cases management wants

2886
02:14:33,960 --> 02:14:35,699
visibility and what the team is doing

2887
02:14:35,699 --> 02:14:37,380
they want to have some measure of

2888
02:14:37,380 --> 02:14:40,139
quality control they want to have inside

2889
02:14:40,139 --> 02:14:41,639
in the process and these kind of things

2890
02:14:41,639 --> 02:14:44,040
are all there and the quality aspect is

2891
02:14:44,040 --> 02:14:46,800
there the validation is there so in most

2892
02:14:46,800 --> 02:14:48,119
cases

2893
02:14:48,119 --> 02:14:50,400
and we work for for larger Enterprises

2894
02:14:50,400 --> 02:14:52,139
and global companies so maybe it's a

2895
02:14:52,139 --> 02:14:53,579
different it's a bubble right so if

2896
02:14:53,579 --> 02:14:55,619
you're in a small company it's a harder

2897
02:14:55,619 --> 02:14:59,159
sell but even then you can I mean the

2898
02:14:59,159 --> 02:15:01,980
the guarantee of of consistency is

2899
02:15:01,980 --> 02:15:03,599
usually already the biggest selling

2900
02:15:03,599 --> 02:15:05,699
points and then if you're in a in a

2901
02:15:05,699 --> 02:15:08,280
company that is susceptive to audit and

2902
02:15:08,280 --> 02:15:09,540
these kind of things then it's even

2903
02:15:09,540 --> 02:15:11,460
easier because the full audit Trail is

2904
02:15:11,460 --> 02:15:15,000
there every auditor likes it

2905
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:16,380
um especially if you explain how it

2906
02:15:16,380 --> 02:15:17,880
works because they usually don't get it

2907
02:15:17,880 --> 02:15:20,340
directly but it's I think those are the

2908
02:15:20,340 --> 02:15:22,560
easiest selling points is it's like the

2909
02:15:22,560 --> 02:15:24,780
measurability the quality the insights

2910
02:15:24,780 --> 02:15:27,659
and and having a consistency method

2911
02:15:27,659 --> 02:15:28,619
there

2912
02:15:28,619 --> 02:15:32,040
I uh we're uh we're implementing uh

2913
02:15:32,040 --> 02:15:34,980
detection as code in our organization as

2914
02:15:34,980 --> 02:15:37,139
we speak and management was very very

2915
02:15:37,139 --> 02:15:40,079
open to to the idea but if they weren't

2916
02:15:40,079 --> 02:15:42,900
I would have given the the argument that

2917
02:15:42,900 --> 02:15:45,599
we can have dashboards and automated

2918
02:15:45,599 --> 02:15:49,079
kpis of detections dashboards yeah yeah

2919
02:15:49,079 --> 02:15:52,079
they have pie charts everybody's FB then

2920
02:15:52,079 --> 02:15:54,840
this man speaks management right here

2921
02:15:54,840 --> 02:15:56,940
um we we have about five more minutes so

2922
02:15:56,940 --> 02:15:58,980
there's there's a couple questions

2923
02:15:58,980 --> 02:16:00,420
um that I'm going to do a Shameless plug

2924
02:16:00,420 --> 02:16:03,540
for my for my workshop so uh

2925
02:16:03,540 --> 02:16:05,880
let's see how do you evaluate that you

2926
02:16:05,880 --> 02:16:07,380
have a good or bad detection coverage I

2927
02:16:07,380 --> 02:16:09,599
have a three hour explanation on that uh

2928
02:16:09,599 --> 02:16:11,699
coming at 1 pm if you're interested in

2929
02:16:11,699 --> 02:16:14,400
that at least my my perspective

2930
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:15,360
um

2931
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:17,460
what is the validation process look like

2932
02:16:17,460 --> 02:16:19,260
for writing a new detection also that

2933
02:16:19,260 --> 02:16:20,639
that would be included in the workshop

2934
02:16:20,639 --> 02:16:23,639
if if you're so interested

2935
02:16:23,639 --> 02:16:25,920
um let's see maybe maybe a final

2936
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:27,960
question that I'm sure everybody kind of

2937
02:16:27,960 --> 02:16:29,940
has an opinion on and this is definitely

2938
02:16:29,940 --> 02:16:32,700
an unsolved problem in my opinion is 42

2939
02:16:32,700 --> 02:16:37,019
huh I have an opinion it's 42 42. okay

2940
02:16:37,019 --> 02:16:38,340
well we'll see how that goes we'll see

2941
02:16:38,340 --> 02:16:40,019
how that age is in a second

2942
02:16:40,019 --> 02:16:40,859
um

2943
02:16:40,859 --> 02:16:42,599
so it's directed at Olaf but I think

2944
02:16:42,599 --> 02:16:43,920
everybody has an opinion how do you

2945
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:46,500
prioritize your detection logic from the

2946
02:16:46,500 --> 02:16:48,420
backlog to the plant state so like you

2947
02:16:48,420 --> 02:16:50,519
have this law this backlog of detections

2948
02:16:50,519 --> 02:16:53,218
how do you prioritize and how like so we

2949
02:16:53,218 --> 02:16:54,840
have limited just like we have limited

2950
02:16:54,840 --> 02:16:56,638
uh capacity for dealing with alerts we

2951
02:16:56,638 --> 02:16:57,840
have limited capacity for detection

2952
02:16:57,840 --> 02:17:00,420
engineering and there's way more things

2953
02:17:00,420 --> 02:17:01,920
that we could be building detections for

2954
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:03,599
than we have time so how do we choose

2955
02:17:03,599 --> 02:17:05,820
which things

2956
02:17:05,820 --> 02:17:09,898
yeah I'll try to get the answer as a as

2957
02:17:09,898 --> 02:17:12,000
a person working for one organization

2958
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:13,500
because as a consultant it's kind of

2959
02:17:13,500 --> 02:17:15,058
different I guess but

2960
02:17:15,058 --> 02:17:17,820
um I would knowing you have a threat

2961
02:17:17,820 --> 02:17:20,700
model or are aware of what

2962
02:17:20,700 --> 02:17:24,359
um is trying to attack you uh I would

2963
02:17:24,359 --> 02:17:26,580
have a feasibility of

2964
02:17:26,580 --> 02:17:29,459
how How likely is it that I get attacked

2965
02:17:29,459 --> 02:17:31,978
by it it's not mitigated by anything and

2966
02:17:31,978 --> 02:17:34,320
I can detect this in a meaningful way

2967
02:17:34,320 --> 02:17:36,000
that our analysts can analyze I think

2968
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:39,359
those three things based on knowing your

2969
02:17:39,359 --> 02:17:41,700
your threat landscape because running

2970
02:17:41,700 --> 02:17:45,599
after the newest Trader zero day is not

2971
02:17:45,599 --> 02:17:47,939
maybe the most important in every case

2972
02:17:47,939 --> 02:17:50,580
this is another Nicholas now or not sim

2973
02:17:50,580 --> 02:17:52,320
Nicholas to lab idea called the Lindy

2974
02:17:52,320 --> 02:17:54,420
principle which is this idea that things

2975
02:17:54,420 --> 02:17:56,160
that have existed for a long period of

2976
02:17:56,160 --> 02:17:58,439
time you should assume that they will

2977
02:17:58,439 --> 02:18:00,120
continue to exist for at least the same

2978
02:18:00,120 --> 02:18:01,620
amount so like if I wrote a book today

2979
02:18:01,620 --> 02:18:04,138
the chances that 2000 years from now it

2980
02:18:04,138 --> 02:18:05,879
would still be published as like zero

2981
02:18:05,879 --> 02:18:08,398
but it the Bible for instance was

2982
02:18:08,398 --> 02:18:10,320
published or written two thousand years

2983
02:18:10,320 --> 02:18:13,138
ago and it's reasonable to expect that

2984
02:18:13,138 --> 02:18:14,519
it will continue to be published two

2985
02:18:14,519 --> 02:18:16,200
thousand years from now so that's kind

2986
02:18:16,200 --> 02:18:17,398
of the thing of the longer something's

2987
02:18:17,398 --> 02:18:19,080
been around the longer it will continue

2988
02:18:19,080 --> 02:18:20,820
to be around and that's that's the

2989
02:18:20,820 --> 02:18:24,478
anecdote antidote and antidote to uh

2990
02:18:24,478 --> 02:18:26,760
chasing the new hotness so everybody

2991
02:18:26,760 --> 02:18:28,439
something new comes out I don't even

2992
02:18:28,439 --> 02:18:30,540
remember what the the snake turla

2993
02:18:30,540 --> 02:18:33,240
malware thing it's like if you people

2994
02:18:33,240 --> 02:18:35,218
are focused on that because it's this

2995
02:18:35,218 --> 02:18:36,898
new thing but if you actually look at it

2996
02:18:36,898 --> 02:18:38,879
a lot of it is really old stuff that's

2997
02:18:38,879 --> 02:18:40,679
just being repurposed or wrapped up into

2998
02:18:40,679 --> 02:18:42,599
something that appears to be sexy right

2999
02:18:42,599 --> 02:18:44,519
so if you would have focused on the old

3000
02:18:44,519 --> 02:18:45,599
things the things that have been around

3001
02:18:45,599 --> 02:18:47,280
and have been successful for attackers

3002
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:49,080
for a long time you would have been

3003
02:18:49,080 --> 02:18:50,398
already prepared for that type of

3004
02:18:50,398 --> 02:18:52,019
situation what I'm hearing about your

3005
02:18:52,019 --> 02:18:54,120
theory is that if my backlog is a

3006
02:18:54,120 --> 02:18:56,280
hundred tickets in the future it's gonna

3007
02:18:56,280 --> 02:18:58,620
be 100 tickets perfect it will never

3008
02:18:58,620 --> 02:19:00,000
leave

3009
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:01,920
yeah it's it's I think it's difficult to

3010
02:19:01,920 --> 02:19:03,718
prioritize well but knowing your own

3011
02:19:03,718 --> 02:19:06,359
environment and your own threats you can

3012
02:19:06,359 --> 02:19:07,920
make the best determination based on

3013
02:19:07,920 --> 02:19:09,359
that knowledge I think that there's no

3014
02:19:09,359 --> 02:19:11,939
single Source answer there yeah

3015
02:19:11,939 --> 02:19:14,099
um I would say make sure you have the

3016
02:19:14,099 --> 02:19:16,859
logs so which which logs do I have to

3017
02:19:16,859 --> 02:19:18,780
actually detect this if I don't have the

3018
02:19:18,780 --> 02:19:20,700
logs that's probably not my priority my

3019
02:19:20,700 --> 02:19:22,080
priority is probably to go get those

3020
02:19:22,080 --> 02:19:23,939
logs but it might if you're a large

3021
02:19:23,939 --> 02:19:25,859
enough organization that might be

3022
02:19:25,859 --> 02:19:27,058
another team that then detection

3023
02:19:27,058 --> 02:19:30,000
engineering what's the severity of this

3024
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,939
attack what's the impact and what's the

3025
02:19:32,939 --> 02:19:35,398
likelihood of being hit so a little bit

3026
02:19:35,398 --> 02:19:37,019
like the vulnerability system but you

3027
02:19:37,019 --> 02:19:39,780
can apply that calculation for your

3028
02:19:39,780 --> 02:19:42,058
detection as well

3029
02:19:42,058 --> 02:19:44,638
um and and what's the likelihood or the

3030
02:19:44,638 --> 02:19:46,379
Fidelity You're Expecting out of it do

3031
02:19:46,379 --> 02:19:48,299
you expect it to generate very little

3032
02:19:48,299 --> 02:19:50,939
false positive or be very noisy is this

3033
02:19:50,939 --> 02:19:52,920
like a one for one rule is it more like

3034
02:19:52,920 --> 02:19:55,620
a chain rule is it something that um

3035
02:19:55,620 --> 02:19:57,359
that you build more like as an indicator

3036
02:19:57,359 --> 02:19:59,520
that that's more like portrait Hunter so

3037
02:19:59,520 --> 02:20:00,960
those are all things that you can

3038
02:20:00,960 --> 02:20:03,359
consider to help you organize your

3039
02:20:03,359 --> 02:20:06,359
backlog and put the

3040
02:20:06,359 --> 02:20:09,180
yeah most value on top obviously and

3041
02:20:09,180 --> 02:20:11,220
then for what's gives you a one for one

3042
02:20:11,220 --> 02:20:13,920
you put at the top puts more uh tread

3043
02:20:13,920 --> 02:20:16,620
hunting I'll put lower in the priority

3044
02:20:16,620 --> 02:20:19,320
and a whole class could be given as to

3045
02:20:19,320 --> 02:20:21,479
what is a high value

3046
02:20:21,479 --> 02:20:25,080
detection so true very hard to answer

3047
02:20:25,080 --> 02:20:27,720
yeah for sure I the one thing that I was

3048
02:20:27,720 --> 02:20:29,399
um I'm interested that nobody nobody

3049
02:20:29,399 --> 02:20:31,080
mentioned it but it's like prevalence

3050
02:20:31,080 --> 02:20:32,820
seems to be a thing that a lot of people

3051
02:20:32,820 --> 02:20:36,540
will will use but I'm uh cautiously

3052
02:20:36,540 --> 02:20:38,460
optimistic about prevalence numbers just

3053
02:20:38,460 --> 02:20:40,680
because uh is that everybody's seen the

3054
02:20:40,680 --> 02:20:42,600
plane with the red circles on it and

3055
02:20:42,600 --> 02:20:44,460
that people talk about observation bias

3056
02:20:44,460 --> 02:20:47,640
right so the idea that like if you see

3057
02:20:47,640 --> 02:20:49,020
something you're going to look for it

3058
02:20:49,020 --> 02:20:50,220
and then when you look for it you're

3059
02:20:50,220 --> 02:20:51,720
going to continue to see it if you've

3060
02:20:51,720 --> 02:20:54,960
ever like um if you've ever heard of

3061
02:20:54,960 --> 02:20:56,939
something and then gone out into the

3062
02:20:56,939 --> 02:20:58,500
world and then you see that thing over

3063
02:20:58,500 --> 02:21:00,060
and over and over but you feel like

3064
02:21:00,060 --> 02:21:01,500
you've never seen it before that's

3065
02:21:01,500 --> 02:21:03,600
that's essentially observation bias and

3066
02:21:03,600 --> 02:21:05,580
these prevalence numbers well they are

3067
02:21:05,580 --> 02:21:07,979
useful right because absolute absolute

3068
02:21:07,979 --> 02:21:10,020
occurrence is interesting

3069
02:21:10,020 --> 02:21:11,340
um you got to be very careful when

3070
02:21:11,340 --> 02:21:12,359
you're starting to compare things

3071
02:21:12,359 --> 02:21:14,700
because just because something has been

3072
02:21:14,700 --> 02:21:16,500
seen more often doesn't mean that it

3073
02:21:16,500 --> 02:21:18,899
actually occurs more often uh in reality

3074
02:21:18,899 --> 02:21:21,060
or has a bigger impact so prevalence is

3075
02:21:21,060 --> 02:21:23,399
an input but it shouldn't be the the in

3076
02:21:23,399 --> 02:21:25,319
my opinion the primary factor when

3077
02:21:25,319 --> 02:21:27,840
you're prioritizing

3078
02:21:27,840 --> 02:21:29,460
um also something that has not been said

3079
02:21:29,460 --> 02:21:31,620
maybe the

3080
02:21:31,620 --> 02:21:34,859
how much um how much of a pain is it to

3081
02:21:34,859 --> 02:21:37,560
the traductor if we block this technique

3082
02:21:37,560 --> 02:21:40,140
so if you just disrupt the skill chain

3083
02:21:40,140 --> 02:21:42,720
because uh you block this particular

3084
02:21:42,720 --> 02:21:43,700
spot

3085
02:21:43,700 --> 02:21:46,439
that could be something nice to uh to

3086
02:21:46,439 --> 02:21:49,560
put Priority on yeah so Central is a

3087
02:21:49,560 --> 02:21:52,500
scent like how Central is that technique

3088
02:21:52,500 --> 02:21:55,500
or that behavior to the most number of

3089
02:21:55,500 --> 02:21:57,240
possible attack paths or something like

3090
02:21:57,240 --> 02:21:58,979
that would be really interesting and so

3091
02:21:58,979 --> 02:22:00,899
it's like and then also how many

3092
02:22:00,899 --> 02:22:03,240
different options do they have so if

3093
02:22:03,240 --> 02:22:05,460
you're talking about like low bins for

3094
02:22:05,460 --> 02:22:07,140
instance right there's a trillion low

3095
02:22:07,140 --> 02:22:09,300
bins and so if you block one I'm just

3096
02:22:09,300 --> 02:22:10,979
going to use a different but if you're

3097
02:22:10,979 --> 02:22:12,359
talking about lateral movement for

3098
02:22:12,359 --> 02:22:13,979
instance there's a relatively finite

3099
02:22:13,979 --> 02:22:15,540
number of lateral movement options and

3100
02:22:15,540 --> 02:22:17,100
so if I could block W my lateral

3101
02:22:17,100 --> 02:22:18,960
movement now you're stuck with you know

3102
02:22:18,960 --> 02:22:21,479
services or scheduled tests or there's

3103
02:22:21,479 --> 02:22:23,520
very few but you kind of start to close

3104
02:22:23,520 --> 02:22:24,660
people in

3105
02:22:24,660 --> 02:22:26,700
I think I think we're near the end but

3106
02:22:26,700 --> 02:22:28,080
it looked like you were getting ready to

3107
02:22:28,080 --> 02:22:28,920
say something

3108
02:22:28,920 --> 02:22:31,979
no uh well they said pretty much what I

3109
02:22:31,979 --> 02:22:34,020
wanted to say okay cool all right well

3110
02:22:34,020 --> 02:22:36,120
thank you everybody for joining us thank

3111
02:22:36,120 --> 02:22:41,000
you to Olaf Emilio Remy and Scooby

3112
02:22:43,859 --> 02:22:46,560
great great presentations to all three

3113
02:22:46,560 --> 02:22:49,140
of you and uh yeah looking forward to

3114
02:22:49,140 --> 02:22:50,340
re-watching those and kind of playing

3115
02:22:50,340 --> 02:22:51,780
around especially with your tool because

3116
02:22:51,780 --> 02:22:54,000
that's that seems like it's fun and it

3117
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,280
really seems like a capability that a

3118
02:22:56,280 --> 02:22:57,720
lot of organizations would benefit from

3119
02:22:57,720 --> 02:22:59,160
so yeah

3120
02:22:59,160 --> 02:23:02,119
sure thanks everybody

3121
02:23:05,479 --> 02:23:09,899
oh uh so uh the conference will start

3122
02:23:09,899 --> 02:23:13,500
again at 1 pm so we have lunch go have

3123
02:23:13,500 --> 02:23:15,899
lunch and come back at workshops also

3124
02:23:15,899 --> 02:23:18,979
start at 1pm

3125
03:20:31,040 --> 03:20:33,359
all right

3126
03:20:33,359 --> 03:20:36,660
um so welcome to the second block of the

3127
03:20:36,660 --> 03:20:39,960
vilmari room uh so we're now at the red

3128
03:20:39,960 --> 03:20:43,500
team block uh so our moderator is magnet

3129
03:20:43,500 --> 03:20:46,080
he has been hacking for 15 years in

3130
03:20:46,080 --> 03:20:47,640
particular on malware development

3131
03:20:47,640 --> 03:20:50,460
invasion of Defense controls I'm losing

3132
03:20:50,460 --> 03:20:53,100
my sheets and process automation it has

3133
03:20:53,100 --> 03:20:54,779
been a challenge designer for Access for

3134
03:20:54,779 --> 03:20:56,700
seven years and North tech for one year

3135
03:20:56,700 --> 03:20:58,979
uh currently Martin leads a large

3136
03:20:58,979 --> 03:21:02,220
ethical Acker department so welcome

3137
03:21:02,220 --> 03:21:04,760
Martin

3138
03:21:10,080 --> 03:21:13,080
all right good afternoon everyone I hope

3139
03:21:13,080 --> 03:21:15,300
you have a good lunch maybe not too

3140
03:21:15,300 --> 03:21:17,100
heavy because honestly this afternoon is

3141
03:21:17,100 --> 03:21:20,700
going to be heavy and content I'm very

3142
03:21:20,700 --> 03:21:23,279
excited to to animate this red team

3143
03:21:23,279 --> 03:21:24,600
block I think it's going to be an

3144
03:21:24,600 --> 03:21:27,600
awesome awesome three conference in a

3145
03:21:27,600 --> 03:21:30,600
row without waiting let's start with our

3146
03:21:30,600 --> 03:21:31,920
first speaker

3147
03:21:31,920 --> 03:21:34,620
uh we have Guillaume Caye he leads the

3148
03:21:34,620 --> 03:21:38,300
pen testing pen testing team at okiak

3149
03:21:38,300 --> 03:21:40,380
Guillaume specialized in malware

3150
03:21:40,380 --> 03:21:42,180
development red teaming and incident

3151
03:21:42,180 --> 03:21:43,680
response

3152
03:21:43,680 --> 03:21:46,230
the floor is yours

3153
03:21:46,230 --> 03:21:49,859
[Applause]

3154
03:21:49,859 --> 03:21:52,740
thank you uh hi everyone thanks for

3155
03:21:52,740 --> 03:21:54,540
joining me for this talk on 14 malware

3156
03:21:54,540 --> 03:21:57,479
analysis integrating established in

3157
03:21:57,479 --> 03:21:59,520
novel techniques

3158
03:21:59,520 --> 03:22:01,859
so as Martin said I'm young I'm the team

3159
03:22:01,859 --> 03:22:03,899
lead at the clock for the Fantastic Team

3160
03:22:03,899 --> 03:22:06,000
I'm a huge nordsec fan I've been

3161
03:22:06,000 --> 03:22:07,620
participating for the last few years and

3162
03:22:07,620 --> 03:22:10,260
it's always a pleasure to be here as you

3163
03:22:10,260 --> 03:22:12,540
will see in the next slides I really

3164
03:22:12,540 --> 03:22:14,580
like nimline as a programmatic language

3165
03:22:14,580 --> 03:22:17,760
so every proof of concept that I will

3166
03:22:17,760 --> 03:22:18,540
um

3167
03:22:18,540 --> 03:22:20,760
published today on GitHub are written in

3168
03:22:20,760 --> 03:22:22,680
nimlang but be assured you can translate

3169
03:22:22,680 --> 03:22:25,740
them in less optimal languages like Ross

3170
03:22:25,740 --> 03:22:28,560
go or c

3171
03:22:28,560 --> 03:22:30,300
that was a joke please don't throw rocks

3172
03:22:30,300 --> 03:22:32,539
at me

3173
03:22:33,420 --> 03:22:36,000
so here's what we'll cover today but

3174
03:22:36,000 --> 03:22:38,399
first where this research started so um

3175
03:22:38,399 --> 03:22:40,439
obviously when you do red teaming you

3176
03:22:40,439 --> 03:22:42,540
need to craft your own payload because

3177
03:22:42,540 --> 03:22:44,279
if you use anything public you will get

3178
03:22:44,279 --> 03:22:45,899
burned instantly it's not even worth

3179
03:22:45,899 --> 03:22:47,340
doing it

3180
03:22:47,340 --> 03:22:49,080
so when you spend that amount of time

3181
03:22:49,080 --> 03:22:51,660
creating your those special precious

3182
03:22:51,660 --> 03:22:53,819
tradecraft the last thing you want to

3183
03:22:53,819 --> 03:22:55,620
the last thing you want that to happen

3184
03:22:55,620 --> 03:22:57,840
as a redeemer is the blue team getting a

3185
03:22:57,840 --> 03:22:59,939
hand on your payload and trading a bunch

3186
03:22:59,939 --> 03:23:02,340
of signature on it like in one hour or

3187
03:23:02,340 --> 03:23:04,380
even one day

3188
03:23:04,380 --> 03:23:07,080
so uh yeah I wanted to even if my goal

3189
03:23:07,080 --> 03:23:08,399
is to train the blue team Indiana I

3190
03:23:08,399 --> 03:23:10,500
wanted to put a better fight make it

3191
03:23:10,500 --> 03:23:14,160
more interesting uh and in 2021 there's

3192
03:23:14,160 --> 03:23:17,580
a one researcher that published a tool

3193
03:23:17,580 --> 03:23:19,760
that I will present soon

3194
03:23:19,760 --> 03:23:22,439
and basically it was an anti copy

3195
03:23:22,439 --> 03:23:26,340
technique so a file executed on system a

3196
03:23:26,340 --> 03:23:29,640
could indefinitely work on system a but

3197
03:23:29,640 --> 03:23:31,680
on system b or on varist at all after

3198
03:23:31,680 --> 03:23:33,600
that it was not possible to execute it

3199
03:23:33,600 --> 03:23:35,700
that really sparked my interest because

3200
03:23:35,700 --> 03:23:37,319
it didn't explain anything about that

3201
03:23:37,319 --> 03:23:38,399
technique

3202
03:23:38,399 --> 03:23:40,140
so I spent a good amount of time trying

3203
03:23:40,140 --> 03:23:42,779
to understand what it was doing

3204
03:23:42,779 --> 03:23:45,540
um I found some some weaknesses then I

3205
03:23:45,540 --> 03:23:47,520
created more proof of concept that

3206
03:23:47,520 --> 03:23:49,680
improve on that technique so this is

3207
03:23:49,680 --> 03:23:52,020
what I will present today as for the

3208
03:23:52,020 --> 03:23:54,060
Innova and tqb techniques but first I

3209
03:23:54,060 --> 03:23:55,620
will present some established technique

3210
03:23:55,620 --> 03:23:57,239
that you can use to prevent your payload

3211
03:23:57,239 --> 03:23:59,939
from being executed in sandboxes or from

3212
03:23:59,939 --> 03:24:01,500
being reversed

3213
03:24:01,500 --> 03:24:03,180
then we will talk about detection

3214
03:24:03,180 --> 03:24:05,279
opportunities and other element to

3215
03:24:05,279 --> 03:24:07,640
consider

3216
03:24:08,939 --> 03:24:10,800
established techniques so the first big

3217
03:24:10,800 --> 03:24:12,840
category of technique you can use are

3218
03:24:12,840 --> 03:24:14,819
called guardrails so the goal of the

3219
03:24:14,819 --> 03:24:16,319
guardrails is to prevent your payload

3220
03:24:16,319 --> 03:24:17,939
from being executed in the wrong

3221
03:24:17,939 --> 03:24:19,260
environment so it can be either

3222
03:24:19,260 --> 03:24:23,100
Aristotle a Sandbox or just not your

3223
03:24:23,100 --> 03:24:25,739
right target there's multiple way you

3224
03:24:25,739 --> 03:24:27,899
can go about that so making sure your

3225
03:24:27,899 --> 03:24:29,880
pedal can check that the system is

3226
03:24:29,880 --> 03:24:31,979
joined to a domain that's a good enough

3227
03:24:31,979 --> 03:24:35,120
number of CPUs a high number of screen

3228
03:24:35,120 --> 03:24:37,620
as the mouse moves in the last few

3229
03:24:37,620 --> 03:24:39,540
minutes as the number of Windows changed

3230
03:24:39,540 --> 03:24:41,220
in the last few minutes so all those

3231
03:24:41,220 --> 03:24:42,180
techniques are really good against

3232
03:24:42,180 --> 03:24:43,680
sandboxes

3233
03:24:43,680 --> 03:24:45,960
a bit less against human because I add a

3234
03:24:45,960 --> 03:24:47,340
reverse I can just take a look at your

3235
03:24:47,340 --> 03:24:49,979
payload see what you're looking for and

3236
03:24:49,979 --> 03:24:52,739
just modify his virtual machine and in

3237
03:24:52,739 --> 03:24:54,000
the end you will be able to decoup your

3238
03:24:54,000 --> 03:24:56,640
payload get your shell code get URLs

3239
03:24:56,640 --> 03:24:58,620
Secrets Etc

3240
03:24:58,620 --> 03:24:59,880
so

3241
03:24:59,880 --> 03:25:02,100
it does good point but some good

3242
03:25:02,100 --> 03:25:04,640
weaknesses

3243
03:25:04,739 --> 03:25:06,180
um the next big category of things you

3244
03:25:06,180 --> 03:25:07,859
can do is is anti debugging or

3245
03:25:07,859 --> 03:25:09,359
anti-reversing technique so the goal is

3246
03:25:09,359 --> 03:25:11,700
to prevent a reverser from being able to

3247
03:25:11,700 --> 03:25:13,560
take your payload open it in a debugger

3248
03:25:13,560 --> 03:25:16,560
like I'm showing here and being able to

3249
03:25:16,560 --> 03:25:20,580
uh to bypass your uh basic guardrail so

3250
03:25:20,580 --> 03:25:21,960
in in the GIF at the right you can see

3251
03:25:21,960 --> 03:25:24,600
that I implemented two checks first when

3252
03:25:24,600 --> 03:25:26,040
you execute the payload without any

3253
03:25:26,040 --> 03:25:28,560
debugger running it it does not detect a

3254
03:25:28,560 --> 03:25:31,500
debugger but if you open either either

3255
03:25:31,500 --> 03:25:34,020
by default create a few temporary files

3256
03:25:34,020 --> 03:25:37,319
next to your to your payload so I'm

3257
03:25:37,319 --> 03:25:39,720
checking regularly for that those type

3258
03:25:39,720 --> 03:25:41,939
of files and also in the PEB of the

3259
03:25:41,939 --> 03:25:43,979
process there's the am I being debugged

3260
03:25:43,979 --> 03:25:46,200
the value that you can check so those

3261
03:25:46,200 --> 03:25:49,140
are two non entity bug or reversing

3262
03:25:49,140 --> 03:25:50,700
technique the more you add in your

3263
03:25:50,700 --> 03:25:52,319
payload the less the more it's painful

3264
03:25:52,319 --> 03:25:54,479
for the reverser so the goal is to add

3265
03:25:54,479 --> 03:25:56,880
as much as possible so the reverser lose

3266
03:25:56,880 --> 03:25:59,520
interest and move on to other things

3267
03:25:59,520 --> 03:26:02,040
I'm very I dedicated the reverser will

3268
03:26:02,040 --> 03:26:04,500
in the end be able to uh to decrypt your

3269
03:26:04,500 --> 03:26:06,359
pillow because if he has the right

3270
03:26:06,359 --> 03:26:07,920
tooling and the right knowledge he can

3271
03:26:07,920 --> 03:26:10,739
hide itself from uh from user mode your

3272
03:26:10,739 --> 03:26:12,359
pellet won't won't see that there's a

3273
03:26:12,359 --> 03:26:14,660
debug

3274
03:26:18,720 --> 03:26:22,020
so here's the first and novel NT copy

3275
03:26:22,020 --> 03:26:24,600
technique which is scroll like a king I

3276
03:26:24,600 --> 03:26:27,600
didn't develop this this was created by

3277
03:26:27,600 --> 03:26:29,939
a dress one it was presented at woodconn

3278
03:26:29,939 --> 03:26:32,340
and itcon in 2021.

3279
03:26:32,340 --> 03:26:34,439
um before I move on there's a QR code at

3280
03:26:34,439 --> 03:26:36,779
the bottom right I tested this morning

3281
03:26:36,779 --> 03:26:38,220
I'm not sure it's possible from the

3282
03:26:38,220 --> 03:26:39,859
crowd to scan it

3283
03:26:39,859 --> 03:26:43,140
but just know that at the end you can

3284
03:26:43,140 --> 03:26:46,500
just go on my GitHub and find the repos

3285
03:26:46,500 --> 03:26:49,140
so yeah this uh this proof of concept

3286
03:26:49,140 --> 03:26:52,140
was the published in 2021 and what you

3287
03:26:52,140 --> 03:26:54,420
can see is the in the GIF is that at the

3288
03:26:54,420 --> 03:26:58,080
right is executing the file one time and

3289
03:26:58,080 --> 03:26:59,520
then he's moving the file to a second

3290
03:26:59,520 --> 03:27:01,500
system and on the second system it

3291
03:27:01,500 --> 03:27:04,080
doesn't work anymore it has it was

3292
03:27:04,080 --> 03:27:07,700
saying it's naturally broken

3293
03:27:07,739 --> 03:27:09,840
but how does it work why is it naturally

3294
03:27:09,840 --> 03:27:12,960
broken once it's on the other system

3295
03:27:12,960 --> 03:27:15,779
well let me explain it to you

3296
03:27:15,779 --> 03:27:18,359
when you have an exe or ideal both files

3297
03:27:18,359 --> 03:27:20,340
are following the PE format and in the P

3298
03:27:20,340 --> 03:27:21,540
format there's something called the

3299
03:27:21,540 --> 03:27:23,399
import table so let's say you have a

3300
03:27:23,399 --> 03:27:25,200
basic program that when you execute it

3301
03:27:25,200 --> 03:27:27,600
it pops a message box

3302
03:27:27,600 --> 03:27:30,060
so to your program to be able to learn

3303
03:27:30,060 --> 03:27:31,859
to spawn a message box it needs to call

3304
03:27:31,859 --> 03:27:34,260
a function in a system dll on Windows

3305
03:27:34,260 --> 03:27:37,680
for message box it's it's a user32.dll

3306
03:27:37,680 --> 03:27:40,500
um so the import table of your parallel

3307
03:27:40,500 --> 03:27:42,540
needs to have an entry for message box

3308
03:27:42,540 --> 03:27:45,300
inside that data to be able to fetch

3309
03:27:45,300 --> 03:27:46,920
their address at runtime

3310
03:27:46,920 --> 03:27:48,720
so the

3311
03:27:48,720 --> 03:27:50,340
the text at the right the two more

3312
03:27:50,340 --> 03:27:53,040
important thing to uh to know today is

3313
03:27:53,040 --> 03:27:55,080
the original first tank and the first

3314
03:27:55,080 --> 03:27:56,520
tank

3315
03:27:56,520 --> 03:27:58,319
which are a small part of the import

3316
03:27:58,319 --> 03:28:00,779
table so the original first tank is a

3317
03:28:00,779 --> 03:28:03,000
read-only table which contains the

3318
03:28:03,000 --> 03:28:04,859
function names of each function that you

3319
03:28:04,859 --> 03:28:06,359
need at runtime

3320
03:28:06,359 --> 03:28:10,500
and at runtime the first table the first

3321
03:28:10,500 --> 03:28:13,800
tongue table which is empty on this will

3322
03:28:13,800 --> 03:28:15,960
get filled with the real address on the

3323
03:28:15,960 --> 03:28:17,760
current system for that function

3324
03:28:17,760 --> 03:28:19,260
so that every time that function is

3325
03:28:19,260 --> 03:28:21,359
called again it's the address stored in

3326
03:28:21,359 --> 03:28:24,800
phone first one that will be used

3327
03:28:25,500 --> 03:28:28,439
sorry it's a small or simple example in

3328
03:28:28,439 --> 03:28:31,200
the original first link you could have a

3329
03:28:31,200 --> 03:28:35,100
few etw related function at runtime in

3330
03:28:35,100 --> 03:28:37,319
first tongue you will get memory

3331
03:28:37,319 --> 03:28:39,180
addresses for first tongue in the first

3332
03:28:39,180 --> 03:28:42,439
thing that will get filled in

3333
03:28:42,600 --> 03:28:44,340
however it is true like a king proof of

3334
03:28:44,340 --> 03:28:45,840
concept does not use function names

3335
03:28:45,840 --> 03:28:49,680
instead it uses integers

3336
03:28:49,680 --> 03:28:52,620
but what are those integers those are

3337
03:28:52,620 --> 03:28:56,100
ordinals for so if you open any dll or

3338
03:28:56,100 --> 03:28:58,020
system dll on Windows you will see that

3339
03:28:58,020 --> 03:29:00,359
for each function the function name is

3340
03:29:00,359 --> 03:29:02,880
exported I'll but also a small integer

3341
03:29:02,880 --> 03:29:05,279
that is an ordinal and how it works is

3342
03:29:05,279 --> 03:29:06,899
that the first function of the dll that

3343
03:29:06,899 --> 03:29:08,760
is exported will add the number one the

3344
03:29:08,760 --> 03:29:12,239
second number two and so on and so forth

3345
03:29:12,239 --> 03:29:14,160
um normally everyone everybody call

3346
03:29:14,160 --> 03:29:16,260
function by by their names because this

3347
03:29:16,260 --> 03:29:18,479
is more stable the names don't change

3348
03:29:18,479 --> 03:29:21,420
however it's not the same same thing for

3349
03:29:21,420 --> 03:29:24,300
ordinal because for at every Windows

3350
03:29:24,300 --> 03:29:26,399
version change even for small Windows

3351
03:29:26,399 --> 03:29:29,880
version changes they are non-jordano

3352
03:29:29,880 --> 03:29:32,580
number can be swapped

3353
03:29:32,580 --> 03:29:34,800
so you could have a binary the color

3354
03:29:34,800 --> 03:29:36,660
function with ordinal you do a Windows

3355
03:29:36,660 --> 03:29:38,279
update suddenly it doesn't work anymore

3356
03:29:38,279 --> 03:29:40,700
not really fun for a normal program

3357
03:29:40,700 --> 03:29:44,279
maybe more interesting for payload

3358
03:29:44,279 --> 03:29:46,380
and you might see where I'm going uh two

3359
03:29:46,380 --> 03:29:49,560
with the with ordinals so the the screw

3360
03:29:49,560 --> 03:29:51,300
like a king proof of concept uh

3361
03:29:51,300 --> 03:29:52,680
basically what it does is you have two

3362
03:29:52,680 --> 03:29:54,779
binary the the Builder and the target

3363
03:29:54,779 --> 03:29:57,120
file so the Builder will load the target

3364
03:29:57,120 --> 03:29:59,939
files by it in memory map every every

3365
03:29:59,939 --> 03:30:02,520
section of the binary as an image in

3366
03:30:02,520 --> 03:30:03,840
memory like when you are doing PE

3367
03:30:03,840 --> 03:30:05,880
reflection it will then parse the import

3368
03:30:05,880 --> 03:30:08,640
table find every function names look up

3369
03:30:08,640 --> 03:30:12,000
the function ardinal on that system

3370
03:30:12,000 --> 03:30:13,859
swap the transformation so that the

3371
03:30:13,859 --> 03:30:15,720
importable only has Arduino and then

3372
03:30:15,720 --> 03:30:18,239
ever write back write everything back to

3373
03:30:18,239 --> 03:30:21,239
disk where the file was so every time

3374
03:30:21,239 --> 03:30:24,120
the file gets executed again there's no

3375
03:30:24,120 --> 03:30:25,560
function names in the import table only

3376
03:30:25,560 --> 03:30:28,140
function are only ardinals so it will

3377
03:30:28,140 --> 03:30:29,520
work on that system

3378
03:30:29,520 --> 03:30:32,040
but might maybe not on other system

3379
03:30:32,040 --> 03:30:33,600
which doesn't have the same Windows

3380
03:30:33,600 --> 03:30:36,439
build version

3381
03:30:37,560 --> 03:30:38,279
um

3382
03:30:38,279 --> 03:30:40,439
so

3383
03:30:40,439 --> 03:30:42,960
in the end it's a really efficient

3384
03:30:42,960 --> 03:30:44,760
technique but you need to trust your

3385
03:30:44,760 --> 03:30:46,439
victim to have a different Windows

3386
03:30:46,439 --> 03:30:49,140
version number than virus total or such

3387
03:30:49,140 --> 03:30:51,779
so it's great

3388
03:30:51,779 --> 03:30:53,340
but you have to trust your victim in

3389
03:30:53,340 --> 03:30:54,779
some way and I don't want to trust I

3390
03:30:54,779 --> 03:30:56,279
don't want to trust any victim any

3391
03:30:56,279 --> 03:30:59,279
Target so it has some drawbacks it's not

3392
03:30:59,279 --> 03:31:00,720
effective against the same Windows

3393
03:31:00,720 --> 03:31:02,819
version I tried to contact the authority

3394
03:31:02,819 --> 03:31:05,100
he never answered but I tested it with

3395
03:31:05,100 --> 03:31:06,720
between two systems that has an

3396
03:31:06,720 --> 03:31:09,600
identical Windows version and as you can

3397
03:31:09,600 --> 03:31:11,700
see even when you apply the screw

3398
03:31:11,700 --> 03:31:13,200
technique

3399
03:31:13,200 --> 03:31:15,479
on the first system like as of right now

3400
03:31:15,479 --> 03:31:18,540
calculate calc still work on the second

3401
03:31:18,540 --> 03:31:20,899
system

3402
03:31:21,540 --> 03:31:24,120
the same file will run again and work

3403
03:31:24,120 --> 03:31:25,680
perfectly

3404
03:31:25,680 --> 03:31:27,300
so it's a really good technique but has

3405
03:31:27,300 --> 03:31:29,960
some weaknesses

3406
03:31:31,739 --> 03:31:33,840
so here's what I did

3407
03:31:33,840 --> 03:31:36,420
uh first no ever since a link I like

3408
03:31:36,420 --> 03:31:38,939
name I first translated that technique

3409
03:31:38,939 --> 03:31:41,060
into nameline

3410
03:31:41,060 --> 03:31:43,560
and what I did is I improved it so

3411
03:31:43,560 --> 03:31:45,779
instead of needing two binary one that

3412
03:31:45,779 --> 03:31:48,239
Target the other the the file overwrite

3413
03:31:48,239 --> 03:31:50,580
itself and change itself so you could

3414
03:31:50,580 --> 03:31:52,920
send one file to your victim once the

3415
03:31:52,920 --> 03:31:56,160
file is executed once the file load

3416
03:31:56,160 --> 03:31:57,779
itself on memory change itself with

3417
03:31:57,779 --> 03:32:00,840
Arduino writes itself back to disk uh

3418
03:32:00,840 --> 03:32:03,239
how it so it's nicer you maybe in some

3419
03:32:03,239 --> 03:32:04,979
Ready Mix or you don't want to send too

3420
03:32:04,979 --> 03:32:07,100
many binaries to your target victim

3421
03:32:07,100 --> 03:32:09,540
however it has the same weakness you

3422
03:32:09,540 --> 03:32:11,880
don't you it's not effective between the

3423
03:32:11,880 --> 03:32:14,660
same Windows version

3424
03:32:16,319 --> 03:32:18,840
before I move on to the next technique

3425
03:32:18,840 --> 03:32:21,359
there's two concepts I need to talk with

3426
03:32:21,359 --> 03:32:23,700
you the first is alternate data stream

3427
03:32:23,700 --> 03:32:26,279
for those that don't know what is EDS or

3428
03:32:26,279 --> 03:32:27,660
alternate data stream you can look at

3429
03:32:27,660 --> 03:32:29,160
the image at the right you can see in

3430
03:32:29,160 --> 03:32:31,040
that folder I have only one file it's

3431
03:32:31,040 --> 03:32:34,080
nardsec.txt if I try to Output its

3432
03:32:34,080 --> 03:32:36,720
content with the first uh the first type

3433
03:32:36,720 --> 03:32:38,899
come in you will see the default content

3434
03:32:38,899 --> 03:32:41,160
however with EDS you can create

3435
03:32:41,160 --> 03:32:44,520
alternate content in uh what we call

3436
03:32:44,520 --> 03:32:46,920
alternate data Stream So if I request

3437
03:32:46,920 --> 03:32:50,160
that the the secret alternator stream

3438
03:32:50,160 --> 03:32:51,420
you will see that there's a different

3439
03:32:51,420 --> 03:32:54,120
content that's a NTFS function that was

3440
03:32:54,120 --> 03:32:57,420
created for Mac OS compatibility it's

3441
03:32:57,420 --> 03:32:59,340
mainly useful nowadays for web browser

3442
03:32:59,340 --> 03:33:01,380
so when you download a file using your

3443
03:33:01,380 --> 03:33:04,140
browser that is uh even it's sign or

3444
03:33:04,140 --> 03:33:06,060
unsigned you will get a Zone identifier

3445
03:33:06,060 --> 03:33:08,700
alternative stream applied to it so if

3446
03:33:08,700 --> 03:33:10,859
the file was in sign when you execute

3447
03:33:10,859 --> 03:33:12,420
the exe for example you will get that

3448
03:33:12,420 --> 03:33:14,819
big blue screen that we call smart

3449
03:33:14,819 --> 03:33:17,160
screen to tell you that hey that file is

3450
03:33:17,160 --> 03:33:19,739
not signed it's the main use nowadays

3451
03:33:19,739 --> 03:33:21,680
for ads

3452
03:33:21,680 --> 03:33:25,620
however every file has a default unnamed

3453
03:33:25,620 --> 03:33:28,319
data stream that when you create a basic

3454
03:33:28,319 --> 03:33:31,319
file and you open it in notepad for

3455
03:33:31,319 --> 03:33:33,239
example that's the default on name that

3456
03:33:33,239 --> 03:33:34,739
action that you see

3457
03:33:34,739 --> 03:33:36,420
the key thing to understand here is that

3458
03:33:36,420 --> 03:33:38,580
depending how it's done when you move a

3459
03:33:38,580 --> 03:33:40,620
file that has an alternate that are

3460
03:33:40,620 --> 03:33:42,660
streamed to another system or to virus

3461
03:33:42,660 --> 03:33:45,479
total for example the Eds does not come

3462
03:33:45,479 --> 03:33:46,859
with it

3463
03:33:46,859 --> 03:33:49,200
so that's really interesting

3464
03:33:49,200 --> 03:33:51,540
keep that in mind the next concept is

3465
03:33:51,540 --> 03:33:53,939
self-deletion so normally on Windows

3466
03:33:53,939 --> 03:33:56,160
it's not possible for a process to

3467
03:33:56,160 --> 03:33:58,920
delete or even you you cannot delete a

3468
03:33:58,920 --> 03:34:00,239
file which is linked to our running

3469
03:34:00,239 --> 03:34:01,380
process

3470
03:34:01,380 --> 03:34:03,300
so if the file is mapped into memory and

3471
03:34:03,300 --> 03:34:05,279
the process is running you cannot delete

3472
03:34:05,279 --> 03:34:08,040
that file however Jonas slick found a

3473
03:34:08,040 --> 03:34:10,439
way to do it anyway so how it works is

3474
03:34:10,439 --> 03:34:12,000
that your parallel gets an indole on

3475
03:34:12,000 --> 03:34:15,540
itself rename is default unnamed data

3476
03:34:15,540 --> 03:34:18,300
stream to something named close Yandel

3477
03:34:18,300 --> 03:34:20,399
reopen and when it tries to close the

3478
03:34:20,399 --> 03:34:22,319
window again since there is no primary

3479
03:34:22,319 --> 03:34:24,600
data stream Windows trigger the file

3480
03:34:24,600 --> 03:34:27,060
delete itself so you end up with a

3481
03:34:27,060 --> 03:34:28,620
process in memory

3482
03:34:28,620 --> 03:34:32,479
that is not linked to any file on this

3483
03:34:37,859 --> 03:34:39,420
so here's the first technique I created

3484
03:34:39,420 --> 03:34:43,040
which is like I call payload routine

3485
03:34:43,200 --> 03:34:46,020
so the goal would be to have a payload

3486
03:34:46,020 --> 03:34:48,180
that contains encrypted stuff like Shell

3487
03:34:48,180 --> 03:34:51,479
Code URLs other secrets

3488
03:34:51,479 --> 03:34:53,760
um and have it executed on a system a

3489
03:34:53,760 --> 03:34:56,040
while not having any prior information

3490
03:34:56,040 --> 03:34:58,859
on system a then I want that file to

3491
03:34:58,859 --> 03:35:01,020
always execute successful on system a

3492
03:35:01,020 --> 03:35:04,319
but never again on system BC virus.org

3493
03:35:04,319 --> 03:35:05,939
or other virtual machine

3494
03:35:05,939 --> 03:35:08,100
all right or I I want it to be hard to

3495
03:35:08,100 --> 03:35:10,080
execute it or to decrypt the encrypted

3496
03:35:10,080 --> 03:35:12,260
step

3497
03:35:14,040 --> 03:35:15,720
so here's the plan at the right you can

3498
03:35:15,720 --> 03:35:19,439
see a x dump of a binary the parts in

3499
03:35:19,439 --> 03:35:21,020
red are

3500
03:35:21,020 --> 03:35:23,819
encrypted secrets in in this text so you

3501
03:35:23,819 --> 03:35:26,520
could think of variables URLs or other

3502
03:35:26,520 --> 03:35:28,200
stuff

3503
03:35:28,200 --> 03:35:30,960
um so the build loads its own bytes in

3504
03:35:30,960 --> 03:35:34,680
memory locate those Secrets decrypt them

3505
03:35:34,680 --> 03:35:37,260
with the hard-coded key then generate a

3506
03:35:37,260 --> 03:35:40,439
new key store part of that key into ads

3507
03:35:40,439 --> 03:35:43,319
or the whole and then re-encrypt those

3508
03:35:43,319 --> 03:35:45,720
decrypted secrets in memory then

3509
03:35:45,720 --> 03:35:50,060
overwrite itself back on this

3510
03:35:51,600 --> 03:35:54,239
few things so to be able to locate my

3511
03:35:54,239 --> 03:35:57,060
encrypted Secrets I append and prepend

3512
03:35:57,060 --> 03:35:58,979
those secrets with a unique pattern that

3513
03:35:58,979 --> 03:36:00,300
is not commonly found in the byte

3514
03:36:00,300 --> 03:36:02,580
patterns of a file

3515
03:36:02,580 --> 03:36:03,239
um

3516
03:36:03,239 --> 03:36:05,819
then I will just show you the quick GIF

3517
03:36:05,819 --> 03:36:07,859
while I I talk about the rest in the

3518
03:36:07,859 --> 03:36:10,080
gift you can see that I'm executing a

3519
03:36:10,080 --> 03:36:12,720
nimir key.exe on system a I tried to

3520
03:36:12,720 --> 03:36:15,239
re-execute it it still work then I move

3521
03:36:15,239 --> 03:36:18,239
it on on system B uh which has a month

3522
03:36:18,239 --> 03:36:20,180
at a mountain drive for the same file

3523
03:36:20,180 --> 03:36:23,279
compute on desktop re-execute it

3524
03:36:23,279 --> 03:36:25,200
um it's not it does not work anymore and

3525
03:36:25,200 --> 03:36:27,180
I also added a function that self-delete

3526
03:36:27,180 --> 03:36:29,760
when it detects that is on it is on

3527
03:36:29,760 --> 03:36:32,160
another system

3528
03:36:32,160 --> 03:36:35,819
so for all of that to work uh initially

3529
03:36:35,819 --> 03:36:39,300
the key needs to be a ash it's my

3530
03:36:39,300 --> 03:36:40,739
implementation because when you replace

3531
03:36:40,739 --> 03:36:43,680
bytes in your in your payload you cannot

3532
03:36:43,680 --> 03:36:45,540
change the length so Mikey needs to

3533
03:36:45,540 --> 03:36:47,760
always be the same length and this is

3534
03:36:47,760 --> 03:36:49,800
the same thing for encrypted secrets so

3535
03:36:49,800 --> 03:36:51,180
you need to you need to use an

3536
03:36:51,180 --> 03:36:53,700
encryption algorithm which does not add

3537
03:36:53,700 --> 03:36:56,540
padding or change the length the the

3538
03:36:56,540 --> 03:36:58,680
byte code needs to be need to be the

3539
03:36:58,680 --> 03:37:00,899
same length so you can use uh encryption

3540
03:37:00,899 --> 03:37:02,300
like

3541
03:37:02,300 --> 03:37:06,300
aes256 CTR if I remember correctly that

3542
03:37:06,300 --> 03:37:08,340
encryption does not change anything as

3543
03:37:08,340 --> 03:37:09,479
for the link

3544
03:37:09,479 --> 03:37:12,060
so I keep I store the original key which

3545
03:37:12,060 --> 03:37:14,399
is an ash and I start the art the ash of

3546
03:37:14,399 --> 03:37:17,279
the original Ash and then when I do the

3547
03:37:17,279 --> 03:37:19,620
raking operation I generate the new key

3548
03:37:19,620 --> 03:37:21,300
replace the bytes and memory for that

3549
03:37:21,300 --> 03:37:24,479
key and at every run even on the first I

3550
03:37:24,479 --> 03:37:26,700
validate that the ash of the key is the

3551
03:37:26,700 --> 03:37:29,460
same as the original Ash of the ash of

3552
03:37:29,460 --> 03:37:31,800
the ghee so if that is different it

3553
03:37:31,800 --> 03:37:33,600
means that I'm on the second run it

3554
03:37:33,600 --> 03:37:35,760
means that I'm really I'm I am already

3555
03:37:35,760 --> 03:37:37,560
rekeyed

3556
03:37:37,560 --> 03:37:39,840
so yeah like I said on subsequent runs

3557
03:37:39,840 --> 03:37:42,899
and that that thing is checked and my

3558
03:37:42,899 --> 03:37:44,580
pillow will know that it needs to use

3559
03:37:44,580 --> 03:37:47,460
the new key and part of part or the

3560
03:37:47,460 --> 03:37:49,500
whole thing that is stored in EDS to be

3561
03:37:49,500 --> 03:37:51,899
able to decrypt URL Shell Code in other

3562
03:37:51,899 --> 03:37:54,600
recipients if that decryption fails I

3563
03:37:54,600 --> 03:37:55,979
trigger the subdivision as you can see

3564
03:37:55,979 --> 03:37:57,060
in the gif

3565
03:37:57,060 --> 03:37:59,220
the goal is to give

3566
03:37:59,220 --> 03:38:01,380
less possible opportunities for the

3567
03:38:01,380 --> 03:38:02,580
routine to be able to decrypt the

3568
03:38:02,580 --> 03:38:04,200
payload

3569
03:38:04,200 --> 03:38:06,500
um yeah

3570
03:38:07,080 --> 03:38:08,760
so in that case the payload becomes

3571
03:38:08,760 --> 03:38:11,460
bricked if the file is moved to another

3572
03:38:11,460 --> 03:38:12,620
system

3573
03:38:12,620 --> 03:38:15,720
and or if the file is uploaded to an

3574
03:38:15,720 --> 03:38:18,180
online sign box or if like the stock

3575
03:38:18,180 --> 03:38:20,279
analyst download your file using the EDR

3576
03:38:20,279 --> 03:38:22,800
functionality in all those cases the Eds

3577
03:38:22,800 --> 03:38:25,439
does not come with it if you if you have

3578
03:38:25,439 --> 03:38:27,600
an NTFS USB key and you move the file on

3579
03:38:27,600 --> 03:38:30,060
it since it's a NTFS function the Eds

3580
03:38:30,060 --> 03:38:32,220
will come with it but if your USB key is

3581
03:38:32,220 --> 03:38:34,560
FAT32 for example Yeah the secret will

3582
03:38:34,560 --> 03:38:35,939
be gone if you delete the file the

3583
03:38:35,939 --> 03:38:38,160
secret is gone if you move it in any

3584
03:38:38,160 --> 03:38:41,779
North ways the script will begin

3585
03:38:44,700 --> 03:38:46,680
um this technique was nice but I it

3586
03:38:46,680 --> 03:38:49,500
again had some weaknesses because if the

3587
03:38:49,500 --> 03:38:52,500
stock or if the the analysis process

3588
03:38:52,500 --> 03:38:54,359
took an image of the of the system

3589
03:38:54,359 --> 03:38:56,460
before doing the reverse the reverse

3590
03:38:56,460 --> 03:38:58,560
operation in the end they will they will

3591
03:38:58,560 --> 03:39:00,600
know that I'm looking for a key in EDS

3592
03:39:00,600 --> 03:39:02,939
if if they still have the laptop or the

3593
03:39:02,939 --> 03:39:06,060
system they can get the secret back

3594
03:39:06,060 --> 03:39:10,880
um so I want then something even better

3595
03:39:12,180 --> 03:39:14,160
um so here's the Nim drmm proof of

3596
03:39:14,160 --> 03:39:15,660
concept the goal was to build the

3597
03:39:15,660 --> 03:39:16,800
strength of the last proof of concept

3598
03:39:16,800 --> 03:39:19,319
but even provide even less opportunities

3599
03:39:19,319 --> 03:39:21,840
for The Blue Team to in the end be able

3600
03:39:21,840 --> 03:39:25,760
to decrypt yourself yeah the payload

3601
03:39:26,340 --> 03:39:28,080
so the approach is that I've completely

3602
03:39:28,080 --> 03:39:29,939
removed the decryption key from the

3603
03:39:29,939 --> 03:39:31,859
payload I'm using an external licensing

3604
03:39:31,859 --> 03:39:32,819
server

3605
03:39:32,819 --> 03:39:35,880
um so let me explain the GIF at the left

3606
03:39:35,880 --> 03:39:37,620
you have a license server that runs on

3607
03:39:37,620 --> 03:39:38,700
system a

3608
03:39:38,700 --> 03:39:40,739
at the at the right sometimes you have

3609
03:39:40,739 --> 03:39:43,920
system B and if the file is initially

3610
03:39:43,920 --> 03:39:47,220
created executed on system B and contact

3611
03:39:47,220 --> 03:39:49,260
the license server on system a

3612
03:39:49,260 --> 03:39:52,140
the payload contains a unique license

3613
03:39:52,140 --> 03:39:55,020
that it sends it to the license server

3614
03:39:55,020 --> 03:39:57,359
on the first time with many uh

3615
03:39:57,359 --> 03:40:00,479
fingerprinting elements like file ashes

3616
03:40:00,479 --> 03:40:03,540
hostname and you can get creative with

3617
03:40:03,540 --> 03:40:05,520
this the goal is to

3618
03:40:05,520 --> 03:40:09,180
uh it can look like a in entity sheet or

3619
03:40:09,180 --> 03:40:12,600
licensing server for games though it's a

3620
03:40:12,600 --> 03:40:14,640
really cheap version of that

3621
03:40:14,640 --> 03:40:18,300
um you can calculate the NIMA reach exam

3622
03:40:18,300 --> 03:40:20,580
of some important element of your

3623
03:40:20,580 --> 03:40:23,399
payload to make sure it's not bypassed

3624
03:40:23,399 --> 03:40:25,140
you send all that information to the

3625
03:40:25,140 --> 03:40:26,520
license server the goal of the license

3626
03:40:26,520 --> 03:40:28,439
server is to take a decision with what

3627
03:40:28,439 --> 03:40:31,859
was provided if it decides to return the

3628
03:40:31,859 --> 03:40:34,979
decryption key it will also send a

3629
03:40:34,979 --> 03:40:36,960
generated secret the secret will get

3630
03:40:36,960 --> 03:40:38,640
stored in ads I think you can see the

3631
03:40:38,640 --> 03:40:41,460
pattern here and that secret needs to be

3632
03:40:41,460 --> 03:40:44,300
provided on each subsequent run

3633
03:40:44,300 --> 03:40:47,520
with all those other unique elements

3634
03:40:47,520 --> 03:40:50,160
that fingerprint the system

3635
03:40:50,160 --> 03:40:52,020
so if again if anything is missing the

3636
03:40:52,020 --> 03:40:53,100
license will work then return that

3637
03:40:53,100 --> 03:40:55,080
message to self-delete or do other

3638
03:40:55,080 --> 03:40:57,620
actions

3639
03:40:59,700 --> 03:41:02,100
in this case the license uh the the bill

3640
03:41:02,100 --> 03:41:03,420
gets bricked for the same reason as

3641
03:41:03,420 --> 03:41:06,120
before but if you added all those basic

3642
03:41:06,120 --> 03:41:07,739
guard rails and anteriorating technique

3643
03:41:07,739 --> 03:41:10,260
that I talked at the beginning uh so if

3644
03:41:10,260 --> 03:41:12,300
there if some if someone patch the

3645
03:41:12,300 --> 03:41:14,100
binary to bypass some basic guardrails

3646
03:41:14,100 --> 03:41:16,859
the file hash will be different uh so

3647
03:41:16,859 --> 03:41:19,080
the license will get banned uh if the

3648
03:41:19,080 --> 03:41:21,060
process is being debugged for any reason

3649
03:41:21,060 --> 03:41:22,979
uh the process the license will get

3650
03:41:22,979 --> 03:41:25,020
banned and more importantly if as an

3651
03:41:25,020 --> 03:41:27,479
operator you feel like it's time to

3652
03:41:27,479 --> 03:41:29,160
close your

3653
03:41:29,160 --> 03:41:31,620
um your campaign uh if you if you feel

3654
03:41:31,620 --> 03:41:33,540
that the stock is as big in is

3655
03:41:33,540 --> 03:41:35,279
investigation you can just bundle

3656
03:41:35,279 --> 03:41:36,840
license or closes your license server

3657
03:41:36,840 --> 03:41:40,080
and the decryption key will never get

3658
03:41:40,080 --> 03:41:42,500
returned again

3659
03:41:45,060 --> 03:41:48,680
sorry some detection opportunities

3660
03:41:50,640 --> 03:41:53,340
the one technique that is all of the

3661
03:41:53,340 --> 03:41:54,840
proof of concept that I represented

3662
03:41:54,840 --> 03:41:57,140
today is ads

3663
03:41:57,140 --> 03:41:59,939
so you can use this one to detect that

3664
03:41:59,939 --> 03:42:03,180
or to lock that as you the thing you

3665
03:42:03,180 --> 03:42:04,260
need to know that is that basic

3666
03:42:04,260 --> 03:42:06,300
configuration for system online does not

3667
03:42:06,300 --> 03:42:10,140
look for exe creating EDS except if they

3668
03:42:10,140 --> 03:42:12,840
are in the download startup or temp

3669
03:42:12,840 --> 03:42:16,020
folder there are some other assessment

3670
03:42:16,020 --> 03:42:18,120
configuration like this one from from

3671
03:42:18,120 --> 03:42:20,580
Florida that checks for very specific

3672
03:42:20,580 --> 03:42:23,220
alternate data stream name in this case

3673
03:42:23,220 --> 03:42:24,899
this is a couple strike begin object

3674
03:42:24,899 --> 03:42:27,239
file and that is public

3675
03:42:27,239 --> 03:42:28,859
but as you can see you cannot always

3676
03:42:28,859 --> 03:42:31,260
trust hackers to be consistent there are

3677
03:42:31,260 --> 03:42:33,239
multiple other GitHub repo that use

3678
03:42:33,239 --> 03:42:35,939
other alternate data stream so in the

3679
03:42:35,939 --> 03:42:38,460
end this is not really a good detection

3680
03:42:38,460 --> 03:42:40,739
mechanism

3681
03:42:40,739 --> 03:42:43,140
I initially thought that I had a really

3682
03:42:43,140 --> 03:42:46,380
good detection idea is that my payload

3683
03:42:46,380 --> 03:42:49,739
right creates an Eds on itself

3684
03:42:49,739 --> 03:42:52,859
so if the main usage of EDS nowadays is

3685
03:42:52,859 --> 03:42:55,319
a browser treating uh something

3686
03:42:55,319 --> 03:42:58,380
identifier ads a file creating an NDS on

3687
03:42:58,380 --> 03:43:00,420
itself would be a really good detection

3688
03:43:00,420 --> 03:43:02,220
however as you can see this in this

3689
03:43:02,220 --> 03:43:05,279
system image uh it's not numericky.exe

3690
03:43:05,279 --> 03:43:08,760
that creates its ads it's explorer.exe

3691
03:43:08,760 --> 03:43:11,040
I have no idea why this is the case I

3692
03:43:11,040 --> 03:43:13,680
need to investigate more but uh for uh

3693
03:43:13,680 --> 03:43:15,739
on all the the tests I did it was always

3694
03:43:15,739 --> 03:43:17,700
explore.exe so this is not really nice

3695
03:43:17,700 --> 03:43:19,859
for a detection opportunity

3696
03:43:19,859 --> 03:43:22,140
however you could be really well

3697
03:43:22,140 --> 03:43:24,120
Baseline your environment for any EDS

3698
03:43:24,120 --> 03:43:27,260
creation and aside from Zone identifier

3699
03:43:27,260 --> 03:43:31,279
I don't think there's many more

3700
03:43:32,060 --> 03:43:34,560
EDS creation so Baseline your

3701
03:43:34,560 --> 03:43:37,439
environment is a really good idea and

3702
03:43:37,439 --> 03:43:39,120
attacker will try to mimic The Zone

3703
03:43:39,120 --> 03:43:42,540
identify your ads but without other

3704
03:43:42,540 --> 03:43:44,220
custom content

3705
03:43:44,220 --> 03:43:47,100
that will not add much value another key

3706
03:43:47,100 --> 03:43:49,380
stuff to to note here you can see the

3707
03:43:49,380 --> 03:43:52,739
content so the content of my EDS was

3708
03:43:52,739 --> 03:43:55,020
logged I can guarantee you that I didn't

3709
03:43:55,020 --> 03:43:57,060
create it this Chinese or Asian looking

3710
03:43:57,060 --> 03:44:00,479
string so events is none does not

3711
03:44:00,479 --> 03:44:02,880
monitor correctly the content of EDS

3712
03:44:02,880 --> 03:44:06,019
being treated

3713
03:44:07,620 --> 03:44:10,140
so as a conclusion NT copy is really fun

3714
03:44:10,140 --> 03:44:12,060
I encourage every red team or pen

3715
03:44:12,060 --> 03:44:14,700
testing to play with it I also encourage

3716
03:44:14,700 --> 03:44:15,960
every blue team to start play with it

3717
03:44:15,960 --> 03:44:18,540
because I uh we never know when

3718
03:44:18,540 --> 03:44:20,399
introductor starts using that those

3719
03:44:20,399 --> 03:44:22,979
techniques other aspect to consider will

3720
03:44:22,979 --> 03:44:25,620
be handling of the key so when you

3721
03:44:25,620 --> 03:44:27,060
contact your the license server for

3722
03:44:27,060 --> 03:44:29,100
example and get the decryption key if

3723
03:44:29,100 --> 03:44:31,680
the file continue to execute for a long

3724
03:44:31,680 --> 03:44:34,319
number of time keeping them in the kin

3725
03:44:34,319 --> 03:44:35,880
memory is dangerous because any blue

3726
03:44:35,880 --> 03:44:37,439
team can dump your process and get your

3727
03:44:37,439 --> 03:44:41,640
key and in the same style of idea in

3728
03:44:41,640 --> 03:44:43,140
general preventing in memory content

3729
03:44:43,140 --> 03:44:45,600
carving using some sleep masks if you're

3730
03:44:45,600 --> 03:44:48,060
using the bus right for example is a

3731
03:44:48,060 --> 03:44:50,160
nice way to

3732
03:44:50,160 --> 03:44:52,260
make content carving at runtime

3733
03:44:52,260 --> 03:44:54,239
difficult

3734
03:44:54,239 --> 03:44:56,520
today I start every Secret in ads

3735
03:44:56,520 --> 03:44:58,200
because I find it nice it's volatile

3736
03:44:58,200 --> 03:45:00,120
it's it's hard to notice but you could

3737
03:45:00,120 --> 03:45:01,800
store that that secret in other

3738
03:45:01,800 --> 03:45:05,580
locations like regulative and log or the

3739
03:45:05,580 --> 03:45:07,500
file system itself however in my opinion

3740
03:45:07,500 --> 03:45:08,880
it offers more opportunities for The

3741
03:45:08,880 --> 03:45:10,520
Blue Team to find it

3742
03:45:10,520 --> 03:45:14,420
in a short period of time

3743
03:45:14,640 --> 03:45:17,040
well thank you so

3744
03:45:17,040 --> 03:45:19,080
again if you want to look at the proof

3745
03:45:19,080 --> 03:45:20,640
of concept I released today they are on

3746
03:45:20,640 --> 03:45:24,000
my GitHub at offensive teacher offense

3747
03:45:24,000 --> 03:45:26,060
teacher sorry on get them

3748
03:45:26,060 --> 03:45:29,539
yeah thank you

3749
03:45:36,660 --> 03:45:39,479
thank you good job for your talk it was

3750
03:45:39,479 --> 03:45:42,479
very very interesting uh guys don't

3751
03:45:42,479 --> 03:45:44,760
forget to send your questions on the

3752
03:45:44,760 --> 03:45:47,100
slido I will address them at the Q a

3753
03:45:47,100 --> 03:45:49,020
after that and we'll be back in 15

3754
03:45:49,020 --> 03:45:52,939
minutes at 1 45.

3755
03:45:56,040 --> 03:45:59,040
hmm

3756
03:59:25,580 --> 03:59:30,199
one two thank you

3757
03:59:30,359 --> 03:59:32,279
um we'll we'll continue this afternoon

3758
03:59:32,279 --> 03:59:35,160
with with this red team block

3759
03:59:35,160 --> 03:59:38,840
we have with us a legend

3760
03:59:38,840 --> 03:59:41,699
uh I'm sure everyone knows Charles

3761
03:59:41,699 --> 03:59:43,920
Hamilton so I'm not sure I will really

3762
03:59:43,920 --> 03:59:47,040
take too much time to introduce him uh

3763
03:59:47,040 --> 03:59:50,399
but just for the form uh shall is uh the

3764
03:59:50,399 --> 03:59:52,380
for the founder of ring zero Team

3765
03:59:52,380 --> 03:59:55,500
website he's known as Mr nicoder he has

3766
03:59:55,500 --> 03:59:58,580
a patreon he has been given many talks

3767
03:59:58,580 --> 04:00:02,460
uh always very epic stuff so Charles

3768
04:00:02,460 --> 04:00:05,640
have fun thank you thank you can you

3769
04:00:05,640 --> 04:00:07,140
guys hear me

3770
04:00:07,140 --> 04:00:09,680
I think

3771
04:00:10,560 --> 04:00:12,960
so I have a tendency to have way too

3772
04:00:12,960 --> 04:00:14,699
much content so this is going to be like

3773
04:00:14,699 --> 04:00:15,899
30 minutes

3774
04:00:15,899 --> 04:00:18,239
for probably three hours of content so

3775
04:00:18,239 --> 04:00:21,000
buckle up we're going to start real fast

3776
04:00:21,000 --> 04:00:23,359
uh nothing really interesting about me

3777
04:00:23,359 --> 04:00:27,000
manager at KPMG we have some KPMG folks

3778
04:00:27,000 --> 04:00:29,460
also known as Mr unicoder founders of

3779
04:00:29,460 --> 04:00:30,840
ring zero team and a bunch of other

3780
04:00:30,840 --> 04:00:33,960
stuff some GitHub code that I wrote over

3781
04:00:33,960 --> 04:00:36,359
the years and also have a patreon for

3782
04:00:36,359 --> 04:00:38,699
like three years now where I produce a

3783
04:00:38,699 --> 04:00:41,220
lot of content regarding red teaming and

3784
04:00:41,220 --> 04:00:43,859
a lot of love to share with everyone

3785
04:00:43,859 --> 04:00:45,960
so first of all I guess we're just going

3786
04:00:45,960 --> 04:00:47,819
to address this difference between red

3787
04:00:47,819 --> 04:00:50,279
team and typical intrusion tests I guess

3788
04:00:50,279 --> 04:00:52,979
the key Point here is that a typical pen

3789
04:00:52,979 --> 04:00:56,100
testing will not assess the polluting

3790
04:00:56,100 --> 04:00:58,319
efficient Effectiveness right so we're

3791
04:00:58,319 --> 04:00:59,640
not trying to see if they're good at

3792
04:00:59,640 --> 04:01:01,080
detecting you or anything like that

3793
04:01:01,080 --> 04:01:03,359
we're usually not going to do any social

3794
04:01:03,359 --> 04:01:05,460
engineering and stuff like that so when

3795
04:01:05,460 --> 04:01:07,500
we go to Red Team this is slightly

3796
04:01:07,500 --> 04:01:08,939
different right we want to actually

3797
04:01:08,939 --> 04:01:11,040
assess the detection capability and

3798
04:01:11,040 --> 04:01:13,100
responsiveness capability of a company

3799
04:01:13,100 --> 04:01:15,359
because of that usually we're going to

3800
04:01:15,359 --> 04:01:17,040
have to deal with some security products

3801
04:01:17,040 --> 04:01:19,319
such as EDR antivirus and stuff like

3802
04:01:19,319 --> 04:01:21,660
that so that's the major difference from

3803
04:01:21,660 --> 04:01:23,580
a client perspective and also the tester

3804
04:01:23,580 --> 04:01:25,620
perspective right we have to deal with

3805
04:01:25,620 --> 04:01:27,479
those products and today we're going to

3806
04:01:27,479 --> 04:01:29,220
definitely focus on one of the phase of

3807
04:01:29,220 --> 04:01:31,260
a red team engagement there's much more

3808
04:01:31,260 --> 04:01:33,239
to it but lack of time so we're going to

3809
04:01:33,239 --> 04:01:35,699
focus on gaining access right you have

3810
04:01:35,699 --> 04:01:37,500
to have your code running at some points

3811
04:01:37,500 --> 04:01:39,239
and we need to find a way to evade those

3812
04:01:39,239 --> 04:01:41,699
products as red teamer

3813
04:01:41,699 --> 04:01:43,260
so for those of you that are familiar

3814
04:01:43,260 --> 04:01:45,720
with typical C2 framework you probably

3815
04:01:45,720 --> 04:01:47,160
have seen something like that in the

3816
04:01:47,160 --> 04:01:49,800
past this is typical Shell Code this is

3817
04:01:49,800 --> 04:01:51,479
something that you're going to see with

3818
04:01:51,479 --> 04:01:53,399
meter Predator Cobalt strike or any

3819
04:01:53,399 --> 04:01:55,140
other of the framework that are quite

3820
04:01:55,140 --> 04:01:57,359
popular no need to tell you that EDR and

3821
04:01:57,359 --> 04:01:59,100
AV are really good at detecting those

3822
04:01:59,100 --> 04:02:01,560
patterns those bytes are known forever I

3823
04:02:01,560 --> 04:02:04,819
just want to point out the

3824
04:02:04,819 --> 04:02:06,960
m-z-a-r-u-h just keep that in mind for

3825
04:02:06,960 --> 04:02:09,300
the future we're going to have to go

3826
04:02:09,300 --> 04:02:11,520
back to those bytes a bit later on so

3827
04:02:11,520 --> 04:02:13,020
this is well known this is highly

3828
04:02:13,020 --> 04:02:14,819
predictable of course from a detection

3829
04:02:14,819 --> 04:02:17,300
perspective this can be detected easily

3830
04:02:17,300 --> 04:02:19,500
there's a lot of stuff on your net about

3831
04:02:19,500 --> 04:02:22,640
evasion and bypass nothing fancy here

3832
04:02:22,640 --> 04:02:25,739
personally I love to not follow the

3833
04:02:25,739 --> 04:02:28,399
rules right if we look at the typical

3834
04:02:28,399 --> 04:02:30,720
tricks that's been used over the years

3835
04:02:30,720 --> 04:02:33,000
you're going to come across xor Loop

3836
04:02:33,000 --> 04:02:34,620
which is super typical it's like the

3837
04:02:34,620 --> 04:02:37,500
dummy encryption kind of thing using rc4

3838
04:02:37,500 --> 04:02:39,479
because it's a super simple algorithm to

3839
04:02:39,479 --> 04:02:43,260
implement uh as2 or is a basically for

3840
04:02:43,260 --> 04:02:45,239
you know layers of crap on top of your

3841
04:02:45,239 --> 04:02:46,920
charcoal to actually achieve evasion

3842
04:02:46,920 --> 04:02:49,800
there is a big issue with that most of

3843
04:02:49,800 --> 04:02:51,600
these will end up creating what we

3844
04:02:51,600 --> 04:02:53,640
consider encrypted shock code which

3845
04:02:53,640 --> 04:02:56,100
bring me to this next slide where

3846
04:02:56,100 --> 04:02:57,960
entropy is a thing and I know that

3847
04:02:57,960 --> 04:02:59,460
there's someone that is going to present

3848
04:02:59,460 --> 04:03:01,680
or had presented a talk about entropy

3849
04:03:01,680 --> 04:03:04,199
long story short high entropy which

3850
04:03:04,199 --> 04:03:05,939
means that the sample is highly random

3851
04:03:05,939 --> 04:03:07,620
is bad they know that there's a lot of

3852
04:03:07,620 --> 04:03:09,479
encryption and legitimate software tend

3853
04:03:09,479 --> 04:03:11,100
to have really low entropy in the sense

3854
04:03:11,100 --> 04:03:12,720
that there's a lot of pattern that

3855
04:03:12,720 --> 04:03:14,399
repeat themselves right so if you

3856
04:03:14,399 --> 04:03:15,899
encrypt half of your payload there's a

3857
04:03:15,899 --> 04:03:17,100
good chance that your entropy will be

3858
04:03:17,100 --> 04:03:18,660
terrible you would definitely want to

3859
04:03:18,660 --> 04:03:20,939
avoid that so you want to make sure that

3860
04:03:20,939 --> 04:03:23,399
your code look as uh you know repeatable

3861
04:03:23,399 --> 04:03:25,140
as possible and one of the key things

3862
04:03:25,140 --> 04:03:27,000
that I love to do instead of encryption

3863
04:03:27,000 --> 04:03:29,040
because as I mentioned I like to not

3864
04:03:29,040 --> 04:03:30,779
follow the trend

3865
04:03:30,779 --> 04:03:33,180
what I do is fairly simple I'll create a

3866
04:03:33,180 --> 04:03:35,220
dictionary of words whatever if you pick

3867
04:03:35,220 --> 04:03:38,699
256 word at random and then what you're

3868
04:03:38,699 --> 04:03:40,080
going to do is you're going to transfer

3869
04:03:40,080 --> 04:03:41,819
all your bytes into the offset

3870
04:03:41,819 --> 04:03:44,399
associated with the word in your list so

3871
04:03:44,399 --> 04:03:45,840
what you're going to end up with is

3872
04:03:45,840 --> 04:03:47,760
something similar to this right let's

3873
04:03:47,760 --> 04:03:50,220
say our shell code is zero zero two zero

3874
04:03:50,220 --> 04:03:52,260
one zero zero zero one and you have your

3875
04:03:52,260 --> 04:03:54,060
table that contain all the offsets in

3876
04:03:54,060 --> 04:03:55,500
this case we only have three because we

3877
04:03:55,500 --> 04:03:57,359
only have three different bytes so table

3878
04:03:57,359 --> 04:03:59,760
first second and third and the mapping

3879
04:03:59,760 --> 04:04:02,279
of the Shaco will be converted to First

3880
04:04:02,279 --> 04:04:04,319
third second first first second which

3881
04:04:04,319 --> 04:04:06,359
are actually words right so you may have

3882
04:04:06,359 --> 04:04:08,100
realized by now that we converted the

3883
04:04:08,100 --> 04:04:10,500
shotgun into actual Words which is quite

3884
04:04:10,500 --> 04:04:12,720
useful right especially when it comes to

3885
04:04:12,720 --> 04:04:14,040
entropy you're going to have a pretty

3886
04:04:14,040 --> 04:04:15,960
decent entropy because these pattern is

3887
04:04:15,960 --> 04:04:17,340
going to repeat over and over and over

3888
04:04:17,340 --> 04:04:19,260
and over and on your sailboat especially

3889
04:04:19,260 --> 04:04:20,939
if you're looking at stageless payload

3890
04:04:20,939 --> 04:04:22,080
you're gonna end up with like a three

3891
04:04:22,080 --> 04:04:24,000
megabyte sample with a bunch of words

3892
04:04:24,000 --> 04:04:26,040
that are harmless on their own

3893
04:04:26,040 --> 04:04:28,680
now how you actually deal with this

3894
04:04:28,680 --> 04:04:30,120
um lately I've been using a lot of

3895
04:04:30,120 --> 04:04:32,040
c-sharp to for my payload so you can

3896
04:04:32,040 --> 04:04:34,439
literally just use a built-in C sharp

3897
04:04:34,439 --> 04:04:36,779
capability which is array index of the

3898
04:04:36,779 --> 04:04:38,040
point is you're going to provide your

3899
04:04:38,040 --> 04:04:39,960
needles which is whatever advice you're

3900
04:04:39,960 --> 04:04:42,540
trying to map back to whatever it's in

3901
04:04:42,540 --> 04:04:43,739
your table and you're going to get the

3902
04:04:43,739 --> 04:04:45,420
offset which will eventually be

3903
04:04:45,420 --> 04:04:47,279
converted into the byte associated with

3904
04:04:47,279 --> 04:04:50,160
the original Shaco payload

3905
04:04:50,160 --> 04:04:53,279
so if you look at the final code if you

3906
04:04:53,279 --> 04:04:54,899
implement this in C sharp this is pretty

3907
04:04:54,899 --> 04:04:56,160
much what it's going to look like right

3908
04:04:56,160 --> 04:04:58,920
overall nothing really fancy you have

3909
04:04:58,920 --> 04:05:01,319
your table your mapping and the loop

3910
04:05:01,319 --> 04:05:03,300
here that actually just convert back the

3911
04:05:03,300 --> 04:05:05,460
index into this byte area which contain

3912
04:05:05,460 --> 04:05:07,500
the final data and then the typical

3913
04:05:07,500 --> 04:05:09,660
memory allocation virtual protect

3914
04:05:09,660 --> 04:05:12,000
Marshall copy and just executing the

3915
04:05:12,000 --> 04:05:13,439
function pointer to actually point to

3916
04:05:13,439 --> 04:05:15,239
the Shell Code so this is pretty

3917
04:05:15,239 --> 04:05:17,340
standard stuff the only major difference

3918
04:05:17,340 --> 04:05:19,080
here I'd say is really the use of word

3919
04:05:19,080 --> 04:05:21,239
instead of something else but you can be

3920
04:05:21,239 --> 04:05:23,160
creative the whole point here is avoid

3921
04:05:23,160 --> 04:05:25,020
encryption like this pattern is not

3922
04:05:25,020 --> 04:05:26,340
going to be as detected as any

3923
04:05:26,340 --> 04:05:27,899
encryption pattern because this is not

3924
04:05:27,899 --> 04:05:31,020
something as popular as the other uh

3925
04:05:31,020 --> 04:05:33,420
type of code that we see we need to

3926
04:05:33,420 --> 04:05:34,620
understand something too it's really

3927
04:05:34,620 --> 04:05:36,779
important right when we talk about edrs

3928
04:05:36,779 --> 04:05:39,120
and Antivirus solution when they

3929
04:05:39,120 --> 04:05:40,800
actually detect that kind of code when

3930
04:05:40,800 --> 04:05:42,420
you drop your pedal on this they're

3931
04:05:42,420 --> 04:05:44,160
going to check for Signature right it's

3932
04:05:44,160 --> 04:05:45,479
really important to understand that the

3933
04:05:45,479 --> 04:05:47,279
compiler will do a lot of magic for you

3934
04:05:47,279 --> 04:05:48,540
under the hood and you need to

3935
04:05:48,540 --> 04:05:50,040
understand that sometimes the compiler

3936
04:05:50,040 --> 04:05:52,739
will lie to you we're going to have a

3937
04:05:52,739 --> 04:05:54,359
brief look at what the compiler may

3938
04:05:54,359 --> 04:05:55,739
actually do for you keep in mind that

3939
04:05:55,739 --> 04:05:57,840
the same concept can also apply to C

3940
04:05:57,840 --> 04:06:00,720
sharp C sharp have a metal language

3941
04:06:00,720 --> 04:06:03,060
called MSI which is the up code version

3942
04:06:03,060 --> 04:06:05,100
of whatever you're going to write in C

3943
04:06:05,100 --> 04:06:06,960
sharp that is interpreted by the.net

3944
04:06:06,960 --> 04:06:08,580
environment

3945
04:06:08,580 --> 04:06:11,160
so just a quick example uh if you look

3946
04:06:11,160 --> 04:06:13,560
at GCC for example for a standard C code

3947
04:06:13,560 --> 04:06:15,540
right you can just compile it if you're

3948
04:06:15,540 --> 04:06:17,340
trying to use the optimization switch in

3949
04:06:17,340 --> 04:06:19,620
this case the o1 you actually ended up

3950
04:06:19,620 --> 04:06:21,120
with totally different codes so if we

3951
04:06:21,120 --> 04:06:23,340
look at this example here we have this

3952
04:06:23,340 --> 04:06:25,260
piece of C code that doesn't really do

3953
04:06:25,260 --> 04:06:27,420
much right it's just an xor Loop typical

3954
04:06:27,420 --> 04:06:30,120
stuff when it comes to encrypting Shell

3955
04:06:30,120 --> 04:06:31,920
Code right this is obviously a weak

3956
04:06:31,920 --> 04:06:33,420
encryption but the whole point is about

3957
04:06:33,420 --> 04:06:35,399
just to hide what you want to have

3958
04:06:35,399 --> 04:06:38,220
executed in memory later on right this

3959
04:06:38,220 --> 04:06:41,460
is the assembly code of this keep in

3960
04:06:41,460 --> 04:06:42,779
mind that at the end of the day what's

3961
04:06:42,779 --> 04:06:44,699
inside of your binary are those bytes

3962
04:06:44,699 --> 04:06:46,380
here right so they can build signature

3963
04:06:46,380 --> 04:06:48,359
on that let's in this case here you have

3964
04:06:48,359 --> 04:06:50,460
the for loop with the xrof which is

3965
04:06:50,460 --> 04:06:52,500
actually living in here so they could

3966
04:06:52,500 --> 04:06:54,359
actually build a signature on those

3967
04:06:54,359 --> 04:06:56,580
bytes here the point is you want to

3968
04:06:56,580 --> 04:06:58,380
obviously modify those bytes that's kind

3969
04:06:58,380 --> 04:07:00,779
of the whole point so if we look at this

3970
04:07:00,779 --> 04:07:03,960
same code with optimization one like I

3971
04:07:03,960 --> 04:07:05,819
showed earlier you'll see that we have

3972
04:07:05,819 --> 04:07:07,500
two different pieces of code right

3973
04:07:07,500 --> 04:07:10,500
notice here the that the xor is now here

3974
04:07:10,500 --> 04:07:13,020
you have this by here which is 80 30 of

3975
04:07:13,020 --> 04:07:16,260
and the original one was 83 F1 of

3976
04:07:16,260 --> 04:07:18,600
depending on how the compiler did its

3977
04:07:18,600 --> 04:07:20,340
magic it totally changed the code and

3978
04:07:20,340 --> 04:07:22,020
the signature is totally different just

3979
04:07:22,020 --> 04:07:23,279
keep in mind that sometimes using

3980
04:07:23,279 --> 04:07:25,380
optimization may change your code when

3981
04:07:25,380 --> 04:07:28,080
it comes to writing malicious code it

3982
04:07:28,080 --> 04:07:29,399
may also affect the way that the code

3983
04:07:29,399 --> 04:07:31,080
behave because you may actually try to

3984
04:07:31,080 --> 04:07:34,020
trick it but this is really important to

3985
04:07:34,020 --> 04:07:35,580
understand something the compiler is

3986
04:07:35,580 --> 04:07:37,319
definitely smarter than you sometimes

3987
04:07:37,319 --> 04:07:39,120
you're going to write super complex code

3988
04:07:39,120 --> 04:07:40,260
when you're going to compile it well

3989
04:07:40,260 --> 04:07:41,580
it's going to end up being the exact

3990
04:07:41,580 --> 04:07:43,520
same code that you had at the beginning

3991
04:07:43,520 --> 04:07:46,319
this is an example of why the compiler

3992
04:07:46,319 --> 04:07:47,580
is definitely smarter than you it's

3993
04:07:47,580 --> 04:07:49,380
going to try to guess for you so if you

3994
04:07:49,380 --> 04:07:52,020
declare a variable like I equals one and

3995
04:07:52,020 --> 04:07:54,779
you're trying to assign xor I into the

3996
04:07:54,779 --> 04:07:56,760
variable a well it's just going to

3997
04:07:56,760 --> 04:07:58,260
figure out that a will contain whatever

3998
04:07:58,260 --> 04:08:01,260
the result of one xor with I is right so

3999
04:08:01,260 --> 04:08:03,180
they're just gonna remove all that code

4000
04:08:03,180 --> 04:08:04,260
so it's not going to change the

4001
04:08:04,260 --> 04:08:05,460
signature

4002
04:08:05,460 --> 04:08:07,199
this is something to keep in mind the

4003
04:08:07,199 --> 04:08:08,580
trick usually when you want to make sure

4004
04:08:08,580 --> 04:08:10,439
that the signature will be different is

4005
04:08:10,439 --> 04:08:11,460
to make sure that you don't have any

4006
04:08:11,460 --> 04:08:13,380
static value in there so the compiler

4007
04:08:13,380 --> 04:08:14,939
cannot predict what the value is going

4008
04:08:14,939 --> 04:08:17,399
to look like so here's an example where

4009
04:08:17,399 --> 04:08:19,680
we have some code it's the same thing as

4010
04:08:19,680 --> 04:08:22,199
you as what we saw earlier right this is

4011
04:08:22,199 --> 04:08:24,239
the more complex version of this code

4012
04:08:24,239 --> 04:08:26,819
which is exactly the same result at the

4013
04:08:26,819 --> 04:08:28,140
end it's just that we use much more

4014
04:08:28,140 --> 04:08:30,479
complex code so as you can see here we

4015
04:08:30,479 --> 04:08:33,000
have the d word key equals the word size

4016
04:08:33,000 --> 04:08:35,040
xor with the word size this is a typical

4017
04:08:35,040 --> 04:08:37,020
trick it's actually going to zero out

4018
04:08:37,020 --> 04:08:39,060
the value and you may believe that oh

4019
04:08:39,060 --> 04:08:40,439
this is cool I'm going to change the

4020
04:08:40,439 --> 04:08:42,600
signature of micro with this xoring

4021
04:08:42,600 --> 04:08:44,220
technique at the end of the day the

4022
04:08:44,220 --> 04:08:45,660
compiler doesn't know what's inside of

4023
04:08:45,660 --> 04:08:47,340
the word size but it knows that this

4024
04:08:47,340 --> 04:08:49,500
operation will turn out to just create a

4025
04:08:49,500 --> 04:08:51,720
value with zero and then you have all

4026
04:08:51,720 --> 04:08:54,060
the magic you know we do plus plus which

4027
04:08:54,060 --> 04:08:55,560
is going to increment the value by one

4028
04:08:55,560 --> 04:08:58,140
bit shifting by four and then reducing

4029
04:08:58,140 --> 04:08:59,939
it by one at the end of the day this is

4030
04:08:59,939 --> 04:09:02,100
going to end up generating of so you may

4031
04:09:02,100 --> 04:09:04,319
think oh that's pretty cool my code is

4032
04:09:04,319 --> 04:09:06,540
super smart High added the five dollars

4033
04:09:06,540 --> 04:09:09,300
xor with the of well

4034
04:09:09,300 --> 04:09:11,520
the compiler figure it out for you so as

4035
04:09:11,520 --> 04:09:12,779
you can see here you ended up with the

4036
04:09:12,779 --> 04:09:15,180
same signature xor the byte which is

4037
04:09:15,180 --> 04:09:17,100
part of the loop with of because the

4038
04:09:17,100 --> 04:09:19,140
compiler was able to understand what's

4039
04:09:19,140 --> 04:09:21,300
going on in there

4040
04:09:21,300 --> 04:09:24,239
if you look at the code on the the right

4041
04:09:24,239 --> 04:09:26,580
side pretty similar the only difference

4042
04:09:26,580 --> 04:09:28,979
is the key in this case here which is d

4043
04:09:28,979 --> 04:09:31,739
word size is actually unknown because we

4044
04:09:31,739 --> 04:09:34,380
don't now negate it with like xor or

4045
04:09:34,380 --> 04:09:35,580
something like that so technically the

4046
04:09:35,580 --> 04:09:37,439
compiler doesn't know at this point what

4047
04:09:37,439 --> 04:09:39,540
it's going to look like however it's

4048
04:09:39,540 --> 04:09:41,580
still smarter than us it figured that

4049
04:09:41,580 --> 04:09:43,560
the solo Position will end it up causing

4050
04:09:43,560 --> 04:09:45,660
a knot which will actually revert all

4051
04:09:45,660 --> 04:09:47,399
the bat it's it's a it's a not

4052
04:09:47,399 --> 04:09:49,859
instruction so this was replaced uh with

4053
04:09:49,859 --> 04:09:53,580
a knot on this specific register here at

4054
04:09:53,580 --> 04:09:55,380
the end of the day it's still a victory

4055
04:09:55,380 --> 04:09:57,479
for you because you ended up having a

4056
04:09:57,479 --> 04:09:59,580
different signature right so it's just a

4057
04:09:59,580 --> 04:10:01,260
matter in this case of using different

4058
04:10:01,260 --> 04:10:03,600
piece of curl you change a liner too and

4059
04:10:03,600 --> 04:10:05,880
the whole signature is going to be

4060
04:10:05,880 --> 04:10:07,680
totally different so main takeaway when

4061
04:10:07,680 --> 04:10:10,500
it comes to obfuscating your C code or C

4062
04:10:10,500 --> 04:10:12,479
sharp code look at the actual final

4063
04:10:12,479 --> 04:10:14,819
result you may be surprised right so if

4064
04:10:14,819 --> 04:10:16,920
we go back to the original code right

4065
04:10:16,920 --> 04:10:18,720
which is the one that we have on the

4066
04:10:18,720 --> 04:10:21,300
right and the fully optimized one well

4067
04:10:21,300 --> 04:10:22,680
you're going to realize at this point

4068
04:10:22,680 --> 04:10:24,540
that the signature is totally different

4069
04:10:24,540 --> 04:10:26,520
at the end of the day those two pieces

4070
04:10:26,520 --> 04:10:29,220
of code will yell the same result but

4071
04:10:29,220 --> 04:10:30,840
signature wise they're totally different

4072
04:10:30,840 --> 04:10:32,220
and it's really important to actually

4073
04:10:32,220 --> 04:10:33,779
assess the code that you generate

4074
04:10:33,779 --> 04:10:35,520
through your compiler

4075
04:10:35,520 --> 04:10:37,800
so this is another example here if we

4076
04:10:37,800 --> 04:10:40,020
remove the optimization on the last one

4077
04:10:40,020 --> 04:10:41,640
that we saw because keep in mind that

4078
04:10:41,640 --> 04:10:43,620
the one on the right was also optimized

4079
04:10:43,620 --> 04:10:45,720
when compiled if we remove it you'll

4080
04:10:45,720 --> 04:10:48,120
notice here that it's much bigger so we

4081
04:10:48,120 --> 04:10:51,840
had the original 83 f1of and now this

4082
04:10:51,840 --> 04:10:53,640
whole operation here has been modified

4083
04:10:53,640 --> 04:10:56,939
for like a sub eax xor I cannot really

4084
04:10:56,939 --> 04:10:59,220
see anything to be honest and here is

4085
04:10:59,220 --> 04:11:03,000
but the xor is 31 C1 so at the end of

4086
04:11:03,000 --> 04:11:04,739
the day totally different signature

4087
04:11:04,739 --> 04:11:07,140
right just by modifying a bit of your

4088
04:11:07,140 --> 04:11:08,580
code right

4089
04:11:08,580 --> 04:11:10,439
the downside with that it's pretty

4090
04:11:10,439 --> 04:11:12,779
annoying right let's be honest if you

4091
04:11:12,779 --> 04:11:14,340
have to rewrite all your tools to make

4092
04:11:14,340 --> 04:11:15,960
sure that you obfuscate all the C code

4093
04:11:15,960 --> 04:11:18,899
or whatever language you use it's going

4094
04:11:18,899 --> 04:11:20,399
to be painful but keep in mind that this

4095
04:11:20,399 --> 04:11:21,840
is doable especially if you maintain

4096
04:11:21,840 --> 04:11:23,279
your old tool set that's why I usually

4097
04:11:23,279 --> 04:11:24,840
love to write my own tools so I have

4098
04:11:24,840 --> 04:11:26,399
full control over the source code and I

4099
04:11:26,399 --> 04:11:27,960
kind of understand what's going on to a

4100
04:11:27,960 --> 04:11:29,580
certain extent

4101
04:11:29,580 --> 04:11:30,660
um

4102
04:11:30,660 --> 04:11:32,819
there's that so let's just go back to

4103
04:11:32,819 --> 04:11:35,640
this original code for those of you that

4104
04:11:35,640 --> 04:11:37,260
are not necessarily familiar with most

4105
04:11:37,260 --> 04:11:39,540
of the modern C2 they have a concept

4106
04:11:39,540 --> 04:11:41,939
which is called sleep mask right sleep

4107
04:11:41,939 --> 04:11:44,460
mask is the ability to actually encrypt

4108
04:11:44,460 --> 04:11:46,979
the data in memory so when the beacon or

4109
04:11:46,979 --> 04:11:48,899
the agent is not doing anything it's

4110
04:11:48,899 --> 04:11:50,460
going to sleep in memory encrypted

4111
04:11:50,460 --> 04:11:52,739
there's no point of actually looking at

4112
04:11:52,739 --> 04:11:54,120
that piece of code because it's not

4113
04:11:54,120 --> 04:11:55,800
doing anything so they hook the Sleep

4114
04:11:55,800 --> 04:11:57,420
Method there's multiple method that you

4115
04:11:57,420 --> 04:12:00,000
can hook but the point is when it's

4116
04:12:00,000 --> 04:12:01,199
living and there it's going to be

4117
04:12:01,199 --> 04:12:03,060
totally encrypted so if there's memory

4118
04:12:03,060 --> 04:12:05,279
scanning going on well they're not going

4119
04:12:05,279 --> 04:12:07,680
to see anything however there's a catch

4120
04:12:07,680 --> 04:12:10,199
most of the code like that have no

4121
04:12:10,199 --> 04:12:12,060
effect when it comes to memory scanning

4122
04:12:12,060 --> 04:12:13,979
because if we look at all these engine

4123
04:12:13,979 --> 04:12:16,020
work you're going to end up actually

4124
04:12:16,020 --> 04:12:18,660
copying the code in memory at several

4125
04:12:18,660 --> 04:12:22,020
places just a quick hint final here

4126
04:12:22,020 --> 04:12:23,699
we're definitely going to have the final

4127
04:12:23,699 --> 04:12:25,140
Shell Code in there it's going to live

4128
04:12:25,140 --> 04:12:26,279
in memory that's going to be the

4129
04:12:26,279 --> 04:12:28,800
original shellco right the Marshall copy

4130
04:12:28,800 --> 04:12:30,660
2 is going to copy this into on my

4131
04:12:30,660 --> 04:12:33,060
manage variable they can be later reused

4132
04:12:33,060 --> 04:12:34,920
to call so we have please have two

4133
04:12:34,920 --> 04:12:36,660
variables that actually contain the

4134
04:12:36,660 --> 04:12:38,699
clear text charcoal which is definitely

4135
04:12:38,699 --> 04:12:40,140
something that you want to avoid right

4136
04:12:40,140 --> 04:12:42,300
and you can always validate that

4137
04:12:42,300 --> 04:12:44,880
by actually dumping the process so if

4138
04:12:44,880 --> 04:12:47,760
you just dump a process and you search

4139
04:12:47,760 --> 04:12:51,899
for patterns remember the MZ a r u h

4140
04:12:51,899 --> 04:12:53,460
that I mentioned earlier without

4141
04:12:53,460 --> 04:12:55,979
surprise well we have two instance of it

4142
04:12:55,979 --> 04:12:57,420
the reason why we don't have a third one

4143
04:12:57,420 --> 04:12:59,460
is because the agent itself is actually

4144
04:12:59,460 --> 04:13:01,560
encrypted in memory at this specific

4145
04:13:01,560 --> 04:13:04,020
time right so that's the expected beever

4146
04:13:04,020 --> 04:13:05,580
that's the whole point of a sleep mask

4147
04:13:05,580 --> 04:13:07,680
so million dollar question is there a

4148
04:13:07,680 --> 04:13:09,660
way to have an invisible Shuckle within

4149
04:13:09,660 --> 04:13:11,819
your process well the answer is yes

4150
04:13:11,819 --> 04:13:15,420
here's the trick uh it rely on trying to

4151
04:13:15,420 --> 04:13:18,779
get rid of the final content and the

4152
04:13:18,779 --> 04:13:21,300
allocated content later on how can you

4153
04:13:21,300 --> 04:13:22,800
do that well

4154
04:13:22,800 --> 04:13:24,359
there's two things we're going to have

4155
04:13:24,359 --> 04:13:26,640
the the a thread that is going to be

4156
04:13:26,640 --> 04:13:27,899
spawned so the whole point of having a

4157
04:13:27,899 --> 04:13:30,779
tread is you have execution in parallel

4158
04:13:30,779 --> 04:13:32,520
to another flow of code that it's

4159
04:13:32,520 --> 04:13:34,260
running the whole point is the whole

4160
04:13:34,260 --> 04:13:36,779
shenanigan of memory copying execution

4161
04:13:36,779 --> 04:13:38,340
is going to be inside of that tread

4162
04:13:38,340 --> 04:13:40,560
which I call let's have fun for whatever

4163
04:13:40,560 --> 04:13:42,960
reason and then inside of your main

4164
04:13:42,960 --> 04:13:44,520
you're just going to call that thread so

4165
04:13:44,520 --> 04:13:46,560
far nothing fancy

4166
04:13:46,560 --> 04:13:48,600
and then just to be sure I'm also going

4167
04:13:48,600 --> 04:13:50,520
to modify those variables to make them

4168
04:13:50,520 --> 04:13:52,739
Global to the class so I'm sure that

4169
04:13:52,739 --> 04:13:55,140
there's no copy because there's a bunch

4170
04:13:55,140 --> 04:13:56,580
of magic going on especially with

4171
04:13:56,580 --> 04:13:58,439
c-sharp where you have clone of memory

4172
04:13:58,439 --> 04:14:00,660
and stuff like that so if it's inside of

4173
04:14:00,660 --> 04:14:02,460
a tread and it's not necessarily Global

4174
04:14:02,460 --> 04:14:04,260
you may end up with an extra copy of

4175
04:14:04,260 --> 04:14:06,180
code without even knowing once again

4176
04:14:06,180 --> 04:14:08,040
curiosity here's the key feel free to

4177
04:14:08,040 --> 04:14:09,720
just dump your process analyze what you

4178
04:14:09,720 --> 04:14:11,760
see in memory you may be extremely

4179
04:14:11,760 --> 04:14:13,500
surprised of what you'll find in there

4180
04:14:13,500 --> 04:14:15,899
so by making them Global it's going to

4181
04:14:15,899 --> 04:14:17,460
definitely help you right and for those

4182
04:14:17,460 --> 04:14:19,439
of you that know me I love c not the

4183
04:14:19,439 --> 04:14:21,359
best at writing C but I love it so

4184
04:14:21,359 --> 04:14:22,939
here's the million dollar solution

4185
04:14:22,939 --> 04:14:25,859
there's a specific keyword in C sharp

4186
04:14:25,859 --> 04:14:27,479
called Fix where you can actually use

4187
04:14:27,479 --> 04:14:29,880
raw type like byte pointer so everybody

4188
04:14:29,880 --> 04:14:31,800
says there's no pointer in C sharp well

4189
04:14:31,800 --> 04:14:33,300
technically you can cheat and everything

4190
04:14:33,300 --> 04:14:34,500
is a point in your life but that's

4191
04:14:34,500 --> 04:14:36,840
another story point is you have your

4192
04:14:36,840 --> 04:14:39,060
main you call your tread with let's have

4193
04:14:39,060 --> 04:14:40,439
fun so you're going to get your beacon

4194
04:14:40,439 --> 04:14:42,300
running in memory then you're going to

4195
04:14:42,300 --> 04:14:44,220
sleep for whatever I usually put 12

4196
04:14:44,220 --> 04:14:45,899
seconds just to be safe to make sure

4197
04:14:45,899 --> 04:14:47,640
that it's going to happen and then you

4198
04:14:47,640 --> 04:14:49,920
enter this unsafe piece of extremely

4199
04:14:49,920 --> 04:14:52,020
terrible code but the point is you're

4200
04:14:52,020 --> 04:14:53,699
going to generate a string in this case

4201
04:14:53,699 --> 04:14:55,140
it's just going to be the length of

4202
04:14:55,140 --> 04:14:57,420
whatever the shackle originally was and

4203
04:14:57,420 --> 04:14:58,800
I'm going to replace this with a bunch

4204
04:14:58,800 --> 04:15:00,899
of CC you can just randomize that be

4205
04:15:00,899 --> 04:15:03,420
creative doesn't matter and now just for

4206
04:15:03,420 --> 04:15:05,040
the fun of it I'm going to retrieve the

4207
04:15:05,040 --> 04:15:07,620
raw pointer to the actual data that we

4208
04:15:07,620 --> 04:15:11,160
created earlier so PTR is now the raw

4209
04:15:11,160 --> 04:15:13,680
unmanaged pointer to data which is the

4210
04:15:13,680 --> 04:15:16,920
manage environment variable and what

4211
04:15:16,920 --> 04:15:18,420
we're going to do is fairly simple keep

4212
04:15:18,420 --> 04:15:19,859
in mind that the tread is running in

4213
04:15:19,859 --> 04:15:21,660
parallel at this point 12 seconds later

4214
04:15:21,660 --> 04:15:23,819
well we definitely have the Shocker in

4215
04:15:23,819 --> 04:15:25,560
memory was copied by the the whole

4216
04:15:25,560 --> 04:15:27,180
framework associated with whatever

4217
04:15:27,180 --> 04:15:30,000
payload you use and we move back to

4218
04:15:30,000 --> 04:15:32,040
let's clean up that memory it's super

4219
04:15:32,040 --> 04:15:34,140
simple all you do is you copy that

4220
04:15:34,140 --> 04:15:35,939
string back into those two location

4221
04:15:35,939 --> 04:15:38,460
because at this point the execution was

4222
04:15:38,460 --> 04:15:40,739
completed the beacon itself copied

4223
04:15:40,739 --> 04:15:42,239
itself somewhere else so you don't need

4224
04:15:42,239 --> 04:15:44,880
the original payload you empty them with

4225
04:15:44,880 --> 04:15:46,439
this and you move on with your life and

4226
04:15:46,439 --> 04:15:48,479
and if you actually check what's going

4227
04:15:48,479 --> 04:15:50,699
on extra point you can also even change

4228
04:15:50,699 --> 04:15:52,500
back the memory permission because this

4229
04:15:52,500 --> 04:15:54,540
is also well known rewrite executable

4230
04:15:54,540 --> 04:15:56,399
memory will get you detected depending

4231
04:15:56,399 --> 04:15:58,020
on whatever product they use so you can

4232
04:15:58,020 --> 04:16:00,239
even revert back the permission on the

4233
04:16:00,239 --> 04:16:03,000
code to a typical execute which is what

4234
04:16:03,000 --> 04:16:05,399
you will expect to see right and you're

4235
04:16:05,399 --> 04:16:07,620
done and if you actually dump that

4236
04:16:07,620 --> 04:16:09,540
process memory well all you're going to

4237
04:16:09,540 --> 04:16:12,060
find is a bunch of CC so the beauty of

4238
04:16:12,060 --> 04:16:13,920
this is there's no trace of your shackle

4239
04:16:13,920 --> 04:16:16,140
because at this point it was modified in

4240
04:16:16,140 --> 04:16:17,699
memory so keep in mind that whatever

4241
04:16:17,699 --> 04:16:19,979
tools you use It's always important to

4242
04:16:19,979 --> 04:16:21,720
make sure that you do your cleanup and

4243
04:16:21,720 --> 04:16:23,340
most people don't actually think about

4244
04:16:23,340 --> 04:16:25,080
that and memory scanning is getting more

4245
04:16:25,080 --> 04:16:26,460
and more popular because we're getting

4246
04:16:26,460 --> 04:16:28,560
more and more creative so if you don't

4247
04:16:28,560 --> 04:16:30,960
clean your original clear chuckle after

4248
04:16:30,960 --> 04:16:32,640
the execution well there's no point of

4249
04:16:32,640 --> 04:16:34,620
using fancy technique they're just going

4250
04:16:34,620 --> 04:16:36,840
to find the sample in memory simple as

4251
04:16:36,840 --> 04:16:37,920
that

4252
04:16:37,920 --> 04:16:40,020
keep in mind that as I mentioned same

4253
04:16:40,020 --> 04:16:43,080
can be done in C sharp right MSI is like

4254
04:16:43,080 --> 04:16:46,080
c c is also like the human version of

4255
04:16:46,080 --> 04:16:48,420
assembly same goes with C sharp right so

4256
04:16:48,420 --> 04:16:50,100
you have the up code associated with a

4257
04:16:50,100 --> 04:16:52,380
bunch of instruction which are our IL

4258
04:16:52,380 --> 04:16:55,319
instruction which is the middleware kind

4259
04:16:55,319 --> 04:16:57,479
of thing between C sharp and the engine

4260
04:16:57,479 --> 04:16:59,399
and the up code is What's Understood by

4261
04:16:59,399 --> 04:17:01,199
the runtime environment associated with

4262
04:17:01,199 --> 04:17:03,359
c-sharp so we can also technically

4263
04:17:03,359 --> 04:17:06,060
obfuscate these right the beauty of this

4264
04:17:06,060 --> 04:17:08,520
is uh there is built-in capability that

4265
04:17:08,520 --> 04:17:11,040
allow you to actually get the IL code of

4266
04:17:11,040 --> 04:17:13,739
a method so not going to go to Too Much

4267
04:17:13,739 --> 04:17:15,899
details here but you can use a sample

4268
04:17:15,899 --> 04:17:17,220
like let's say you created your

4269
04:17:17,220 --> 04:17:19,680
malicious payload and you're gonna get

4270
04:17:19,680 --> 04:17:22,500
all the IL bytes the point here is you

4271
04:17:22,500 --> 04:17:24,600
can actually obfuscate them right by

4272
04:17:24,600 --> 04:17:26,819
extracting all the IL you can actually

4273
04:17:26,819 --> 04:17:28,859
in this case here use a simple technique

4274
04:17:28,859 --> 04:17:31,739
like a plus three so every bias is going

4275
04:17:31,739 --> 04:17:33,239
to be added plus three so it's going to

4276
04:17:33,239 --> 04:17:35,580
become gibberish and it's actually not

4277
04:17:35,580 --> 04:17:37,560
going to point to the original one the

4278
04:17:37,560 --> 04:17:39,300
point is you can actually patch the

4279
04:17:39,300 --> 04:17:40,680
original software so instead of

4280
04:17:40,680 --> 04:17:42,720
obfuscating the c-sharp code that you

4281
04:17:42,720 --> 04:17:45,000
write you actually obfuscated a layer

4282
04:17:45,000 --> 04:17:47,580
above and closer to the actual engine

4283
04:17:47,580 --> 04:17:50,479
execution and you're gonna get that

4284
04:17:50,479 --> 04:17:54,479
msilophated code instead of a

4285
04:17:54,479 --> 04:17:57,300
typical c-sharp you know using random

4286
04:17:57,300 --> 04:17:59,340
string and as tricks or anything like

4287
04:17:59,340 --> 04:18:01,080
that at this point the code is not even

4288
04:18:01,080 --> 04:18:03,660
functional within the binary

4289
04:18:03,660 --> 04:18:05,640
and the beauty of it is what you get

4290
04:18:05,640 --> 04:18:07,560
after that is you actually hunt for your

4291
04:18:07,560 --> 04:18:10,100
own F method that was modified here

4292
04:18:10,100 --> 04:18:12,720
there's a pattern so obviously I just

4293
04:18:12,720 --> 04:18:14,340
need a couple of bytes that are unique

4294
04:18:14,340 --> 04:18:16,439
enough at the beginning of my modified

4295
04:18:16,439 --> 04:18:21,239
code in this case it's O3 75 8A

4296
04:18:21,239 --> 04:18:23,880
O3 whatever this old thing and what I'm

4297
04:18:23,880 --> 04:18:25,319
going to do is I'm going to read my own

4298
04:18:25,319 --> 04:18:27,000
process memory I'm going to Loop through

4299
04:18:27,000 --> 04:18:29,460
all the memory until I found that

4300
04:18:29,460 --> 04:18:31,380
pattern knowing that it was plus three

4301
04:18:31,380 --> 04:18:33,300
well all I have to do is when I found

4302
04:18:33,300 --> 04:18:35,819
the actual location is to revert it back

4303
04:18:35,819 --> 04:18:38,580
to -3 right so you're using unmanaged

4304
04:18:38,580 --> 04:18:41,340
functionality within your manage code to

4305
04:18:41,340 --> 04:18:43,680
modify the manage code back to the

4306
04:18:43,680 --> 04:18:46,699
original state if it makes any sense

4307
04:18:46,699 --> 04:18:51,000
hopefully it does ish and then the

4308
04:18:51,000 --> 04:18:53,100
beauty of this is you get to the point

4309
04:18:53,100 --> 04:18:56,160
where you have your msil code back to

4310
04:18:56,160 --> 04:18:58,080
its original state and you don't have

4311
04:18:58,080 --> 04:19:00,060
any C sharp obfuscation because your

4312
04:19:00,060 --> 04:19:02,100
level level above so no need to use

4313
04:19:02,100 --> 04:19:04,979
fancy variable Shenanigans or trying to

4314
04:19:04,979 --> 04:19:08,939
bypass AMS amsi you don't care you're

4315
04:19:08,939 --> 04:19:11,220
you just below that so they're not going

4316
04:19:11,220 --> 04:19:12,660
to understand any of that shenanigan

4317
04:19:12,660 --> 04:19:13,920
because there's just going to be a bunch

4318
04:19:13,920 --> 04:19:17,040
of random buys right but there's

4319
04:19:17,040 --> 04:19:18,359
something to consider too and that's

4320
04:19:18,359 --> 04:19:20,520
something that people tend to oversee a

4321
04:19:20,520 --> 04:19:21,779
lot right

4322
04:19:21,779 --> 04:19:23,520
um that's cool you know you obfuscated

4323
04:19:23,520 --> 04:19:25,439
your stuff you have plenty of really

4324
04:19:25,439 --> 04:19:27,180
interesting

4325
04:19:27,180 --> 04:19:31,020
concept going on but the thing is

4326
04:19:31,020 --> 04:19:34,199
c-sharp actually uh Gonna Leave a bunch

4327
04:19:34,199 --> 04:19:37,020
of artifact in your code that people

4328
04:19:37,020 --> 04:19:39,720
tend to really forget about one example

4329
04:19:39,720 --> 04:19:44,580
here is the pdb it may sound silly but

4330
04:19:44,580 --> 04:19:46,260
for those of you that actually do red

4331
04:19:46,260 --> 04:19:49,560
theming you may actually end up being

4332
04:19:49,560 --> 04:19:52,080
part of known malicious database just

4333
04:19:52,080 --> 04:19:54,540
because of the PEB that you use all the

4334
04:19:54,540 --> 04:19:56,399
time if you're using the same VM over

4335
04:19:56,399 --> 04:19:58,140
and over and you have this you know

4336
04:19:58,140 --> 04:20:00,859
random username or anything like that

4337
04:20:00,859 --> 04:20:04,380
you may actually be there because by

4338
04:20:04,380 --> 04:20:06,120
default it's always going to be part of

4339
04:20:06,120 --> 04:20:08,100
your assembly in.net so that's

4340
04:20:08,100 --> 04:20:09,779
definitely something that you need to

4341
04:20:09,779 --> 04:20:11,160
consider there's a lot of tools

4342
04:20:11,160 --> 04:20:13,140
available for that but you should always

4343
04:20:13,140 --> 04:20:15,000
clean that another really important

4344
04:20:15,000 --> 04:20:16,859
thing is you can use all the obfuscation

4345
04:20:16,859 --> 04:20:19,260
in the world every time you actually

4346
04:20:19,260 --> 04:20:21,779
have a function that are used even if

4347
04:20:21,779 --> 04:20:24,779
it's a c-sharp or unmanaged function

4348
04:20:24,779 --> 04:20:26,220
they're going to end it up being in

4349
04:20:26,220 --> 04:20:28,199
clear in the assembly so we have an

4350
04:20:28,199 --> 04:20:31,080
example here where the sample is

4351
04:20:31,080 --> 04:20:33,540
actually going to do assembly load and

4352
04:20:33,540 --> 04:20:35,340
when it performs assembly low it's going

4353
04:20:35,340 --> 04:20:37,439
to invoke a specific set of method

4354
04:20:37,439 --> 04:20:39,420
within the framework right so you're

4355
04:20:39,420 --> 04:20:41,520
going to end it up with something like

4356
04:20:41,520 --> 04:20:44,819
Ms core lib load invoke you would

4357
04:20:44,819 --> 04:20:47,580
attribute debug all that stuff which is

4358
04:20:47,580 --> 04:20:49,920
a known pattern right so you may

4359
04:20:49,920 --> 04:20:51,540
actually come up with a super cool

4360
04:20:51,540 --> 04:20:54,000
evasion technique and be like but I got

4361
04:20:54,000 --> 04:20:56,340
detected right away by you know mde or

4362
04:20:56,340 --> 04:20:57,899
whatever and me maybe you're wondering

4363
04:20:57,899 --> 04:21:00,120
why it's probably because your Imports

4364
04:21:00,120 --> 04:21:02,100
have some well-known pattern and you

4365
04:21:02,100 --> 04:21:04,920
don't even realize it that's also

4366
04:21:04,920 --> 04:21:06,600
something to keep in mind so if we go

4367
04:21:06,600 --> 04:21:08,819
back to this kind of code

4368
04:21:08,819 --> 04:21:11,279
keep in mind that we modified the msil

4369
04:21:11,279 --> 04:21:13,859
but we could also technically modify

4370
04:21:13,859 --> 04:21:15,840
more than that right we can get the

4371
04:21:15,840 --> 04:21:18,120
offset of that and make sure that we

4372
04:21:18,120 --> 04:21:20,600
actually also modify it so at runtime

4373
04:21:20,600 --> 04:21:22,800
it's going to be patched back to the

4374
04:21:22,800 --> 04:21:24,779
original the original code but when you

4375
04:21:24,779 --> 04:21:26,220
look at it on this it's just going to be

4376
04:21:26,220 --> 04:21:28,380
gibberish right that's something really

4377
04:21:28,380 --> 04:21:30,300
important to also consider it's like for

4378
04:21:30,300 --> 04:21:31,560
those of you that are familiar with C

4379
04:21:31,560 --> 04:21:33,420
you have the concept of import table

4380
04:21:33,420 --> 04:21:35,460
it's pretty much the same right there's

4381
04:21:35,460 --> 04:21:37,319
a lot of products that use your import

4382
04:21:37,319 --> 04:21:39,840
table to actually create signature it's

4383
04:21:39,840 --> 04:21:41,580
the same right there's different

4384
04:21:41,580 --> 04:21:43,140
technique and patterns that you're going

4385
04:21:43,140 --> 04:21:45,600
to find when you look at Mouse's code

4386
04:21:45,600 --> 04:21:47,880
and this is no exception right so make

4387
04:21:47,880 --> 04:21:50,040
sure that you also assess the final

4388
04:21:50,040 --> 04:21:52,920
binary to actually get this kind of

4389
04:21:52,920 --> 04:21:55,080
output does it look like something that

4390
04:21:55,080 --> 04:21:57,300
we know is known to be malicious if the

4391
04:21:57,300 --> 04:21:59,939
answer is yes well you may have guessed

4392
04:21:59,939 --> 04:22:01,560
it you probably have something malicious

4393
04:22:01,560 --> 04:22:05,040
going on same goes with the guid there's

4394
04:22:05,040 --> 04:22:07,399
a guid associated with your installation

4395
04:22:07,399 --> 04:22:10,380
funny enough I know cases where

4396
04:22:10,380 --> 04:22:13,260
legitimate apt group were uncovered

4397
04:22:13,260 --> 04:22:15,840
because of that they found that the guid

4398
04:22:15,840 --> 04:22:18,840
was used in a malware sample and also a

4399
04:22:18,840 --> 04:22:20,880
legitimate software because probably the

4400
04:22:20,880 --> 04:22:22,800
guy forget about it and he ended up

4401
04:22:22,800 --> 04:22:24,960
compiling Mouse's code on this

4402
04:22:24,960 --> 04:22:27,300
production machine or whatever so this

4403
04:22:27,300 --> 04:22:30,479
unit is also the key uh keep in mind

4404
04:22:30,479 --> 04:22:31,920
that you either replace it with

4405
04:22:31,920 --> 04:22:34,260
gibberish or you make sure that you make

4406
04:22:34,260 --> 04:22:36,120
one that looks legitimate but it's not

4407
04:22:36,120 --> 04:22:38,399
yours especially for red teamers

4408
04:22:38,399 --> 04:22:40,199
probably have one VM you generate the

4409
04:22:40,199 --> 04:22:42,720
same code over and over and over and if

4410
04:22:42,720 --> 04:22:44,460
you test the same client or your

4411
04:22:44,460 --> 04:22:46,739
internal red team practice well they may

4412
04:22:46,739 --> 04:22:48,420
ended up starting creating rules just

4413
04:22:48,420 --> 04:22:50,340
based on this viewed associated with

4414
04:22:50,340 --> 04:22:52,020
your Visual Studio environment and

4415
04:22:52,020 --> 04:22:53,580
they're going to get thank you

4416
04:22:53,580 --> 04:22:54,899
doesn't matter what you're going to do

4417
04:22:54,899 --> 04:22:56,760
they notice your signature is unique for

4418
04:22:56,760 --> 04:22:58,560
installation so that's also something to

4419
04:22:58,560 --> 04:23:00,779
consider point is you can have super

4420
04:23:00,779 --> 04:23:03,840
complex fancy code with super Advanced

4421
04:23:03,840 --> 04:23:06,420
technique but if you get forget about

4422
04:23:06,420 --> 04:23:08,580
those little details well

4423
04:23:08,580 --> 04:23:10,979
you may actually get detected right away

4424
04:23:10,979 --> 04:23:13,380
and funny enough right

4425
04:23:13,380 --> 04:23:15,180
if you don't believe me that these are

4426
04:23:15,180 --> 04:23:18,420
actual use pattern if you take a look at

4427
04:23:18,420 --> 04:23:21,180
Microsoft security product in memory uh

4428
04:23:21,180 --> 04:23:23,399
just a quick note on that if you have

4429
04:23:23,399 --> 04:23:25,140
the trusted installer privilege we can

4430
04:23:25,140 --> 04:23:26,340
do pretty much whatever the hell you

4431
04:23:26,340 --> 04:23:29,220
want with Microsoft detection product so

4432
04:23:29,220 --> 04:23:30,779
you're allowed to actually dump the

4433
04:23:30,779 --> 04:23:33,420
process memory and if you look for a

4434
04:23:33,420 --> 04:23:35,699
certain keyword let's say

4435
04:23:35,699 --> 04:23:39,479
pdb within the memory well obviously

4436
04:23:39,479 --> 04:23:41,580
it's a bit of a mess though but you

4437
04:23:41,580 --> 04:23:43,920
realize that these are some of their

4438
04:23:43,920 --> 04:23:46,380
patterns that they know to be malicious

4439
04:23:46,380 --> 04:23:48,239
right of course some of them are

4440
04:23:48,239 --> 04:23:52,020
obviously malicious like a q Z minor

4441
04:23:52,020 --> 04:23:55,199
Source release Bitcoin miner.pdb it's

4442
04:23:55,199 --> 04:23:57,359
pretty obvious that it's probably a

4443
04:23:57,359 --> 04:24:00,660
Bitcoin miner but there's some that may

4444
04:24:00,660 --> 04:24:04,199
looks a bit more subtle like rubbish DN

4445
04:24:04,199 --> 04:24:06,899
loader RC release it's probably you know

4446
04:24:06,899 --> 04:24:08,640
just another tools and they realize that

4447
04:24:08,640 --> 04:24:09,960
this pattern is always there because

4448
04:24:09,960 --> 04:24:12,420
every time that group or that individual

4449
04:24:12,420 --> 04:24:15,239
create a mouse is simple well they

4450
04:24:15,239 --> 04:24:17,220
forget about the fact that they have the

4451
04:24:17,220 --> 04:24:19,319
specific users like here here for

4452
04:24:19,319 --> 04:24:22,020
example Joe job girls release loader

4453
04:24:22,020 --> 04:24:24,600
like loader can be literally everything

4454
04:24:24,600 --> 04:24:27,600
but it was unique enough that they were

4455
04:24:27,600 --> 04:24:30,239
able to actually make signature so back

4456
04:24:30,239 --> 04:24:32,580
to this kind of code here once again you

4457
04:24:32,580 --> 04:24:34,140
can come up with some interesting

4458
04:24:34,140 --> 04:24:36,660
technique and nothing told that I have

4459
04:24:36,660 --> 04:24:39,540
five minutes left thanks you Martin you

4460
04:24:39,540 --> 04:24:41,160
can come up with a really cool technique

4461
04:24:41,160 --> 04:24:43,380
and realize that they caught you way

4462
04:24:43,380 --> 04:24:45,300
before they get to your fancy code

4463
04:24:45,300 --> 04:24:46,800
because you forget about those little

4464
04:24:46,800 --> 04:24:49,380
details another example really short

4465
04:24:49,380 --> 04:24:52,500
code out of question

4466
04:24:52,500 --> 04:24:54,180
how many times you think you name

4467
04:24:54,180 --> 04:24:55,800
something charcoaled in your life and

4468
04:24:55,800 --> 04:24:57,180
forget about the fact that you name it

4469
04:24:57,180 --> 04:24:59,580
charcoal probably a million times this

4470
04:24:59,580 --> 04:25:01,260
is an example it's in there they're

4471
04:25:01,260 --> 04:25:02,520
gonna catch you just because of that

4472
04:25:02,520 --> 04:25:03,960
doesn't matter what you did afterwards

4473
04:25:03,960 --> 04:25:06,000
it's there so this is something really

4474
04:25:06,000 --> 04:25:08,100
important to keep in mind right

4475
04:25:08,100 --> 04:25:10,560
at the end of the day as I mentioned

4476
04:25:10,560 --> 04:25:12,779
it's always about you know being

4477
04:25:12,779 --> 04:25:15,600
creative and making sure that you check

4478
04:25:15,600 --> 04:25:18,060
what the code that you create is going

4479
04:25:18,060 --> 04:25:20,100
to result in your binary right this is a

4480
04:25:20,100 --> 04:25:22,260
typical reflective loader in c-sharp

4481
04:25:22,260 --> 04:25:24,000
it's super simple it's literally three

4482
04:25:24,000 --> 04:25:25,979
line of code you can get unmanaged code

4483
04:25:25,979 --> 04:25:28,620
in memory or whatever.net assembly this

4484
04:25:28,620 --> 04:25:30,840
is something that I love to use however

4485
04:25:30,840 --> 04:25:33,120
the pattern is super known right so if

4486
04:25:33,120 --> 04:25:35,279
you look at your data in your XC

4487
04:25:35,279 --> 04:25:37,500
remember earlier we saw the MS core lab

4488
04:25:37,500 --> 04:25:39,779
load app and get method and all of that

4489
04:25:39,779 --> 04:25:41,580
it's always going to be there so you

4490
04:25:41,580 --> 04:25:43,500
need to actually make sure that you get

4491
04:25:43,500 --> 04:25:44,819
rid of this

4492
04:25:44,819 --> 04:25:47,699
another thing to keep in mind right this

4493
04:25:47,699 --> 04:25:49,739
is a bit small but the point is uh this

4494
04:25:49,739 --> 04:25:51,479
is something that I do often do is

4495
04:25:51,479 --> 04:25:54,180
heavily officating my code I have a

4496
04:25:54,180 --> 04:25:55,859
little tools if you're interested I'll

4497
04:25:55,859 --> 04:25:57,600
be more than happy to share the concept

4498
04:25:57,600 --> 04:25:59,340
afterward because we're running out of

4499
04:25:59,340 --> 04:26:01,500
time the point is I'm going to use a

4500
04:26:01,500 --> 04:26:03,420
switch case concept so it's all

4501
04:26:03,420 --> 04:26:05,220
automatedly generated for me so it's

4502
04:26:05,220 --> 04:26:07,140
going to take a function or a method

4503
04:26:07,140 --> 04:26:08,460
that I provide and it's going to create

4504
04:26:08,460 --> 04:26:12,000
this crazy switch case statement so this

4505
04:26:12,000 --> 04:26:14,640
code is massive it's literally the same

4506
04:26:14,640 --> 04:26:16,800
as this at the end of the day the only

4507
04:26:16,800 --> 04:26:18,300
difference is all the gibberish that was

4508
04:26:18,300 --> 04:26:20,279
added there's a bunch of check counter

4509
04:26:20,279 --> 04:26:22,140
there's magic going on just to make the

4510
04:26:22,140 --> 04:26:25,080
code more heavy however here's the catch

4511
04:26:25,080 --> 04:26:27,899
doesn't matter how complex it is you

4512
04:26:27,899 --> 04:26:30,060
still have the MS core lib load pattern

4513
04:26:30,060 --> 04:26:32,760
in there because this specific method

4514
04:26:32,760 --> 04:26:34,199
has to be called like that so there's

4515
04:26:34,199 --> 04:26:35,880
nothing that you can do unless you hide

4516
04:26:35,880 --> 04:26:38,399
it which bring me back to

4517
04:26:38,399 --> 04:26:40,560
something like that where you definitely

4518
04:26:40,560 --> 04:26:42,540
want to hide the code and don't forget

4519
04:26:42,540 --> 04:26:45,120
to hide what I like to call the import

4520
04:26:45,120 --> 04:26:47,520
table within your exe when you're

4521
04:26:47,520 --> 04:26:49,800
dealing with net because patterns are

4522
04:26:49,800 --> 04:26:52,979
easily detectable there

4523
04:26:52,979 --> 04:26:55,319
another thing that you can do if you

4524
04:26:55,319 --> 04:26:57,000
look at the up code as I mentioned

4525
04:26:57,000 --> 04:26:59,100
earlier this is the upco so the

4526
04:26:59,100 --> 04:27:01,620
equivalent of assembly in C sharp the

4527
04:27:01,620 --> 04:27:03,659
small version is just that right the

4528
04:27:03,659 --> 04:27:04,920
switch case

4529
04:27:04,920 --> 04:27:07,199
one that I'll show you is this one uh

4530
04:27:07,199 --> 04:27:09,479
it's definitely bigger so this help

4531
04:27:09,479 --> 04:27:11,279
right pattern matching is going to be

4532
04:27:11,279 --> 04:27:13,260
different but if you look inside of that

4533
04:27:13,260 --> 04:27:15,720
you may come across part of that pattern

4534
04:27:15,720 --> 04:27:17,939
too so uh definitely it's going to make

4535
04:27:17,939 --> 04:27:20,100
uh you know pattern matching much more

4536
04:27:20,100 --> 04:27:22,199
difficult but

4537
04:27:22,199 --> 04:27:24,000
still something that can cause you

4538
04:27:24,000 --> 04:27:26,279
problems so obfuscating on top of it

4539
04:27:26,279 --> 04:27:27,540
will definitely make sure that this

4540
04:27:27,540 --> 04:27:29,399
pattern is not going to be present in

4541
04:27:29,399 --> 04:27:32,040
the bigger more complex function I guess

4542
04:27:32,040 --> 04:27:33,840
at the end of the day I've been saying

4543
04:27:33,840 --> 04:27:35,220
this for a year I believe that

4544
04:27:35,220 --> 04:27:37,380
obfuscation and evasion is really an art

4545
04:27:37,380 --> 04:27:40,859
and uh I think lately in the industry

4546
04:27:40,859 --> 04:27:42,479
people are trying to come up with super

4547
04:27:42,479 --> 04:27:44,580
complex technique but at the end of the

4548
04:27:44,580 --> 04:27:46,500
day sometimes they just forget the root

4549
04:27:46,500 --> 04:27:48,779
right it's like little details will get

4550
04:27:48,779 --> 04:27:50,520
you cut so before you're trying to you

4551
04:27:50,520 --> 04:27:52,140
know come up with some complex technique

4552
04:27:52,140 --> 04:27:54,239
where you scan your own memories batch

4553
04:27:54,239 --> 04:27:56,460
msil code and all of that make sure you

4554
04:27:56,460 --> 04:27:57,600
actually understand what's happening

4555
04:27:57,600 --> 04:27:59,520
under the hood when you generate a C

4556
04:27:59,520 --> 04:28:01,739
sharp payload or just a piece of C what

4557
04:28:01,739 --> 04:28:03,359
are the artifact left in there and

4558
04:28:03,359 --> 04:28:05,640
hopefully well today achieve the goal of

4559
04:28:05,640 --> 04:28:06,779
showing you that there's a bunch of

4560
04:28:06,779 --> 04:28:10,620
little uh artifact left in your code and

4561
04:28:10,620 --> 04:28:12,420
um I guess be creative and enjoy life

4562
04:28:12,420 --> 04:28:14,430
and that's it for me

4563
04:28:14,430 --> 04:28:25,670
[Applause]

4564
04:28:25,800 --> 04:28:28,819

4565
04:28:31,260 --> 04:28:34,979
two minutes left wow

4566
04:28:34,979 --> 04:28:39,080

4567
04:28:42,600 --> 04:28:45,439
just yell

4568
04:28:46,080 --> 04:28:48,680

[Applause]

4571

being here in such a large group so

4595
04:43:57,840 --> 04:43:58,920
today I'm going to talk to you about

4596
04:43:58,920 --> 04:44:01,680
deception for pen testers uh first let

4597
04:44:01,680 --> 04:44:03,740
me introduce myself my name is

4598
04:44:03,740 --> 04:44:06,360
I'm the vice president of bridge

4599
04:44:06,360 --> 04:44:08,520
detection and response at gosecure but

4600
04:44:08,520 --> 04:44:10,680
first and foremost I am a North Tech

4601
04:44:10,680 --> 04:44:13,138
Challenge designer it's my 11th year as

4602
04:44:13,138 --> 04:44:14,940
a North Tech organizer as well as a

4603
04:44:14,940 --> 04:44:16,920
magician in pickpocket so today I'm

4604
04:44:16,920 --> 04:44:18,660
going to talk to you about magic as well

4605
04:44:18,660 --> 04:44:20,400
as about

4606
04:44:20,400 --> 04:44:22,860
um pen testing and the question you

4607
04:44:22,860 --> 04:44:25,378
should ask yourself is why like why am I

4608
04:44:25,378 --> 04:44:27,180
here talking to you about pick a card or

4609
04:44:27,180 --> 04:44:29,760
these type of things and in truth

4610
04:44:29,760 --> 04:44:32,940
my magic improved my pen testing what I

4611
04:44:32,940 --> 04:44:34,560
found out was that once you understand

4612
04:44:34,560 --> 04:44:38,160
how the mind works how can you capture

4613
04:44:38,160 --> 04:44:40,020
the attention of someone or make sure

4614
04:44:40,020 --> 04:44:42,180
they don't look at something you'd like

4615
04:44:42,180 --> 04:44:45,240
then suddenly you're better at

4616
04:44:45,240 --> 04:44:47,458
lying you're better at deceiving you're

4617
04:44:47,458 --> 04:44:49,740
better at crafting the right phishing

4618
04:44:49,740 --> 04:44:51,900
email that suggests just the right level

4619
04:44:51,900 --> 04:44:55,260
of stress without being too noisy so

4620
04:44:55,260 --> 04:44:57,298
basically today I'm gonna talk about you

4621
04:44:57,298 --> 04:44:59,400
regarding magic and how it can make all

4622
04:44:59,400 --> 04:45:01,440
of you better pen testers

4623
04:45:01,440 --> 04:45:04,378
and I kind of felt clever thinking about

4624
04:45:04,378 --> 04:45:07,020
this but turns out other people had

4625
04:45:07,020 --> 04:45:08,580
thought about it before

4626
04:45:08,580 --> 04:45:10,260
there's a Freedom of Information Act

4627
04:45:10,260 --> 04:45:11,760
that you can request in the United

4628
04:45:11,760 --> 04:45:15,120
States where a famous magician coached

4629
04:45:15,120 --> 04:45:17,940
the CIA in deception techniques so if

4630
04:45:17,940 --> 04:45:19,560
it's good enough for the CIA I figure

4631
04:45:19,560 --> 04:45:22,020
it's good enough for us but even let's

4632
04:45:22,020 --> 04:45:25,580
go even further

4633
04:45:27,020 --> 04:45:31,020
also known as during the Napoleon Wars

4634
04:45:31,020 --> 04:45:33,740
helped Napoleon

4635
04:45:33,740 --> 04:45:37,920
trick the uh du propaganda and do psyops

4636
04:45:37,920 --> 04:45:41,280
using a trick called heavy light chest

4637
04:45:41,280 --> 04:45:44,360
and that was used to convince population

4638
04:45:44,360 --> 04:45:47,580
that Europeans were better and that

4639
04:45:47,580 --> 04:45:49,860
magic was real so if it's good at like

4640
04:45:49,860 --> 04:45:52,080
if we look at these things

4641
04:45:52,080 --> 04:45:54,600
I mean there's a background where

4642
04:45:54,600 --> 04:45:57,600
deception and Magic intersects

4643
04:45:57,600 --> 04:45:59,160
so today I'm going to talk about a few

4644
04:45:59,160 --> 04:46:00,480
things I'm going to talk about

4645
04:46:00,480 --> 04:46:02,958
convincers suggestion repeatability

4646
04:46:02,958 --> 04:46:06,000
repeatability repeatability not run if

4647
04:46:06,000 --> 04:46:07,440
you're not being chased managing

4648
04:46:07,440 --> 04:46:10,200
attention students and accomplices and

4649
04:46:10,200 --> 04:46:12,298
while it's exactly something that's

4650
04:46:12,298 --> 04:46:13,860
about magic about surveillance

4651
04:46:13,860 --> 04:46:15,540
surveillance detection how to tell

4652
04:46:15,540 --> 04:46:18,420
someone how to surveil people and common

4653
04:46:18,420 --> 04:46:20,820
mistakes people do when they're doing

4654
04:46:20,820 --> 04:46:22,320
telling people

4655
04:46:22,320 --> 04:46:24,360
all right so let's go

4656
04:46:24,360 --> 04:46:25,798
so the first thing you the first

4657
04:46:25,798 --> 04:46:27,240
principle you need to know in about

4658
04:46:27,240 --> 04:46:29,820
magic is that people doubt others but

4659
04:46:29,820 --> 04:46:32,100
don't doubt themselves what it means

4660
04:46:32,100 --> 04:46:36,240
really is if I tell you I'm a plumber

4661
04:46:36,240 --> 04:46:38,700
you might doubt but if you look at me

4662
04:46:38,700 --> 04:46:40,320
and you say oh he got this he's got the

4663
04:46:40,320 --> 04:46:43,080
suit the car there's a problem with my

4664
04:46:43,080 --> 04:46:46,500
my faucet I called someone then you're

4665
04:46:46,500 --> 04:46:48,480
more than likely to believe that I am

4666
04:46:48,480 --> 04:46:50,040
the right person

4667
04:46:50,040 --> 04:46:52,680
so if I tell you something

4668
04:46:52,680 --> 04:46:54,958
you can doubt it if you deduce it

4669
04:46:54,958 --> 04:46:58,138
yourself then you won't be as likely to

4670
04:46:58,138 --> 04:46:59,218
doubt it

4671
04:46:59,218 --> 04:47:03,780
so a convincer really is like a game

4672
04:47:03,780 --> 04:47:06,120
where I want to give as many hints as

4673
04:47:06,120 --> 04:47:07,980
possible that what I'm doing here what

4674
04:47:07,980 --> 04:47:09,120
I'd like you to do in these type of

4675
04:47:09,120 --> 04:47:12,060
things without actually telling you

4676
04:47:12,060 --> 04:47:14,638
because if I tell you it doesn't work so

4677
04:47:14,638 --> 04:47:17,218
that's called a convincer

4678
04:47:17,218 --> 04:47:19,620
of course if you tell you can if you

4679
04:47:19,620 --> 04:47:20,820
talk about your convincerity doesn't

4680
04:47:20,820 --> 04:47:22,500
work in Magic you'll never see someone

4681
04:47:22,500 --> 04:47:24,540
say look at my thumb it's a truly normal

4682
04:47:24,540 --> 04:47:26,580
thumb I have two two there's two sides

4683
04:47:26,580 --> 04:47:27,840
at a thumb here's a thumb it's a normal

4684
04:47:27,840 --> 04:47:29,638
thumb look at this stuff like that

4685
04:47:29,638 --> 04:47:32,160
doesn't work I mean

4686
04:47:32,160 --> 04:47:33,718
they're gonna show their hand but the

4687
04:47:33,718 --> 04:47:35,700
moment they say it's a normal thumb of

4688
04:47:35,700 --> 04:47:37,500
course it's a normal thumb like we all

4689
04:47:37,500 --> 04:47:39,660
have two well most of us so it's the

4690
04:47:39,660 --> 04:47:41,160
type of thing that

4691
04:47:41,160 --> 04:47:43,740
of course if you need to see it then

4692
04:47:43,740 --> 04:47:46,620
it's not as good as a convincer and if

4693
04:47:46,620 --> 04:47:49,440
you had one rule to recall that's the

4694
04:47:49,440 --> 04:47:51,240
one like people are better at looking at

4695
04:47:51,240 --> 04:47:53,400
themselves that are better

4696
04:47:53,400 --> 04:47:57,060
to like it's much easier to cut people

4697
04:47:57,060 --> 04:47:58,560
don't doubt themselves but they're

4698
04:47:58,560 --> 04:48:00,360
likely to doubt others so when you're

4699
04:48:00,360 --> 04:48:04,080
crafting fishing you are much better not

4700
04:48:04,080 --> 04:48:06,540
to say something but let them deduce it

4701
04:48:06,540 --> 04:48:08,520
believe that they're smart more than

4702
04:48:08,520 --> 04:48:12,180
likely and hint about things but give as

4703
04:48:12,180 --> 04:48:14,458
many hints as possible let me give you a

4704
04:48:14,458 --> 04:48:15,840
few examples

4705
04:48:15,840 --> 04:48:17,820
this one I already talked about the

4706
04:48:17,820 --> 04:48:21,420
lanyard attack so if I have a lanyard of

4707
04:48:21,420 --> 04:48:25,680
say uh ey are famous Auditors and I wear

4708
04:48:25,680 --> 04:48:27,660
my my ey lanyard

4709
04:48:27,660 --> 04:48:29,280
it's more likely that people will say

4710
04:48:29,280 --> 04:48:30,600
hmm

4711
04:48:30,600 --> 04:48:32,940
this guy must be an auditor

4712
04:48:32,940 --> 04:48:34,798
of course I mean who else carries

4713
04:48:34,798 --> 04:48:37,020
lanyards or who's crazy enough to

4714
04:48:37,020 --> 04:48:40,560
collect lanyards so of course

4715
04:48:40,560 --> 04:48:43,260
um in that regard by having this I mean

4716
04:48:43,260 --> 04:48:46,500
nobody will never ever only let me get

4717
04:48:46,500 --> 04:48:48,000
in because I have a lanyard that doesn't

4718
04:48:48,000 --> 04:48:50,878
make sense but it adds credibility and

4719
04:48:50,878 --> 04:48:52,740
people build on it

4720
04:48:52,740 --> 04:48:54,600
but there some things are even simpler

4721
04:48:54,600 --> 04:48:56,100
and the following attack

4722
04:48:56,100 --> 04:48:59,100
my team did this year it's the very

4723
04:48:59,100 --> 04:49:01,320
fabled hot dog attack

4724
04:49:01,320 --> 04:49:02,638
so

4725
04:49:02,638 --> 04:49:05,218
some places they have like favorite

4726
04:49:05,218 --> 04:49:07,320
spots and favorite restaurants

4727
04:49:07,320 --> 04:49:10,500
so we found where people ate and in this

4728
04:49:10,500 --> 04:49:12,240
case were hot dogs and we purchased the

4729
04:49:12,240 --> 04:49:14,700
same hot dogs at the same place and we

4730
04:49:14,700 --> 04:49:17,100
walked with them as they came back in

4731
04:49:17,100 --> 04:49:18,060
the office

4732
04:49:18,060 --> 04:49:20,580
now of course no better nobody will ever

4733
04:49:20,580 --> 04:49:24,180
see say hmm I trust this guy he has the

4734
04:49:24,180 --> 04:49:26,218
same hot dog Brands as we do like that

4735
04:49:26,218 --> 04:49:28,740
never happens right but the thing is

4736
04:49:28,740 --> 04:49:31,680
they might say hmm I don't know this guy

4737
04:49:31,680 --> 04:49:33,480
but it works for us obviously he knows

4738
04:49:33,480 --> 04:49:35,700
our secret hot dog spot and it really

4739
04:49:35,700 --> 04:49:37,740
worked like people find the hot dog

4740
04:49:37,740 --> 04:49:40,378
attack stupid but it works so keep in

4741
04:49:40,378 --> 04:49:44,040
mind convincers doesn't need to be

4742
04:49:44,040 --> 04:49:46,860
fancy or complex all they need to do is

4743
04:49:46,860 --> 04:49:49,798
reduce the risk about somebody doubting

4744
04:49:49,798 --> 04:49:51,718
you because you gave a hint that you're

4745
04:49:51,718 --> 04:49:55,040
part of the in-group so lanyards uniform

4746
04:49:55,040 --> 04:49:58,740
uh way to way to walk way to talk are

4747
04:49:58,740 --> 04:50:03,240
all things that are common as convincers

4748
04:50:03,240 --> 04:50:06,420
so convincers are a way to reduce

4749
04:50:06,420 --> 04:50:08,040
path in your mental mind like you know

4750
04:50:08,040 --> 04:50:10,920
when they're you know there's a path of

4751
04:50:10,920 --> 04:50:12,480
possibilities and new convincers are

4752
04:50:12,480 --> 04:50:14,458
used to remove these paths remove that

4753
04:50:14,458 --> 04:50:16,500
perhaps it's an outsider but what if

4754
04:50:16,500 --> 04:50:18,240
instead you wanted a person to perform

4755
04:50:18,240 --> 04:50:19,560
something

4756
04:50:19,560 --> 04:50:22,560
if you recall the the the the principle

4757
04:50:22,560 --> 04:50:24,718
if I tell you to do something you can

4758
04:50:24,718 --> 04:50:26,760
doubt whereas if you convince yourself

4759
04:50:26,760 --> 04:50:28,560
you're more than likely to do it without

4760
04:50:28,560 --> 04:50:32,160
understanding that I told you about it

4761
04:50:32,160 --> 04:50:33,360
and

4762
04:50:33,360 --> 04:50:36,540
of course there's ethics here but you

4763
04:50:36,540 --> 04:50:38,700
know if I say gee the dishes are due and

4764
04:50:38,700 --> 04:50:40,680
we may have visit any time I'm not

4765
04:50:40,680 --> 04:50:43,500
telling anyone to do the dishes all I am

4766
04:50:43,500 --> 04:50:47,100
saying is dishes are not done yet and we

4767
04:50:47,100 --> 04:50:48,780
may have visit

4768
04:50:48,780 --> 04:50:50,878
the person might

4769
04:50:50,878 --> 04:50:54,240
be more inclined to do it without me

4770
04:50:54,240 --> 04:50:55,560
telling that person to do it you

4771
04:50:55,560 --> 04:50:56,700
understand the difference

4772
04:50:56,700 --> 04:50:58,740
and since the desire or the

4773
04:50:58,740 --> 04:51:00,420
understanding the understanding comes

4774
04:51:00,420 --> 04:51:03,180
from them comes comes from within then

4775
04:51:03,180 --> 04:51:05,520
suddenly they're more than likely to do

4776
04:51:05,520 --> 04:51:06,540
it

4777
04:51:06,540 --> 04:51:08,458
so that's the first principle of magic

4778
04:51:08,458 --> 04:51:11,218
people are the best Liars to themselves

4779
04:51:11,218 --> 04:51:13,500
does that make sense

4780
04:51:13,500 --> 04:51:15,060
all right I'm going a bit fast because

4781
04:51:15,060 --> 04:51:18,060
we have plenty and plenty of examples

4782
04:51:18,060 --> 04:51:20,218
repetition that's a common thing in

4783
04:51:20,218 --> 04:51:21,298
magic

4784
04:51:21,298 --> 04:51:24,360
first time is exciting second time is

4785
04:51:24,360 --> 04:51:27,138
normal third time is routine

4786
04:51:27,138 --> 04:51:29,458
magicians do a thing where you know they

4787
04:51:29,458 --> 04:51:30,840
would show something in their hand put

4788
04:51:30,840 --> 04:51:32,940
in their hand put it back put in their

4789
04:51:32,940 --> 04:51:35,820
hand put it back put in their hand oh

4790
04:51:35,820 --> 04:51:37,860
it's empty why is that empty well

4791
04:51:37,860 --> 04:51:39,000
because the first time you were looking

4792
04:51:39,000 --> 04:51:41,280
in the hand and your brain said oh yeah

4793
04:51:41,280 --> 04:51:43,320
that's

4794
04:51:43,320 --> 04:51:44,638
there's something happening but nothing

4795
04:51:44,638 --> 04:51:46,378
happens I think you're coming back and I

4796
04:51:46,378 --> 04:51:50,100
put it again now you your brain says I

4797
04:51:50,100 --> 04:51:51,840
got I didn't get cut the first time this

4798
04:51:51,840 --> 04:51:53,940
time is right but no

4799
04:51:53,940 --> 04:51:56,400
this time again was true and third time

4800
04:51:56,400 --> 04:51:58,620
your brain was lulled into sense of

4801
04:51:58,620 --> 04:52:01,620
repetition and then coin is gone and

4802
04:52:01,620 --> 04:52:03,718
repetition is a way to build trust

4803
04:52:03,718 --> 04:52:06,420
because it's normal like you have a

4804
04:52:06,420 --> 04:52:08,580
model of awareness and things that are

4805
04:52:08,580 --> 04:52:11,160
repetitive are suddenly boring and your

4806
04:52:11,160 --> 04:52:13,370
mind erases

4807
04:52:13,370 --> 04:52:13,920
[Music]

4808
04:52:13,920 --> 04:52:14,458
um

4809
04:52:14,458 --> 04:52:16,200
of course it's our mechanism to reduce

4810
04:52:16,200 --> 04:52:19,200
suspicion as I mentioned

4811
04:52:19,200 --> 04:52:20,040
um

4812
04:52:20,040 --> 04:52:22,740
for example asking for information

4813
04:52:22,740 --> 04:52:24,360
you know you're performing a social

4814
04:52:24,360 --> 04:52:25,500
engineering attack you need to know

4815
04:52:25,500 --> 04:52:27,958
something since important

4816
04:52:27,958 --> 04:52:29,700
the first time

4817
04:52:29,700 --> 04:52:31,440
is abnormal

4818
04:52:31,440 --> 04:52:33,060
so suddenly that's not one you should

4819
04:52:33,060 --> 04:52:34,860
ask your question if you want somebody's

4820
04:52:34,860 --> 04:52:36,780
password the first time you call them

4821
04:52:36,780 --> 04:52:39,420
don't say hey what's your password that

4822
04:52:39,420 --> 04:52:41,700
won't work instead how about you calling

4823
04:52:41,700 --> 04:52:43,680
give information share something

4824
04:52:43,680 --> 04:52:45,900
non-committal like there's a meeting

4825
04:52:45,900 --> 04:52:47,458
about something or you know the first

4826
04:52:47,458 --> 04:52:49,020
time is where they have the most

4827
04:52:49,020 --> 04:52:51,000
attention is where you should be the

4828
04:52:51,000 --> 04:52:52,980
most mundane

4829
04:52:52,980 --> 04:52:55,980
second time you reinforce that model so

4830
04:52:55,980 --> 04:52:57,840
again you're non-committal you're asking

4831
04:52:57,840 --> 04:53:00,240
for something that has no impact and the

4832
04:53:00,240 --> 04:53:03,120
third time then you go for the kill and

4833
04:53:03,120 --> 04:53:06,298
that by creating patterns of three it's

4834
04:53:06,298 --> 04:53:09,000
much much easier

4835
04:53:09,000 --> 04:53:11,040
let me give you an example

4836
04:53:11,040 --> 04:53:14,280
we had to perform a I'm really happy

4837
04:53:14,280 --> 04:53:15,600
about that example so he's got to take

4838
04:53:15,600 --> 04:53:17,760
I'm going to take like three minutes we

4839
04:53:17,760 --> 04:53:19,860
had to perform phone phishing

4840
04:53:19,860 --> 04:53:22,378
and foam fishing is super difficult one

4841
04:53:22,378 --> 04:53:23,878
it can't be automated two depending on

4842
04:53:23,878 --> 04:53:25,378
the personality of the person is

4843
04:53:25,378 --> 04:53:29,580
difficult so we had to craft a scenario

4844
04:53:29,580 --> 04:53:31,920
here's the following scenario

4845
04:53:31,920 --> 04:53:34,320
hello I'm calling regarding a survey or

4846
04:53:34,320 --> 04:53:36,298
regarding your I.T services

4847
04:53:36,298 --> 04:53:38,878
do you have a minute for me one they

4848
04:53:38,878 --> 04:53:41,520
will say yes two it's boring if you're

4849
04:53:41,520 --> 04:53:44,458
having fun doing social engineering you

4850
04:53:44,458 --> 04:53:46,680
are failing most people when they call

4851
04:53:46,680 --> 04:53:48,600
you they're not having fun if you're

4852
04:53:48,600 --> 04:53:50,340
like hey I'm super happy to talk with

4853
04:53:50,340 --> 04:53:52,200
you can I can I interest you in

4854
04:53:52,200 --> 04:53:54,360
Insurance like it won't work those

4855
04:53:54,360 --> 04:53:57,840
people hate their lives so beautiful so

4856
04:53:57,840 --> 04:54:00,600
I'm calling saying hey I'm here for a

4857
04:54:00,600 --> 04:54:01,980
survey first question

4858
04:54:01,980 --> 04:54:05,160
on uh on a rate from one to ten RP about

4859
04:54:05,160 --> 04:54:08,638
how IP about the I.T support this is

4860
04:54:08,638 --> 04:54:10,920
non-committal like they're gonna answer

4861
04:54:10,920 --> 04:54:12,120
seven

4862
04:54:12,120 --> 04:54:13,620
who cares

4863
04:54:13,620 --> 04:54:16,320
question two from a scale of one to ten

4864
04:54:16,320 --> 04:54:19,200
how happy are you about the material

4865
04:54:19,200 --> 04:54:20,760
you're that you're being provided and

4866
04:54:20,760 --> 04:54:22,620
then I give an explanation saying in

4867
04:54:22,620 --> 04:54:25,080
time of covid any items that belong to

4868
04:54:25,080 --> 04:54:26,580
you were not provided by the identity

4869
04:54:26,580 --> 04:54:30,180
company so please disregard these

4870
04:54:30,180 --> 04:54:32,878
whatever they give you four fine

4871
04:54:32,878 --> 04:54:34,440
question three

4872
04:54:34,440 --> 04:54:36,718
from a scale of one to ten how happy are

4873
04:54:36,718 --> 04:54:40,560
you about your network speed

4874
04:54:40,560 --> 04:54:44,100
whatever it seems huh interesting what's

4875
04:54:44,100 --> 04:54:49,500
your speed so from the the widths made

4876
04:54:49,500 --> 04:54:52,980
the the fourth question is not part it

4877
04:54:52,980 --> 04:54:54,600
looks like improvised

4878
04:54:54,600 --> 04:54:57,240
what's your speed interesting and when

4879
04:54:57,240 --> 04:55:00,420
people recall the the the discussion

4880
04:55:00,420 --> 04:55:02,340
they will recall the three questions not

4881
04:55:02,340 --> 04:55:04,740
the oh by the way like it it seems like

4882
04:55:04,740 --> 04:55:07,560
an afterthought so what's your speed I

4883
04:55:07,560 --> 04:55:09,420
don't know whatever oh you don't know no

4884
04:55:09,420 --> 04:55:12,500
problem can you go on evil dot don't

4885
04:55:12,500 --> 04:55:15,020
clickme.hackme.ca

4886
04:55:15,020 --> 04:55:17,218
evil.exe we are going to run a speed

4887
04:55:17,218 --> 04:55:18,420
test

4888
04:55:18,420 --> 04:55:20,040
and

4889
04:55:20,040 --> 04:55:22,378
the the here are the way it's worthwhite

4890
04:55:22,378 --> 04:55:23,820
it's so clever

4891
04:55:23,820 --> 04:55:26,480
some people knew that this was wrong

4892
04:55:26,480 --> 04:55:28,980
they knew by then that this was a

4893
04:55:28,980 --> 04:55:31,378
problem but they had said yes three

4894
04:55:31,378 --> 04:55:34,620
times they had committed they had said

4895
04:55:34,620 --> 04:55:36,360
yes they gave information oh I don't

4896
04:55:36,360 --> 04:55:38,700
like you know the background or my mouse

4897
04:55:38,700 --> 04:55:40,680
doesn't work whatever so they had

4898
04:55:40,680 --> 04:55:43,440
involvement in the discussion so once

4899
04:55:43,440 --> 04:55:46,560
they had their arm in it was too late to

4900
04:55:46,560 --> 04:55:47,940
say oh I don't feel comfortable

4901
04:55:47,940 --> 04:55:51,240
downloading your exe so we created trust

4902
04:55:51,240 --> 04:55:53,458
we created repeatability and at some

4903
04:55:53,458 --> 04:55:55,860
point we did interviews and they said I

4904
04:55:55,860 --> 04:55:57,540
knew it was bad I knew I should not have

4905
04:55:57,540 --> 04:55:59,940
downloaded that virus but I did because

4906
04:55:59,940 --> 04:56:01,620
it was it would have been an awkward

4907
04:56:01,620 --> 04:56:03,298
conversation otherwise

4908
04:56:03,298 --> 04:56:05,458
so

4909
04:56:05,458 --> 04:56:08,400
and I swear like this scenario is using

4910
04:56:08,400 --> 04:56:11,040
repetition is using trust and is using

4911
04:56:11,040 --> 04:56:13,320
what's called after talk or side side

4912
04:56:13,320 --> 04:56:16,080
thought where the important part doesn't

4913
04:56:16,080 --> 04:56:17,400
look important and I'm going to talk

4914
04:56:17,400 --> 04:56:20,580
about it in a minute that makes sense

4915
04:56:20,580 --> 04:56:21,718
all right

4916
04:56:21,718 --> 04:56:23,458
same thing used by politicians and

4917
04:56:23,458 --> 04:56:25,378
posters all the all the time the three

4918
04:56:25,378 --> 04:56:27,840
yes rules if you want somebody to do

4919
04:56:27,840 --> 04:56:30,120
something ask three questions that will

4920
04:56:30,120 --> 04:56:31,680
end by a yes

4921
04:56:31,680 --> 04:56:35,400
are you using Windows yes cool

4922
04:56:35,400 --> 04:56:38,040
do you work at this place yes amazing

4923
04:56:38,040 --> 04:56:41,100
and are you having ID problems you want

4924
04:56:41,100 --> 04:56:45,840
a yes but by creating a three rules that

4925
04:56:45,840 --> 04:56:48,360
end by a yes people are more likely to

4926
04:56:48,360 --> 04:56:51,240
also start with a yes

4927
04:56:51,240 --> 04:56:53,520
doesn't work all the time of course not

4928
04:56:53,520 --> 04:56:55,138
but it really really works and

4929
04:56:55,138 --> 04:56:57,180
politicians and posters use it all the

4930
04:56:57,180 --> 04:57:01,500
time some famous German uh P German

4931
04:57:01,500 --> 04:57:02,340
um

4932
04:57:02,340 --> 04:57:05,638
politician in the 1940s was very famous

4933
04:57:05,638 --> 04:57:07,860
for using this rule

4934
04:57:07,860 --> 04:57:09,660
um

4935
04:57:09,660 --> 04:57:12,600
now this is so the whole reason why I

4936
04:57:12,600 --> 04:57:14,820
started this talk was because of the

4937
04:57:14,820 --> 04:57:15,900
following situation I'm going to share

4938
04:57:15,900 --> 04:57:18,900
with you here the the magic principle is

4939
04:57:18,900 --> 04:57:20,280
called don't run if you're not being

4940
04:57:20,280 --> 04:57:23,340
chased and what it means is this

4941
04:57:23,340 --> 04:57:26,580
so we're doing a an intrusion at a site

4942
04:57:26,580 --> 04:57:29,700
and say and we're saying we're a plumber

4943
04:57:29,700 --> 04:57:31,440
and we get caught there's somebody like

4944
04:57:31,440 --> 04:57:34,320
challenging us if I say I am a fourth

4945
04:57:34,320 --> 04:57:36,240
generation plumber my mom was a plumber

4946
04:57:36,240 --> 04:57:38,520
she went to the international Plumbing

4947
04:57:38,520 --> 04:57:40,440
Institute where my father is a copper

4948
04:57:40,440 --> 04:57:43,020
plumber I'm such a legit plumber that I

4949
04:57:43,020 --> 04:57:46,020
name my kid my dog gasket and my first

4950
04:57:46,020 --> 04:57:48,360
kid is going to be called tea trap well

4951
04:57:48,360 --> 04:57:50,280
you know

4952
04:57:50,280 --> 04:57:53,580
most people don't talk like that you

4953
04:57:53,580 --> 04:57:55,200
know most people and when I say are you

4954
04:57:55,200 --> 04:57:56,820
a plumber they're going to say yes I'm a

4955
04:57:56,820 --> 04:57:58,798
plumber

4956
04:57:58,798 --> 04:58:01,200
that's it they're gonna talk about like

4957
04:58:01,200 --> 04:58:03,660
their name or their kids or anything but

4958
04:58:03,660 --> 04:58:06,718
pen testers oftentimes feel guilt deep

4959
04:58:06,718 --> 04:58:08,400
down we're good people and we're told

4960
04:58:08,400 --> 04:58:11,100
that lying is bad so since we're feeling

4961
04:58:11,100 --> 04:58:12,360
guilt

4962
04:58:12,360 --> 04:58:14,400
and there's risk we want to over explain

4963
04:58:14,400 --> 04:58:17,400
and that's a common defense mechanism we

4964
04:58:17,400 --> 04:58:19,138
all want to

4965
04:58:19,138 --> 04:58:20,940
be good person

4966
04:58:20,940 --> 04:58:22,080
so

4967
04:58:22,080 --> 04:58:24,360
like people of course naming your kid

4968
04:58:24,360 --> 04:58:26,700
Deskjet is a bit of a of a stretch but

4969
04:58:26,700 --> 04:58:29,160
the idea is still this oftentimes you're

4970
04:58:29,160 --> 04:58:31,680
gonna see especially pen tester over

4971
04:58:31,680 --> 04:58:34,378
explain while just saying I don't know

4972
04:58:34,378 --> 04:58:36,420
it's such a powerful word when you're

4973
04:58:36,420 --> 04:58:38,160
being asked like why are you what are

4974
04:58:38,160 --> 04:58:40,440
you doing here I don't know

4975
04:58:40,440 --> 04:58:42,480
and oftentimes the people will have to

4976
04:58:42,480 --> 04:58:44,340
do the processing power on their end

4977
04:58:44,340 --> 04:58:46,138
it's like Judo you're using their

4978
04:58:46,138 --> 04:58:48,540
cognitive power against them I don't

4979
04:58:48,540 --> 04:58:51,600
know oh you're here for this yes

4980
04:58:51,600 --> 04:58:53,580
you know so

4981
04:58:53,580 --> 04:58:55,860
but you need to do a pause like when you

4982
04:58:55,860 --> 04:58:58,620
do I don't know stop

4983
04:58:58,620 --> 04:59:00,900
people will feel the blank but these are

4984
04:59:00,900 --> 04:59:02,280
the type of thing where

4985
04:59:02,280 --> 04:59:04,500
if you run if you're being chased you're

4986
04:59:04,500 --> 04:59:05,760
gonna look just if you're not being

4987
04:59:05,760 --> 04:59:08,638
chased you're gonna look suspicious and

4988
04:59:08,638 --> 04:59:11,400
I've seen this over and over and over in

4989
04:59:11,400 --> 04:59:15,120
physical pen test so again you must be

4990
04:59:15,120 --> 04:59:17,040
comfortable and not feel guilt when

4991
04:59:17,040 --> 04:59:20,458
you're lying now

4992
04:59:20,458 --> 04:59:23,400
how do you know how can you avoid

4993
04:59:23,400 --> 04:59:25,320
feeling guilt

4994
04:59:25,320 --> 04:59:29,160
it's easy like everything else practice

4995
04:59:29,160 --> 04:59:30,900
next time you're in a taxi you don't

4996
04:59:30,900 --> 04:59:32,940
ever you don't have kids talk about your

4997
04:59:32,940 --> 04:59:36,180
kids mine are two and four

4998
04:59:36,180 --> 04:59:38,160
like don't lie to people who are

4999
04:59:38,160 --> 04:59:39,420
important or you're gonna see again

5000
04:59:39,420 --> 04:59:41,638
that's not going to work you know and

5001
04:59:41,638 --> 04:59:44,160
like don't invent things that don't make

5002
04:59:44,160 --> 04:59:45,360
sense like there's no way I'm going to

5003
04:59:45,360 --> 04:59:47,700
be like Oh I'm an ex-marine and now I am

5004
04:59:47,700 --> 04:59:51,000
a Olympian you know it won't work that's

5005
04:59:51,000 --> 04:59:54,180
not gonna happen so but you know be

5006
04:59:54,180 --> 04:59:55,620
mundane

5007
04:59:55,620 --> 04:59:58,860
you work in an office talk about life at

5008
04:59:58,860 --> 05:00:01,378
the factory was difficult or perhaps an

5009
05:00:01,378 --> 05:00:03,600
event that your fax repairman and

5010
05:00:03,600 --> 05:00:05,400
business doesn't go super well except in

5011
05:00:05,400 --> 05:00:07,740
hospitals or you know find something

5012
05:00:07,740 --> 05:00:09,900
and learn to lie and you'll find out

5013
05:00:09,900 --> 05:00:13,740
that people don't care and it's like a

5014
05:00:13,740 --> 05:00:15,780
super sad story because we're all unique

5015
05:00:15,780 --> 05:00:18,540
snowflakes but when you think about it

5016
05:00:18,540 --> 05:00:20,638
most people you'll never encounter again

5017
05:00:20,638 --> 05:00:24,180
in your life and they don't care but you

5018
05:00:24,180 --> 05:00:26,280
need to practice lying you need to

5019
05:00:26,280 --> 05:00:28,260
practice just the right level of

5020
05:00:28,260 --> 05:00:29,760
information

5021
05:00:29,760 --> 05:00:30,958
so

5022
05:00:30,958 --> 05:00:33,060
you know and

5023
05:00:33,060 --> 05:00:35,820
lie the taxis are wonderful because they

5024
05:00:35,820 --> 05:00:37,560
meet people and you'll never meet them

5025
05:00:37,560 --> 05:00:40,378
again but you need to learn about lying

5026
05:00:40,378 --> 05:00:42,180
and understanding understanding that all

5027
05:00:42,180 --> 05:00:45,020
this over explaining comes from guilt

5028
05:00:45,020 --> 05:00:47,820
yeah keep things single simple Rex

5029
05:00:47,820 --> 05:00:50,580
player now managing attention

5030
05:00:50,580 --> 05:00:52,920
there's this amazing book it's difficult

5031
05:00:52,920 --> 05:00:54,420
to find called leading with your head

5032
05:00:54,420 --> 05:00:57,480
that explains how the attention model

5033
05:00:57,480 --> 05:00:59,940
works like there's there are things that

5034
05:00:59,940 --> 05:01:01,620
are called active versus passive

5035
05:01:01,620 --> 05:01:03,718
positions if I'm talking with you like

5036
05:01:03,718 --> 05:01:04,740
this

5037
05:01:04,740 --> 05:01:06,480
you know I'm interested you know I'm

5038
05:01:06,480 --> 05:01:09,660
looking at you whereas if I'm like this

5039
05:01:09,660 --> 05:01:12,298
you know I mean I might be listening or

5040
05:01:12,298 --> 05:01:13,440
thinking about whatever I'm eating

5041
05:01:13,440 --> 05:01:16,260
tonight right it's just my body language

5042
05:01:16,260 --> 05:01:18,540
so the idea is

5043
05:01:18,540 --> 05:01:20,700
people will care when you care and

5044
05:01:20,700 --> 05:01:22,740
people won't care when you don't

5045
05:01:22,740 --> 05:01:25,138
so if you need to copy a card or

5046
05:01:25,138 --> 05:01:28,020
something if you're like this

5047
05:01:28,020 --> 05:01:30,600
man well of course there might feel

5048
05:01:30,600 --> 05:01:32,940
something's worrying right or if you're

5049
05:01:32,940 --> 05:01:34,560
giving information

5050
05:01:34,560 --> 05:01:36,900
and you want them to focus on something

5051
05:01:36,900 --> 05:01:39,120
look at them like be

5052
05:01:39,120 --> 05:01:42,360
active in your posture whereas if you

5053
05:01:42,360 --> 05:01:43,980
want someone not to look at something

5054
05:01:43,980 --> 05:01:46,440
don't look at it you know I oftentimes

5055
05:01:46,440 --> 05:01:49,260
seen people copying cards and being like

5056
05:01:49,260 --> 05:01:51,660
like this and looking of course people

5057
05:01:51,660 --> 05:01:53,100
are going to look where you look like

5058
05:01:53,100 --> 05:01:55,920
we're humans we we look at people's eyes

5059
05:01:55,920 --> 05:01:58,798
so if you want to emphasis on something

5060
05:01:58,798 --> 05:02:01,260
look at it if you want people not

5061
05:02:01,260 --> 05:02:03,480
looking at it don't look at it it

5062
05:02:03,480 --> 05:02:05,340
appears very obvious but it's not so

5063
05:02:05,340 --> 05:02:07,798
obvious after all

5064
05:02:07,798 --> 05:02:09,840
um then you need to take in in mind what

5065
05:02:09,840 --> 05:02:12,000
is called the bubble of attention so

5066
05:02:12,000 --> 05:02:13,020
quick question

5067
05:02:13,020 --> 05:02:14,820
what is more worrisome

5068
05:02:14,820 --> 05:02:17,280
somebody in your back or somebody in

5069
05:02:17,280 --> 05:02:19,620
front of you

5070
05:02:19,620 --> 05:02:21,600
in the back yes you can talk out loud by

5071
05:02:21,600 --> 05:02:24,540
the way I see you but just in case so

5072
05:02:24,540 --> 05:02:26,700
um yes so people in your back are more

5073
05:02:26,700 --> 05:02:29,400
worrisome than people in front of you so

5074
05:02:29,400 --> 05:02:31,980
obviously if you want to not be a threat

5075
05:02:31,980 --> 05:02:33,600
you should be in front of them now

5076
05:02:33,600 --> 05:02:35,100
what's more worrisome somebody in front

5077
05:02:35,100 --> 05:02:38,340
of you somebody Insider next to you

5078
05:02:38,340 --> 05:02:40,378
next to you is less worrisome and in

5079
05:02:40,378 --> 05:02:42,180
front in theory and what's worse

5080
05:02:42,180 --> 05:02:44,520
somebody going toward you or are you

5081
05:02:44,520 --> 05:02:46,440
going toward them

5082
05:02:46,440 --> 05:02:48,958
well somebody if you I am going towards

5083
05:02:48,958 --> 05:02:50,820
someone it's less threatening that if

5084
05:02:50,820 --> 05:02:53,040
that person is going towards me

5085
05:02:53,040 --> 05:02:55,378
so when you take that in mind

5086
05:02:55,378 --> 05:02:57,540
that if you need to clone a card or pick

5087
05:02:57,540 --> 05:03:00,480
a pocket you are much better

5088
05:03:00,480 --> 05:03:02,280
if you understand that model to be in

5089
05:03:02,280 --> 05:03:04,020
the right place my favorite spotter

5090
05:03:04,020 --> 05:03:06,000
escalators because when you're in an

5091
05:03:06,000 --> 05:03:08,940
escalator in a non-active position like

5092
05:03:08,940 --> 05:03:10,500
this cloning a card

5093
05:03:10,500 --> 05:03:12,718
you're not a threat you're on the side

5094
05:03:12,718 --> 05:03:15,000
you're not moving toward them they are

5095
05:03:15,000 --> 05:03:16,798
moving toward you and the fun part about

5096
05:03:16,798 --> 05:03:19,138
an escalator is they can't go back so

5097
05:03:19,138 --> 05:03:21,660
it's pretty nice

5098
05:03:21,660 --> 05:03:24,600
elevator's work as well uh doorways but

5099
05:03:24,600 --> 05:03:27,958
you know we've all seen the the TV

5100
05:03:27,958 --> 05:03:30,120
series where there's a cloner that like

5101
05:03:30,120 --> 05:03:32,218
hides behind a guy like this trying to

5102
05:03:32,218 --> 05:03:34,320
clone a card and everybody finds it's

5103
05:03:34,320 --> 05:03:36,600
really weird try to avoid these things

5104
05:03:36,600 --> 05:03:39,540
when you know how people perceive what

5105
05:03:39,540 --> 05:03:41,878
are what's around them by knowing this

5106
05:03:41,878 --> 05:03:43,680
just take care of know the bubble of

5107
05:03:43,680 --> 05:03:46,740
attention and know where to when to

5108
05:03:46,740 --> 05:03:48,980
attack

5109
05:03:49,260 --> 05:03:52,138
um yeah so yes I worked super hard to

5110
05:03:52,138 --> 05:03:53,700
find a Sun Tzu quote because it's

5111
05:03:53,700 --> 05:03:55,020
obvious that all cyber security

5112
05:03:55,020 --> 05:03:57,240
conferences should have a Sun Tzu quote

5113
05:03:57,240 --> 05:03:59,400
and this one is the hand considering the

5114
05:03:59,400 --> 05:04:01,320
object should be dead to you so really

5115
05:04:01,320 --> 05:04:02,700
if you have something important in your

5116
05:04:02,700 --> 05:04:04,620
hand like you have a Roberta key and

5117
05:04:04,620 --> 05:04:06,900
real thing um

5118
05:04:06,900 --> 05:04:10,138
we I got into a high security place

5119
05:04:10,138 --> 05:04:12,958
where they had they patted you down and

5120
05:04:12,958 --> 05:04:15,000
I had a rubber duck in my hand

5121
05:04:15,000 --> 05:04:16,740
and they did Pat me down I was like sure

5122
05:04:16,740 --> 05:04:19,560
Pat me down and it felt like I felt like

5123
05:04:19,560 --> 05:04:22,138
such a a spy but in the end I just

5124
05:04:22,138 --> 05:04:25,200
stopped looking at it and it didn't care

5125
05:04:25,200 --> 05:04:27,718
oh by the way if you're breaking into

5126
05:04:27,718 --> 05:04:30,060
high security place they're gonna look

5127
05:04:30,060 --> 05:04:32,218
for cell phones and cameras

5128
05:04:32,218 --> 05:04:33,958
you know you're allowed to have decoys

5129
05:04:33,958 --> 05:04:36,000
right and they never think about it you

5130
05:04:36,000 --> 05:04:38,280
know they're gonna say you have a laptop

5131
05:04:38,280 --> 05:04:40,138
say yes

5132
05:04:40,138 --> 05:04:42,298
you're allowed to have two laptops they

5133
05:04:42,298 --> 05:04:45,240
don't know about it and decoys work very

5134
05:04:45,240 --> 05:04:46,680
very very well

5135
05:04:46,680 --> 05:04:49,200
by the way and if you have cheap laptops

5136
05:04:49,200 --> 05:04:50,700
because oftentimes they're going to

5137
05:04:50,700 --> 05:04:52,740
expect you to come back to get it so

5138
05:04:52,740 --> 05:04:55,080
like find the most broken super dated

5139
05:04:55,080 --> 05:04:58,500
laptop I'm a Marketplace guy and like

5140
05:04:58,500 --> 05:05:01,138
leave that laptop and they'll know you

5141
05:05:01,138 --> 05:05:02,580
you will come back to get it because

5142
05:05:02,580 --> 05:05:04,740
it's an expensive item and then you're

5143
05:05:04,740 --> 05:05:06,840
free to roam so when you're breaking

5144
05:05:06,840 --> 05:05:08,760
through things think about having decoys

5145
05:05:08,760 --> 05:05:09,780
anyway

5146
05:05:09,780 --> 05:05:11,520
that's a side note

5147
05:05:11,520 --> 05:05:14,040
uh active versus Iraq State I just want

5148
05:05:14,040 --> 05:05:15,780
to explain again that if it's important

5149
05:05:15,780 --> 05:05:17,878
to you you should be active and it's not

5150
05:05:17,878 --> 05:05:19,320
important to you you should be passive

5151
05:05:19,320 --> 05:05:22,378
and use this use the attention model to

5152
05:05:22,378 --> 05:05:25,138
exactly know when to attack

5153
05:05:25,138 --> 05:05:27,240
actually you should be the the opposite

5154
05:05:27,240 --> 05:05:28,980
you want you're doing something at that

5155
05:05:28,980 --> 05:05:31,860
point well then you should be in a

5156
05:05:31,860 --> 05:05:33,958
relaxed State of Mind you should be in a

5157
05:05:33,958 --> 05:05:36,540
relaxed body because of course if you're

5158
05:05:36,540 --> 05:05:38,160
like this well people are going to feel

5159
05:05:38,160 --> 05:05:39,780
stressed and it's more about position

5160
05:05:39,780 --> 05:05:41,520
words

5161
05:05:41,520 --> 05:05:43,138
tone of voice and all these things

5162
05:05:43,138 --> 05:05:44,820
there's this amazing book called

5163
05:05:44,820 --> 05:05:47,878
psychological subtleties by Banacek who

5164
05:05:47,878 --> 05:05:50,100
is uh you you can read all about this or

5165
05:05:50,100 --> 05:05:52,020
the leading with your mind by Gary

5166
05:05:52,020 --> 05:05:54,718
kurtzer like it's only this as a side

5167
05:05:54,718 --> 05:05:56,940
note Gary Kurtz was a dancer before

5168
05:05:56,940 --> 05:05:59,580
being a magician so he's an expert at

5169
05:05:59,580 --> 05:06:01,860
the body and he has it's like a 300

5170
05:06:01,860 --> 05:06:03,780
Pages book about all the subtleties of

5171
05:06:03,780 --> 05:06:06,600
position and how to use your hand to

5172
05:06:06,600 --> 05:06:10,200
look convey some things it's really nice

5173
05:06:10,200 --> 05:06:12,060
tutors and accomplices

5174
05:06:12,060 --> 05:06:15,480
so spoiler in Magic sometimes we have

5175
05:06:15,480 --> 05:06:17,718
things called Stooges

5176
05:06:17,718 --> 05:06:19,920
accomplices and what it accomplices is

5177
05:06:19,920 --> 05:06:24,420
somebody who's with your team and that

5178
05:06:24,420 --> 05:06:26,100
whoever you're trying to con doesn't

5179
05:06:26,100 --> 05:06:27,600
know

5180
05:06:27,600 --> 05:06:29,940
the first thing you should in Magic they

5181
05:06:29,940 --> 05:06:32,878
always do is say we've never met

5182
05:06:32,878 --> 05:06:35,940
we've never seen one another of course

5183
05:06:35,940 --> 05:06:38,040
the accomplice is expected to say no but

5184
05:06:38,040 --> 05:06:40,500
the thing is why are they all saying

5185
05:06:40,500 --> 05:06:41,878
we've never met

5186
05:06:41,878 --> 05:06:45,840
were we we didn't know one another well

5187
05:06:45,840 --> 05:06:48,420
because two people build trust so if

5188
05:06:48,420 --> 05:06:49,860
you're able to have an accomplice then

5189
05:06:49,860 --> 05:06:51,120
it's amazing

5190
05:06:51,120 --> 05:06:54,060
but accomplices only work as long as

5191
05:06:54,060 --> 05:06:56,520
it's not obvious you know one another

5192
05:06:56,520 --> 05:06:58,980
so if you say hey how are you I'm nice

5193
05:06:58,980 --> 05:07:01,560
meeting you then suddenly you're not too

5194
05:07:01,560 --> 05:07:04,080
team of one but one team of two and then

5195
05:07:04,080 --> 05:07:06,298
you can't Leverage

5196
05:07:06,298 --> 05:07:10,440
um accomplices now in what kind of a pen

5197
05:07:10,440 --> 05:07:12,000
testing you use accomplices right

5198
05:07:12,000 --> 05:07:14,040
because of course if you can if your

5199
05:07:14,040 --> 05:07:16,020
client lets you in it's easy but say

5200
05:07:16,020 --> 05:07:17,940
you're able to get in once using one

5201
05:07:17,940 --> 05:07:21,060
person then you can privileges tell it

5202
05:07:21,060 --> 05:07:23,940
by suddenly becoming an internal

5203
05:07:23,940 --> 05:07:25,500
employee and then opening the door for

5204
05:07:25,500 --> 05:07:26,878
somebody else saying hey you're a new

5205
05:07:26,878 --> 05:07:29,580
person by all means register

5206
05:07:29,580 --> 05:07:31,378
so now you're able to bring your own

5207
05:07:31,378 --> 05:07:34,560
team inside the premise because you're

5208
05:07:34,560 --> 05:07:36,958
now an Insider and you're enforcing the

5209
05:07:36,958 --> 05:07:39,180
rules of having people

5210
05:07:39,180 --> 05:07:41,820
sign in and since you're there they're

5211
05:07:41,820 --> 05:07:43,860
there you can even request for a badge

5212
05:07:43,860 --> 05:07:46,680
so by being an accomplice it only works

5213
05:07:46,680 --> 05:07:48,480
if it's obvious that you're not working

5214
05:07:48,480 --> 05:07:50,160
with the person so that's called an

5215
05:07:50,160 --> 05:07:52,560
accomplice it's very used in magic

5216
05:07:52,560 --> 05:07:54,420
but there is something much more cool

5217
05:07:54,420 --> 05:07:56,160
magic that is not well known called

5218
05:07:56,160 --> 05:08:00,480
Studios and Stooges are accomplices who

5219
05:08:00,480 --> 05:08:02,100
don't know their accomplices

5220
05:08:02,100 --> 05:08:05,520
and this is really nice and

5221
05:08:05,520 --> 05:08:07,740
let me give you an example and I'll talk

5222
05:08:07,740 --> 05:08:10,500
about the next few slides

5223
05:08:10,500 --> 05:08:12,660
I came into a pen test and say I'm here

5224
05:08:12,660 --> 05:08:14,160
for the audit

5225
05:08:14,160 --> 05:08:17,700
now the first person expected me to be

5226
05:08:17,700 --> 05:08:19,200
an auditor

5227
05:08:19,200 --> 05:08:21,540
so that person brought me

5228
05:08:21,540 --> 05:08:24,540
to the auditors

5229
05:08:24,540 --> 05:08:26,400
and now

5230
05:08:26,400 --> 05:08:29,160
that person said he's here he wanted to

5231
05:08:29,160 --> 05:08:31,500
tell that I was here for the audit but

5232
05:08:31,500 --> 05:08:34,138
the Auditors really knows that I'm not

5233
05:08:34,138 --> 05:08:35,700
that they don't have an ongoing audit

5234
05:08:35,700 --> 05:08:37,260
right

5235
05:08:37,260 --> 05:08:39,420
so I'm kind of stuck what do you do in

5236
05:08:39,420 --> 05:08:41,638
these cases

5237
05:08:41,638 --> 05:08:44,400
there's this amazing magic principle

5238
05:08:44,400 --> 05:08:47,160
that you can use called double talk and

5239
05:08:47,160 --> 05:08:49,440
what double talk is is when you're

5240
05:08:49,440 --> 05:08:52,020
saying something and both sides

5241
05:08:52,020 --> 05:08:54,540
understand something different

5242
05:08:54,540 --> 05:08:57,840
what I'm saying I'm here for the audit

5243
05:08:57,840 --> 05:09:00,540
the personal reception hears

5244
05:09:00,540 --> 05:09:03,180
I'm here as an auditor

5245
05:09:03,180 --> 05:09:05,638
whereas the auditor

5246
05:09:05,638 --> 05:09:08,878
believes that I'm here to be audited

5247
05:09:08,878 --> 05:09:10,920
I'm using the same words I'm saying I'm

5248
05:09:10,920 --> 05:09:13,980
here for the audit but both sides of the

5249
05:09:13,980 --> 05:09:17,340
people hearing hear something different

5250
05:09:17,340 --> 05:09:18,780
or they understand something different

5251
05:09:18,780 --> 05:09:20,760
does that make sense

5252
05:09:20,760 --> 05:09:23,940
and it's an amazingly powerful tool I'm

5253
05:09:23,940 --> 05:09:25,560
giving you a very very simple example

5254
05:09:25,560 --> 05:09:27,840
about audits but when you can have

5255
05:09:27,840 --> 05:09:29,458
somebody on the inside understand

5256
05:09:29,458 --> 05:09:32,458
something and that person can now be

5257
05:09:32,458 --> 05:09:35,458
your messenger about your throot to

5258
05:09:35,458 --> 05:09:37,680
somebody else then you're leveraging

5259
05:09:37,680 --> 05:09:40,138
their trust in order to get in

5260
05:09:40,138 --> 05:09:42,480
so that's something super useful and

5261
05:09:42,480 --> 05:09:44,820
it's called double talk now unless

5262
05:09:44,820 --> 05:09:47,520
you're exceedingly witty it's very rare

5263
05:09:47,520 --> 05:09:48,840
that we see people being able to do

5264
05:09:48,840 --> 05:09:50,638
double talk

5265
05:09:50,638 --> 05:09:53,100
um like this it requires some practice

5266
05:09:53,100 --> 05:09:56,400
but it's a very very nice tool in that

5267
05:09:56,400 --> 05:09:58,378
regard

5268
05:09:58,378 --> 05:10:01,080
now um I have like four more minutes and

5269
05:10:01,080 --> 05:10:02,580
I want to talk to you about surveillance

5270
05:10:02,580 --> 05:10:05,520
because recently I've been uh privy to

5271
05:10:05,520 --> 05:10:07,200
people doing surveillance or tailing

5272
05:10:07,200 --> 05:10:09,600
people and I want to give you a very

5273
05:10:09,600 --> 05:10:10,980
very good example

5274
05:10:10,980 --> 05:10:14,540
what is wrong with this picture

5275
05:10:15,360 --> 05:10:16,860
no one

5276
05:10:16,860 --> 05:10:20,878
well first yes people doing this now if

5277
05:10:20,878 --> 05:10:22,740
you ever have to do

5278
05:10:22,740 --> 05:10:26,160
um surveillance please know that you

5279
05:10:26,160 --> 05:10:28,020
don't need to do this in movies they do

5280
05:10:28,020 --> 05:10:30,120
because they want them to see it but you

5281
05:10:30,120 --> 05:10:32,160
don't need to do this oftentimes you can

5282
05:10:32,160 --> 05:10:35,280
just talk and it'll work so and it's

5283
05:10:35,280 --> 05:10:36,660
very obvious when you see people being

5284
05:10:36,660 --> 05:10:38,458
trained at surveillance they will all

5285
05:10:38,458 --> 05:10:40,138
have a reflex of doing this there's

5286
05:10:40,138 --> 05:10:41,458
another problem with this picture what

5287
05:10:41,458 --> 05:10:43,760
is it

5288
05:10:44,820 --> 05:10:47,520
yes exactly there's this little

5289
05:10:47,520 --> 05:10:49,740
but earpiece

5290
05:10:49,740 --> 05:10:52,080
earpiece like now the earpiece is so

5291
05:10:52,080 --> 05:10:54,000
small it goes inside the ear and there's

5292
05:10:54,000 --> 05:10:55,500
an induction Loop in your collar so

5293
05:10:55,500 --> 05:10:58,200
there's no wire it's just like radio

5294
05:10:58,200 --> 05:10:59,760
but more than this

5295
05:10:59,760 --> 05:11:00,600
um

5296
05:11:00,600 --> 05:11:02,520
again in movies they use cell phone and

5297
05:11:02,520 --> 05:11:04,260
so on but you can't always use your cell

5298
05:11:04,260 --> 05:11:04,920
phone

5299
05:11:04,920 --> 05:11:07,138
if you need to talk to someone in in

5300
05:11:07,138 --> 05:11:08,940
surveillance there's something called

5301
05:11:08,940 --> 05:11:11,878
the pretzel or a PTT switch press to

5302
05:11:11,878 --> 05:11:14,940
touch and the way it worked roughly is

5303
05:11:14,940 --> 05:11:17,340
since you can't talk you need to have an

5304
05:11:17,340 --> 05:11:19,620
operator asking questions so oftentimes

5305
05:11:19,620 --> 05:11:21,420
three beeps will mean ask me a question

5306
05:11:21,420 --> 05:11:23,340
so I have to press on in my hand it's

5307
05:11:23,340 --> 05:11:25,320
like a little beige shaped button

5308
05:11:25,320 --> 05:11:28,440
basically and one day I'm gonna press

5309
05:11:28,440 --> 05:11:30,660
three times to say ask me a question

5310
05:11:30,660 --> 05:11:33,240
question and the operator will say is

5311
05:11:33,240 --> 05:11:35,218
the target moving I'll press one for yes

5312
05:11:35,218 --> 05:11:38,400
is the target going west I'm gonna press

5313
05:11:38,400 --> 05:11:40,980
twice for no then is twice for no then

5314
05:11:40,980 --> 05:11:43,378
North yes and all these things so

5315
05:11:43,378 --> 05:11:45,360
it's not like in the movies and people

5316
05:11:45,360 --> 05:11:47,160
need to be super worried about

5317
05:11:47,160 --> 05:11:49,500
surveillance the way they're doing it

5318
05:11:49,500 --> 05:11:52,620
is really bad and you're gonna see Pros

5319
05:11:52,620 --> 05:11:55,500
doing something like this but it still

5320
05:11:55,500 --> 05:11:58,680
is about magic if you care about it and

5321
05:11:58,680 --> 05:12:00,660
if you look at it people will look

5322
05:12:00,660 --> 05:12:02,458
so now

5323
05:12:02,458 --> 05:12:03,958
or you're lucky enough to do

5324
05:12:03,958 --> 05:12:06,240
surveillance it's really mine it's

5325
05:12:06,240 --> 05:12:07,860
really boring work by the way

5326
05:12:07,860 --> 05:12:09,180
um just

5327
05:12:09,180 --> 05:12:12,000
relax and don't touch your earpiece and

5328
05:12:12,000 --> 05:12:13,680
behave like normal there's lots of

5329
05:12:13,680 --> 05:12:15,180
things I'm out of time so I'm not going

5330
05:12:15,180 --> 05:12:16,740
to talk about clothing and techniques

5331
05:12:16,740 --> 05:12:18,420
and counter surveillance talk to me

5332
05:12:18,420 --> 05:12:20,400
around a beer if you'd like but it's

5333
05:12:20,400 --> 05:12:22,260
something you should you shouldn't need

5334
05:12:22,260 --> 05:12:24,060
to know it in the movies it's totally

5335
05:12:24,060 --> 05:12:25,798
wrong

5336
05:12:25,798 --> 05:12:28,320
uh yeah I said this and references

5337
05:12:28,320 --> 05:12:30,540
finally the CIA manual to deception this

5338
05:12:30,540 --> 05:12:32,940
is something the CIA wrote uh well what

5339
05:12:32,940 --> 05:12:34,440
magician living with your mind I talked

5340
05:12:34,440 --> 05:12:36,540
about it before psychological subtleties

5341
05:12:36,540 --> 05:12:39,120
a slight of mind it's amazing it's like

5342
05:12:39,120 --> 05:12:41,400
neuroscientists looking at Deception and

5343
05:12:41,400 --> 05:12:42,798
the book influenced by Robert

5344
05:12:42,798 --> 05:12:45,298
beachaldini who are um it was a

5345
05:12:45,298 --> 05:12:48,298
psychologist who wrote who wrote about

5346
05:12:48,298 --> 05:12:50,218
how influence works it's a really really

5347
05:12:50,218 --> 05:12:51,540
good book

5348

but anyway it's going to be that's not

5367
05:30:26,520 --> 05:30:29,760
true okay a few feedback and we'll start

5368
05:30:29,760 --> 05:30:32,340
with the easy ones so let's just start

5369
05:30:32,340 --> 05:30:34,378
with a basic question

5370
05:30:34,378 --> 05:30:36,718
uh

5371
05:30:36,718 --> 05:30:38,940
we had a talk by Guillaume on guard

5372
05:30:38,940 --> 05:30:41,940
rails I really appreciate this talk I

5373
05:30:41,940 --> 05:30:43,740
really appreciate guardrails I mean it's

5374
05:30:43,740 --> 05:30:46,500
a very interesting topic when you

5375
05:30:46,500 --> 05:30:49,260
develop malware

5376
05:30:49,260 --> 05:30:53,040
um what do you see the what what do you

5377
05:30:53,040 --> 05:30:55,980
see as a challenge in 2023

5378
05:30:55,980 --> 05:31:00,298
for EDR evasion from the guardrail point

5379
05:31:00,298 --> 05:31:02,600
of view

5380
05:31:05,900 --> 05:31:08,400
from my perspective and my knowledge at

5381
05:31:08,400 --> 05:31:11,400
in 2023 uh guardrails are not really

5382
05:31:11,400 --> 05:31:13,260
detected

5383
05:31:13,260 --> 05:31:16,440
um as a behavior so I don't know any EDR

5384
05:31:16,440 --> 05:31:19,320
that that see a process looking at the

5385
05:31:19,320 --> 05:31:20,580
user

5386
05:31:20,580 --> 05:31:21,360
um

5387
05:31:21,360 --> 05:31:24,180
the the domain variable uh of the

5388
05:31:24,180 --> 05:31:25,620
computer and say hey this is a guardrail

5389
05:31:25,620 --> 05:31:27,660
obviously let's let's block the process

5390
05:31:27,660 --> 05:31:30,060
so I don't think it's a problem right

5391
05:31:30,060 --> 05:31:31,798
now but it might be in the future

5392
05:31:31,798 --> 05:31:34,020
okay

5393
05:31:34,020 --> 05:31:36,240
um because

5394
05:31:36,240 --> 05:31:38,940
I I saw a trend between the talks of

5395
05:31:38,940 --> 05:31:41,120
Guillaume and Xiao

5396
05:31:41,120 --> 05:31:43,860
you too modify your code modify your

5397
05:31:43,860 --> 05:31:46,320
malware and it really becomes like a bit

5398
05:31:46,320 --> 05:31:48,540
weird and I have had some challenge

5399
05:31:48,540 --> 05:31:51,840
evading EDR by just adding piece of

5400
05:31:51,840 --> 05:31:54,480
layers things like that so same question

5401
05:31:54,480 --> 05:31:57,560
for you shall do you see your techniques

5402
05:31:57,560 --> 05:32:02,280
not work in one or two year

5403
05:32:02,280 --> 05:32:04,378
well I guess it always depends how you

5404
05:32:04,378 --> 05:32:06,780
implement your stuff right uh I always

5405
05:32:06,780 --> 05:32:09,120
try to be as generic as possible but I'm

5406
05:32:09,120 --> 05:32:11,218
a bit of an idiot so I shared those

5407
05:32:11,218 --> 05:32:14,400
tricks online with a bunch of people so

5408
05:32:14,400 --> 05:32:17,100
they're not really a secret anymore uh

5409
05:32:17,100 --> 05:32:18,718
however I guess it's always about

5410
05:32:18,718 --> 05:32:20,340
creativity right this is something that

5411
05:32:20,340 --> 05:32:22,440
I added to most of my talk you just have

5412
05:32:22,440 --> 05:32:24,298
to be creative sometimes you just go in

5413
05:32:24,298 --> 05:32:26,218
the shower and you think about some

5414
05:32:26,218 --> 05:32:27,718
weird things and you come up with some

5415
05:32:27,718 --> 05:32:30,000
ideas right at the end of the day EDR

5416
05:32:30,000 --> 05:32:31,620
cannot track everything it's like

5417
05:32:31,620 --> 05:32:34,080
hooking or kernel callback or all of

5418
05:32:34,080 --> 05:32:35,700
that at the end of the day they cannot

5419
05:32:35,700 --> 05:32:37,560
hook everything they cannot have call

5420
05:32:37,560 --> 05:32:39,360
back everywhere because it's just gonna

5421
05:32:39,360 --> 05:32:42,540
make your system unusable so you always

5422
05:32:42,540 --> 05:32:44,458
have to play The Catch and mouse game

5423
05:32:44,458 --> 05:32:46,798
with them and at the end of the day it's

5424
05:32:46,798 --> 05:32:48,480
it's part of the job right being

5425
05:32:48,480 --> 05:32:50,520
creative and always coming up with new

5426
05:32:50,520 --> 05:32:52,320
Solutions so they're going to improve

5427
05:32:52,320 --> 05:32:55,560
we're going to improve I made a talk uh

5428
05:32:55,560 --> 05:32:57,900
six seven months ago at the

5429
05:32:57,900 --> 05:33:01,500
access about machine learning for those

5430
05:33:01,500 --> 05:33:03,600
of you that attended that talk I was

5431
05:33:03,600 --> 05:33:05,580
always air quoting machine learning

5432
05:33:05,580 --> 05:33:07,138
because I don't know anything about

5433
05:33:07,138 --> 05:33:09,480
machine learning but I know for a fact

5434
05:33:09,480 --> 05:33:10,860
that they're definitely not using

5435
05:33:10,860 --> 05:33:12,718
machine learning based on what I

5436
05:33:12,718 --> 05:33:15,540
presented you know typical super sample

5437
05:33:15,540 --> 05:33:18,060
evasion techniques still work and they

5438
05:33:18,060 --> 05:33:19,920
should be able to detect that with

5439
05:33:19,920 --> 05:33:22,920
machine learning so we're definitely not

5440
05:33:22,920 --> 05:33:24,540
there yet

5441
05:33:24,540 --> 05:33:27,240
I guess from my point of view which have

5442
05:33:27,240 --> 05:33:28,320
no value

5443
05:33:28,320 --> 05:33:30,600
if I may add I talked yesterday with

5444
05:33:30,600 --> 05:33:33,540
some detection engineers and they talked

5445
05:33:33,540 --> 05:33:36,360
to me about one indicator that that I

5446
05:33:36,360 --> 05:33:39,900
see will be a challenge in the future is

5447
05:33:39,900 --> 05:33:42,298
saying like this binary is only present

5448
05:33:42,298 --> 05:33:44,820
on two of your hosts like we've only

5449
05:33:44,820 --> 05:33:47,520
encountered this on Two Hosts or we've

5450
05:33:47,520 --> 05:33:48,360
only

5451
05:33:48,360 --> 05:33:51,298
the it's never been seen before on the

5452
05:33:51,298 --> 05:33:54,120
internet except there that type of Intel

5453
05:33:54,120 --> 05:33:56,340
is going to be a real challenge much

5454
05:33:56,340 --> 05:33:58,440
more you know obfuscation at the EDR

5455
05:33:58,440 --> 05:34:02,580
level is there I think due to the risk

5456
05:34:02,580 --> 05:34:04,200
of false positive and so on this is

5457
05:34:04,200 --> 05:34:06,480
going to be there's plenty of years and

5458
05:34:06,480 --> 05:34:08,820
years and years and these people are at

5459
05:34:08,820 --> 05:34:10,320
the Forefront of it but when we're

5460
05:34:10,320 --> 05:34:12,840
attacking human analysts these type of

5461
05:34:12,840 --> 05:34:15,180
metrics saying in your ten thousand

5462
05:34:15,180 --> 05:34:18,240
holes this binary is only present twice

5463
05:34:18,240 --> 05:34:19,920
that's something you should look at and

5464
05:34:19,920 --> 05:34:21,600
this is something that I'm gonna in the

5465
05:34:21,600 --> 05:34:23,218
future will be much more difficult to

5466
05:34:23,218 --> 05:34:24,060
evade

5467
05:34:24,060 --> 05:34:26,638
and if I can add to that that's why

5468
05:34:26,638 --> 05:34:30,000
nowhere days loading is so popular

5469
05:34:30,000 --> 05:34:31,138
because

5470
05:34:31,138 --> 05:34:33,958
if you have a legendary process to have

5471
05:34:33,958 --> 05:34:36,660
a dll being side loaded and if you do an

5472
05:34:36,660 --> 05:34:38,878
error afterwards and the alert will come

5473
05:34:38,878 --> 05:34:41,638
from the sign dll which is found on like

5474
05:34:41,638 --> 05:34:44,218
thousands of system worldwide so the

5475
05:34:44,218 --> 05:34:46,440
first investigation step will see a

5476
05:34:46,440 --> 05:34:48,600
legit binary

5477
05:34:48,600 --> 05:34:50,760
and if I may add regarding this it's

5478
05:34:50,760 --> 05:34:52,500
super cool they can technically detect

5479
05:34:52,500 --> 05:34:54,360
High loading if the dll loader is not

5480
05:34:54,360 --> 05:34:56,580
signed however if you look at net you

5481
05:34:56,580 --> 05:34:58,080
have the concept of app domain which

5482
05:34:58,080 --> 05:35:00,000
allow you to actually load a dll without

5483
05:35:00,000 --> 05:35:02,280
actually side loading it it doesn't have

5484
05:35:02,280 --> 05:35:03,840
to be signed so for every problem

5485
05:35:03,840 --> 05:35:06,120
there's a solution literally but yeah

5486
05:35:06,120 --> 05:35:07,920
side loading is definitely cool this is

5487
05:35:07,920 --> 05:35:09,900
something that I've done in phishing you

5488
05:35:09,900 --> 05:35:11,940
use an actual legitimate Microsoft sign

5489
05:35:11,940 --> 05:35:14,218
binary that you know supports some side

5490
05:35:14,218 --> 05:35:16,320
loading so you just ship the executable

5491
05:35:16,320 --> 05:35:18,120
that is signed and your dll so you

5492
05:35:18,120 --> 05:35:20,458
bypass Mark of the web smart screen and

5493
05:35:20,458 --> 05:35:21,480
all of that then you get your code

5494
05:35:21,480 --> 05:35:23,638
execution through that actual binary so

5495
05:35:23,638 --> 05:35:25,500
it's once again just about being

5496
05:35:25,500 --> 05:35:27,780
creative

5497
05:35:27,780 --> 05:35:30,958
but thanks for the answers I'll talk now

5498
05:35:30,958 --> 05:35:33,660
about deception I really like your talk

5499
05:35:33,660 --> 05:35:36,298
Lara about you know tips and tricks and

5500
05:35:36,298 --> 05:35:38,820
the link between Magic and deception I

5501
05:35:38,820 --> 05:35:41,340
guess everyone know that deception is a

5502
05:35:41,340 --> 05:35:44,040
real Topic in our field you can put fake

5503
05:35:44,040 --> 05:35:46,798
systems to detect red teamers for

5504
05:35:46,798 --> 05:35:50,940
example and of course real threats

5505
05:35:50,940 --> 05:35:53,040
if you think about this topic do you do

5506
05:35:53,040 --> 05:35:56,878
you think magic can be used to is there

5507
05:35:56,878 --> 05:35:59,218
a way to to detect threats with

5508
05:35:59,218 --> 05:36:01,980
deception oh yes absolutely so I am also

5509
05:36:01,980 --> 05:36:04,320
doing purple teaming and more and more

5510
05:36:04,320 --> 05:36:06,000
days now incident response and we do

5511
05:36:06,000 --> 05:36:07,920
exactly these type of things of course

5512
05:36:07,920 --> 05:36:09,780
there's all the common techniques you

5513
05:36:09,780 --> 05:36:11,820
know have a password in gpp a honey

5514
05:36:11,820 --> 05:36:14,700
token inject creds and RAM that don't

5515
05:36:14,700 --> 05:36:17,218
work but look at it uh look at Fosters

5516
05:36:17,218 --> 05:36:19,218
all these things that are fairly common

5517
05:36:19,218 --> 05:36:21,718
but there are ways to cheat there are

5518
05:36:21,718 --> 05:36:24,000
ways to have files with beacons and now

5519
05:36:24,000 --> 05:36:25,740
you know if you're using Canary and all

5520
05:36:25,740 --> 05:36:27,718
these things are well known but as you

5521
05:36:27,718 --> 05:36:30,480
know most doc files are in XML file

5522
05:36:30,480 --> 05:36:32,638
inside and you've had if you have an

5523
05:36:32,638 --> 05:36:34,260
external DTD it can call you there's

5524
05:36:34,260 --> 05:36:37,680
lots of things you can do to hint people

5525
05:36:37,680 --> 05:36:39,360
about doing these things on these things

5526
05:36:39,360 --> 05:36:43,080
so yes deception works for it's a tool

5527
05:36:43,080 --> 05:36:44,280
so it can be used both for a second

5528
05:36:44,280 --> 05:36:47,160
defense but there's been such a massive

5529
05:36:47,160 --> 05:36:49,798
Improvement in the past few years in

5530
05:36:49,798 --> 05:36:52,860
Honey tokens and these steps it really

5531
05:36:52,860 --> 05:36:54,780
changed the layout of the way we do red

5532
05:36:54,780 --> 05:36:57,180
teaming myself

5533
05:36:57,180 --> 05:37:00,900
I tried first I'm not technical so I

5534
05:37:00,900 --> 05:37:03,000
oftentimes don't rely on these amateur

5535
05:37:03,000 --> 05:37:05,160
right exactly yes so I don't rely on

5536
05:37:05,160 --> 05:37:08,878
these um on these Advanced Techniques I

5537
05:37:08,878 --> 05:37:12,060
mostly go to people and do stupid things

5538
05:37:12,060 --> 05:37:14,458
like asking for the files or as you know

5539
05:37:14,458 --> 05:37:17,400
and there's no EDR for humans right so

5540
05:37:17,400 --> 05:37:18,840
yes

5541
05:37:18,840 --> 05:37:21,780
some no but just maybe a take on

5542
05:37:21,780 --> 05:37:23,878
Deception but from an offensive

5543
05:37:23,878 --> 05:37:26,458
perspective uh for those of you that are

5544
05:37:26,458 --> 05:37:27,900
familiar with Albin you may have

5545
05:37:27,900 --> 05:37:29,878
probably heard of Ms bill which allow

5546
05:37:29,878 --> 05:37:32,040
you to run an XML file where you have

5547
05:37:32,040 --> 05:37:34,138
embedded c-sharp right so Microsoft

5548
05:37:34,138 --> 05:37:36,240
response was to actually start to use

5549
05:37:36,240 --> 05:37:38,820
MSI within that file to actually detect

5550
05:37:38,820 --> 05:37:42,000
my list right and one day was like hey

5551
05:37:42,000 --> 05:37:43,860
this is XML right why not just using

5552
05:37:43,860 --> 05:37:45,718
entity to obfuscate the whole thing so

5553
05:37:45,718 --> 05:37:47,940
now what I use is XML entities to

5554
05:37:47,940 --> 05:37:50,040
actually have my payload encoded using

5555
05:37:50,040 --> 05:37:52,560
HTML entities but nobody looks for that

5556
05:37:52,560 --> 05:37:54,718
because right now MSI is only going to

5557
05:37:54,718 --> 05:37:56,760
look at the c-sharp part of this so it's

5558
05:37:56,760 --> 05:37:58,740
it's about deceiving the people are

5559
05:37:58,740 --> 05:38:00,298
chasing you right so put your code

5560
05:38:00,298 --> 05:38:02,820
somewhere where it's not popular or

5561
05:38:02,820 --> 05:38:04,440
where they're not looking at and that

5562
05:38:04,440 --> 05:38:05,520
way you're always going to come up with

5563
05:38:05,520 --> 05:38:07,138
new technique I've been using this for

5564
05:38:07,138 --> 05:38:09,180
probably like a year and a half and

5565
05:38:09,180 --> 05:38:10,860
Microsoft doesn't care but it's a

5566
05:38:10,860 --> 05:38:12,180
technique you've been using for a while

5567
05:38:12,180 --> 05:38:14,100
now I mean people who are on your

5568
05:38:14,100 --> 05:38:15,840
Discord knowing this for a while because

5569
05:38:15,840 --> 05:38:17,940
I share all My Little Secret with the

5570
05:38:17,940 --> 05:38:20,160
world one similar technique that I share

5571
05:38:20,160 --> 05:38:22,458
and I've some people know about it is

5572
05:38:22,458 --> 05:38:25,320
oftentimes you can use your companies

5573
05:38:25,320 --> 05:38:28,560
your Target's website as a CNC so think

5574
05:38:28,560 --> 05:38:30,718
about for example a website that has a

5575
05:38:30,718 --> 05:38:33,360
review field then you can craft malware

5576
05:38:33,360 --> 05:38:36,060
that's gonna read in the review the the

5577
05:38:36,060 --> 05:38:40,320
commands and then push the output as an

5578
05:38:40,320 --> 05:38:42,840
answer that review the item so when the

5579
05:38:42,840 --> 05:38:45,540
stock is looking at the out the the C2

5580
05:38:45,540 --> 05:38:47,458
they're not looking at some weird

5581
05:38:47,458 --> 05:38:50,160
website with a non-domain or with

5582
05:38:50,160 --> 05:38:51,958
something else what they're looking at

5583
05:38:51,958 --> 05:38:54,718
is your internal computer visiting your

5584
05:38:54,718 --> 05:38:56,580
main website there's some beginning and

5585
05:38:56,580 --> 05:39:00,360
so on but leveraging trust and deceiving

5586
05:39:00,360 --> 05:39:02,458
these

5587
05:39:02,458 --> 05:39:04,440
so you're not fooling systems you're

5588
05:39:04,440 --> 05:39:06,180
fooling the analysts looking at a system

5589
05:39:06,180 --> 05:39:08,580
saying oh this is fine and that's again

5590
05:39:08,580 --> 05:39:10,920
where deception is useful yeah and all

5591
05:39:10,920 --> 05:39:13,620
that no thanks for Google to create the

5592
05:39:13,620 --> 05:39:17,878
dot zip TLD that was a terrible idea

5593
05:39:17,878 --> 05:39:20,100
like all the domain that were registered

5594
05:39:20,100 --> 05:39:21,958
so far are definitely malicious like

5595
05:39:21,958 --> 05:39:23,700
none of them are legitimate that was the

5596
05:39:23,700 --> 05:39:25,920
dumbest idea ever

5597
05:39:25,920 --> 05:39:28,138
I agree I think it's an amazing idea

5598
05:39:28,138 --> 05:39:30,060
there should be more like you know I'm

5599
05:39:30,060 --> 05:39:32,700
out of purple and then for php5 I think

5600
05:39:32,700 --> 05:39:35,218
we should like industry should use more

5601
05:39:35,218 --> 05:39:38,580
php5 definitely and like you know I

5602
05:39:38,580 --> 05:39:39,900
think that's a wonderful idea as a red

5603
05:39:39,900 --> 05:39:41,580
teamer I'm all for that yeah definitely

5604
05:39:41,580 --> 05:39:43,500
but I don't even understand what was the

5605
05:39:43,500 --> 05:39:45,560
point of doing this like legitimately

5606
05:39:45,560 --> 05:39:47,700
according to the blog they said that

5607
05:39:47,700 --> 05:39:51,680
that zip is more secure right

5608
05:39:54,420 --> 05:39:54,958
um

5609
05:39:54,958 --> 05:39:57,000
we've we were starting to receive

5610
05:39:57,000 --> 05:39:59,280
questions thanks guys what's the most

5611
05:39:59,280 --> 05:40:01,560
important difference between an okay red

5612
05:40:01,560 --> 05:40:05,298
team and an awesome routine

5613
05:40:05,540 --> 05:40:08,458
the report

5614
05:40:08,458 --> 05:40:10,560
so that's true at the end of the day you

5615
05:40:10,560 --> 05:40:12,480
said what's the the difference between

5616
05:40:12,480 --> 05:40:14,458
an okay red team and an awesome red team

5617
05:40:14,458 --> 05:40:16,440
and I believe that the report really

5618
05:40:16,440 --> 05:40:18,060
does matter you can be the best hacker

5619
05:40:18,060 --> 05:40:20,040
in the world if you cannot provide a

5620
05:40:20,040 --> 05:40:22,320
decent report it has no value right and

5621
05:40:22,320 --> 05:40:24,180
we tend to over an estimate the fact

5622
05:40:24,180 --> 05:40:26,218
that we're highly Technical and the

5623
05:40:26,218 --> 05:40:27,480
people are going to read the report have

5624
05:40:27,480 --> 05:40:28,860
no clue what we're doing for a living

5625
05:40:28,860 --> 05:40:30,600
right so you can have this super crazy

5626
05:40:30,600 --> 05:40:33,180
uh chain of exploit that lead to

5627
05:40:33,180 --> 05:40:34,500
whatever at the end of the day they

5628
05:40:34,500 --> 05:40:35,580
don't care they don't know what a

5629
05:40:35,580 --> 05:40:38,218
certificate server is and all of that so

5630
05:40:38,218 --> 05:40:40,080
it really depends on how you actually

5631
05:40:40,080 --> 05:40:42,360
provide the result to the customer right

5632
05:40:42,360 --> 05:40:44,218
I've seen cases where they didn't find

5633
05:40:44,218 --> 05:40:46,200
that much but it was well written and

5634
05:40:46,200 --> 05:40:47,878
people still see the value in there

5635
05:40:47,878 --> 05:40:50,820
right so I guess from my perspective

5636
05:40:50,820 --> 05:40:52,680
it's really whatever you deliver to the

5637
05:40:52,680 --> 05:40:55,620
client for me a red good red team gets

5638
05:40:55,620 --> 05:40:57,540
caught by that I mean once you've

5639
05:40:57,540 --> 05:41:00,000
achieved your objective as a redeemer

5640
05:41:00,000 --> 05:41:01,920
you should increase the noise level in a

5641
05:41:01,920 --> 05:41:03,660
way to get caught because you want to

5642
05:41:03,660 --> 05:41:06,180
give feedback on did they catch you and

5643
05:41:06,180 --> 05:41:07,560
then they did they take the right

5644
05:41:07,560 --> 05:41:10,020
decision oftentimes times the you know

5645
05:41:10,020 --> 05:41:11,520
we have people saying oh yeah it's just

5646
05:41:11,520 --> 05:41:14,458
malware we AV clean that tank tanks done

5647
05:41:14,458 --> 05:41:18,000
but malware's aren't like malwares are

5648
05:41:18,000 --> 05:41:19,740
not like shrooms they don't grow like

5649
05:41:19,740 --> 05:41:22,020
you know if there's malware on your host

5650
05:41:22,020 --> 05:41:23,878
somebody put it there and you should

5651
05:41:23,878 --> 05:41:27,298
investigate and so oftentimes I think

5652
05:41:27,298 --> 05:41:30,378
great red team make the blue team work

5653
05:41:30,378 --> 05:41:32,878
definitely and I think a lot of red team

5654
05:41:32,878 --> 05:41:34,860
are scared to be cut but at the end of

5655
05:41:34,860 --> 05:41:36,660
the day as you pointed out it's because

5656
05:41:36,660 --> 05:41:38,458
someone did something great at the end

5657
05:41:38,458 --> 05:41:40,740
of the day we're not invisible to edrs

5658
05:41:40,740 --> 05:41:42,240
and stuff like that it's just I think

5659
05:41:42,240 --> 05:41:44,340
edrs are not ready yet in the sense that

5660
05:41:44,340 --> 05:41:46,440
everything is an event but nobody looks

5661
05:41:46,440 --> 05:41:48,718
at events right they should find a way

5662
05:41:48,718 --> 05:41:52,020
to make them more useful easier to query

5663
05:41:52,020 --> 05:41:54,480
or whatever but it's impossible to run

5664
05:41:54,480 --> 05:41:56,878
something without like existing like

5665
05:41:56,878 --> 05:41:58,378
you're going to leave a trace at some

5666
05:41:58,378 --> 05:42:00,780
point and they just need to get better

5667
05:42:00,780 --> 05:42:02,280
in that sense but I think they're just

5668
05:42:02,280 --> 05:42:05,180
not interested yet

5669
05:42:06,798 --> 05:42:09,600
another important aspect is to not spend

5670
05:42:09,600 --> 05:42:11,280
like off of the project on the external

5671
05:42:11,280 --> 05:42:13,080
part because if you don't succeed you

5672
05:42:13,080 --> 05:42:14,760
don't provide any value to the client so

5673
05:42:14,760 --> 05:42:17,700
it's important to have a clear

5674
05:42:17,700 --> 05:42:21,060
um like check mark when you switch face

5675
05:42:21,060 --> 05:42:24,060
to a Json breach or the dtec identify

5676
05:42:24,060 --> 05:42:25,040
phase

5677
05:42:25,040 --> 05:42:27,600
awesome answers are really I really

5678
05:42:27,600 --> 05:42:29,700
agree with with what you said I will

5679
05:42:29,700 --> 05:42:33,060
surf on a few few ingredients here

5680
05:42:33,060 --> 05:42:37,320
um let's talk about prioritization

5681
05:42:37,320 --> 05:42:40,378
um so you set up a red team you prepare

5682
05:42:40,378 --> 05:42:42,360
your chain you write your malware you

5683
05:42:42,360 --> 05:42:44,940
you write awesome stuff you take all the

5684
05:42:44,940 --> 05:42:48,620
awesome tricks uh how do you make sure

5685
05:42:48,620 --> 05:42:51,240
that your attack chain your attack

5686
05:42:51,240 --> 05:42:53,878
scenario will provide

5687
05:42:53,878 --> 05:42:57,900
most value to your customers

5688
05:42:57,900 --> 05:43:00,540
yes go ahead well first you need to make

5689
05:43:00,540 --> 05:43:02,400
sure that it's not detected immediately

5690
05:43:02,400 --> 05:43:04,080
because else you won't provide any value

5691
05:43:04,080 --> 05:43:07,620
if the clients hire a red team and uh

5692
05:43:07,620 --> 05:43:09,298
you don't modify anything you send your

5693
05:43:09,298 --> 05:43:10,798
ability to detect that the client gets

5694
05:43:10,798 --> 05:43:13,138
no value so my point of view is that try

5695
05:43:13,138 --> 05:43:15,240
to Recon try to find what's easier Sim

5696
05:43:15,240 --> 05:43:17,900
their ADR their their configuration

5697
05:43:17,900 --> 05:43:20,700
mimicating a internal environment and

5698
05:43:20,700 --> 05:43:22,560
when you're 100 sure that it's bypassing

5699
05:43:22,560 --> 05:43:26,100
it that start your your campaign and the

5700
05:43:26,100 --> 05:43:28,080
value will come after that sometimes we

5701
05:43:28,080 --> 05:43:30,000
just called it the white cell we're

5702
05:43:30,000 --> 05:43:31,378
saying a white cell we're going to run

5703
05:43:31,378 --> 05:43:33,480
this malware can you run it just to make

5704
05:43:33,480 --> 05:43:34,440
sure it's fine

5705
05:43:34,440 --> 05:43:36,718
and so we know for sure at that point

5706
05:43:36,718 --> 05:43:39,000
that it's that it's all right I mean

5707
05:43:39,000 --> 05:43:40,980
it's is it cheating well yes but that's

5708
05:43:40,980 --> 05:43:42,840
the best way to provide value so we just

5709
05:43:42,840 --> 05:43:44,520
sometimes we just straight up call the

5710
05:43:44,520 --> 05:43:45,958
clients say you want a red team cool

5711
05:43:45,958 --> 05:43:48,298
make sure this runs on your system like

5712
05:43:48,298 --> 05:43:49,980
run this it's totally fine we swear

5713
05:43:49,980 --> 05:43:53,340
pinky swear and that's it and I guess

5714
05:43:53,340 --> 05:43:54,660
client also needs to understand that

5715
05:43:54,660 --> 05:43:56,700
we're Limited in time and budget we are

5716
05:43:56,700 --> 05:43:58,980
limited so sometimes yes of course if

5717
05:43:58,980 --> 05:44:00,660
you give me six months I'll come up with

5718
05:44:00,660 --> 05:44:02,580
something more exotic but at the end of

5719
05:44:02,580 --> 05:44:03,718
the day it's important that they

5720
05:44:03,718 --> 05:44:04,980
understand that also if you have an

5721
05:44:04,980 --> 05:44:06,120
accomplice make sure that they

5722
05:44:06,120 --> 05:44:07,920
understand what they have to do looking

5723
05:44:07,920 --> 05:44:11,000
at you who are Martin

5724
05:44:12,360 --> 05:44:14,458
but yeah so it's important that

5725
05:44:14,458 --> 05:44:16,320
everybody's in the loop actually truly

5726
05:44:16,320 --> 05:44:17,580
understand what's going to happen how

5727
05:44:17,580 --> 05:44:19,440
many times I had to actually educate

5728
05:44:19,440 --> 05:44:21,298
client I want an actual red team is

5729
05:44:21,298 --> 05:44:23,280
right it's a buzzword that is used on

5730
05:44:23,280 --> 05:44:25,740
every recipe at the end of the day uh

5731
05:44:25,740 --> 05:44:27,480
it's more than that right as I kind of

5732
05:44:27,480 --> 05:44:29,520
briefly touch on my my talk it's always

5733
05:44:29,520 --> 05:44:32,400
about also detecting your capability of

5734
05:44:32,400 --> 05:44:33,900
detection and how you can actually find

5735
05:44:33,900 --> 05:44:35,400
a path to crown jewels right it's not

5736
05:44:35,400 --> 05:44:37,080
about here's a list of thousands of

5737
05:44:37,080 --> 05:44:39,420
reality without any context so they need

5738
05:44:39,420 --> 05:44:40,620
to understand that we're not going to

5739
05:44:40,620 --> 05:44:42,958
give them like a result like a necessary

5740
05:44:42,958 --> 05:44:44,520
scan kind of thing right and there's a

5741
05:44:44,520 --> 05:44:46,798
lot of you know company businesses and

5742
05:44:46,798 --> 05:44:49,080
vendors like the new thing that I see

5743
05:44:49,080 --> 05:44:50,940
often is automated Red theme I still

5744
05:44:50,940 --> 05:44:52,020
don't really understand what it is

5745
05:44:52,020 --> 05:44:53,878
because if you ask them it's like a scan

5746
05:44:53,878 --> 05:44:57,420
but they actually exploit it so it's an

5747
05:44:57,420 --> 05:44:59,458
internal test but from my perspective

5748
05:44:59,458 --> 05:45:00,840
but at the end of the day it's an

5749
05:45:00,840 --> 05:45:01,980
industry that generates probably

5750
05:45:01,980 --> 05:45:03,540
billions of dollars so everybody's

5751
05:45:03,540 --> 05:45:05,940
trying to get a piece of the pie but I'm

5752
05:45:05,940 --> 05:45:07,320
gonna fight hard to make sure that

5753
05:45:07,320 --> 05:45:09,540
people understand what is my vision of a

5754
05:45:09,540 --> 05:45:11,638
red team and fun fact I was working at

5755
05:45:11,638 --> 05:45:13,740
trustwave years years ago and they're

5756
05:45:13,740 --> 05:45:15,840
based out of the UK mostly and a red

5757
05:45:15,840 --> 05:45:18,600
team in UK is really different than what

5758
05:45:18,600 --> 05:45:20,458
we consider red team like What I Call

5759
05:45:20,458 --> 05:45:22,558
Now American red team American red team

5760
05:45:22,558 --> 05:45:25,440
this is what we're used to UK is more

5761
05:45:25,440 --> 05:45:27,240
about the Myron attack framework and

5762
05:45:27,240 --> 05:45:29,638
cases specific cases they don't you know

5763
05:45:29,638 --> 05:45:31,980
tell the story like we do in America so

5764
05:45:31,980 --> 05:45:33,840
it was really different but for them

5765
05:45:33,840 --> 05:45:35,520
that's the reality of what a red team is

5766
05:45:35,520 --> 05:45:37,200
so you also have to adapt with your

5767
05:45:37,200 --> 05:45:40,798
actual crowd I guess they use the Tiber

5768
05:45:40,798 --> 05:45:43,620
EU framework yeah all kind of stuff but

5769
05:45:43,620 --> 05:45:45,840
that's just the reality and also have

5770
05:45:45,840 --> 05:45:47,700
like Crest that push their agenda and

5771
05:45:47,700 --> 05:45:49,440
all of that so you know everybody have

5772
05:45:49,440 --> 05:45:51,480
different standards

5773
05:45:51,480 --> 05:45:53,400
let's surf on that do you think they

5774
05:45:53,400 --> 05:45:56,700
have more maturity than North America

5775
05:45:56,700 --> 05:45:59,878
it's different it's just you know

5776
05:45:59,878 --> 05:46:01,980
validating and control is good but

5777
05:46:01,980 --> 05:46:03,420
sometimes you may miss the whole picture

5778
05:46:03,420 --> 05:46:05,878
right typical oh yeah patch all my

5779
05:46:05,878 --> 05:46:07,320
system but what about your certificate

5780
05:46:07,320 --> 05:46:09,480
or the server did you actually make sure

5781
05:46:09,480 --> 05:46:11,760
that your server probably is configured

5782
05:46:11,760 --> 05:46:13,700
do you does your template are actually

5783
05:46:13,700 --> 05:46:16,980
well secured so it can be up to date

5784
05:46:16,980 --> 05:46:18,900
fully patched but if you have terrible

5785
05:46:18,900 --> 05:46:22,020
template it's not going to do anything

5786
05:46:22,020 --> 05:46:23,100
sorry

5787
05:46:23,100 --> 05:46:26,340
yeah we have people doing a wave in

5788
05:46:26,340 --> 05:46:27,718
front so

5789
05:46:27,718 --> 05:46:29,580
awesome don't worry about it yeah I'm

5790
05:46:29,580 --> 05:46:31,440
not sure what's going on with Mr Marcil

5791
05:46:31,440 --> 05:46:33,540
he actually flew from like super far

5792
05:46:33,540 --> 05:46:36,718
just to be there and see Logan so you

5793
05:46:36,718 --> 05:46:40,580
deserve a round of applause yeah

5794
05:46:41,540 --> 05:46:43,980
[Applause]

5795
05:46:43,980 --> 05:46:45,540
oh

5796
05:46:45,540 --> 05:46:46,320
like

5797
05:46:46,320 --> 05:46:49,680
um next one what about you Martin

5798
05:46:49,680 --> 05:46:53,180
what do you think about all of this

5799
05:46:53,240 --> 05:46:55,620
all of this

5800
05:46:55,620 --> 05:46:57,000
yeah

5801
05:46:57,000 --> 05:47:01,320
um thanks well well first of all

5802
05:47:01,320 --> 05:47:05,160
for for the crowd so I run an internal

5803
05:47:05,160 --> 05:47:07,200
red team so it's completely different we

5804
05:47:07,200 --> 05:47:10,200
have our own team the the dynamic is

5805
05:47:10,200 --> 05:47:11,940
different the objective is different and

5806
05:47:11,940 --> 05:47:15,660
my I mean that's the that's the base of

5807
05:47:15,660 --> 05:47:17,040
the question about prioritization

5808
05:47:17,040 --> 05:47:19,878
because I asked this question every day

5809
05:47:19,878 --> 05:47:24,600
uh because once we use tradecraft we

5810
05:47:24,600 --> 05:47:26,580
need to rebuild new ones because it's

5811
05:47:26,580 --> 05:47:28,320
always

5812
05:47:28,320 --> 05:47:29,820
uh

5813
05:47:29,820 --> 05:47:31,320
really

5814
05:47:31,320 --> 05:47:34,378
burn well I guess that's a question for

5815
05:47:34,378 --> 05:47:36,058
you at this point as an internal red

5816
05:47:36,058 --> 05:47:37,980
teamer since you're already the same guy

5817
05:47:37,980 --> 05:47:40,320
that do this the same kind of stuff over

5818
05:47:40,320 --> 05:47:42,058
and over you have to adapt right because

5819
05:47:42,058 --> 05:47:43,680
like as I mentioned earlier I don't know

5820
05:47:43,680 --> 05:47:45,360
if you attend my talk but like the

5821
05:47:45,360 --> 05:47:46,798
signature of your compiler and stuff

5822
05:47:46,798 --> 05:47:48,360
like that at some point they may

5823
05:47:48,360 --> 05:47:49,558
actually realize oh yeah we know it's

5824
05:47:49,558 --> 05:47:51,240
Martin again he's part of the red team

5825
05:47:51,240 --> 05:47:53,160
so as a consultant that just you know do

5826
05:47:53,160 --> 05:47:54,958
my thing and leave it's slightly

5827
05:47:54,958 --> 05:47:56,520
different than you right so how do you

5828
05:47:56,520 --> 05:47:58,020
actually adapt to that kind of you know

5829
05:47:58,020 --> 05:47:59,520
they know they're coming you also have

5830
05:47:59,520 --> 05:48:02,100
Insider knowledge kind of thing so oh

5831
05:48:02,100 --> 05:48:04,440
it's quite a challenge yes but today I

5832
05:48:04,440 --> 05:48:06,600
will say that we have a very very good

5833
05:48:06,600 --> 05:48:09,000
collaboration with the blue team and I

5834
05:48:09,000 --> 05:48:12,180
I'm a big purple fan most of our

5835
05:48:12,180 --> 05:48:14,400
activities are purple based and

5836
05:48:14,400 --> 05:48:16,260
sometimes we do what we call adversary

5837
05:48:16,260 --> 05:48:18,480
simulation just to do with a little

5838
05:48:18,480 --> 05:48:21,180
surprise and have them work at night at

5839
05:48:21,180 --> 05:48:25,138
night a few a few weeks a year but uh no

5840
05:48:25,138 --> 05:48:27,180
I mean it needs to be collaborative and

5841
05:48:27,180 --> 05:48:29,580
and why do you build a red team in the

5842
05:48:29,580 --> 05:48:32,280
company well to train to opportunities

5843
05:48:32,280 --> 05:48:35,820
to improve to challenge assumptions so

5844
05:48:35,820 --> 05:48:40,200
it's all it's all blue driven so

5845
05:48:40,200 --> 05:48:42,000
so that's how I would answer your

5846
05:48:42,000 --> 05:48:44,520
question fair enough

5847
05:48:44,520 --> 05:48:47,638
let's talk about AI do you believe that

5848
05:48:47,638 --> 05:48:50,458
EDR and Antivirus solution will leverage

5849
05:48:50,458 --> 05:48:52,980
AI to the point that the current state

5850
05:48:52,980 --> 05:48:55,080
of the amplification and evasion will

5851
05:48:55,080 --> 05:48:59,058
not be enough to bypass them

5852
05:48:59,218 --> 05:49:03,600
so the people who are pushing AI are the

5853
05:49:03,600 --> 05:49:05,458
same people who push the metaverse last

5854
05:49:05,458 --> 05:49:10,680
year nfts the years before and like so

5855
05:49:10,680 --> 05:49:13,440
is AI a thing well yeah it's cool you

5856
05:49:13,440 --> 05:49:15,600
can make pretty cat pictures and you can

5857
05:49:15,600 --> 05:49:17,218
cut and even sometimes get the right

5858
05:49:17,218 --> 05:49:18,600
answer

5859
05:49:18,600 --> 05:49:20,458
um so is that something that's going to

5860
05:49:20,458 --> 05:49:22,080
be leveraged well

5861
05:49:22,080 --> 05:49:25,020
yeah perhaps but I think is the

5862
05:49:25,020 --> 05:49:27,660
metaversala thing well not really do we

5863
05:49:27,660 --> 05:49:30,500
care about nft

5864
05:49:30,680 --> 05:49:33,480
so I mean next year we're going to talk

5865
05:49:33,480 --> 05:49:35,218
about AI like this really cool concept

5866
05:49:35,218 --> 05:49:37,138
that happened once but don't worry like

5867
05:49:37,138 --> 05:49:38,940
there was some point where PTI was a

5868
05:49:38,940 --> 05:49:41,458
solution in 2000 then 2002 was a year

5869
05:49:41,458 --> 05:49:43,138
the wife and you know and all these

5870
05:49:43,138 --> 05:49:46,080
things so next gen AV was 2006. so you

5871
05:49:46,080 --> 05:49:47,940
know every year we come with a New

5872
05:49:47,940 --> 05:49:50,040
Concept to buy stuff so it's going to be

5873
05:49:50,040 --> 05:49:52,020
great that's stunning like lots of sales

5874
05:49:52,020 --> 05:49:53,820
people are going to sell lots of cool

5875
05:49:53,820 --> 05:49:56,040
product and they're gonna make lots of

5876
05:49:56,040 --> 05:49:58,080
money in many Industries gonna have a

5877
05:49:58,080 --> 05:50:00,600
new box with AI powered on it and it's

5878
05:50:00,600 --> 05:50:01,980
going to be as useful as the previous

5879
05:50:01,980 --> 05:50:04,680
one and yeah that's it

5880
05:50:04,680 --> 05:50:07,920
if I can add to that I think I will

5881
05:50:07,920 --> 05:50:09,840
definitely it will definitely be an

5882
05:50:09,840 --> 05:50:12,660
accelerator uh if you were at my

5883
05:50:12,660 --> 05:50:14,160
presentation that's true like a king

5884
05:50:14,160 --> 05:50:15,840
proof concept it took me like

5885
05:50:15,840 --> 05:50:17,340
several weeks to understand what was

5886
05:50:17,340 --> 05:50:19,980
going on and when charging came out I

5887
05:50:19,980 --> 05:50:22,620
just I just called the code and

5888
05:50:22,620 --> 05:50:24,540
it was perfect it was explaining to me

5889
05:50:24,540 --> 05:50:26,218
what was going on so I don't think it

5890
05:50:26,218 --> 05:50:27,660
why it will break our payload

5891
05:50:27,660 --> 05:50:30,360
immediately but it can help blue team

5892
05:50:30,360 --> 05:50:33,620
investigate faster

5893
05:50:34,378 --> 05:50:37,020
I'm a bit on Love on the side on this

5894
05:50:37,020 --> 05:50:38,820
one I guess it's going to help me ride

5895
05:50:38,820 --> 05:50:41,100
fishing campaign without having typos

5896
05:50:41,100 --> 05:50:43,138
and grammatical error I'm not going to

5897
05:50:43,138 --> 05:50:45,120
have to reach out to my bus to QA my

5898
05:50:45,120 --> 05:50:47,520
fishing campaign but apart from that I

5899
05:50:47,520 --> 05:50:49,200
think there's a misconception about AI

5900
05:50:49,200 --> 05:50:51,000
about the fact that it has learning

5901
05:50:51,000 --> 05:50:53,160
capability it can only learn what it

5902
05:50:53,160 --> 05:50:55,378
knows about to a certain extent so if

5903
05:50:55,378 --> 05:50:57,718
you have chat GPT to come up with a new

5904
05:50:57,718 --> 05:50:59,700
attack Vector that was never seen before

5905
05:50:59,700 --> 05:51:02,580
good luck right it probably have some

5906
05:51:02,580 --> 05:51:05,100
value it's just I guess I don't know how

5907
05:51:05,100 --> 05:51:06,660
to use computers so I don't really know

5908
05:51:06,660 --> 05:51:09,660
how to log into chat GPT so I'm probably

5909
05:51:09,660 --> 05:51:11,520
gonna have to write my code myself and

5910
05:51:11,520 --> 05:51:13,740
it's all about the data set yes I mean

5911
05:51:13,740 --> 05:51:16,440
the internet is dumb like look at it

5912
05:51:16,440 --> 05:51:18,540
there's anti-fax things there's like

5913
05:51:18,540 --> 05:51:21,120
lots of cats a picture of cats but like

5914
05:51:21,120 --> 05:51:24,600
think about it like open AI is based on

5915
05:51:24,600 --> 05:51:26,940
the internet we all know and use so like

5916
05:51:26,940 --> 05:51:29,820
the Facebook post of your grandma it's

5917
05:51:29,820 --> 05:51:32,040
in there and that's what intelligence is

5918
05:51:32,040 --> 05:51:33,840
so think about this next time you're

5919
05:51:33,840 --> 05:51:37,200
using uh chat GPT

5920
05:51:37,200 --> 05:51:39,540
thank you and I think as far as I know

5921
05:51:39,540 --> 05:51:41,520
charging PT is basically a prompt and a

5922
05:51:41,520 --> 05:51:44,340
UI on top of open AI so still not sure

5923
05:51:44,340 --> 05:51:46,860
how this was acquired by Microsoft and

5924
05:51:46,860 --> 05:51:49,500
not open AI but I don't know much about

5925
05:51:49,500 --> 05:51:51,600
this

5926
05:51:51,600 --> 05:51:54,180
I don't know it's probably written in

5927
05:51:54,180 --> 05:51:56,700
Ruby or something like that or plural

5928
05:51:56,700 --> 05:52:00,558
baby Pearl any Pearl Dev in there

5929
05:52:00,558 --> 05:52:04,700
is not here today so no

5930
05:52:05,638 --> 05:52:08,100
Ross yeah speaking of that for those of

5931
05:52:08,100 --> 05:52:10,740
you that love Windows kernel uh latest

5932
05:52:10,740 --> 05:52:13,260
better have a part that was written in

5933
05:52:13,260 --> 05:52:14,160
Rust that's going to be really

5934
05:52:14,160 --> 05:52:16,740
interesting you're gonna have to relearn

5935
05:52:16,740 --> 05:52:18,958
everything you know about Windows that's

5936
05:52:18,958 --> 05:52:20,580
going to be interesting from a red theme

5937
05:52:20,580 --> 05:52:23,280
perspective evasion perspective really

5938
05:52:23,280 --> 05:52:24,780
looking forward to it you can already

5939
05:52:24,780 --> 05:52:26,580
take a peek at it if you want it's quite

5940
05:52:26,580 --> 05:52:28,260
nice there's some drivers that are

5941
05:52:28,260 --> 05:52:31,558
already in there written in Rust

5942
05:52:31,558 --> 05:52:34,440
we have only seven minutes yet a year

5943
05:52:34,440 --> 05:52:38,700
left sorry uh so let's I mean you would

5944
05:52:38,700 --> 05:52:40,920
like to would you like to share some

5945
05:52:40,920 --> 05:52:43,798
failed stories uh red team stories My

5946
05:52:43,798 --> 05:52:45,680
Life as a failure

5947
05:52:45,680 --> 05:52:48,718
don't say that

5948
05:52:48,718 --> 05:52:50,760
um yes I'm sorry something uh

5949
05:52:50,760 --> 05:52:53,160
interesting that you'd like to share

5950
05:52:53,160 --> 05:52:56,040
I can go ahead if you want so my fastest

5951
05:52:56,040 --> 05:52:59,280
physical intrusion to impact was like

5952
05:52:59,280 --> 05:53:02,760
five minutes because from the outside I

5953
05:53:02,760 --> 05:53:05,400
tailgated followed someone upstairs went

5954
05:53:05,400 --> 05:53:07,138
into a conference room plugged the

5955
05:53:07,138 --> 05:53:11,340
internet cable from the the VoIP phone I

5956
05:53:11,340 --> 05:53:13,620
looked what was my DNS server and the

5957
05:53:13,620 --> 05:53:16,160
DNS server was vulnerable to

5958
05:53:16,160 --> 05:53:18,480
ms-17010 nice

5959
05:53:18,480 --> 05:53:20,218
stop by five minutes from outside to

5960
05:53:20,218 --> 05:53:22,320
domain and Min that was pretty fast it

5961
05:53:22,320 --> 05:53:24,540
was in 2017. that's actually really fast

5962
05:53:24,540 --> 05:53:26,638
our record is nine minutes

5963
05:53:26,638 --> 05:53:30,120
so five is really blazingly fast

5964
05:53:30,120 --> 05:53:32,940
um one fail I had was I was calling tech

5965
05:53:32,940 --> 05:53:35,940
support saying it was someone and the

5966
05:53:35,940 --> 05:53:39,320
guy answered that's me

5967
05:53:39,900 --> 05:53:41,400
and

5968
05:53:41,400 --> 05:53:43,558
I don't know I'll be honest I don't know

5969
05:53:43,558 --> 05:53:45,360
how you can recover from that I'm like

5970
05:53:45,360 --> 05:53:48,540
oh sorry wrong wrong number and you hang

5971
05:53:48,540 --> 05:53:51,000
up like honestly if ever you have you

5972
05:53:51,000 --> 05:53:52,440
know what to answer from this let me

5973
05:53:52,440 --> 05:53:55,980
know but right that was my my

5974
05:53:55,980 --> 05:53:58,620
well maybe a funny one to a certain

5975
05:53:58,620 --> 05:54:00,718
extent so I was working with this client

5976
05:54:00,718 --> 05:54:02,638
and we had an accomplice that was told

5977
05:54:02,638 --> 05:54:04,440
to actually click on the fishing that

5978
05:54:04,440 --> 05:54:06,240
was part of scenario they know that this

5979
05:54:06,240 --> 05:54:08,458
person will get fish right and for some

5980
05:54:08,458 --> 05:54:10,080
reason the person had all the

5981
05:54:10,080 --> 05:54:12,240
information the subject of the email and

5982
05:54:12,240 --> 05:54:14,100
all of that and they still reported the

5983
05:54:14,100 --> 05:54:16,138
email so I was like well that went well

5984
05:54:16,138 --> 05:54:18,718
and funny enough it was reviewed by the

5985
05:54:18,718 --> 05:54:20,458
security team and it was actually marked

5986
05:54:20,458 --> 05:54:22,680
as safe so I was like that ended up

5987
05:54:22,680 --> 05:54:23,638
being

5988
05:54:23,638 --> 05:54:25,740
pretty decent that was a funny one I

5989
05:54:25,740 --> 05:54:27,860
found

5990
05:54:28,138 --> 05:54:30,798
oh damn

5991
05:54:31,200 --> 05:54:35,638
Okay okay something else

5992
05:54:35,638 --> 05:54:38,340
I'm just checking my my awesome

5993
05:54:38,340 --> 05:54:40,020
questions

5994
05:54:40,020 --> 05:54:41,760
I'm sure you have another another one

5995
05:54:41,760 --> 05:54:44,638
lava oh well sadly there's plenty of

5996
05:54:44,638 --> 05:54:47,340
fails um it's more repentance than a red

5997
05:54:47,340 --> 05:54:50,280
team but with a client who made a typo

5998
05:54:50,280 --> 05:54:51,958
in their IP range

5999
05:54:51,958 --> 05:54:54,000
and they had the same like the company

6000
05:54:54,000 --> 05:54:56,700
the other company had the same

6001
05:54:56,700 --> 05:54:58,798
Mission like they were building widgets

6002
05:54:58,798 --> 05:55:00,058
and the other one was called the widget

6003
05:55:00,058 --> 05:55:02,700
Factor year something like this and they

6004
05:55:02,700 --> 05:55:05,280
had the graphene point we pivoted we

6005
05:55:05,280 --> 05:55:07,558
hacked their Mainframe dumped all the

6006
05:55:07,558 --> 05:55:10,558
credit cards and the client was copied

6007
05:55:10,558 --> 05:55:12,180
every step saying that's fine that's

6008
05:55:12,180 --> 05:55:15,298
great continue and at the end once we

6009
05:55:15,298 --> 05:55:16,980
sent like the log of like we added

6010
05:55:16,980 --> 05:55:19,020
credit cards and so on it's oh but

6011
05:55:19,020 --> 05:55:21,718
that's not us

6012
05:55:21,718 --> 05:55:24,420
and then you were like um what should we

6013
05:55:24,420 --> 05:55:26,218
do and we even called the other clients

6014
05:55:26,218 --> 05:55:28,138
they a clients we apologize we

6015
05:55:28,138 --> 05:55:30,718
mistakenly hacked your Mainframe from

6016
05:55:30,718 --> 05:55:33,420
the outside I apologize you get a free

6017
05:55:33,420 --> 05:55:35,400
pen test congrats here's a report and

6018
05:55:35,400 --> 05:55:36,718
the client was like no I don't want to

6019
05:55:36,718 --> 05:55:38,218
talk to vendor but yeah but we went out

6020
05:55:38,218 --> 05:55:39,298
I don't want to talk to vendor don't

6021
05:55:39,298 --> 05:55:41,520
call me again and so as far as I know

6022
05:55:41,520 --> 05:55:43,200
that client is still vulnerable to this

6023
05:55:43,200 --> 05:55:45,000
day because we've never been able to

6024
05:55:45,000 --> 05:55:46,920
reach them

6025
05:55:46,920 --> 05:55:48,900
um right now

6026
05:55:48,900 --> 05:55:51,260
okay

6027
05:55:54,138 --> 05:55:57,540
all right let's end with the sum it up a

6028
05:55:57,540 --> 05:56:00,420
philosophical one what do you wish for

6029
05:56:00,420 --> 05:56:02,340
the cyber security industry what do you

6030
05:56:02,340 --> 05:56:04,440
think is the their next best move

6031
05:56:04,440 --> 05:56:06,798
from your perspective as a

6032
05:56:06,798 --> 05:56:09,900
simulating adversaries every day we

6033
05:56:09,900 --> 05:56:11,760
talked about it earlier but only tokens

6034
05:56:11,760 --> 05:56:14,340
only threads I I find them very

6035
05:56:14,340 --> 05:56:17,218
effective when I do have a teaming I'm

6036
05:56:17,218 --> 05:56:20,040
I'm becoming automatically paranoid if I

6037
05:56:20,040 --> 05:56:22,798
find easy credentials on the system I

6038
05:56:22,798 --> 05:56:24,840
just don't want to look at the look at

6039
05:56:24,840 --> 05:56:26,958
it

6040
05:56:31,820 --> 05:56:35,218
browsers the new L SAS everything is in

6041
05:56:35,218 --> 05:56:38,040
the cloud you can have 20 MFA factor I

6042
05:56:38,040 --> 05:56:39,480
don't care I'm just gonna steal your

6043
05:56:39,480 --> 05:56:41,400
cookie

6044
05:56:41,400 --> 05:56:44,760
you don't have to touch Elsas

6045
05:56:44,760 --> 05:56:46,680
my answer is really boring but for me

6046
05:56:46,680 --> 05:56:48,718
one thing we're seeing more and more is

6047
05:56:48,718 --> 05:56:50,280
involvement of management and red

6048
05:56:50,280 --> 05:56:52,260
teaming so suddenly it's not just get

6049
05:56:52,260 --> 05:56:55,138
domain admin but test our processes and

6050
05:56:55,138 --> 05:56:59,160
like do some actual business risk in the

6051
05:56:59,160 --> 05:57:00,780
past we've stolen a building if I may

6052
05:57:00,780 --> 05:57:03,298
say like we've found the the building

6053
05:57:03,298 --> 05:57:06,180
certificate of the ownership of sent to

6054
05:57:06,180 --> 05:57:08,160
the city of Montreal and we took

6055
05:57:08,160 --> 05:57:10,260
ownership of a building that was a

6056
05:57:10,260 --> 05:57:12,660
pretty big business risk and not I.T

6057
05:57:12,660 --> 05:57:14,040
related

6058
05:57:14,040 --> 05:57:16,740
um so I think more and more and you've

6059
05:57:16,740 --> 05:57:19,260
said it but more and more as management

6060
05:57:19,260 --> 05:57:22,440
are involved red teaming are much more

6061
05:57:22,440 --> 05:57:24,058
tailored to the business need of the

6062
05:57:24,058 --> 05:57:27,000
client and they're much more what the

6063
05:57:27,000 --> 05:57:29,458
business needs and it's not

6064
05:57:29,458 --> 05:57:31,920
just about getting domain admin and this

6065
05:57:31,920 --> 05:57:34,138
is something I'm really really happy and

6066
05:57:34,138 --> 05:57:36,000
internal red teaming is something we're

6067
05:57:36,000 --> 05:57:37,740
seeing more and more that I think brings

6068
05:57:37,740 --> 05:57:40,020
a lot to this

6069
05:57:40,020 --> 05:57:42,480
thank you Laura

6070
05:57:42,480 --> 05:57:45,180
I think we'll oh I was just about to say

6071
05:57:45,180 --> 05:57:47,100
Pastor hash is dead Long Live red

6072
05:57:47,100 --> 05:57:48,540
theming

6073
05:57:48,540 --> 05:57:50,820
and passage is not dead no they're

6074
05:57:50,820 --> 05:57:53,280
really not not yet

6075
05:57:53,280 --> 05:57:55,440
all right well uh thanks guys it was

6076
05:57:55,440 --> 05:57:57,360
amazing amazing talk this afternoon

6077
05:57:57,360 --> 05:57:59,638
thank you very much let's have a last

6078
05:57:59,638 --> 05:58:02,080
round of applause

6079
05:58:02,080 --> 05:58:07,138
[Applause]

6080
05:58:07,138 --> 05:58:11,340
we'll take 15 minutes break and after

6081
05:58:11,340 --> 05:58:13,620
that there is another talk

6082
05:58:13,620 --> 05:58:16,280
thank you

6083
06:14:54,920 --> 06:14:59,520
all right uh so the evening is not over

6084
06:14:59,520 --> 06:15:02,820
uh so we have a another talk by Ashley

6085
06:15:02,820 --> 06:15:05,760
manraj is a CTO at pivotel Technologies

6086
06:15:05,760 --> 06:15:08,280
where we spearheads technology and

6087
06:15:08,280 --> 06:15:10,200
development methodology around event

6088
06:15:10,200 --> 06:15:13,138
driven asynchronous go grpc

6089
06:15:13,138 --> 06:15:15,180
microservices in the back end it didn't

6090
06:15:15,180 --> 06:15:17,100
make that easy for me

6091
06:15:17,100 --> 06:15:18,480
um so in the front end they're

6092
06:15:18,480 --> 06:15:20,218
developing with flutter across a

6093
06:15:20,218 --> 06:15:22,260
platform using the block pattern to

6094
06:15:22,260 --> 06:15:24,600
interact with our back ends in grpc and

6095
06:15:24,600 --> 06:15:27,840
grpc web you'll hear a lot about grpc in

6096
06:15:27,840 --> 06:15:30,360
the next 30 minutes and I have to say I

6097
06:15:30,360 --> 06:15:34,260
know Ashley since University so it's a

6098
06:15:34,260 --> 06:15:36,058
great pleasure to see you on this stage

6099
06:15:36,058 --> 06:15:38,100
right now thank you all right so uh

6100
06:15:38,100 --> 06:15:40,260
thanks

6101
06:15:40,260 --> 06:15:42,660
so I'm representing today pivotal

6102
06:15:42,660 --> 06:15:45,480
Technologies with a subject grpc with

6103
06:15:45,480 --> 06:15:49,500
less effort the less effort comes after

6104
06:15:49,500 --> 06:15:51,660
having done the transformation to be

6105
06:15:51,660 --> 06:15:53,820
even sourced and having done the work in

6106
06:15:53,820 --> 06:15:56,280
order to simplify it but if you don't

6107
06:15:56,280 --> 06:15:58,378
we're going to go through the steps that

6108
06:15:58,378 --> 06:16:00,420
get us there

6109
06:16:00,420 --> 06:16:04,440
so first I was doing applicative pen

6110
06:16:04,440 --> 06:16:07,378
testing I was doing Security review for

6111
06:16:07,378 --> 06:16:10,020
banks before now I'm more in the

6112
06:16:10,020 --> 06:16:11,580
building and trying to build more

6113
06:16:11,580 --> 06:16:13,020
securely things

6114
06:16:13,020 --> 06:16:16,138
and we're doing a bit of branding we

6115
06:16:16,138 --> 06:16:18,298
call it infinite Enterprise but it's

6116
06:16:18,298 --> 06:16:20,160
basically the way to have pure

6117
06:16:20,160 --> 06:16:22,080
containers everywhere the deployment

6118
06:16:22,080 --> 06:16:24,000
methodology to secure everything from

6119
06:16:24,000 --> 06:16:26,280
small to medium-sized companies and do

6120
06:16:26,280 --> 06:16:28,920
digital transformation and so we do we

6121
06:16:28,920 --> 06:16:31,200
try to do secure patterns develop

6122
06:16:31,200 --> 06:16:33,958
libraries for infrastructure as code for

6123
06:16:33,958 --> 06:16:38,040
for your Cloud infrastructure for some

6124
06:16:38,040 --> 06:16:40,320
of your on-premise but right now it's

6125
06:16:40,320 --> 06:16:42,900
very focused on gcp and we try to

6126
06:16:42,900 --> 06:16:46,798
simplify maintenance of of microservices

6127
06:16:46,798 --> 06:16:48,840
and maintain huge fleets of

6128
06:16:48,840 --> 06:16:51,420
microservices for clients but also try

6129
06:16:51,420 --> 06:16:53,520
to develop them faster or transform

6130
06:16:53,520 --> 06:16:56,400
those groups faster

6131
06:16:56,400 --> 06:16:59,700
so you can see on top our website is

6132
06:16:59,700 --> 06:17:02,638
pivotal Tech and our GitHub is pivotal

6133
06:17:02,638 --> 06:17:04,200
Dash Tech

6134
06:17:04,200 --> 06:17:06,298
uh some of the Technologies we use very

6135
06:17:06,298 --> 06:17:08,100
quickly so because it was mentioned

6136
06:17:08,100 --> 06:17:10,620
before we only use flutter or mostly

6137
06:17:10,620 --> 06:17:13,620
flutter for front end for all platforms

6138
06:17:13,620 --> 06:17:16,138
and we've been using web for almost as

6139
06:17:16,138 --> 06:17:18,120
long as it's been available almost for

6140
06:17:18,120 --> 06:17:20,878
years we try to maintain our own CI

6141
06:17:20,878 --> 06:17:23,400
because our CI and CD are very custom so

6142
06:17:23,400 --> 06:17:26,160
we use mostly tecton and some GitHub

6143
06:17:26,160 --> 06:17:28,520
actions when you need root level

6144
06:17:28,520 --> 06:17:31,558
privileges when you run your CI bid rise

6145
06:17:31,558 --> 06:17:33,298
for mobile otherwise everything is in

6146
06:17:33,298 --> 06:17:36,600
bash for that part continuous deployment

6147
06:17:36,600 --> 06:17:40,200
is uh was Google pubs is Google Pub Sub

6148
06:17:40,200 --> 06:17:41,958
in order to deploy

6149
06:17:41,958 --> 06:17:44,878
Network restricted environments using

6150
06:17:44,878 --> 06:17:47,100
Argos vrgo stack before and now we have

6151
06:17:47,100 --> 06:17:49,080
our custom deployer that builds on top

6152
06:17:49,080 --> 06:17:52,798
of our go for the deployment heavy users

6153
06:17:52,798 --> 06:17:56,218
of terraform cloud and terraform uses a

6154
06:17:56,218 --> 06:17:59,100
vault and ashicorp tools mainly

6155
06:17:59,100 --> 06:18:00,840
kubernetes sometimes Google Cloud run

6156
06:18:00,840 --> 06:18:03,780
and the Technologies now is mostly istio

6157
06:18:03,780 --> 06:18:06,180
for service mesh Ingress Gateway grass

6158
06:18:06,180 --> 06:18:07,740
Gateway and the Ori stock for

6159
06:18:07,740 --> 06:18:09,180
Authentication

6160
06:18:09,180 --> 06:18:12,298
and the last but not least even storm

6161
06:18:12,298 --> 06:18:14,520
fc4 even sourcing

6162
06:18:14,520 --> 06:18:16,378
if you don't like the even sourcing is

6163
06:18:16,378 --> 06:18:18,780
we're going to talk about it a bit later

6164
06:18:18,780 --> 06:18:21,360
and those libraries do the heavy lifting

6165
06:18:21,360 --> 06:18:23,218
for us to transform because if we don't

6166
06:18:23,218 --> 06:18:25,378
have libraries you can't actually go

6167
06:18:25,378 --> 06:18:27,378
faster

6168
06:18:27,378 --> 06:18:31,798
so the OAS top 10 for 2023 is mostly

6169
06:18:31,798 --> 06:18:34,440
about broken object level authorization

6170
06:18:34,440 --> 06:18:36,958
which is an authorization problem I'm

6171
06:18:36,958 --> 06:18:39,058
going to Define it a bit later broken

6172
06:18:39,058 --> 06:18:42,900
authentication so it means knowing who

6173
06:18:42,900 --> 06:18:45,058
your users are what which different

6174
06:18:45,058 --> 06:18:47,718
shades authentication from authorization

6175
06:18:47,718 --> 06:18:50,520
authorization is also the topic but at

6176
06:18:50,520 --> 06:18:52,020
the object level property or number

6177
06:18:52,020 --> 06:18:52,820
three

6178
06:18:52,820 --> 06:18:55,440
unrestricted resource consumption mostly

6179
06:18:55,440 --> 06:18:57,420
does indeed us not going to be talked by

6180
06:18:57,420 --> 06:19:00,480
me in the stop in the stock and the

6181
06:19:00,480 --> 06:19:02,280
fifth subject as well will be addressed

6182
06:19:02,280 --> 06:19:05,100
by the infrastructure automation during

6183
06:19:05,100 --> 06:19:08,700
the talk so it's one two one two three

6184
06:19:08,700 --> 06:19:11,280
and five of the top ten

6185
06:19:11,280 --> 06:19:14,400
the objective is to show how we secure

6186
06:19:14,400 --> 06:19:17,580
directly from photobuff and ensure that

6187
06:19:17,580 --> 06:19:21,360
infrastructure is secure by default or

6188
06:19:21,360 --> 06:19:24,058
non-functioning so we try to have either

6189
06:19:24,058 --> 06:19:26,160
functioning services and secure or

6190
06:19:26,160 --> 06:19:28,740
non-functioning at all so that's what we

6191
06:19:28,740 --> 06:19:31,320
try to do because otherwise if you have

6192
06:19:31,320 --> 06:19:33,120
to review your code every time you

6193
06:19:33,120 --> 06:19:35,040
deliver hundreds of endpoints you

6194
06:19:35,040 --> 06:19:37,320
wouldn't deliver fast

6195
06:19:37,320 --> 06:19:42,180
uh so now it's kind of bear with me it's

6196
06:19:42,180 --> 06:19:44,700
the template for some of our large scale

6197
06:19:44,700 --> 06:19:47,280
Transformations so as you can see here

6198
06:19:47,280 --> 06:19:49,620
there's a wide label project it can be

6199
06:19:49,620 --> 06:19:52,500
one or more kubernetes projects but

6200
06:19:52,500 --> 06:19:55,558
mostly it's like the front end but also

6201
06:19:55,558 --> 06:19:57,360
front-end and customization of Yen

6202
06:19:57,360 --> 06:20:00,058
points so there's a it gets into a

6203
06:20:00,058 --> 06:20:02,580
kubernetes cluster within istio Ingress

6204
06:20:02,580 --> 06:20:04,798
Gateway it goes to an authentication

6205
06:20:04,798 --> 06:20:08,218
Service here represented by Oreo of

6206
06:20:08,218 --> 06:20:10,798
keeper for the white label and then it

6207
06:20:10,798 --> 06:20:13,860
talks in grpc web for a translation

6208
06:20:13,860 --> 06:20:17,400
layer of Easter Ingress to a proxy and

6209
06:20:17,400 --> 06:20:19,740
through that proxy it goes to an

6210
06:20:19,740 --> 06:20:22,798
internal Gateway and from the internal

6211
06:20:22,798 --> 06:20:26,340
gateway to a core why do we do it like

6212
06:20:26,340 --> 06:20:28,080
that it's because we've automated

6213
06:20:28,080 --> 06:20:30,240
authorization and because you have

6214
06:20:30,240 --> 06:20:33,120
automated authorization it's simpler to

6215
06:20:33,120 --> 06:20:35,878
have less endpoints but more closely

6216
06:20:35,878 --> 06:20:39,120
maintain and manage them for your

6217
06:20:39,120 --> 06:20:41,100
clients because if you don't have that

6218
06:20:41,100 --> 06:20:42,660
automated authorization you leave

6219
06:20:42,660 --> 06:20:44,940
developers to do it it's more secure to

6220
06:20:44,940 --> 06:20:47,458
develop one set of endpoints per white

6221
06:20:47,458 --> 06:20:49,320
label and that's what we've seen a lot

6222
06:20:49,320 --> 06:20:52,020
of our competitors and others do when

6223
06:20:52,020 --> 06:20:53,458
they don't have their built-in

6224
06:20:53,458 --> 06:20:56,100
authorization but once you do have a

6225
06:20:56,100 --> 06:20:57,540
core for which you can control

6226
06:20:57,540 --> 06:21:00,298
authorization very tightly and do just

6227
06:21:00,298 --> 06:21:02,400
the customization needed for some of the

6228
06:21:02,400 --> 06:21:05,100
white labels it's more efficient to have

6229
06:21:05,100 --> 06:21:08,280
many white labels in front and then have

6230
06:21:08,280 --> 06:21:10,040
a gigantic

6231
06:21:10,040 --> 06:21:13,020
distributed microservice core for the

6232
06:21:13,020 --> 06:21:15,660
core and the core retakes the same logic

6233
06:21:15,660 --> 06:21:19,798
as as mentioned before except we're

6234
06:21:19,798 --> 06:21:22,920
using a grpc Interceptor directly at the

6235
06:21:22,920 --> 06:21:25,080
micro service level and it's templated

6236
06:21:25,080 --> 06:21:27,958
in order to be always there or the

6237
06:21:27,958 --> 06:21:30,718
service wouldn't be deployed and it goes

6238
06:21:30,718 --> 06:21:33,000
to an authorization service that does

6239
06:21:33,000 --> 06:21:35,760
that does rule expansion for us and then

6240
06:21:35,760 --> 06:21:37,740
finally to an authorization engine

6241
06:21:37,740 --> 06:21:39,298
behind

6242
06:21:39,298 --> 06:21:41,638
uh The Roots as I'm mentioning in the

6243
06:21:41,638 --> 06:21:43,860
text here you're much better off

6244
06:21:43,860 --> 06:21:45,718
defining completely new rules for your

6245
06:21:45,718 --> 06:21:49,020
HTTP to HD HTTP free routes whether it's

6246
06:21:49,020 --> 06:21:51,298
cloud or on premise the reason being

6247
06:21:51,298 --> 06:21:53,600
there's a huge new attack Vector

6248
06:21:53,600 --> 06:21:58,280
mentioned by James Kettle from the group

6249
06:21:58,280 --> 06:22:01,620
which is HTTP 2 request smuggling or

6250
06:22:01,620 --> 06:22:03,780
HTTP to downgrade so if you're on

6251
06:22:03,780 --> 06:22:06,058
premise don't share your load balancers

6252
06:22:06,058 --> 06:22:08,458
for HTTP 1 workloads and HTTP 2

6253
06:22:08,458 --> 06:22:10,200
workloads you find completely new

6254
06:22:10,200 --> 06:22:13,080
endpoints for for it because to my

6255
06:22:13,080 --> 06:22:15,360
knowledge it's it becomes a lot harder

6256
06:22:15,360 --> 06:22:17,940
at your different load balancers to be

6257
06:22:17,940 --> 06:22:20,218
managing correctly you're at heavy risk

6258
06:22:20,218 --> 06:22:23,940
of either smuggling or HTTP 2 downgrade

6259
06:22:23,940 --> 06:22:27,180
or other more complex problem related to

6260
06:22:27,180 --> 06:22:29,420
caching so

6261
06:22:29,420 --> 06:22:33,298
we recommend to to Really separate those

6262
06:22:33,298 --> 06:22:35,280
two types of routes whether on cloud

6263
06:22:35,280 --> 06:22:38,218
on-premise not to share any HTTP to http

6264
06:22:38,218 --> 06:22:40,860
free and when last thing from experience

6265
06:22:40,860 --> 06:22:43,558
when you're using those new protocol get

6266
06:22:43,558 --> 06:22:45,660
ready to patch everything in your

6267
06:22:45,660 --> 06:22:48,200
critical path which means

6268
06:22:48,200 --> 06:22:50,878
your your Cloud configuration to be

6269
06:22:50,878 --> 06:22:53,340
regularly updated whether you're using

6270
06:22:53,340 --> 06:22:54,660
uh

6271
06:22:54,660 --> 06:22:57,540
Google Cloud load balancer or AWS Cloud

6272
06:22:57,540 --> 06:23:01,620
load balancer where uh other large Cloud

6273
06:23:01,620 --> 06:23:03,660
providers in order to do your DDOS

6274
06:23:03,660 --> 06:23:06,600
protection your kubernetes cluster your

6275
06:23:06,600 --> 06:23:09,240
istio Ingress keep them at least

6276
06:23:09,240 --> 06:23:11,100
unstable you're already off keeper

6277
06:23:11,100 --> 06:23:13,580
everything that is in the critical path

6278
06:23:13,580 --> 06:23:16,500
including the proxy has to be regularly

6279
06:23:16,500 --> 06:23:17,878
updated because if you have a

6280
06:23:17,878 --> 06:23:21,000
vulnerability the chain is so long but

6281
06:23:21,000 --> 06:23:22,798
it has to be able to be patched quickly

6282
06:23:22,798 --> 06:23:26,160
so if you get into those new things IEC

6283
06:23:26,160 --> 06:23:29,040
is mandatory and doing things fast is

6284
06:23:29,040 --> 06:23:32,540
also really necessary

6285
06:23:32,580 --> 06:23:35,580
uh so now let's get into one simple

6286
06:23:35,580 --> 06:23:38,400
Service uh why do I say that it's simple

6287
06:23:38,400 --> 06:23:40,980
because there's only one endpoint and

6288
06:23:40,980 --> 06:23:42,660
the endpoint is very simple it's a

6289
06:23:42,660 --> 06:23:45,540
simple read the logic here why we're

6290
06:23:45,540 --> 06:23:47,820
using Proto and talking about Proto for

6291
06:23:47,820 --> 06:23:49,980
security is not around as you can see

6292
06:23:49,980 --> 06:23:52,138
here not only about speed because people

6293
06:23:52,138 --> 06:23:54,180
talk about photo a lot for Speed but

6294
06:23:54,180 --> 06:23:56,218
it's about the IDL and the fact that you

6295
06:23:56,218 --> 06:24:00,798
can template directly from the code

6296
06:24:00,798 --> 06:24:04,260
crds for the deployment of your security

6297
06:24:04,260 --> 06:24:06,138
so that your security is automated

6298
06:24:06,138 --> 06:24:08,638
directly from the Proto level your

6299
06:24:08,638 --> 06:24:10,558
protons are compiled and then are

6300
06:24:10,558 --> 06:24:14,780
deployed through your CD at that

6301
06:24:14,780 --> 06:24:17,218
related to the different configurations

6302
06:24:17,218 --> 06:24:19,760
that we see here here for authentication

6303
06:24:19,760 --> 06:24:23,160
and under for authorization and the

6304
06:24:23,160 --> 06:24:26,700
first one being for the white label so

6305
06:24:26,700 --> 06:24:31,620
when we go back to this schema uh you

6306
06:24:31,620 --> 06:24:34,260
have off-key per config here for the

6307
06:24:34,260 --> 06:24:36,360
white label and a second off keeper

6308
06:24:36,360 --> 06:24:38,520
config here for the core

6309
06:24:38,520 --> 06:24:41,878
and you can see here the config folder

6310
06:24:41,878 --> 06:24:43,620
white label as you can see here it's

6311
06:24:43,620 --> 06:24:46,138
white label player with authenticators

6312
06:24:46,138 --> 06:24:49,860
player GWT and the name of the end point

6313
06:24:49,860 --> 06:24:53,160
is get user wallet and get user wallet

6314
06:24:53,160 --> 06:24:56,700
response but at the core level you can

6315
06:24:56,700 --> 06:24:58,980
see that it transforms into get player

6316
06:24:58,980 --> 06:25:01,200
while it responds and git player

6317
06:25:01,200 --> 06:25:05,280
requests so on the on that proxy you can

6318
06:25:05,280 --> 06:25:08,760
transform the calls and modify them a

6319
06:25:08,760 --> 06:25:12,000
bit so without the white label knowing

6320
06:25:12,000 --> 06:25:13,558
that they're actually using another

6321
06:25:13,558 --> 06:25:16,260
interface so that's one of the big

6322
06:25:16,260 --> 06:25:18,298
advantages as well of having two

6323
06:25:18,298 --> 06:25:20,340
different sets of configurations and

6324
06:25:20,340 --> 06:25:22,320
security you can you have like basically

6325
06:25:22,320 --> 06:25:26,760
two levels of control and uh as well uh

6326
06:25:26,760 --> 06:25:28,680
the aspect that we really want to talk

6327
06:25:28,680 --> 06:25:31,620
about here it's a simple wallet with a

6328
06:25:31,620 --> 06:25:34,860
requester ID and a player ID and

6329
06:25:34,860 --> 06:25:37,320
authorization if I haven't mentioned it

6330
06:25:37,320 --> 06:25:39,718
before it's knowing what the person

6331
06:25:39,718 --> 06:25:43,740
should have access to or who it is the

6332
06:25:43,740 --> 06:25:47,000
requester being the person requesting

6333
06:25:47,000 --> 06:25:50,040
for the asset and the player ID is who

6334
06:25:50,040 --> 06:25:52,798
is requesting it for so so knowing if a

6335
06:25:52,798 --> 06:25:55,020
requester is allowed to request for the

6336
06:25:55,020 --> 06:25:57,240
player ID is what we solve for the

6337
06:25:57,240 --> 06:26:01,320
authorization so our custom option here

6338
06:26:01,320 --> 06:26:04,700
that you can see is made for

6339
06:26:04,700 --> 06:26:07,378
authentication purposes to validate the

6340
06:26:07,378 --> 06:26:11,218
jot so here it's X1 platform for the

6341
06:26:11,218 --> 06:26:14,218
core and the other one that we saw

6342
06:26:14,218 --> 06:26:17,400
previously is for the white label and

6343
06:26:17,400 --> 06:26:20,700
the authorization is evaluated for now

6344
06:26:20,700 --> 06:26:23,940
for us on the core it can also be valid

6345
06:26:23,940 --> 06:26:26,820
on the on the user I mean on the white

6346
06:26:26,820 --> 06:26:29,458
label and that the validations didn't

6347
06:26:29,458 --> 06:26:32,040
completely make sense because we're

6348
06:26:32,040 --> 06:26:33,900
doing absolutely the same checks twice

6349
06:26:33,900 --> 06:26:36,180
so we ended up doing more on the core

6350
06:26:36,180 --> 06:26:38,100
and add another level of platform check

6351
06:26:38,100 --> 06:26:40,980
on the core and so you can see here a

6352
06:26:40,980 --> 06:26:42,718
custom structure

6353
06:26:42,718 --> 06:26:46,138
with a player and the player ID and

6354
06:26:46,138 --> 06:26:49,500
using a permission as player viewer on

6355
06:26:49,500 --> 06:26:53,280
the requester sorry I inverted the

6356
06:26:53,280 --> 06:26:56,520
requester ID is a player viewer on the

6357
06:26:56,520 --> 06:26:59,878
protofield player ID and so from this

6358
06:26:59,878 --> 06:27:02,840
from this authorization check

6359
06:27:02,840 --> 06:27:07,080
we make sure directly by reading our RPC

6360
06:27:07,080 --> 06:27:09,780
that there's a validation of player uh

6361
06:27:09,780 --> 06:27:12,740
player viewer needed in order to access

6362
06:27:12,740 --> 06:27:16,620
that wallet on the core

6363
06:27:16,620 --> 06:27:20,340
so in order to summarize the big

6364
06:27:20,340 --> 06:27:22,740
objective here is to delegate a lot of

6365
06:27:22,740 --> 06:27:25,200
security to be templated directly from

6366
06:27:25,200 --> 06:27:28,620
the protos use custom annotations to

6367
06:27:28,620 --> 06:27:32,340
drive at each layer of interfaces so as

6368
06:27:32,340 --> 06:27:34,798
soon as we patch or upgrade any

6369
06:27:34,798 --> 06:27:37,558
interface the security is deducted

6370
06:27:37,558 --> 06:27:40,378
automatically at different levels of

6371
06:27:40,378 --> 06:27:42,660
deployment and you don't have to

6372
06:27:42,660 --> 06:27:45,660
maintain as much once it is built the

6373
06:27:45,660 --> 06:27:47,940
problem again being you have to build it

6374
06:27:47,940 --> 06:27:51,000
or find someone who helps you get

6375
06:27:51,000 --> 06:27:53,100
through that transition of supporting

6376
06:27:53,100 --> 06:27:56,580
the templates at the different levels of

6377
06:27:56,580 --> 06:28:00,900
and so we're gonna get now into the

6378
06:28:00,900 --> 06:28:04,020
templated value that is generated I

6379
06:28:04,020 --> 06:28:05,878
won't bore you guys too much but for the

6380
06:28:05,878 --> 06:28:08,400
white label it has again the required

6381
06:28:08,400 --> 06:28:12,600
scope of the audiences the issuers but

6382
06:28:12,600 --> 06:28:15,058
more interestingly the URL is

6383
06:28:15,058 --> 06:28:17,700
automatically templated and generated

6384
06:28:17,700 --> 06:28:21,480
directly from the Proto so as a user or

6385
06:28:21,480 --> 06:28:24,420
a developer you generate your Proto and

6386
06:28:24,420 --> 06:28:27,000
all the security is deployed for you but

6387
06:28:27,000 --> 06:28:29,040
your authorization is not your

6388
06:28:29,040 --> 06:28:30,540
authorization requires a few other

6389
06:28:30,540 --> 06:28:33,180
things that will be added by

6390
06:28:33,180 --> 06:28:34,860
infrastructure later on in order to make

6391
06:28:34,860 --> 06:28:36,500
it available

6392
06:28:36,500 --> 06:28:40,798
uh that's for the white label and we're

6393
06:28:40,798 --> 06:28:43,200
gonna get rapidly into the core as you

6394
06:28:43,200 --> 06:28:45,360
can see it's very similar it's also

6395
06:28:45,360 --> 06:28:47,458
templated the infrastructure generates

6396
06:28:47,458 --> 06:28:50,520
the the URLs for for it we're using

6397
06:28:50,520 --> 06:28:53,820
Hydra from Ori in order to manage it and

6398
06:28:53,820 --> 06:28:56,040
we're using the different Scopes and

6399
06:28:56,040 --> 06:28:58,740
again the developer doesn't have to type

6400
06:28:58,740 --> 06:29:01,320
any of that most of that is generated

6401
06:29:01,320 --> 06:29:02,580
directly

6402
06:29:02,580 --> 06:29:06,180
from the the options here plus

6403
06:29:06,180 --> 06:29:08,638
deployment manifests in order to enrich

6404
06:29:08,638 --> 06:29:11,218
the authenticator's name here platform

6405
06:29:11,218 --> 06:29:14,100
GWT and here play your GWT so the

6406
06:29:14,100 --> 06:29:16,260
templates knows to look for those two

6407
06:29:16,260 --> 06:29:18,180
fields in order to enrich it for

6408
06:29:18,180 --> 06:29:21,138
automatic deployment

6409
06:29:21,540 --> 06:29:23,280
um

6410
06:29:23,280 --> 06:29:26,218
so how do we enforce

6411
06:29:26,218 --> 06:29:29,040
at the final microservice that the

6412
06:29:29,040 --> 06:29:31,680
Interceptor will always be there so

6413
06:29:31,680 --> 06:29:33,480
otherwise what's the point of doing all

6414
06:29:33,480 --> 06:29:35,878
this if it wasn't automatic so we're

6415
06:29:35,878 --> 06:29:40,558
using a templated go and code generation

6416
06:29:40,558 --> 06:29:43,260
in order to enforce that all developers

6417
06:29:43,260 --> 06:29:45,958
are following our code base and our

6418
06:29:45,958 --> 06:29:48,900
methodology so it goes from here the

6419
06:29:48,900 --> 06:29:52,020
core Interceptor to databases to

6420
06:29:52,020 --> 06:29:54,840
external services to mounted services to

6421
06:29:54,840 --> 06:29:58,440
share secrets in order to patch hundreds

6422
06:29:58,440 --> 06:30:00,298
now hundreds or thousands of

6423
06:30:00,298 --> 06:30:03,480
microservices directly by patching a

6424
06:30:03,480 --> 06:30:07,200
code gen so we can see here that the uni

6425
06:30:07,200 --> 06:30:09,780
server Interceptor is present we have a

6426
06:30:09,780 --> 06:30:13,378
value to remove the authorization if

6427
06:30:13,378 --> 06:30:16,020
need be so it's a there's a bypass that

6428
06:30:16,020 --> 06:30:18,240
is in the code but it's not available in

6429
06:30:18,240 --> 06:30:20,040
config just available for the developers

6430
06:30:20,040 --> 06:30:22,138
in their local kubernetes for the

6431
06:30:22,138 --> 06:30:23,340
authorization while they're working

6432
06:30:23,340 --> 06:30:25,558
because if they don't have the entire

6433
06:30:25,558 --> 06:30:28,920
flow they can't work if we don't add the

6434
06:30:28,920 --> 06:30:31,080
authorization engines that come later on

6435
06:30:31,080 --> 06:30:33,240
when I'm going to talk about how we

6436
06:30:33,240 --> 06:30:36,180
actually add those authorizations so

6437
06:30:36,180 --> 06:30:39,718
that's just to show that you can have an

6438
06:30:39,718 --> 06:30:41,520
enforcement that in infrastructure level

6439
06:30:41,520 --> 06:30:44,100
in their microservices by controlling

6440
06:30:44,100 --> 06:30:46,740
tightly recovered of those microservices

6441
06:30:46,740 --> 06:30:50,400
before we get to the authorization

6442
06:30:50,400 --> 06:30:54,480
and here we have the config that goes

6443
06:30:54,480 --> 06:30:56,520
along the service that we saw earlier

6444
06:30:56,520 --> 06:31:00,360
with a player player viewer this is a

6445
06:31:00,360 --> 06:31:02,340
syntax from Google from their white

6446
06:31:02,340 --> 06:31:05,360
paper from 25 2018

6447
06:31:05,360 --> 06:31:09,958
uh called Zanzibar uh vatspec was

6448
06:31:09,958 --> 06:31:11,280
described in the white paper but the

6449
06:31:11,280 --> 06:31:13,440
code is not open source so we

6450
06:31:13,440 --> 06:31:16,878
implemented the entire spec in 2020

6451
06:31:16,878 --> 06:31:20,940
as you can see here the description is

6452
06:31:20,940 --> 06:31:23,820
basically when you read it it's made to

6453
06:31:23,820 --> 06:31:27,240
expand upon the list and expand the user

6454
06:31:27,240 --> 06:31:28,920
sets in order to understand what's

6455
06:31:28,920 --> 06:31:31,138
happening so I'm gonna go I'm gonna try

6456
06:31:31,138 --> 06:31:32,700
to go slowly with you guys so you

6457
06:31:32,700 --> 06:31:35,160
understand but the objective is at the

6458
06:31:35,160 --> 06:31:37,860
end of the day to have something that's

6459
06:31:37,860 --> 06:31:40,320
a bit more easy to read for the

6460
06:31:40,320 --> 06:31:42,958
infrastructure Specialists because as a

6461
06:31:42,958 --> 06:31:45,840
developer you only see the tags that are

6462
06:31:45,840 --> 06:31:49,138
here so player viewer player editor or

6463
06:31:49,138 --> 06:31:51,058
player manager and in between mean is

6464
06:31:51,058 --> 06:31:53,218
the deduction of rules so we're going to

6465
06:31:53,218 --> 06:31:56,700
go through the simple one so the the

6466
06:31:56,700 --> 06:31:59,100
player viewer is either directly or

6467
06:31:59,100 --> 06:32:02,040
player viewer or is somebody computed

6468
06:32:02,040 --> 06:32:04,620
from a player editor so player editor is

6469
06:32:04,620 --> 06:32:07,020
also a player viewer so if you give that

6470
06:32:07,020 --> 06:32:08,700
property to someone else you'll

6471
06:32:08,700 --> 06:32:10,440
automatically get assets to player

6472
06:32:10,440 --> 06:32:11,638
viewers

6473
06:32:11,638 --> 06:32:14,298
and now a player editor is either

6474
06:32:14,298 --> 06:32:16,980
directly a player editor through the use

6475
06:32:16,980 --> 06:32:20,040
case of a of a word this this means

6476
06:32:20,040 --> 06:32:23,058
directly that the the term player editor

6477
06:32:23,058 --> 06:32:26,580
or from the computer user set from

6478
06:32:26,580 --> 06:32:28,860
player owner so if you have a property

6479
06:32:28,860 --> 06:32:31,138
player owner you're automatically a

6480
06:32:31,138 --> 06:32:33,180
player editor and automatically or play

6481
06:32:33,180 --> 06:32:35,700
your viewer and so if you start to build

6482
06:32:35,700 --> 06:32:38,280
more complex engines let's say with free

6483
06:32:38,280 --> 06:32:41,520
front-ends and hundreds of rules for us

6484
06:32:41,520 --> 06:32:43,980
it's in the order of 50 let's say 50 or

6485
06:32:43,980 --> 06:32:47,580
70 keywords on larger platforms uh it

6486
06:32:47,580 --> 06:32:49,920
it's way easier to read those terms

6487
06:32:49,920 --> 06:32:52,680
understand what those relation mean and

6488
06:32:52,680 --> 06:32:55,200
test them rather than try to build or

6489
06:32:55,200 --> 06:32:57,180
understand the larger authorization

6490
06:32:57,180 --> 06:33:01,080
that's come in play and so I've just put

6491
06:33:01,080 --> 06:33:03,780
one example of one of more interesting

6492
06:33:03,780 --> 06:33:07,740
use case so a player manager here is

6493
06:33:07,740 --> 06:33:10,740
related to a tuple set of

6494
06:33:10,740 --> 06:33:13,860
in the namespace of Master and has a

6495
06:33:13,860 --> 06:33:17,820
relationship player related to

6496
06:33:17,820 --> 06:33:20,520
so it's a master player relationship

6497
06:33:20,520 --> 06:33:22,860
that makes it a player manager so

6498
06:33:22,860 --> 06:33:25,080
basically a master that has the

6499
06:33:25,080 --> 06:33:26,600
relationship

6500
06:33:26,600 --> 06:33:32,160
player related to that player he he's

6501
06:33:32,160 --> 06:33:34,798
he's that player's manager and the

6502
06:33:34,798 --> 06:33:37,378
computed user said also applies to

6503
06:33:37,378 --> 06:33:41,040
master owner in order to the Masters

6504
06:33:41,040 --> 06:33:45,680
owner will also be players manager

6505
06:33:47,480 --> 06:33:50,458
and the big Advantage is for that

6506
06:33:50,458 --> 06:33:52,080
infrastructure developer because we

6507
06:33:52,080 --> 06:33:54,000
don't want every developer to be doing

6508
06:33:54,000 --> 06:33:56,400
this we want only two or three of your

6509
06:33:56,400 --> 06:33:58,740
developers doing this that like doing

6510
06:33:58,740 --> 06:34:01,138
and working with tuples but all the

6511
06:34:01,138 --> 06:34:02,900
other developers benefit from it

6512
06:34:02,900 --> 06:34:06,058
afterwards and so here you have your

6513
06:34:06,058 --> 06:34:07,860
developer specialist that understands

6514
06:34:07,860 --> 06:34:10,680
the tuples that defines the rules to be

6515
06:34:10,680 --> 06:34:13,378
inserted player Grant as player owner

6516
06:34:13,378 --> 06:34:16,860
grat Master otherwise label with the

6517
06:34:16,860 --> 06:34:19,378
relationship player with player grat and

6518
06:34:19,378 --> 06:34:21,620
the platform with the term white label

6519
06:34:21,620 --> 06:34:25,138
with the term active on player grad so

6520
06:34:25,138 --> 06:34:26,878
those are more complex rules that were

6521
06:34:26,878 --> 06:34:29,878
added later and this is just a subset

6522
06:34:29,878 --> 06:34:32,580
and you want you can check directly at

6523
06:34:32,580 --> 06:34:34,218
compilation time

6524
06:34:34,218 --> 06:34:37,378
of the authorization library that player

6525
06:34:37,378 --> 06:34:40,200
grad have and graph is a player viewer

6526
06:34:40,200 --> 06:34:46,500
of himself and you can check for a H you

6527
06:34:46,500 --> 06:34:48,298
can assert that other things are false

6528
06:34:48,298 --> 06:34:50,040
as well in order to make sure that your

6529
06:34:50,040 --> 06:34:52,200
validation makes sense but that's kind

6530
06:34:52,200 --> 06:34:54,840
of a big advantage of a methodology you

6531
06:34:54,840 --> 06:34:56,218
have some people specializing in

6532
06:34:56,218 --> 06:34:58,320
authorization and they manage it for

6533
06:34:58,320 --> 06:34:59,820
everyone else and you don't have to

6534
06:34:59,820 --> 06:35:02,638
manually re-verify a lot of things it's

6535
06:35:02,638 --> 06:35:04,980
handled by the infrastructure for the

6536
06:35:04,980 --> 06:35:06,718
Developers

6537
06:35:06,718 --> 06:35:10,160
and that's an example of Tuple testing

6538
06:35:10,160 --> 06:35:13,500
dedicated for those that that do this

6539
06:35:13,500 --> 06:35:18,120
and here we have an example of the

6540
06:35:18,120 --> 06:35:20,700
entire flow with a trace that's

6541
06:35:20,700 --> 06:35:23,580
happening from the the large-scale

6542
06:35:23,580 --> 06:35:24,718
infrastructure that we showed before

6543
06:35:24,718 --> 06:35:28,820
that goes down to the secondary cluster

6544
06:35:28,820 --> 06:35:32,160
so the first query comes and it takes 40

6545
06:35:32,160 --> 06:35:34,920
milliseconds it spends a bit of time

6546
06:35:34,920 --> 06:35:37,200
enough keep the first off keeper that we

6547
06:35:37,200 --> 06:35:40,200
showed earlier and then uh

6548
06:35:40,200 --> 06:35:42,660
there's evaluation at the off keeper

6549
06:35:42,660 --> 06:35:45,240
level in terms of three milliseconds it

6550
06:35:45,240 --> 06:35:47,340
gets to the get user wallet which was

6551
06:35:47,340 --> 06:35:49,920
the first call that we saw earlier at

6552
06:35:49,920 --> 06:35:52,680
the proxy level and from the proxy it

6553
06:35:52,680 --> 06:35:55,020
gets to the secondary get player if you

6554
06:35:55,020 --> 06:35:56,520
remember earlier we showed that there's

6555
06:35:56,520 --> 06:35:59,760
a discrepancy and a change at that layer

6556
06:35:59,760 --> 06:36:01,080
of a proxy

6557
06:36:01,080 --> 06:36:03,058
and from the proxy it goes to the

6558
06:36:03,058 --> 06:36:05,340
internal load balancer and the secondary

6559
06:36:05,340 --> 06:36:08,280
cluster so we get again into a cluster

6560
06:36:08,280 --> 06:36:10,620
and then there's another we have the

6561
06:36:10,620 --> 06:36:12,600
secondary off keeper it's a bit faster

6562
06:36:12,600 --> 06:36:15,540
at evaluation and then it gets to the

6563
06:36:15,540 --> 06:36:18,718
final get player wallet within the

6564
06:36:18,718 --> 06:36:21,718
microservice the internal micro service

6565
06:36:21,718 --> 06:36:24,480
that's the first part of a Trace

6566
06:36:24,480 --> 06:36:27,718
the second part of a trace is uh once we

6567
06:36:27,718 --> 06:36:29,638
get to the get player wallet it's down

6568
06:36:29,638 --> 06:36:33,600
to 23 milliseconds it performs a get the

6569
06:36:33,600 --> 06:36:35,360
check get player wallet

6570
06:36:35,360 --> 06:36:38,820
that's an internal call for Keto

6571
06:36:38,820 --> 06:36:41,218
and of internal call but as you can see

6572
06:36:41,218 --> 06:36:43,558
there are two checks the reason for

6573
06:36:43,558 --> 06:36:47,100
having two checks is uh keto is checking

6574
06:36:47,100 --> 06:36:50,878
that the player is indeed a viewer and

6575
06:36:50,878 --> 06:36:53,160
that there's a relationship a direct

6576
06:36:53,160 --> 06:36:54,840
relationship compared to the one that is

6577
06:36:54,840 --> 06:36:58,320
in keto so is a player viewer related to

6578
06:36:58,320 --> 06:37:00,840
player owner and the second check is yes

6579
06:37:00,840 --> 06:37:03,900
and so the chain is valid and the the

6580
06:37:03,900 --> 06:37:06,900
get balance is performed within the arm

6581
06:37:06,900 --> 06:37:09,780
and the user gets his query back and the

6582
06:37:09,780 --> 06:37:11,700
change propagates all the way back to

6583
06:37:11,700 --> 06:37:14,040
the front end so goes back through the

6584
06:37:14,040 --> 06:37:17,840
entire chain back to to the beginning

6585
06:37:18,718 --> 06:37:22,260
uh but one Park I didn't talk about is

6586
06:37:22,260 --> 06:37:24,180
how do you make sure that your

6587
06:37:24,180 --> 06:37:26,760
authorization are added correctly by

6588
06:37:26,760 --> 06:37:29,280
your infrastructure related to what your

6589
06:37:29,280 --> 06:37:30,660
developers are doing

6590
06:37:30,660 --> 06:37:32,700
so now we're going to talk rapidly about

6591
06:37:32,700 --> 06:37:35,180
that part

6592
06:37:35,180 --> 06:37:38,878
uh if we we're using even store DB

6593
06:37:38,878 --> 06:37:40,558
and we've even stored DB while

6594
06:37:40,558 --> 06:37:42,780
monitoring here free streams as an

6595
06:37:42,780 --> 06:37:45,958
example uh player created player

6596
06:37:45,958 --> 06:37:48,180
activated player suspended we're using

6597
06:37:48,180 --> 06:37:51,420
even sourcing so developers feed those

6598
06:37:51,420 --> 06:37:54,780
streams and this is a projection in even

6599
06:37:54,780 --> 06:37:57,420
store DB and it would automatically link

6600
06:37:57,420 --> 06:37:59,340
it to another projection or another

6601
06:37:59,340 --> 06:38:02,218
stream called authorization so for the

6602
06:38:02,218 --> 06:38:04,920
authorization his Verizon stream is

6603
06:38:04,920 --> 06:38:07,080
listening to hundreds of internal

6604
06:38:07,080 --> 06:38:08,878
streams in order to feed the

6605
06:38:08,878 --> 06:38:12,958
authorization as we show here all the

6606
06:38:12,958 --> 06:38:15,840
the platform users or the developers add

6607
06:38:15,840 --> 06:38:18,000
the different commands those commands

6608
06:38:18,000 --> 06:38:19,920
such as player created player activated

6609
06:38:19,920 --> 06:38:22,620
player suspended get into even store DB

6610
06:38:22,620 --> 06:38:25,740
in our case but you could use Kafka you

6611
06:38:25,740 --> 06:38:28,040
could use not jet stream

6612
06:38:28,040 --> 06:38:32,160
mostly even buses and the infrastructure

6613
06:38:32,160 --> 06:38:33,840
listens to all those streams that are

6614
06:38:33,840 --> 06:38:36,420
relevant to authorization and from that

6615
06:38:36,420 --> 06:38:39,900
we insert the tuples into to the

6616
06:38:39,900 --> 06:38:43,020
authorization engine and from there it

6617
06:38:43,020 --> 06:38:45,840
inserts it in alloy DB for us that part

6618
06:38:45,840 --> 06:38:49,040
is just for scalability we're using

6619
06:38:49,040 --> 06:38:51,240
large-scale databases in order to have

6620
06:38:51,240 --> 06:38:53,100
high performance there because those

6621
06:38:53,100 --> 06:38:56,040
checks are performed once on every

6622
06:38:56,040 --> 06:38:59,340
single call so it has to be performant

6623
06:38:59,340 --> 06:39:02,040
and so that's what I was talking about

6624
06:39:02,040 --> 06:39:04,500
about in terms of even sourcing

6625
06:39:04,500 --> 06:39:07,760
all our applicative services use

6626
06:39:07,760 --> 06:39:10,980
streams and all these events from all

6627
06:39:10,980 --> 06:39:14,100
the applicative side is pushed into a an

6628
06:39:14,100 --> 06:39:16,138
even sourcing you could technically do

6629
06:39:16,138 --> 06:39:18,900
it without it and only push

6630
06:39:18,900 --> 06:39:21,958
authorization as an uh as an even

6631
06:39:21,958 --> 06:39:24,120
sourcing part and keep all the rest of

6632
06:39:24,120 --> 06:39:27,958
your infrastructure normal but we did

6633
06:39:27,958 --> 06:39:30,540
the effort of doing uh even sourcing so

6634
06:39:30,540 --> 06:39:33,420
we did it on everything for us which

6635
06:39:33,420 --> 06:39:34,700
means that

6636
06:39:34,700 --> 06:39:37,740
once new events are propagated we're

6637
06:39:37,740 --> 06:39:40,920
eventually consistent the authorization

6638
06:39:40,920 --> 06:39:43,860
eh means even Handler pushes the the

6639
06:39:43,860 --> 06:39:46,458
rules for those different situations

6640
06:39:46,458 --> 06:39:49,378
into the whoops

6641
06:39:49,378 --> 06:39:54,480
into the database for keto and then vrd

6642
06:39:54,480 --> 06:39:56,700
authorization is capable of doing the

6643
06:39:56,700 --> 06:39:59,638
rule expansion and check the same keto

6644
06:39:59,638 --> 06:40:01,440
in order to make sure everything is

6645
06:40:01,440 --> 06:40:04,920
secure so with the advantages here once

6646
06:40:04,920 --> 06:40:06,900
you've put that methodology by the way

6647
06:40:06,900 --> 06:40:09,120
we're not the only ones doing that a lot

6648
06:40:09,120 --> 06:40:10,860
of the big organizations are also

6649
06:40:10,860 --> 06:40:12,718
working with large-scale authorization

6650
06:40:12,718 --> 06:40:16,080
engine it's it's the practical way to

6651
06:40:16,080 --> 06:40:18,000
solve the big issues related to

6652
06:40:18,000 --> 06:40:20,820
authorization the examples we've just

6653
06:40:20,820 --> 06:40:23,520
shown are just simple examples it can

6654
06:40:23,520 --> 06:40:26,040
get a lot more complex and honestly

6655
06:40:26,040 --> 06:40:28,558
after doing that for a while we wonder

6656
06:40:28,558 --> 06:40:31,020
how developers manage complex

6657
06:40:31,020 --> 06:40:33,240
authorization when there's seven types

6658
06:40:33,240 --> 06:40:35,520
of user groups five types of privileges

6659
06:40:35,520 --> 06:40:37,920
and delegations in between it's very

6660
06:40:37,920 --> 06:40:39,958
tough to manage rooftop also

6661
06:40:39,958 --> 06:40:42,718
I wonder how developers were doing it

6662
06:40:42,718 --> 06:40:44,700
correctly if they could do it correctly

6663
06:40:44,700 --> 06:40:46,138
back in the day

6664
06:40:46,138 --> 06:40:49,080
without even sourcing engines

6665
06:40:49,080 --> 06:40:51,600
and so this is a just a small example

6666
06:40:51,600 --> 06:40:55,280
for people to have visibility on

6667
06:40:55,280 --> 06:40:58,080
an example of stream such as player

6668
06:40:58,080 --> 06:40:59,218
created

6669
06:40:59,218 --> 06:41:00,480
uh

6670
06:41:00,480 --> 06:41:03,780
the player created stream here has all

6671
06:41:03,780 --> 06:41:06,240
the events that are associated is

6672
06:41:06,240 --> 06:41:08,638
basically for those that have never seen

6673
06:41:08,638 --> 06:41:11,458
and even stories just a stream that

6674
06:41:11,458 --> 06:41:14,718
contains all the events related to to

6675
06:41:14,718 --> 06:41:18,120
that context and so you can do that for

6676
06:41:18,120 --> 06:41:21,420
any type that you want player and any

6677
06:41:21,420 --> 06:41:24,360
type of secondary word to qualify what

6678
06:41:24,360 --> 06:41:26,400
is happening usually it's for new

6679
06:41:26,400 --> 06:41:30,600
objects like if somebody's suspended or

6680
06:41:30,600 --> 06:41:33,360
activated that's related to the

6681
06:41:33,360 --> 06:41:35,878
activation if an account is active so

6682
06:41:35,878 --> 06:41:37,740
that's why you had those those other

6683
06:41:37,740 --> 06:41:40,680
terms but you can think about dozens or

6684
06:41:40,680 --> 06:41:42,660
hundreds of use cases do we have a

6685
06:41:42,660 --> 06:41:44,360
permission to do

6686
06:41:44,360 --> 06:41:48,718
let's say modify their card obtain uh or

6687
06:41:48,718 --> 06:41:51,260
another account open another account

6688
06:41:51,260 --> 06:41:54,058
chat with somebody you can do anything

6689
06:41:54,058 --> 06:41:56,160
with the authorization that's what

6690
06:41:56,160 --> 06:41:58,200
Google is doing behind the scenes for

6691
06:41:58,200 --> 06:42:01,740
cloud storage and gcp we're using huge

6692
06:42:01,740 --> 06:42:04,020
Zanzibar engines that do billions of

6693
06:42:04,020 --> 06:42:06,660
queries per second on all the assets to

6694
06:42:06,660 --> 06:42:09,360
validate systematically this is the way

6695
06:42:09,360 --> 06:42:11,540
that we're doing kind of the same thing

6696
06:42:11,540 --> 06:42:14,940
but we've even sourcing other smaller

6697
06:42:14,940 --> 06:42:17,280
grade but the objective is to be secure

6698
06:42:17,280 --> 06:42:20,298
by default and by Design

6699
06:42:20,298 --> 06:42:23,340
with another method we use tons of other

6700
06:42:23,340 --> 06:42:25,680
services in order to do that we're just

6701
06:42:25,680 --> 06:42:29,280
doing it simpler at a smaller scale but

6702
06:42:29,280 --> 06:42:30,958
because we want security and we want

6703
06:42:30,958 --> 06:42:33,180
speed we ended up having the same

6704
06:42:33,180 --> 06:42:35,718
methodology

6705
06:42:36,240 --> 06:42:37,680
uh

6706
06:42:37,680 --> 06:42:40,080
so

6707
06:42:40,080 --> 06:42:42,860
um the what's what are the key takeaways

6708
06:42:42,860 --> 06:42:45,958
it's not easy to implement the entire

6709
06:42:45,958 --> 06:42:48,860
structure a lot of banks haven't done it

6710
06:42:48,860 --> 06:42:52,080
when you look at who has implemented it

6711
06:42:52,080 --> 06:42:53,878
mostly there are a lot of groups are

6712
06:42:53,878 --> 06:42:55,500
experimenting

6713
06:42:55,500 --> 06:42:57,958
um we are I think they're just a few

6714
06:42:57,958 --> 06:42:59,940
dozen who completely implemented it in

6715
06:42:59,940 --> 06:43:02,520
prod the methodology with authorization

6716
06:43:02,520 --> 06:43:06,780
at scale like this but we I believe that

6717
06:43:06,780 --> 06:43:10,020
it's the best way to simplify not only

6718
06:43:10,020 --> 06:43:12,298
authentication because a lot of you guys

6719
06:43:12,298 --> 06:43:14,340
are probably using authentication

6720
06:43:14,340 --> 06:43:16,980
Services it's becoming fairly standard

6721
06:43:16,980 --> 06:43:21,958
the authorization requires a lot

6722
06:43:21,958 --> 06:43:24,840
well in our opinion a lot of better

6723
06:43:24,840 --> 06:43:27,540
annotations by default as you saw the

6724
06:43:27,540 --> 06:43:29,600
rule expansion that we've shown before

6725
06:43:29,600 --> 06:43:32,940
the annotations are heavier you need the

6726
06:43:32,940 --> 06:43:34,920
structure of protobufs to directly

6727
06:43:34,920 --> 06:43:40,798
compile and obtain uh a functional a

6728
06:43:40,798 --> 06:43:42,600
functional service that implements it

6729
06:43:42,600 --> 06:43:44,160
and

6730
06:43:44,160 --> 06:43:47,040
we thought that it's not mandatory but

6731
06:43:47,040 --> 06:43:50,160
even sourcing makes it implementable so

6732
06:43:50,160 --> 06:43:51,718
if you don't have access to a lot of

6733
06:43:51,718 --> 06:43:54,600
streams coming from from your developers

6734
06:43:54,600 --> 06:43:57,958
out of their usual path if you're trying

6735
06:43:57,958 --> 06:43:59,700
to listen to a database it becomes a lot

6736
06:43:59,700 --> 06:44:02,458
more complex you can miss things whereas

6737
06:44:02,458 --> 06:44:04,798
if you're using an even store in write

6738
06:44:04,798 --> 06:44:07,138
only you get the advantage of seeing all

6739
06:44:07,138 --> 06:44:10,080
the event and even correlate for let's

6740
06:44:10,080 --> 06:44:13,378
say active let's say activate and then

6741
06:44:13,378 --> 06:44:15,298
deactivate and then reactivate and then

6742
06:44:15,298 --> 06:44:17,820
deactivate be able to act exactly follow

6743
06:44:17,820 --> 06:44:20,218
the flow if you have even sourcing and

6744
06:44:20,218 --> 06:44:22,080
you have an even Handler that that's

6745
06:44:22,080 --> 06:44:25,138
measuring both sriva at the same time it

6746
06:44:25,138 --> 06:44:27,120
can have the logic and the timestamps in

6747
06:44:27,120 --> 06:44:28,440
order to figure out figure it out

6748
06:44:28,440 --> 06:44:30,860
whereas if you do it from a database

6749
06:44:30,860 --> 06:44:33,958
discrepancy between the operations might

6750
06:44:33,958 --> 06:44:36,780
completely make it go this array so we

6751
06:44:36,780 --> 06:44:40,080
thought even sourcing really helps to to

6752
06:44:40,080 --> 06:44:43,680
do authorization in that fashion and we

6753
06:44:43,680 --> 06:44:46,920
have a big thing is your CDs need to be

6754
06:44:46,920 --> 06:44:49,378
very powerful in order to to manage

6755
06:44:49,378 --> 06:44:51,360
large fleets of microservices like that

6756
06:44:51,360 --> 06:44:53,638
because if we saw before

6757
06:44:53,638 --> 06:44:55,860
we have like seven types of

6758
06:44:55,860 --> 06:44:58,798
microservices in our infra and in order

6759
06:44:58,798 --> 06:45:01,080
to just generate a one or two services

6760
06:45:01,080 --> 06:45:03,958
at business services so you need to have

6761
06:45:03,958 --> 06:45:06,180
the capability to be very very efficient

6762
06:45:06,180 --> 06:45:09,120
in your continuous deployment where

6763
06:45:09,120 --> 06:45:11,700
almost 100 infrastructure has code on

6764
06:45:11,700 --> 06:45:13,860
that part so we deploy that's how we

6765
06:45:13,860 --> 06:45:15,540
deploy dozens to hundreds of services

6766
06:45:15,540 --> 06:45:16,700
now

6767
06:45:16,700 --> 06:45:19,980
and finally if we have if there are

6768
06:45:19,980 --> 06:45:21,740
other people that are interested in

6769
06:45:21,740 --> 06:45:24,780
behaving or going in a similar way so

6770
06:45:24,780 --> 06:45:26,580
our effort doesn't go to waste we can

6771
06:45:26,580 --> 06:45:28,378
help and particularly if you want to

6772
06:45:28,378 --> 06:45:30,840
customize your restock we have it

6773
06:45:30,840 --> 06:45:33,480
implemented for everything from

6774
06:45:33,480 --> 06:45:37,020
validating tokens to uh authorization

6775
06:45:37,020 --> 06:45:39,840
and open ID engines with Hydra to keto

6776
06:45:39,840 --> 06:45:42,660
for the authorization engine we use the

6777
06:45:42,660 --> 06:45:45,000
entire stack and we heavily collaborate

6778
06:45:45,000 --> 06:45:47,878
with your regroup for that part

6779
06:45:47,878 --> 06:45:52,980
and again pivotal and pivotal.tech for

6780
06:45:52,980 --> 06:45:56,400
our libraries I hope you enjoyed the

6781
06:45:56,400 --> 06:45:58,820
talk

6782
06:46:04,458 --> 06:46:06,378
foreign

6783
06:46:06,378 --> 06:46:09,000
so we actually have a bit of time for

6784
06:46:09,000 --> 06:46:10,558
questions so if you have any questions

6785
06:46:10,558 --> 06:46:12,480
you can raise your hand or you can put

6786
06:46:12,480 --> 06:46:16,160
them on slido and I'll read them

6787
06:46:20,458 --> 06:46:24,079
I'll just check the website

6788
06:46:42,240 --> 06:46:45,680
any questions don't be shy

6789
06:46:46,378 --> 06:46:48,240
oh

6790
06:46:48,240 --> 06:46:51,718
thanks thanks Ashley

6791
06:46:54,210 --> 06:46:57,290
[Applause]

6792
06:47:03,360 --> 06:47:06,138
mute

6793
07:00:41,218 --> 07:00:44,218
mm-hmm

6794
07:00:56,580 --> 07:00:58,798
one two

6795
07:00:58,798 --> 07:01:01,458
how much

6796
07:01:03,540 --> 07:01:06,240
all right

6797
07:01:06,240 --> 07:01:09,420
so welcome to the last scheduled Talk of

6798
07:01:09,420 --> 07:01:13,080
the day uh so nicaraguar has been

6799
07:01:13,080 --> 07:01:16,798
auditing web apps for 20 years he is an

6800
07:01:16,798 --> 07:01:18,920
official bird feed Pro trainer since

6801
07:01:18,920 --> 07:01:22,620
2015. there's a training uh next week

6802
07:01:22,620 --> 07:01:26,458
next week uh so he trained thousands of

6803
07:01:26,458 --> 07:01:29,240
people privately publicly

6804
07:01:29,240 --> 07:01:32,218
other than that he runs agree a one-man

6805
07:01:32,218 --> 07:01:33,600
business where he looks for security

6806
07:01:33,600 --> 07:01:36,378
vulnerabilities for clients and for fun

6807
07:01:36,378 --> 07:01:39,120
is public talks covering many subjects

6808
07:01:39,120 --> 07:01:44,760
like ssrf XS xslt burp suit and all many

6809
07:01:44,760 --> 07:01:46,558
subjects have been presented at numerous

6810
07:01:46,558 --> 07:01:49,620
conferences around the world we're very

6811
07:01:49,620 --> 07:01:51,900
happy to have you nicara so take it away

6812
07:01:51,900 --> 07:01:54,740
thanks

6813
07:01:55,680 --> 07:01:56,480
thank you

6814
07:01:56,480 --> 07:01:59,709
[Applause]

6815
07:02:00,660 --> 07:02:03,718
hi it's a pleasure to be here uh once

6816
07:02:03,718 --> 07:02:06,920
again I think that my third edition

6817
07:02:06,920 --> 07:02:10,920
so I did a similar talk 10 years ago

6818
07:02:10,920 --> 07:02:14,820
like plenty of tips so luckily we have a

6819
07:02:14,820 --> 07:02:18,718
different one content for this year so

6820
07:02:18,718 --> 07:02:21,660
quickly introducing myself I'm French

6821
07:02:21,660 --> 07:02:25,458
you probably noticed the accent already

6822
07:02:25,458 --> 07:02:28,978
I own a company like a one guy company

6823
07:02:28,978 --> 07:02:32,760
and I said during the introduction I'm

6824
07:02:32,760 --> 07:02:35,478
official Bob sweet training partner

6825
07:02:35,478 --> 07:02:38,400
mostly for Europe but given I love

6826
07:02:38,400 --> 07:02:41,340
Canada so if I have customers in Canada

6827
07:02:41,340 --> 07:02:45,600
that will be welcome and I trained

6828
07:02:45,600 --> 07:02:49,320
nearly 100 people a year so that's a lot

6829
07:02:49,320 --> 07:02:53,340
of uh I mean anyway you are here for the

6830
07:02:53,340 --> 07:02:57,780
trips the tips so what is the plan first

6831
07:02:57,780 --> 07:03:00,718
I have a few tips for core tools so

6832
07:03:00,718 --> 07:03:05,160
tours which are here by default then I

6833
07:03:05,160 --> 07:03:07,798
will discuss a few extensions then I

6834
07:03:07,798 --> 07:03:11,218
have a few other subjects depending on

6835
07:03:11,218 --> 07:03:15,780
the time left and and after that we have

6836
07:03:15,780 --> 07:03:19,558
beers and the CTF and enjoying Montreal

6837
07:03:19,558 --> 07:03:21,298
by itself

6838
07:03:21,298 --> 07:03:26,239
so regarding proxy story

6839
07:03:27,420 --> 07:03:31,620
my point is to be as lazy as possible so

6840
07:03:31,620 --> 07:03:33,958
if I have to scroll through the results

6841
07:03:33,958 --> 07:03:37,320
that probably use less and I want to

6842
07:03:37,320 --> 07:03:41,458
avoid that and if we look at Birth

6843
07:03:41,458 --> 07:03:45,478
Street the default sorting order in

6844
07:03:45,478 --> 07:03:49,680
proxy story is the oldest on top so you

6845
07:03:49,680 --> 07:03:52,680
are constantly scrolling and scrolling

6846
07:03:52,680 --> 07:03:55,978
to the newest content so the solution is

6847
07:03:55,978 --> 07:03:59,040
super easy you can simply double click

6848
07:03:59,040 --> 07:04:03,420
here have the newest entries on top and

6849
07:04:03,420 --> 07:04:07,080
that's quite comfortable it also work

6850
07:04:07,080 --> 07:04:11,580
for Luger you can apply the same sorting

6851
07:04:11,580 --> 07:04:14,718
and Logo plus plus two

6852
07:04:14,718 --> 07:04:17,760
in short if you are scrolling to see the

6853
07:04:17,760 --> 07:04:20,458
new results you probably have to change

6854
07:04:20,458 --> 07:04:24,020
the Sorting criteria

6855
07:04:25,860 --> 07:04:29,820
um okay second problem in proxy story

6856
07:04:29,820 --> 07:04:33,660
you want to map a specific action like

6857
07:04:33,660 --> 07:04:36,240
clicking clicking on the button in a

6858
07:04:36,240 --> 07:04:39,600
mobile app or following a link to a

6859
07:04:39,600 --> 07:04:43,378
specific set of resources so what I do

6860
07:04:43,378 --> 07:04:45,958
for example in proxy story

6861
07:04:45,958 --> 07:04:51,478
I will tag the topmost entry then I will

6862
07:04:51,478 --> 07:04:55,080
I will do something like

6863
07:04:55,080 --> 07:04:58,740
I don't know uh accessing a website a

6864
07:04:58,740 --> 07:05:03,360
complex one like solar and uh here I can

6865
07:05:03,360 --> 07:05:06,298
easily map so everything Which is higher

6866
07:05:06,298 --> 07:05:09,798
than the gray line is related to my

6867
07:05:09,798 --> 07:05:13,740
latest action and a variant of this

6868
07:05:13,740 --> 07:05:16,378
strategy is that I will intercept the

6869
07:05:16,378 --> 07:05:18,260
traffic

6870
07:05:18,260 --> 07:05:22,620
access a specific host

6871
07:05:22,620 --> 07:05:26,458
switch back to proxy and here I can

6872
07:05:26,458 --> 07:05:29,760
color colorize directly from this menu

6873
07:05:29,760 --> 07:05:34,920
so it's uh the same outcome but with a

6874
07:05:34,920 --> 07:05:37,878
different workflow and I switch back to

6875
07:05:37,878 --> 07:05:41,940
proxy story and I can see the first the

6876
07:05:41,940 --> 07:05:48,020
very first request is gray green sorry

6877
07:05:48,120 --> 07:05:50,780
okay is that some big enough stuff

6878
07:05:50,780 --> 07:05:54,739
let's discuss repeater

6879
07:05:57,600 --> 07:06:00,180
so in repeater on the left we have the

6880
07:06:00,180 --> 07:06:01,978
request on the right we have the

6881
07:06:01,978 --> 07:06:04,500
response and quite often we are

6882
07:06:04,500 --> 07:06:08,040
interested in a specific location of the

6883
07:06:08,040 --> 07:06:11,870
response so I have an example for that

6884
07:06:11,870 --> 07:06:14,458
[Music]

6885
07:06:14,458 --> 07:06:15,798
okay

6886
07:06:15,798 --> 07:06:19,740
scroll too much okay this is a web good

6887
07:06:19,740 --> 07:06:23,160
so that's a venewable web app

6888
07:06:23,160 --> 07:06:27,058
we can see here and this parameter is

6889
07:06:27,058 --> 07:06:30,120
used in a command and the command is

6890
07:06:30,120 --> 07:06:31,520
outputted

6891
07:06:31,520 --> 07:06:35,600
somewhere in the result in the response

6892
07:06:35,600 --> 07:06:38,298
so the

6893
07:06:38,298 --> 07:06:41,100
less efficient strategy would be to

6894
07:06:41,100 --> 07:06:44,360
scroll and simply go to the location

6895
07:06:44,360 --> 07:06:47,218
something a little bit better would be

6896
07:06:47,218 --> 07:06:51,260
to search you can see at the at the

6897
07:06:51,260 --> 07:06:54,600
bottom I can go directly to this and

6898
07:06:54,600 --> 07:06:58,620
three but every time I send a new

6899
07:06:58,620 --> 07:07:01,200
request I have to scroll again

6900
07:07:01,200 --> 07:07:06,080
so behind the Cog you have this entry

6901
07:07:06,080 --> 07:07:10,040
and then the response will be scrolled

6902
07:07:10,040 --> 07:07:13,260
every time you have a new content so if

6903
07:07:13,260 --> 07:07:16,920
I submit my request I go directly to the

6904
07:07:16,920 --> 07:07:19,978
location I'm interested in so I don't

6905
07:07:19,978 --> 07:07:22,680
need to scroll and I don't need to spend

6906
07:07:22,680 --> 07:07:25,920
any time looking at the I mean looking

6907
07:07:25,920 --> 07:07:30,260
for the interesting piece of data

6908
07:07:32,000 --> 07:07:36,798
uh what else uh since a few

6909
07:07:36,798 --> 07:07:41,878
years or months we can create colors uh

6910
07:07:41,878 --> 07:07:45,840
I mean create groups and uh put uh

6911
07:07:45,840 --> 07:07:48,660
repeater tabs inside groups so that's

6912
07:07:48,660 --> 07:07:51,298
very uh useful

6913
07:07:51,298 --> 07:07:53,940
um a related feature which is little

6914
07:07:53,940 --> 07:07:59,878
known uh is the odd key for search or

6915
07:07:59,878 --> 07:08:03,718
search tabs exactly and I use Ctrl shift

6916
07:08:03,718 --> 07:08:08,040
s and we get a list of all tabs so we

6917
07:08:08,040 --> 07:08:09,978
can just

6918
07:08:09,978 --> 07:08:14,340
navigate using the up and down key and

6919
07:08:14,340 --> 07:08:18,478
if I type some text like Piper I see

6920
07:08:18,478 --> 07:08:21,120
directly the and only the relevant

6921
07:08:21,120 --> 07:08:25,280
entries so when you have 50 or 80

6922
07:08:25,280 --> 07:08:28,740
entries that's very very useful of

6923
07:08:28,740 --> 07:08:31,500
course you need to put correct names but

6924
07:08:31,500 --> 07:08:35,840
I mean you probably have to do it anyway

6925
07:08:36,540 --> 07:08:40,700
okay let's discuss intruder

6926
07:08:42,420 --> 07:08:45,840
in in burp Street Pro and not in the

6927
07:08:45,840 --> 07:08:48,718
community version there's uh some

6928
07:08:48,718 --> 07:08:52,680
interesting features uh in Intruder when

6929
07:08:52,680 --> 07:08:56,120
you are using simple lists as I do here

6930
07:08:56,120 --> 07:09:00,000
you have a menu uh top uh drop down menu

6931
07:09:00,000 --> 07:09:04,798
with a plenty of word lists and so

6932
07:09:04,798 --> 07:09:08,520
that's useful by itself and it's

6933
07:09:08,520 --> 07:09:11,580
possible to customize the word list so

6934
07:09:11,580 --> 07:09:14,760
from the menu bar I go to configure

6935
07:09:14,760 --> 07:09:18,000
predefined payload list and here I have

6936
07:09:18,000 --> 07:09:21,180
I can use the built-in this is a default

6937
07:09:21,180 --> 07:09:24,378
value or point to a specific directory

6938
07:09:24,378 --> 07:09:27,058
that's what I do here

6939
07:09:27,058 --> 07:09:30,540
there we go and now I go to the same

6940
07:09:30,540 --> 07:09:33,600
menu and I have only my own word list

6941
07:09:33,600 --> 07:09:37,740
and if I want my own plus the built-in

6942
07:09:37,740 --> 07:09:40,978
ones I can go back to the same menu

6943
07:09:40,978 --> 07:09:42,378
and

6944
07:09:42,378 --> 07:09:46,798
click on copy which should be export or

6945
07:09:46,798 --> 07:09:48,058
dump

6946
07:09:48,058 --> 07:09:51,298
and that will extract the built-in word

6947
07:09:51,298 --> 07:09:54,120
list directly to my other Drive

6948
07:09:54,120 --> 07:09:58,280
so it takes a few seconds here we go

6949
07:10:00,298 --> 07:10:02,878
and now I have the built-in work list on

6950
07:10:02,878 --> 07:10:07,740
top and at the very end my uh my own

6951
07:10:07,740 --> 07:10:10,700
word list

6952
07:10:10,990 --> 07:10:11,280
[Music]

6953
07:10:11,280 --> 07:10:13,280
um

6954
07:10:14,218 --> 07:10:17,940
yeah yeah what else so this feature the

6955
07:10:17,940 --> 07:10:20,218
fact that we can customize the word list

6956
07:10:20,218 --> 07:10:24,058
and there's a built-in list that's very

6957
07:10:24,058 --> 07:10:28,978
nice let's say something uh negative uh

6958
07:10:28,978 --> 07:10:30,080
no

6959
07:10:30,080 --> 07:10:34,558
sales Place orders in word list so let

6960
07:10:34,558 --> 07:10:36,978
me show you them

6961
07:10:36,978 --> 07:10:40,378
uh if I use

6962
07:10:40,378 --> 07:10:42,900
a fuzzing full

6963
07:10:42,900 --> 07:10:48,180
you can see base here and if we go below

6964
07:10:48,180 --> 07:10:53,040
we can see your email here or your

6965
07:10:53,040 --> 07:10:56,820
server name here and if you want to

6966
07:10:56,820 --> 07:11:00,000
fully use a word list you need of course

6967
07:11:00,000 --> 07:11:04,040
to replace these values with real ones

6968
07:11:04,040 --> 07:11:07,458
and there's a few

6969
07:11:07,458 --> 07:11:10,620
payload processing options relevant to

6970
07:11:10,620 --> 07:11:12,180
this feature

6971
07:11:12,180 --> 07:11:13,680
uh

6972
07:11:13,680 --> 07:11:16,620
uh so you on the screenshot you see the

6973
07:11:16,620 --> 07:11:20,040
first one will replace the base with the

6974
07:11:20,040 --> 07:11:22,978
base value starting positions domain

6975
07:11:22,978 --> 07:11:26,280
will use a unique uh collaborator auth

6976
07:11:26,280 --> 07:11:29,820
name and for all the other placeholders

6977
07:11:29,820 --> 07:11:33,478
you need uh to customize manually so

6978
07:11:33,478 --> 07:11:36,240
here I will replace file with Etc

6979
07:11:36,240 --> 07:11:39,780
password and your email with my own

6980
07:11:39,780 --> 07:11:43,440
email address uh it's currently a mess

6981
07:11:43,440 --> 07:11:46,920
as you can see and as listed on the

6982
07:11:46,920 --> 07:11:50,520
previous Slide the syntax

6983
07:11:50,520 --> 07:11:53,638
uh we we have curly brackets versus

6984
07:11:53,638 --> 07:11:57,240
angle brackets and we have File versus

6985
07:11:57,240 --> 07:12:01,200
known file so the they have to clean

6986
07:12:01,200 --> 07:12:05,340
that but in all in all cases we have to

6987
07:12:05,340 --> 07:12:11,000
manipulate manually replace the values

6988
07:12:14,520 --> 07:12:17,340
and I think that plenty of bugs were

6989
07:12:17,340 --> 07:12:21,298
missed just because uh users were

6990
07:12:21,298 --> 07:12:24,000
looking for dot dot slash dot dot slash

6991
07:12:24,000 --> 07:12:27,420
dot dot file between curly bracket and

6992
07:12:27,420 --> 07:12:32,420
never finding the real file of course

6993
07:12:32,638 --> 07:12:36,540
okay uh something about collaborator so

6994
07:12:36,540 --> 07:12:39,958
good boyto is a way to get a

6995
07:12:39,958 --> 07:12:42,600
notification notifications from the web

6996
07:12:42,600 --> 07:12:47,160
app and a very common assumption is that

6997
07:12:47,160 --> 07:12:50,040
if you want to get a collabot or ping

6998
07:12:50,040 --> 07:12:53,040
back you must use the collaborator

6999
07:12:53,040 --> 07:12:56,580
domain name and we will simplify we will

7000
07:12:56,580 --> 07:12:59,700
consider only the public collaboratory

7001
07:12:59,700 --> 07:13:04,020
server so uh is this assumption really

7002
07:13:04,020 --> 07:13:06,840
true that's the question and you can

7003
07:13:06,840 --> 07:13:09,540
imagine that if the answer would be yes

7004
07:13:09,540 --> 07:13:13,320
I would not have this content in my

7005
07:13:13,320 --> 07:13:17,580
slides so the answer is no or it depends

7006
07:13:17,580 --> 07:13:22,320
for DNS pink box you must use the

7007
07:13:22,320 --> 07:13:25,320
collaborator domain name for HTTP

7008
07:13:25,320 --> 07:13:28,620
interactions you can use any domain name

7009
07:13:28,620 --> 07:13:33,978
as long as it points to the correct IPS

7010
07:13:34,860 --> 07:13:38,218
um I could do it live but uh I mean I

7011
07:13:38,218 --> 07:13:41,580
did I did it live five minutes ago

7012
07:13:41,580 --> 07:13:44,520
um I will uh take a collaborator of name

7013
07:13:44,520 --> 07:13:47,878
so that's the public server and that's

7014
07:13:47,878 --> 07:13:52,320
my collaborator uh ID or uh host name

7015
07:13:52,320 --> 07:13:55,920
and it points to several IP addresses

7016
07:13:55,920 --> 07:14:01,920
but we will uh use this one 454.77

7017
07:14:01,920 --> 07:14:05,900
Etc and we will use another domain name

7018
07:14:05,900 --> 07:14:11,160
resolving to the same IP so uh nip.io is

7019
07:14:11,160 --> 07:14:14,458
a free service and this is the IP

7020
07:14:14,458 --> 07:14:18,298
address X encoded and this is just a

7021
07:14:18,298 --> 07:14:20,280
random string I mean not so Random of

7022
07:14:20,280 --> 07:14:22,320
course

7023
07:14:22,320 --> 07:14:24,840
so we are a domain name we have a domain

7024
07:14:24,840 --> 07:14:27,660
name pointing to the collaborator IP

7025
07:14:27,660 --> 07:14:29,478
address

7026
07:14:29,478 --> 07:14:34,260
and my oath name is RSN

7027
07:14:34,260 --> 07:14:38,160
etc etc and it works so Place

7028
07:14:38,160 --> 07:14:41,400
surprisingly well here I will simply

7029
07:14:41,400 --> 07:14:45,120
access collaborator via my own domain

7030
07:14:45,120 --> 07:14:49,700
name and put my collaborator auth name

7031
07:14:49,700 --> 07:14:53,940
directly in the bus it could be in a

7032
07:14:53,940 --> 07:14:56,100
parameter name it could be an operator

7033
07:14:56,100 --> 07:14:59,160
in a parameter of value and as you can

7034
07:14:59,160 --> 07:15:02,600
see the interaction is correctly

7035
07:15:02,600 --> 07:15:07,040
linked to my own instance of burp Suite

7036
07:15:07,040 --> 07:15:11,160
we can see here RSN this is my

7037
07:15:11,160 --> 07:15:12,558
collaborator

7038
07:15:12,558 --> 07:15:17,340
ID and we can do I mean there's plenty

7039
07:15:17,340 --> 07:15:22,558
of ways that's another one oops my bad I

7040
07:15:22,558 --> 07:15:27,000
use my collaborator ID as a user agent

7041
07:15:27,000 --> 07:15:31,200
and once again the traffic is correctly

7042
07:15:31,200 --> 07:15:36,420
correlated to my own interactions and I

7043
07:15:36,420 --> 07:15:38,878
mean if the replication firewall is

7044
07:15:38,878 --> 07:15:41,760
looking for the domain name here there's

7045
07:15:41,760 --> 07:15:44,700
no way to find it okay so we have a

7046
07:15:44,700 --> 07:15:49,520
clean bypass in in most situations

7047
07:15:51,718 --> 07:15:55,920
okay let's discuss extensions hagvertor

7048
07:15:55,920 --> 07:15:58,080
is a Swiss knife like you can do

7049
07:15:58,080 --> 07:16:00,080
whatever you want

7050
07:16:00,080 --> 07:16:06,420
it's XML or similar to XML tags and you

7051
07:16:06,420 --> 07:16:09,240
can change them so you can apply several

7052
07:16:09,240 --> 07:16:10,340
transformation

7053
07:16:10,340 --> 07:16:16,200
on the Fly and that's a basic example

7054
07:16:16,200 --> 07:16:16,798
um

7055
07:16:16,798 --> 07:16:20,120
here we have a string and we will

7056
07:16:20,120 --> 07:16:24,558
compress the string and the resulting

7057
07:16:24,558 --> 07:16:26,180
binaries

7058
07:16:26,180 --> 07:16:30,840
data will be basically for encoded and

7059
07:16:30,840 --> 07:16:33,600
we get something like that

7060
07:16:33,600 --> 07:16:36,378
so that's a minimalist example

7061
07:16:36,378 --> 07:16:40,558
we can generate fake data and that's

7062
07:16:40,558 --> 07:16:43,440
very useful when you have to generate a

7063
07:16:43,440 --> 07:16:47,458
unique uh values if you are creating

7064
07:16:47,458 --> 07:16:53,100
users or let's say files via an API you

7065
07:16:53,100 --> 07:16:55,440
probably have to provide unique file

7066
07:16:55,440 --> 07:16:58,860
names or unique usernames and you can

7067
07:16:58,860 --> 07:17:02,520
use the fake

7068
07:17:02,520 --> 07:17:05,900
fake high care fake book fake company

7069
07:17:05,900 --> 07:17:10,400
Tax in order to generate uh like

7070
07:17:10,400 --> 07:17:14,580
valid data but a random one like in this

7071
07:17:14,580 --> 07:17:17,940
example I'm just asking for sentences

7072
07:17:17,940 --> 07:17:23,160
and we get a few sentences generated on

7073
07:17:23,160 --> 07:17:25,458
the Fly

7074
07:17:25,558 --> 07:17:30,540
we can go to more complex solution here

7075
07:17:30,540 --> 07:17:31,878
I will

7076
07:17:31,878 --> 07:17:34,920
anchored my email address

7077
07:17:34,920 --> 07:17:39,260
and put that in a viable called email

7078
07:17:39,260 --> 07:17:43,798
and the flag ear means the variable is

7079
07:17:43,798 --> 07:17:46,680
global so we can reuse it anywhere in

7080
07:17:46,680 --> 07:17:49,020
burp in a different Tab in a different

7081
07:17:49,020 --> 07:17:53,760
tool and somewhere else possibly in a

7082
07:17:53,760 --> 07:17:59,940
intruder I will get my viable and maybe

7083
07:17:59,940 --> 07:18:03,540
iterate on UAG for example and

7084
07:18:03,540 --> 07:18:08,940
everything is in a JWT tag and

7085
07:18:08,940 --> 07:18:13,500
um will generate tokens on the fly so as

7086
07:18:13,500 --> 07:18:15,660
soon as you are you have been able to

7087
07:18:15,660 --> 07:18:19,080
leak the secret key you can generate

7088
07:18:19,080 --> 07:18:22,860
tokens on the Fly simply using Intruder

7089
07:18:22,860 --> 07:18:26,340
Plus hackverter

7090
07:18:26,760 --> 07:18:31,378
uh if if there's anybody doing a HTTP

7091
07:18:31,378 --> 07:18:35,040
smuggling uh you probably know that uh

7092
07:18:35,040 --> 07:18:38,878
managing size uh is a mess because we

7093
07:18:38,878 --> 07:18:41,700
have usually two size and we need to

7094
07:18:41,700 --> 07:18:45,660
manage them dynamically so uh it's a

7095
07:18:45,660 --> 07:18:48,420
complex hack virtual setup but it does

7096
07:18:48,420 --> 07:18:50,000
exactly that

7097
07:18:50,000 --> 07:18:53,840
we have some text here in the middle

7098
07:18:53,840 --> 07:18:57,860
and on the line above we will get the

7099
07:18:57,860 --> 07:19:01,260
hexadecimal size of the chunk

7100
07:19:01,260 --> 07:19:04,620
and here in content lens we will have

7101
07:19:04,620 --> 07:19:07,920
the size of the size so the length of

7102
07:19:07,920 --> 07:19:11,780
the size plus two using the arithmetic

7103
07:19:11,780 --> 07:19:15,420
uh tag and I think I have a

7104
07:19:15,420 --> 07:19:18,019
demonstration

7105
07:19:18,478 --> 07:19:22,820
not sure if you can read anything

7106
07:19:22,978 --> 07:19:25,080
can you read something

7107
07:19:25,080 --> 07:19:28,620
yeah okay because uh hagverto we can't

7108
07:19:28,620 --> 07:19:30,840
set the font size so that's a problem

7109
07:19:30,840 --> 07:19:33,958
but as you can see here I have a short

7110
07:19:33,958 --> 07:19:37,740
string the size is eight

7111
07:19:37,740 --> 07:19:42,420
air and the content length is three but

7112
07:19:42,420 --> 07:19:45,958
if I add some characters

7113
07:19:45,958 --> 07:19:50,400
okay we can see that now the size is 26

7114
07:19:50,400 --> 07:19:54,180
so that's one extra character and the

7115
07:19:54,180 --> 07:19:58,020
content lens is now four instead of

7116
07:19:58,020 --> 07:20:02,400
three that looks like uh nothing but

7117
07:20:02,400 --> 07:20:06,000
then you can pay your attention to this

7118
07:20:06,000 --> 07:20:08,700
section because maybe you are exploiting

7119
07:20:08,700 --> 07:20:10,920
a complex bug and you don't want to

7120
07:20:10,920 --> 07:20:12,978
spend any brain power

7121
07:20:12,978 --> 07:20:17,478
managing the size manually

7122
07:20:19,200 --> 07:20:22,020
and we we can go very fast so I will

7123
07:20:22,020 --> 07:20:25,680
stop giving example uh uh yes that's a

7124
07:20:25,680 --> 07:20:28,138
specific application where you need to

7125
07:20:28,138 --> 07:20:30,840
sign the body of the request with the

7126
07:20:30,840 --> 07:20:33,840
csrf token and that could be done on the

7127
07:20:33,840 --> 07:20:36,600
fly with hikeverter

7128
07:20:36,600 --> 07:20:38,940
okay and there's much more we can

7129
07:20:38,940 --> 07:20:41,820
execute python code we can execute a

7130
07:20:41,820 --> 07:20:45,958
system command like cat whatever uh

7131
07:20:45,958 --> 07:20:49,860
we can access the execution context so

7132
07:20:49,860 --> 07:20:53,040
we can have the URL the value of a

7133
07:20:53,040 --> 07:20:56,160
specific parameter I mean that's uh I

7134
07:20:56,160 --> 07:20:58,680
mean the more time you spend with high

7135
07:20:58,680 --> 07:21:01,020
virtors the more you like it it's really

7136
07:21:01,020 --> 07:21:02,878
good

7137
07:21:02,878 --> 07:21:07,500
uh there's a big disadvantage uh using

7138
07:21:07,500 --> 07:21:10,740
tags will break uh burps in tax passing

7139
07:21:10,740 --> 07:21:16,138
and that has a few side effects but

7140
07:21:16,138 --> 07:21:16,920
um

7141
07:21:16,920 --> 07:21:19,680
yeah we don't really care like it's uh

7142
07:21:19,680 --> 07:21:22,558
not uh something that will uh forbid us

7143
07:21:22,558 --> 07:21:24,840
to use the extension

7144
07:21:24,840 --> 07:21:29,878
okay Piper I need to go quite fast so uh

7145
07:21:29,878 --> 07:21:33,900
Piper the ID is uh interesting you can

7146
07:21:33,900 --> 07:21:36,660
execute anything running on your

7147
07:21:36,660 --> 07:21:40,200
workstation or laptop directly in burp

7148
07:21:40,200 --> 07:21:42,780
so it could be an interpreter like

7149
07:21:42,780 --> 07:21:46,680
python it could be any command line or

7150
07:21:46,680 --> 07:21:50,940
GUI application you have locally

7151
07:21:50,940 --> 07:21:53,400
so I have a few examples

7152
07:21:53,400 --> 07:21:54,600
uh

7153
07:21:54,600 --> 07:21:58,699
uh let's switch to uh

7154
07:21:59,520 --> 07:22:00,900
um

7155
07:22:00,900 --> 07:22:03,440
okay

7156
07:22:04,558 --> 07:22:08,878
so uh on the right I have the response

7157
07:22:08,878 --> 07:22:12,478
which is a Big Blob of Json data and I

7158
07:22:12,478 --> 07:22:16,680
want to make sense of the data so in

7159
07:22:16,680 --> 07:22:21,740
Piper I will enable the grown entry and

7160
07:22:21,740 --> 07:22:25,260
the configuration is very basic

7161
07:22:25,260 --> 07:22:30,360
if the body start with a square or curly

7162
07:22:30,360 --> 07:22:34,680
bracket then I pass the response body to

7163
07:22:34,680 --> 07:22:38,340
gron and the result appears directly in

7164
07:22:38,340 --> 07:22:42,780
burp and that's all that's all we need

7165
07:22:42,780 --> 07:22:45,440
here I have a new

7166
07:22:45,440 --> 07:22:49,680
tab here labeled grown and if I click

7167
07:22:49,680 --> 07:22:54,718
there I see the response body process by

7168
07:22:54,718 --> 07:22:56,820
ground and I have nothing else to do

7169
07:22:56,820 --> 07:23:00,058
just Define a filter and Define which

7170
07:23:00,058 --> 07:23:03,718
command should be executed

7171
07:23:03,718 --> 07:23:07,978
uh uh if you prefer let's say JQ you can

7172
07:23:07,978 --> 07:23:10,020
we could have exactly the same config

7173
07:23:10,020 --> 07:23:12,920
for JQ

7174
07:23:14,360 --> 07:23:19,500
uh that that was grown and uh okura so

7175
07:23:19,500 --> 07:23:22,978
okura is a PDF reader but we don't

7176
07:23:22,978 --> 07:23:25,798
really mind okay any uh PDF reader will

7177
07:23:25,798 --> 07:23:29,820
work and uh we have a simile a similar

7178
07:23:29,820 --> 07:23:33,600
configuration if the response uh start

7179
07:23:33,600 --> 07:23:36,620
with a PDF uh tag

7180
07:23:36,620 --> 07:23:43,020
PDF magic then we enable a PDF reader in

7181
07:23:43,020 --> 07:23:46,020
the contextual menu so here I can go to

7182
07:23:46,020 --> 07:23:51,240
extension Piper and uh given we have the

7183
07:23:51,240 --> 07:23:54,240
PDF magic I can directly open the

7184
07:23:54,240 --> 07:23:58,218
response in a file viewer so if you are

7185
07:23:58,218 --> 07:24:02,040
processing a lot of complex files it's

7186
07:24:02,040 --> 07:24:05,520
very efficient compared to exporting to

7187
07:24:05,520 --> 07:24:08,940
file removing the headers changing the

7188
07:24:08,940 --> 07:24:11,700
extension etc etc

7189
07:24:11,700 --> 07:24:16,638
and the last demonstration for Piper

7190
07:24:16,638 --> 07:24:20,280
uh we will use uh we will compare some

7191
07:24:20,280 --> 07:24:21,718
entries

7192
07:24:21,718 --> 07:24:26,160
so I'm not very happy with the built-in

7193
07:24:26,160 --> 07:24:27,378
comparer

7194
07:24:27,378 --> 07:24:32,240
and I will take a

7195
07:24:32,240 --> 07:24:37,500
few uh sorry three requests so the three

7196
07:24:37,500 --> 07:24:40,378
uh yellow ones here

7197
07:24:40,378 --> 07:24:44,878
right click and if the menu

7198
07:24:44,878 --> 07:24:49,740
uh will appear only if we have two or

7199
07:24:49,740 --> 07:24:52,978
three entries because meld can compare

7200
07:24:52,978 --> 07:24:55,978
two or three files and I will compare

7201
07:24:55,978 --> 07:24:58,620
the requests

7202
07:24:58,620 --> 07:25:02,760
and I get directly the files I mean the

7203
07:25:02,760 --> 07:25:06,600
traffic saved to to disk and we can see

7204
07:25:06,600 --> 07:25:09,080
the file names here temporary file names

7205
07:25:09,080 --> 07:25:12,840
and uh the mail the command line is

7206
07:25:12,840 --> 07:25:16,500
generated on the Fly then executed so

7207
07:25:16,500 --> 07:25:20,400
that's very very convenient

7208
07:25:20,878 --> 07:25:22,520
okay

7209
07:25:22,520 --> 07:25:27,558
it's an extension used to write your own

7210
07:25:27,558 --> 07:25:31,200
scanning check but I think it will die

7211
07:25:31,200 --> 07:25:34,620
soon because we have a core feature

7212
07:25:34,620 --> 07:25:38,360
called B checks that should be

7213
07:25:38,360 --> 07:25:41,840
deployed I mean released in a few weeks

7214
07:25:41,840 --> 07:25:45,058
and then you have a scripting language

7215
07:25:45,058 --> 07:25:48,240
and you can Define your your payload

7216
07:25:48,240 --> 07:25:50,940
here I mean your attack then you define

7217
07:25:50,940 --> 07:25:54,660
O2 identify a vulnerability and you have

7218
07:25:54,660 --> 07:25:57,600
some meta information here and I hope

7219
07:25:57,600 --> 07:26:01,740
the community will share this kind of uh

7220
07:26:01,740 --> 07:26:03,978
of recipes

7221
07:26:03,978 --> 07:26:07,200
uh like publicly and you have a link to

7222
07:26:07,200 --> 07:26:10,378
a video describing the feature uh in the

7223
07:26:10,378 --> 07:26:11,580
nuts

7224
07:26:11,580 --> 07:26:15,138
uh what else uh I need to go very fast

7225
07:26:15,138 --> 07:26:18,840
uh keyboard shortcuts keyboard shortcuts

7226
07:26:18,840 --> 07:26:21,660
there's plenty of keyboard shortcuts if

7227
07:26:21,660 --> 07:26:24,240
you want to be very efficient you need

7228
07:26:24,240 --> 07:26:29,340
to use a combination of shortcuts so uh

7229
07:26:29,340 --> 07:26:32,840
switching from proxy story to repeater

7230
07:26:32,840 --> 07:26:36,558
that's free action sending to repeater

7231
07:26:36,558 --> 07:26:40,320
we have control R switching to the

7232
07:26:40,320 --> 07:26:44,780
repeater tab that's control shift R and

7233
07:26:44,780 --> 07:26:48,260
emitting the repeater request that

7234
07:26:48,260 --> 07:26:54,478
control space so if I do it uh I pick an

7235
07:26:54,478 --> 07:26:55,320
entry

7236
07:26:55,320 --> 07:26:58,680
and I will use the short church so Ctrl

7237
07:26:58,680 --> 07:27:02,160
R control shift R control space and it

7238
07:27:02,160 --> 07:27:05,760
takes like one or two seconds uh to

7239
07:27:05,760 --> 07:27:08,878
switch from proxy story to repeater and

7240
07:27:08,878 --> 07:27:12,540
uh you will use a Master memory so you

7241
07:27:12,540 --> 07:27:15,958
you will not think about about the free

7242
07:27:15,958 --> 07:27:18,780
or Keys it's just a complex or key

7243
07:27:18,780 --> 07:27:23,780
bringing you directly to uh to repeater

7244
07:27:25,320 --> 07:27:27,920
hmm

7245
07:27:28,138 --> 07:27:31,260
uh poor man automation that's when you

7246
07:27:31,260 --> 07:27:34,138
are looking for bugs like in burgundy

7247
07:27:34,138 --> 07:27:37,440
but you you are in early days or you are

7248
07:27:37,440 --> 07:27:40,260
coming for for North SEC and you want to

7249
07:27:40,260 --> 07:27:42,660
look for vulnerabilities anyway

7250
07:27:42,660 --> 07:27:46,020
so we need two ingredients we need a

7251
07:27:46,020 --> 07:27:47,958
live task in burp

7252
07:27:47,958 --> 07:27:50,520
and we need a very specific

7253
07:27:50,520 --> 07:27:54,600
configuration the live task will monitor

7254
07:27:54,600 --> 07:27:58,740
proxy story and every item appearing in

7255
07:27:58,740 --> 07:28:02,160
the proxy story will be scanned so in

7256
07:28:02,160 --> 07:28:04,280
most situations that's very dangerous

7257
07:28:04,280 --> 07:28:09,600
and we will combine that to with fef and

7258
07:28:09,600 --> 07:28:13,378
first we will use a specific option I

7259
07:28:13,378 --> 07:28:15,020
will show the option

7260
07:28:15,020 --> 07:28:19,620
which is Dash replay Dash proxy and all

7261
07:28:19,620 --> 07:28:23,100
the interesting entries will be relayed

7262
07:28:23,100 --> 07:28:27,420
through a proxy so we combine first year

7263
07:28:27,420 --> 07:28:32,340
looking for a status code 200 and every

7264
07:28:32,340 --> 07:28:36,000
finding will be piped I mean will be

7265
07:28:36,000 --> 07:28:39,600
forwarded to birth and in verb we have

7266
07:28:39,600 --> 07:28:42,798
this configuration we have a live task

7267
07:28:42,798 --> 07:28:46,378
monitoring the proxy whatever the scope

7268
07:28:46,378 --> 07:28:48,740
is I mean whatever the Earth name is

7269
07:28:48,740 --> 07:28:52,920
will we will trigger an active scan

7270
07:28:52,920 --> 07:28:57,240
so uh for sure that's not very Advanced

7271
07:28:57,240 --> 07:29:00,660
like it's not a real pen test but if you

7272
07:29:00,660 --> 07:29:02,840
are

7273
07:29:02,940 --> 07:29:07,280
in holidays it's better than nothing

7274
07:29:07,500 --> 07:29:11,420
and you could even run fifth on a VPS

7275
07:29:11,420 --> 07:29:16,558
and forward to burp through SSH listener

7276
07:29:16,558 --> 07:29:19,440
so you have burp locally and you are

7277
07:29:19,440 --> 07:29:23,340
first on a remote server and they are

7278
07:29:23,340 --> 07:29:26,218
talking one two zero there that's quite

7279
07:29:26,218 --> 07:29:28,260
elegant

7280
07:29:28,260 --> 07:29:30,780
okay uh

7281
07:29:30,780 --> 07:29:34,700
not sure how many time I have left

7282
07:29:34,700 --> 07:29:38,400
something about performances I have very

7283
07:29:38,400 --> 07:29:42,240
very often uh some feedback about uh

7284
07:29:42,240 --> 07:29:47,218
burp being a resource intensive my

7285
07:29:47,218 --> 07:29:51,478
opinion is very clear computers are

7286
07:29:51,478 --> 07:29:55,440
cheaper than brains so you can send this

7287
07:29:55,440 --> 07:29:59,400
slide to your boss or manager you want a

7288
07:29:59,400 --> 07:30:02,600
computer which is larger than necessary

7289
07:30:02,600 --> 07:30:06,718
and whatever you are doing like a burp

7290
07:30:06,718 --> 07:30:10,378
or running VM Etc that should not be

7291
07:30:10,378 --> 07:30:13,580
something slowly slowing you down I mean

7292
07:30:13,580 --> 07:30:15,958
it's already difficult to find

7293
07:30:15,958 --> 07:30:18,360
vulnerabilities so having a decent

7294
07:30:18,360 --> 07:30:21,840
computer I think it's a good idea

7295
07:30:21,840 --> 07:30:24,900
um oh to stay up to date uh so of course

7296
07:30:24,900 --> 07:30:28,218
this is just a few tricks uh both figure

7297
07:30:28,218 --> 07:30:32,280
as a channel on YouTube they have very

7298
07:30:32,280 --> 07:30:35,820
short videos and very long ones both are

7299
07:30:35,820 --> 07:30:36,978
very good

7300
07:30:36,978 --> 07:30:40,558
uh they have a bunch of uh Twitter

7301
07:30:40,558 --> 07:30:45,360
accounts uh plus all the accounts all of

7302
07:30:45,360 --> 07:30:48,200
the employees themselves

7303
07:30:48,200 --> 07:30:52,500
uh I have an account a Twitter account

7304
07:30:52,500 --> 07:30:55,500
dedicated to burp so I have my real

7305
07:30:55,500 --> 07:30:59,878
account and this one is exclusively uh

7306
07:30:59,878 --> 07:31:03,478
ready to build chips or links or

7307
07:31:03,478 --> 07:31:04,638
whatever

7308
07:31:04,638 --> 07:31:10,200
and I'm nearly on time so if you want to

7309
07:31:10,200 --> 07:31:12,600
access the slides they are already

7310
07:31:12,600 --> 07:31:14,000
online

7311
07:31:14,000 --> 07:31:18,740
uh so you can you can just get them uh

7312
07:31:18,740 --> 07:31:22,860
and what else if you want some I mean if

7313
07:31:22,860 --> 07:31:26,340
you if you like what you what you saw uh

7314
07:31:26,340 --> 07:31:29,580
I will uh release a workshop for free

7315
07:31:29,580 --> 07:31:33,600
next month so next month uh there's a

7316
07:31:33,600 --> 07:31:36,680
free online concerns called

7317
07:31:36,680 --> 07:31:41,580
and I will have uh I'm not sure 60 or 90

7318
07:31:41,580 --> 07:31:44,940
minute Workshop uh related to session

7319
07:31:44,940 --> 07:31:48,680
management like cookies and

7320
07:31:48,680 --> 07:31:53,340
Json tokens whatever and so that's a bit

7321
07:31:53,340 --> 07:31:57,958
later and uh I think I I'm nearly on

7322
07:31:57,958 --> 07:32:02,700
time uh thanks for listening and if you

7323
07:32:02,700 --> 07:32:04,680
have any questions they are welcome if

7324
07:32:04,680 --> 07:32:07,320
we have the time and I will be at the

7325
07:32:07,320 --> 07:32:08,958
CTF

7326
07:32:08,958 --> 07:32:14,280
uh Friday evening and we with no no goal

7327
07:32:14,280 --> 07:32:17,040
to score anything so if you have any

7328
07:32:17,040 --> 07:32:19,500
question any questions relating to to

7329
07:32:19,500 --> 07:32:22,080
the challenges and or could we automate

7330
07:32:22,080 --> 07:32:25,200
automate them that would be uh like a

7331
07:32:25,200 --> 07:32:27,120
fun uh subject

7332
07:32:27,120 --> 07:32:28,930
thanks for listening

7333
07:32:28,930 --> 07:32:35,100
[Applause]

7334
07:32:35,100 --> 07:32:38,280
we probably have time for one question

7335
07:32:38,280 --> 07:32:41,899
anyone wants to be the one

7336
07:32:48,360 --> 07:32:49,920
yep

7337
07:32:49,920 --> 07:32:52,440
so if you want to take a picture of uh

7338
07:32:52,440 --> 07:32:54,660
oh yes thank you if you want to take a

7339
07:32:54,660 --> 07:32:56,820
picture of the links of the link sorry

7340
07:32:56,820 --> 07:32:58,860
it's already there is that the only

7341
07:32:58,860 --> 07:33:00,718
equation

7342
07:33:00,718 --> 07:33:03,000
that's a good question so

7343
07:33:03,000 --> 07:33:06,958
okay then thanks Nicola very good I

7344
07:33:06,958 --> 07:33:09,840
learned a lot so I'll welcome uh Nursery

7345
07:33:09,840 --> 07:33:14,700
Cinema from secureworks uh secureworks

7346
07:33:14,700 --> 07:33:16,500
is one of our sponsors and he just

7347
07:33:16,500 --> 07:33:18,600
wanted to take a little bit of your time

7348
07:33:18,600 --> 07:33:23,660
to tell us about tickerworks

7349
07:33:31,680 --> 07:33:34,680
foreign

7350
07:33:47,120 --> 07:33:51,020
oh yes thanks

7357
07:35:30,240 --> 07:35:33,840
so last Talk of the day very short one

7358
07:35:33,840 --> 07:35:36,718
only five minutes uh so my name is Dr

7359
07:35:36,718 --> 07:35:39,240
Lester tunima nice to meet you I also

7360
07:35:39,240 --> 07:35:41,940
known as Dr razor ready and I flew all

7361
07:35:41,940 --> 07:35:44,458
the way from Finland here yesterday to

7362
07:35:44,458 --> 07:35:47,580
give you a workshop tomorrow tomorrow

7363
07:35:47,580 --> 07:35:50,040
morning 10 o'clock about Authority and

7364
07:35:50,040 --> 07:35:52,558
tokens so why I'm here

7365
07:35:52,558 --> 07:35:54,958
I don't know to be honest but uh it

7366
07:35:54,958 --> 07:35:56,520
turns out that we have this kind of

7367
07:35:56,520 --> 07:35:58,378
sponsored talk here and I was here

7368
07:35:58,378 --> 07:36:00,540
anyway so my colleagues from from

7369
07:36:00,540 --> 07:36:02,520
Montreal has if I can talk about

7370
07:36:02,520 --> 07:36:04,860
something so I'm gonna talk to you about

7371
07:36:04,860 --> 07:36:06,660
something not about secure works but

7372
07:36:06,660 --> 07:36:08,340
something else

7373
07:36:08,340 --> 07:36:11,878
so how uh researchers as me so I'm

7374
07:36:11,878 --> 07:36:14,160
working as a full-time researcher so how

7375
07:36:14,160 --> 07:36:16,920
I as a researcher can actually defend

7376
07:36:16,920 --> 07:36:19,558
every corner of the cyberspace

7377
07:36:19,558 --> 07:36:22,440
so let's start with this pyramid of pain

7378
07:36:22,440 --> 07:36:24,420
I think some of you have seen this

7379
07:36:24,420 --> 07:36:28,620
before and it tries to describe what is

7380
07:36:28,620 --> 07:36:31,320
the cost of change to adversaries or

7381
07:36:31,320 --> 07:36:33,000
threat actors if we change something

7382
07:36:33,000 --> 07:36:33,958
here

7383
07:36:33,958 --> 07:36:36,840
so for instance there might be a threat

7384
07:36:36,840 --> 07:36:39,420
actor who has a piece of malware and you

7385
07:36:39,420 --> 07:36:43,500
know the half of that malware so if you

7386
07:36:43,500 --> 07:36:46,620
now detect that and then you

7387
07:36:46,620 --> 07:36:48,780
like these have has value here and then

7388
07:36:48,780 --> 07:36:52,200
you like block that it's quite easy for

7389
07:36:52,200 --> 07:36:54,718
direct actor to change that malware a

7390
07:36:54,718 --> 07:36:57,120
bit so that it will have a different

7391
07:36:57,120 --> 07:36:59,280
half right

7392
07:36:59,280 --> 07:37:03,360
so where should we focus then

7393
07:37:03,360 --> 07:37:05,700
so instead of this easy to change stuff

7394
07:37:05,700 --> 07:37:08,040
or something more trickier and yes we're

7395
07:37:08,040 --> 07:37:10,558
gonna focus on the tough which is the

7396
07:37:10,558 --> 07:37:14,218
top of the pyramid here so TTP so

7397
07:37:14,218 --> 07:37:16,558
tactics techniques and procedures so

7398
07:37:16,558 --> 07:37:19,320
those are the hardest part for direct

7399
07:37:19,320 --> 07:37:22,260
actors to change actually so even though

7400
07:37:22,260 --> 07:37:25,378
you change everything below that these

7401
07:37:25,378 --> 07:37:27,240
are still going to be valid so we should

7402
07:37:27,240 --> 07:37:29,458
focus on those but those are not easy

7403
07:37:29,458 --> 07:37:31,680
right they are actually quite

7404
07:37:31,680 --> 07:37:34,620
complicated so what do you do

7405
07:37:34,620 --> 07:37:37,680
well you call the researchers right and

7406
07:37:37,680 --> 07:37:39,298
we come to the help

7407
07:37:39,298 --> 07:37:40,740
help you out

7408
07:37:40,740 --> 07:37:44,400
so yeah

7409
07:37:44,878 --> 07:37:48,780
who of you did so the key talk

7410
07:37:48,780 --> 07:37:51,058
Kino today

7411
07:37:51,058 --> 07:37:54,780
okay so that keynote was given by my

7412
07:37:54,780 --> 07:37:57,000
friend Roberto and now I'm going to

7413
07:37:57,000 --> 07:37:58,558
actually show you a couple of slides

7414
07:37:58,558 --> 07:38:01,020
from a black hat Europe talk me and

7415
07:38:01,020 --> 07:38:04,080
Robel took give gave last December

7416
07:38:04,080 --> 07:38:08,180
so the talk was about how to

7417
07:38:08,180 --> 07:38:11,458
prevent golden summer attacks so that

7418
07:38:11,458 --> 07:38:14,218
was pretty much the the whole idea there

7419
07:38:14,218 --> 07:38:17,940
and here's the how we started so the

7420
07:38:17,940 --> 07:38:19,860
whole golden thermal attack is based on

7421
07:38:19,860 --> 07:38:23,400
one technique which might uh called six

7422
07:38:23,400 --> 07:38:26,160
one six four nine or steel or fourth

7423
07:38:26,160 --> 07:38:28,200
authentication certificates so that's

7424
07:38:28,200 --> 07:38:30,840
the technique they are using so it would

7425
07:38:30,840 --> 07:38:33,058
be so this is the process how to do that

7426
07:38:33,058 --> 07:38:35,580
so you start the attack you export the

7427
07:38:35,580 --> 07:38:36,958
tokens on a certificate and that's the

7428
07:38:36,958 --> 07:38:39,600
end of the attack so as a technique that

7429
07:38:39,600 --> 07:38:41,520
would be easy to block right

7430
07:38:41,520 --> 07:38:44,280
but no it's not that easy it's it's not

7431
07:38:44,280 --> 07:38:47,760
that just that because the adversaries

7432
07:38:47,760 --> 07:38:50,218
can use a lot of different procedures to

7433
07:38:50,218 --> 07:38:53,100
get the same end goal right which is to

7434
07:38:53,100 --> 07:38:55,558
export tokens and speed against and here

7435
07:38:55,558 --> 07:38:58,440
is actually the whole attack graph as it

7436
07:38:58,440 --> 07:39:00,360
turned out so I've been researching this

7437
07:39:00,360 --> 07:39:03,840
uh many years and I'm good at you know

7438
07:39:03,840 --> 07:39:06,718
attacking micro stuff and Roberto is

7439
07:39:06,718 --> 07:39:09,780
very good at detecting stuff

7440
07:39:09,780 --> 07:39:12,200
and together we are quite good to

7441
07:39:12,200 --> 07:39:15,180
mitigate stuff and prevent stuff so

7442
07:39:15,180 --> 07:39:17,878
actually after or in our talk in black

7443
07:39:17,878 --> 07:39:20,700
hat we were able to block all known

7444
07:39:20,700 --> 07:39:24,000
attack vectors so now we are safe and

7445
07:39:24,000 --> 07:39:27,058
you are welcome by the way so so that's

7446
07:39:27,058 --> 07:39:28,200
what we did

7447
07:39:28,200 --> 07:39:29,638
and uh

7448
07:39:29,638 --> 07:39:32,340
I'm actually getting close to the end of

7449
07:39:32,340 --> 07:39:34,440
my talk because this is very short just

7450
07:39:34,440 --> 07:39:36,600
a couple of minutes and I'm between you

7451
07:39:36,600 --> 07:39:39,420
and the party so I'm gonna be fast so

7452
07:39:39,420 --> 07:39:42,780
the key message here is that things are

7453
07:39:42,780 --> 07:39:43,978
complicated they are getting more

7454
07:39:43,978 --> 07:39:46,620
complicated so you need researchers and

7455
07:39:46,620 --> 07:39:49,378
then when they are collaborating like me

7456
07:39:49,378 --> 07:39:50,940
from security works or Roberta from

7457
07:39:50,940 --> 07:39:53,638
Microsoft then the magic happens so you

7458
07:39:53,638 --> 07:39:56,400
can actually do this kind of stuff so I

7459
07:39:56,400 --> 07:39:58,798
found stuff and then Roberto said I can

7460
07:39:58,798 --> 07:40:00,540
detect that and understand how about

7461
07:40:00,540 --> 07:40:03,420
this one I got you so that kind of

7462
07:40:03,420 --> 07:40:05,760
things when we do things together we can

7463
07:40:05,760 --> 07:40:07,500
get it like this

7464
07:40:07,500 --> 07:40:09,680
okay but before

7465
07:40:09,680 --> 07:40:13,378
letting you go so I flew from Finland

7466
07:40:13,378 --> 07:40:16,020
and I did a little bit of research and I

7467
07:40:16,020 --> 07:40:18,958
learned that you Canadian people also

7468
07:40:18,958 --> 07:40:21,718
are mad about hockey

7469
07:40:21,718 --> 07:40:24,600
well so are we so I know that you guys

7470
07:40:24,600 --> 07:40:26,420
know that how Finnish national team

7471
07:40:26,420 --> 07:40:29,638
jersey looks like so I wanted to make it

7472

Okay so

7513
07:57:27,420 --> 07:57:30,420
I have the honor of doing this 10-year

7514
07:57:30,420 --> 07:57:33,360
anniversary but it is also a burden so

7515
07:57:33,360 --> 07:57:35,280
this is an old school board scoreboard I

7516
07:57:35,280 --> 07:57:38,458
guess uh it is also a burden uh because

7517
07:57:38,458 --> 07:57:41,280
I'm here to host something that I didn't

7518
07:57:41,280 --> 07:57:44,878
create okay and something that many

7519
07:57:44,878 --> 07:57:47,058
people contributed to many people

7520
07:57:47,058 --> 07:57:49,558
spearheaded and I know now how much work

7521
07:57:49,558 --> 07:57:52,080
this represents

7522
07:57:52,080 --> 07:57:56,040
um so we will basically feature today in

7523
07:57:56,040 --> 07:57:59,760
a talk show style laid back

7524
07:57:59,760 --> 07:58:02,398
the guests not the guests the creators

7525
07:58:02,398 --> 07:58:04,378
of North Sac and we'll have them you

7526
07:58:04,378 --> 07:58:07,020
know one by one and add to the to the

7527
07:58:07,020 --> 07:58:10,558
party and we will go through uh three

7528
07:58:10,558 --> 07:58:16,978
eras of North SEC okay by presidencies

7529
07:58:17,340 --> 07:58:20,340
um and uh yeah I would like to to

7530
07:58:20,340 --> 07:58:23,040
Showcase their work but we will also

7531
07:58:23,040 --> 07:58:25,860
take questions from the audience uh if

7532
07:58:25,860 --> 07:58:28,020
if you want

7533
07:58:28,020 --> 07:58:28,860
um

7534
07:58:28,860 --> 07:58:32,580
we are we will be allowed to uh speak

7535
07:58:32,580 --> 07:58:34,080
some French

7536
07:58:34,080 --> 07:58:36,558
basketball

7537
07:58:37,260 --> 07:58:39,840
so bear with us we will try to keep it

7538
07:58:39,840 --> 07:58:42,600
English uh you know for accessibility

7539
07:58:42,600 --> 07:58:44,280
reasons because because we're an

7540
07:58:44,280 --> 07:58:45,958
international event we have people

7541
07:58:45,958 --> 07:58:49,260
flying over all the place to come here

7542
07:58:49,260 --> 07:58:51,120
and we would like to have more and more

7543
07:58:51,120 --> 07:58:53,240
of that if you want to be the biggest

7544
07:58:53,240 --> 07:58:57,600
CTF in the world uh so uh so we will try

7545
07:58:57,600 --> 07:58:59,760
to keep as much English as possible but

7546
07:58:59,760 --> 07:59:03,058
I want my my guests to know that if

7547
07:59:03,058 --> 07:59:04,740
something is funnier in French feel free

7548
07:59:04,740 --> 07:59:06,180
to say so

7549
07:59:06,180 --> 07:59:10,020
all right I will invite up on the stage

7550
07:59:10,020 --> 07:59:13,160
right now Ahmad Zinn uh

7551
07:59:13,160 --> 07:59:18,420
who is our VP engagement uh Amazon are

7552
07:59:18,420 --> 07:59:20,340
you here

7553
07:59:20,340 --> 07:59:22,680
small

7554
07:59:22,680 --> 07:59:25,680
you need to find Amazon

7555
07:59:25,680 --> 07:59:28,860
we uh we were they were briefed they

7556
07:59:28,860 --> 07:59:30,600
know they should be here but apparently

7557
07:59:30,600 --> 07:59:33,898
it didn't work out so we'll skip her and

7558
07:59:33,898 --> 07:59:36,000
have Emil first and then we'll we'll

7559
07:59:36,000 --> 07:59:38,700
switch back to Amazon so is Emil in the

7560
07:59:38,700 --> 07:59:40,940
house

7561
07:59:42,130 --> 07:59:44,638
[Applause]

7562
07:59:44,638 --> 07:59:47,398
yeah sit right here man

7563
07:59:47,398 --> 07:59:50,580
so Emil is our vice president of the

7564
07:59:50,580 --> 07:59:53,160
competition which is our weird way of

7565
07:59:53,160 --> 07:59:56,280
saying CTF because the CTF translates

7566
07:59:56,280 --> 07:59:59,700
badly in French

7567
07:59:59,700 --> 08:00:02,398
um so Emil uh

7568
08:00:02,398 --> 08:00:04,740
how long have you been involved with

7569
08:00:04,740 --> 08:00:07,260
North SEC and what was your path to

7570
08:00:07,260 --> 08:00:09,660
nordsec

7571
08:00:09,660 --> 08:00:13,620
oh hello

7572
08:00:14,040 --> 08:00:16,440
um so I am it's and I think the first

7573
08:00:16,440 --> 08:00:18,600
time I I participated at North Tech was

7574
08:00:18,600 --> 08:00:22,740
somewhere in 2014 I think uh as a

7575
08:00:22,740 --> 08:00:24,660
participant I really I was really bad

7576
08:00:24,660 --> 08:00:28,978
and uh I I I I was very very bad and

7577
08:00:28,978 --> 08:00:32,458
essentially uh after like one day of

7578
08:00:32,458 --> 08:00:36,180
full CDF and trying to do just to find

7579
08:00:36,180 --> 08:00:39,000
any Flags I think I found like one flag

7580
08:00:39,000 --> 08:00:41,458
in the in the rules

7581
08:00:41,458 --> 08:00:43,440
um and then I decided to get drunk in

7582
08:00:43,440 --> 08:00:46,500
the rules you found the rules flag yep

7583
08:00:46,500 --> 08:00:48,180
okay

7584
08:00:48,180 --> 08:00:50,398
and and this is the path to vice

7585
08:00:50,398 --> 08:00:52,580
president

7586
08:00:54,440 --> 08:00:57,058
uh we miss you

7587
08:00:57,058 --> 08:00:59,280
interesting all right

7588
08:00:59,280 --> 08:01:01,798
um any do you have any specific anecdote

7589
08:01:01,798 --> 08:01:04,260
you would like to share uh tour about

7590
08:01:04,260 --> 08:01:06,478
the city of like what's your what's the

7591
08:01:06,478 --> 08:01:08,700
moment that comes to mind right now for

7592
08:01:08,700 --> 08:01:11,940
you about the CDF uh I I think that my

7593
08:01:11,940 --> 08:01:14,458
my best moment for uh North Tech uh it's

7594
08:01:14,458 --> 08:01:16,798
a and it's a tribute to Simo which was

7595
08:01:16,798 --> 08:01:20,100
the VP uh CDF before me uh is that like

7596
08:01:20,100 --> 08:01:22,378
I remember coming in and just like

7597
08:01:22,378 --> 08:01:23,878
seeing the the room and everything

7598
08:01:23,878 --> 08:01:26,280
happening at North Tech just I think

7599
08:01:26,280 --> 08:01:28,558
Simo this guy is coming to my table and

7600
08:01:28,558 --> 08:01:30,660
be like hey do you want some bread I

7601
08:01:30,660 --> 08:01:33,120
don't like a what

7602
08:01:33,120 --> 08:01:35,878
and like it was kind of a a very fun

7603
08:01:35,878 --> 08:01:37,740
experience to see like that North Tech

7604
08:01:37,740 --> 08:01:39,898
was not only just a CTF that you you

7605
08:01:39,898 --> 08:01:42,000
stay behind your computer and and do

7606
08:01:42,000 --> 08:01:44,398
like you know find the crypto 500 and

7607
08:01:44,398 --> 08:01:46,378
the whatever is it was more physical

7608
08:01:46,378 --> 08:01:48,898
there was things happening and yeah it's

7609
08:01:48,898 --> 08:01:52,260
a full immersive experience it was a CDF

7610
08:01:52,260 --> 08:01:54,420
but it was also a bakery is what you're

7611
08:01:54,420 --> 08:01:57,780
saying yes yes so for those who don't

7612
08:01:57,780 --> 08:02:00,660
know we made fresh bread for the year

7613
08:02:00,660 --> 08:02:03,540
that the theme was Addison Bakery which

7614
08:02:03,540 --> 08:02:07,398
is a play on the Addis Ashley Edison

7615
08:02:07,398 --> 08:02:11,478
Ashley Madison leak

7616
08:02:11,478 --> 08:02:15,840
that's for Saturday man keep it clean

7617
08:02:15,840 --> 08:02:17,700
um yeah so uh interesting because it

7618
08:02:17,700 --> 08:02:19,020
smelled the bread the whole year and

7619
08:02:19,020 --> 08:02:21,840
they were doing like it was sourdough

7620
08:02:21,840 --> 08:02:24,180
and they were doing this in large bins

7621
08:02:24,180 --> 08:02:27,780
it was a bit crazy operation

7622
08:02:27,780 --> 08:02:30,360
um I have a one last question for you

7623
08:02:30,360 --> 08:02:32,458
Emil what are your thoughts and this is

7624
08:02:32,458 --> 08:02:34,860
serious what are your thoughts on

7625
08:02:34,860 --> 08:02:37,620
elitism versus accessible challenges

7626
08:02:37,620 --> 08:02:41,340
like how do you see the balance it's a

7627
08:02:41,340 --> 08:02:42,600
good question

7628
08:02:42,600 --> 08:02:44,160
I think

7629
08:02:44,160 --> 08:02:47,160
um like elitism is not like a term I I

7630
08:02:47,160 --> 08:02:49,558
like a lot it's it's nice to have art

7631
08:02:49,558 --> 08:02:51,240
challenges I like to see people having

7632
08:02:51,240 --> 08:02:54,240
difficult like spending a lot of time on

7633
08:02:54,240 --> 08:02:56,700
difficult challenges and and have a good

7634
08:02:56,700 --> 08:02:58,080
nose bleed on their reverse and

7635
08:02:58,080 --> 08:02:59,700
everything I think like that's super

7636
08:02:59,700 --> 08:03:01,378
important it's part of North Texas DNA

7637
08:03:01,378 --> 08:03:02,940
to have like very difficult challenges

7638
08:03:02,940 --> 08:03:06,360
but I think accessibility is the path to

7639
08:03:06,360 --> 08:03:07,860
that makes like people like me that

7640
08:03:07,860 --> 08:03:11,340
sucks at CTF uh be like interested and

7641
08:03:11,340 --> 08:03:12,780
involved and become more part of the

7642
08:03:12,780 --> 08:03:15,240
community so uh we do try to have the

7643
08:03:15,240 --> 08:03:17,218
more more and more challenges that are

7644
08:03:17,218 --> 08:03:20,040
accessible to like more beginner more

7645
08:03:20,040 --> 08:03:22,440
beginner friendly I think overall the

7646
08:03:22,440 --> 08:03:24,540
CTF we want it to evolve in a way where

7647
08:03:24,540 --> 08:03:27,420
you you could like if you're really here

7648
08:03:27,420 --> 08:03:29,160
for the elite and like competition and

7649
08:03:29,160 --> 08:03:31,620
be super serious we want it to be

7650
08:03:31,620 --> 08:03:33,058
did

7651
08:03:33,058 --> 08:03:35,100
I mean we want we want you to be able to

7652
08:03:35,100 --> 08:03:36,780
say that you're here for fun and that

7653
08:03:36,780 --> 08:03:39,360
we're able to like give you more hints

7654
08:03:39,360 --> 08:03:41,100
or like uh coach you a little more about

7655
08:03:41,100 --> 08:03:43,620
ctfs and everything uh Without Really

7656
08:03:43,620 --> 08:03:45,240
entering the real competition that's

7657
08:03:45,240 --> 08:03:47,398
happening behind it

7658
08:03:47,398 --> 08:03:50,458

foreign

7663
08:04:03,120 --> 08:04:05,040
like in a talk show man have you ever

7664
08:04:05,040 --> 08:04:08,100
watched TV that's how like they rotate

7665
08:04:08,100 --> 08:04:11,660
during the ad unfortunately hey Amazon

thank you for being here hey am I late

7667
08:04:14,760 --> 08:04:16,978
because I know that someone like they

7668
08:04:16,978 --> 08:04:19,798

7669

asked for you on stage but I I'm too

7670

busy for for being here so but it's okay

7671
08:04:24,360 --> 08:04:26,638
I'll take I'll take 15 minutes of your

7672
08:04:26,638 --> 08:04:28,620
time five minute talking

7673
08:04:28,620 --> 08:04:31,138
um so imagine you are our vice president

7674
08:04:31,138 --> 08:04:36,000
of Engagement and Outreach am I yes okay

7675
08:04:36,000 --> 08:04:40,200
um you uh so you uh okay the question is

7676
08:04:40,200 --> 08:04:43,740
how does one go from a PhD in Psychology

7677
08:04:43,740 --> 08:04:47,120
to be becoming a full-time pen tester

7678
08:04:47,120 --> 08:04:49,340
oscp certified

7679
08:04:49,340 --> 08:04:52,920
all while maintaining clinical practice

7680
08:04:52,920 --> 08:04:55,378
with you

7681
08:04:55,378 --> 08:04:57,298
I don't know man

7682
08:04:57,298 --> 08:04:59,218
I don't even know if I sleep no I sleep

7683
08:04:59,218 --> 08:05:01,860
very well I think that the the secret

7684
08:05:01,860 --> 08:05:05,700
for this is uh just being a a good time

7685
08:05:05,700 --> 08:05:07,920
manager you know and prioritize things

7686
08:05:07,920 --> 08:05:11,040
that you want to do for example nordsec

7687
08:05:11,040 --> 08:05:14,940
this year's uh and the year before I

7688
08:05:14,940 --> 08:05:16,440
don't have time to be here but I'm here

7689
08:05:16,440 --> 08:05:19,020
anyway so I missed some shift at the DPG

7690
08:05:19,020 --> 08:05:24,500
for being here so uh kids

7691
08:05:24,600 --> 08:05:28,620
are are not my priority today but uh

7692
08:05:28,620 --> 08:05:29,878
yeah

7693
08:05:29,878 --> 08:05:33,240
so I think just setting priority is my

7694
08:05:33,240 --> 08:05:36,558
best I think I have a

7695
08:05:36,558 --> 08:05:39,958
adhd2 so I'm just like always doing

7696
08:05:39,958 --> 08:05:41,040
something

7697
08:05:41,040 --> 08:05:42,600
and I don't know I'm passionate about

7698
08:05:42,600 --> 08:05:44,940

7702
08:05:52,978 --> 08:05:58,260

7745
08:11:17,820 --> 08:11:20,760
I got a job opportunity I could work as

7746
08:11:20,760 --> 08:11:23,520
a contractor at Google and so I made the

7747
08:11:23,520 --> 08:11:27,420
move and I was like why why not east

7748

all right

7757
08:11:47,280 --> 08:11:50,760
um so in 2018

7758
08:11:50,760 --> 08:11:53,638
northseek had a sudden death

7759
08:11:53,638 --> 08:11:56,700
the two first places of the CTF had

7760
08:11:56,700 --> 08:11:59,218
accumulated the same number of points so

7761
08:11:59,218 --> 08:12:01,260
first place and second place were equal

7762
08:12:01,260 --> 08:12:05,660
we had to make a decision on who wins

7763
08:12:05,660 --> 08:12:07,260
Bureau

7764
08:12:07,260 --> 08:12:09,840
created a reverse engineering challenge

7765
08:12:09,840 --> 08:12:11,820
at the last minute

7766
08:12:11,820 --> 08:12:15,600
and you were on stage with Zach Devoe

7767
08:12:15,600 --> 08:12:19,200
who's here from goats facing another

7768
08:12:19,200 --> 08:12:22,740
team doing live reverse engineering

7769
08:12:22,740 --> 08:12:23,940
like

7770
08:12:23,940 --> 08:12:26,638
how can you go through that amount of

7771
08:12:26,638 --> 08:12:27,958
pressure

7772
08:12:27,958 --> 08:12:30,739
you don't

7773
08:12:31,200 --> 08:12:32,898
yeah you just don't

7774
08:12:32,898 --> 08:12:36,120
I think if Zach was not there I would

7775
08:12:36,120 --> 08:12:39,620
probably be more Frozen

7776
08:12:39,660 --> 08:12:43,920
it was it was fun it was it was weird I

7777
08:12:43,920 --> 08:12:46,320
don't think I'll ever do that again but

7778
08:12:46,320 --> 08:12:49,320
uh yeah it was fun it was fun to win the

7779
08:12:49,320 --> 08:12:53,638
point you did win yes yeah um and it was

7780
08:12:53,638 --> 08:12:57,200
my first CTF so yeah

7781
08:12:57,540 --> 08:13:01,020
for us like for us organizers this is a

7782
08:13:01,020 --> 08:13:03,360
key moment in northseek history that we

7783
08:13:03,360 --> 08:13:05,520
wish we would have filmed it's like

7784
08:13:05,520 --> 08:13:07,740
something unbelievable happened we were

7785
08:13:07,740 --> 08:13:09,540
wondering what to do we had we thrown

7786
08:13:09,540 --> 08:13:12,898
ideas and at some point one of the teams

7787
08:13:12,898 --> 08:13:16,020
thought that they got it but then their

7788
08:13:16,020 --> 08:13:18,478
Mac verified and it was not okay but you

7789
08:13:18,478 --> 08:13:21,000
guys kept going on and then you got the

7790
08:13:21,000 --> 08:13:23,160
actual real flag I was like oh my God

7791
08:13:23,160 --> 08:13:25,440
there's so much pressure and I'm in the

7792
08:13:25,440 --> 08:13:28,620
audience so congrats on that do you

7793
08:13:28,620 --> 08:13:30,420
remember any of it or it's just like a

7794
08:13:30,420 --> 08:13:32,100
blur

7795
08:13:32,100 --> 08:13:36,180
I think it was a Linux elf file as RC

7796
08:13:36,180 --> 08:13:40,320
pokey uh Zach had radari open I didn't

7797
08:13:40,320 --> 08:13:43,440
do anything I just stared

7798
08:13:43,440 --> 08:13:45,600
I I might have a side anecdote about it

7799
08:13:45,600 --> 08:13:47,580
okay apparently not through uh I blanked

7800
08:13:47,580 --> 08:13:50,218
out that memory so yeah we did realize

7801
08:13:50,218 --> 08:13:52,860
afterward after after the sudden that

7802
08:13:52,860 --> 08:13:54,840
happened and everything and everybody

7803
08:13:54,840 --> 08:13:56,820
might remember this for the people that

7804
08:13:56,820 --> 08:13:58,860
were involved but we did realize that

7805
08:13:58,860 --> 08:14:00,660
one of the teams that were involved in

7806
08:14:00,660 --> 08:14:03,540
the sudden death did not submit the

7807
08:14:03,540 --> 08:14:06,200
rules flag

7808
08:14:06,298 --> 08:14:10,620
and with that flag the losing team

7809
08:14:10,620 --> 08:14:12,718
didn't submit the rules flag like it

7810
08:14:12,718 --> 08:14:14,580
would have been over before it even

7811
08:14:14,580 --> 08:14:18,120
started amazing

7812
08:14:18,600 --> 08:14:20,878
all right last question for you well

7813
08:14:20,878 --> 08:14:22,440
actually you know I'm always doing like

7814
08:14:22,440 --> 08:14:24,780
double questions or whatnot but what

7815
08:14:24,780 --> 08:14:26,040
would you describe as the biggest

7816
08:14:26,040 --> 08:14:29,458
challenge working on the Outreach team

7817
08:14:29,458 --> 08:14:33,540
uh I I guess

7818
08:14:33,540 --> 08:14:37,080
um biggest challenge uh maybe

7819
08:14:37,080 --> 08:14:38,940
seeing a lot more

7820
08:14:38,940 --> 08:14:41,100
I don't know like women type run

7821
08:14:41,100 --> 08:14:43,500
workshops

7822
08:14:43,500 --> 08:14:47,540
I guess I'm really bad at this um yeah

7823
08:14:47,540 --> 08:14:50,280
uh I think that's a bit more it would be

7824
08:14:50,280 --> 08:14:53,100
challenging and it's also I find I don't

7825
08:14:53,100 --> 08:14:54,958
know if it's only like in Montreal I

7826
08:14:54,958 --> 08:14:57,298
find there's not as many women that you

7827
08:14:57,298 --> 08:15:00,058
see attending workshops and it's trying

7828
08:15:00,058 --> 08:15:03,420
to like get them involved in it and just

7829
08:15:03,420 --> 08:15:04,978
creating a space for that but to see

7830
08:15:04,978 --> 08:15:07,320
more women uh

7831
08:15:07,320 --> 08:15:10,620
yeah it's difficult yeah all right but

7832
08:15:10,620 --> 08:15:15,420
good job trying to achieve the difficult

7833
08:15:15,420 --> 08:15:19,440
so uh we I realized I miscalculated we

7834
08:15:19,440 --> 08:15:20,878
have a chair problem that I'm gonna

7835
08:15:20,878 --> 08:15:23,160
smoothly handle like this

7836
08:15:23,160 --> 08:15:26,100
I'm gonna call on stage Serge Olivier

7837
08:15:26,100 --> 08:15:28,230
Paquette who will take my chair

7838
08:15:28,230 --> 08:15:30,840
[Applause]

7839
08:15:30,840 --> 08:15:34,580
and do we have another microphone

7840
08:15:35,458 --> 08:15:37,080
do we have another microphone we don't

7841
08:15:37,080 --> 08:15:39,898
even can we or get one for the next 15

7842
08:15:39,898 --> 08:15:41,878
minutes but for now we'll just borrow

7843
08:15:41,878 --> 08:15:44,580
one from uh from Emil

7844
08:15:44,580 --> 08:15:48,138
from the Overexposed people

7845
08:15:48,240 --> 08:15:49,978
all right thank you

7846
08:15:49,978 --> 08:15:52,878
so selfish

7847
08:15:53,218 --> 08:15:55,138
maybe we'll keep it like that we have

7848
08:15:55,138 --> 08:15:57,120
another chair but we'll see you want to

7849
08:15:57,120 --> 08:16:00,840
sit on my lap oh yeah we could do that

7850
08:16:00,840 --> 08:16:03,620
strong enough

7851
08:16:03,958 --> 08:16:06,180
so sales don't read the questions

7852
08:16:06,180 --> 08:16:09,000
so sir uh what were the challenges of

7853
08:16:09,000 --> 08:16:13,138
your tenure you delivered 2022 and 2021

7854
08:16:13,138 --> 08:16:14,878
as president

7855
08:16:14,878 --> 08:16:17,718
yes after a couple of years as Logistics

7856
08:16:17,718 --> 08:16:20,520
there's one big thing that happened I

7857
08:16:20,520 --> 08:16:22,200
don't know if people remember when

7858
08:16:22,200 --> 08:16:25,798
people were coughing and or staying home

7859
08:16:25,798 --> 08:16:27,600
that was quite a challenge as a

7860
08:16:27,600 --> 08:16:28,920
president

7861
08:16:28,920 --> 08:16:32,160
bring people together motivating them to

7862
08:16:32,160 --> 08:16:33,898
come back and spend some time when

7863
08:16:33,898 --> 08:16:35,580
everyone was in depression

7864
08:16:35,580 --> 08:16:38,458
that was something yeah well you handled

7865
08:16:38,458 --> 08:16:41,218
that very well I'm uncomfortable sorry

7866
08:16:41,218 --> 08:16:41,820
um

7867
08:16:41,820 --> 08:16:43,620
uh or Too Close

7868
08:16:43,620 --> 08:16:45,660
you uh no but you handle that very well

7869
08:16:45,660 --> 08:16:47,458
but people yeah of course don't want to

7870
08:16:47,458 --> 08:16:49,020
remember kovid and I had other questions

7871
08:16:49,020 --> 08:16:50,940
about it so uh

7872
08:16:50,940 --> 08:16:53,280
um can you tell us something about each

7873
08:16:53,280 --> 08:16:55,798
panelist here with us

7874
08:16:55,798 --> 08:16:58,260
a story or something you've learned from

7875
08:16:58,260 --> 08:17:00,000
them

7876
08:17:00,000 --> 08:17:02,660
hmm

7877
08:17:03,240 --> 08:17:05,820
do you want a demonstration

7878
08:17:05,820 --> 08:17:08,700
I don't have my scooter right now

7879
08:17:08,700 --> 08:17:11,700
um Emil loves a snowboard so we're in

7880
08:17:11,700 --> 08:17:14,160
the team of being on something that

7881
08:17:14,160 --> 08:17:16,440
Glides

7882
08:17:16,440 --> 08:17:19,500
and I have no clue about I know very

7883
08:17:19,500 --> 08:17:22,978
little about soira unfortunately so she

7884
08:17:22,978 --> 08:17:25,200
doesn't mind the cold of Montreal and

7885
08:17:25,200 --> 08:17:28,040
loves smoked meat

7886
08:17:30,058 --> 08:17:33,958
all right uh okay last questions for a

7887
08:17:33,958 --> 08:17:36,840
bunch uh you have a math background

7888
08:17:36,840 --> 08:17:39,540
you work in software engineering data

7889
08:17:39,540 --> 08:17:42,898
science machine learning I was told that

7890
08:17:42,898 --> 08:17:45,540
you had imposter syndrome on your way to

7891
08:17:45,540 --> 08:17:47,340
become North sex president

7892
08:17:47,340 --> 08:17:51,298
can you talk about it I still do

7893
08:17:51,298 --> 08:17:54,120
but I learned to cope with it and I

7894
08:17:54,120 --> 08:17:56,458
learned that everybody does also even

7895
08:17:56,458 --> 08:17:59,820
those that don't look like they do and

7896
08:17:59,820 --> 08:18:01,558
it's something to celebrate it's

7897
08:18:01,558 --> 08:18:03,600
something everybody so the reason they

7898
08:18:03,600 --> 08:18:05,218
go on stage is because they became the

7899
08:18:05,218 --> 08:18:06,540
best in the world in their

7900
08:18:06,540 --> 08:18:08,340
domain of course you don't know as much

7901
08:18:08,340 --> 08:18:10,558
as them so it's perfectly fine to not

7902
08:18:10,558 --> 08:18:12,058
understand what the hell they're talking

7903
08:18:12,058 --> 08:18:15,360
about just listen grasp what you can and

7904
08:18:15,360 --> 08:18:17,280
be the best in the in your domain at

7905
08:18:17,280 --> 08:18:19,320
some point in life and so that's it and

7906
08:18:19,320 --> 08:18:22,080
that's what I I became I came to enjoy

7907
08:18:22,080 --> 08:18:23,760
that feeling of being surrounded by

7908
08:18:23,760 --> 08:18:25,680
people that are so much better at me at

7909
08:18:25,680 --> 08:18:27,780
so many things it's just something to

7910
08:18:27,780 --> 08:18:29,340
celebrate and then one of the reasons

7911
08:18:29,340 --> 08:18:32,120
nor Tech is beautiful

7912
08:18:32,180 --> 08:18:35,760
yeah good job

7913
08:18:35,760 --> 08:18:38,520
all right so I'll ask everyone to leave

7914
08:18:38,520 --> 08:18:40,080
the stage and then we'll go with this

7915
08:18:40,080 --> 08:18:42,478
the next era we're going from recent

7916
08:18:42,478 --> 08:18:45,840
years towards uh oldest years and I'm

7917
08:18:45,840 --> 08:18:48,180
taking a lot of time I realized so uh

7918
08:18:48,180 --> 08:18:51,540
I'll have to pick up the pace

7919
08:18:51,540 --> 08:18:54,120
I would like a Florencia to come up on

7920
08:18:54,120 --> 08:18:57,478
stage Florencia

7921
08:18:57,770 --> 08:19:03,180
[Applause]

7922
08:19:03,180 --> 08:19:05,218
hello

7923
08:19:05,218 --> 08:19:07,878
hello

7924
08:19:08,398 --> 08:19:10,558
so very exposed

7925
08:19:10,558 --> 08:19:13,558
that's weird it's weird yeah so I mean

7926
08:19:13,558 --> 08:19:15,718
come on you did stage time before

7927
08:19:15,718 --> 08:19:17,760
yeah but but not in a chair I don't know

7928
08:19:17,760 --> 08:19:19,440
it's weird anyway

7929
08:19:19,440 --> 08:19:21,840
then are you the one who organized the

7930
08:19:21,840 --> 08:19:25,200
the panels the format the I I never sat

7931
08:19:25,200 --> 08:19:26,878
in them though it's completely different

7932
08:19:26,878 --> 08:19:30,000
so now you've yeah yeah now I'm suddenly

7933
08:19:30,000 --> 08:19:31,180
I'm sorry

7934
08:19:31,180 --> 08:19:34,200
[Laughter]

7935
08:19:34,200 --> 08:19:35,878
all right Florencia needs no

7936
08:19:35,878 --> 08:19:38,160
introduction she's been running the

7937
08:19:38,160 --> 08:19:39,478
conference for the last four or five

7938
08:19:39,478 --> 08:19:42,058
years and started the year after Pia

7939
08:19:42,058 --> 08:19:45,958
David started it just did like a napkin

7940
08:19:45,958 --> 08:19:48,298
project and then Florencia delivered an

7941
08:19:48,298 --> 08:19:51,360
actual event conference

7942
08:19:51,360 --> 08:19:54,000
um uh so you were tasked with this big

7943
08:19:54,000 --> 08:19:57,540
and vague request of making a generalist

7944
08:19:57,540 --> 08:20:01,260
cyber security event tied to a CTF

7945
08:20:01,260 --> 08:20:04,620
and making it diverse so the question is

7946
08:20:04,620 --> 08:20:08,218
how did you approach this

7947
08:20:08,218 --> 08:20:10,740
um uh just trying a lot of things and

7948
08:20:10,740 --> 08:20:12,478
seeing what sticks I think the the

7949
08:20:12,478 --> 08:20:13,978
trouble with being a generalist

7950
08:20:13,978 --> 08:20:15,240
conference is

7951
08:20:15,240 --> 08:20:17,940
no matter like you're just you're

7952
08:20:17,940 --> 08:20:19,200
constantly kind of trying to catch up

7953
08:20:19,200 --> 08:20:20,820
with yourself you're like oh we got a

7954
08:20:20,820 --> 08:20:22,138
lot of applications from people in

7955
08:20:22,138 --> 08:20:23,638
reversing now we've got to chase after

7956
08:20:23,638 --> 08:20:25,978
blue team people

7957
08:20:25,978 --> 08:20:27,360
um so a lot of that just a lot of

7958
08:20:27,360 --> 08:20:30,058
chasing uh I guess running after people

7959
08:20:30,058 --> 08:20:31,740
that we think are interesting watching

7960
08:20:31,740 --> 08:20:33,540
uh conference talks from other

7961
08:20:33,540 --> 08:20:35,218
conferences and and doing our best

7962
08:20:35,218 --> 08:20:38,340
especially to try to

7963
08:20:38,340 --> 08:20:40,798
um look for diverse speakers which is

7964
08:20:40,798 --> 08:20:42,898
not that easy and then you know you just

7965
08:20:42,898 --> 08:20:44,040
have to hope that they actually will

7966
08:20:44,040 --> 08:20:46,378
apply when you ask them to

7967
08:20:46,378 --> 08:20:48,420
great answer

7968
08:20:48,420 --> 08:20:50,820
um I would uh I would like you we kind

7969
08:20:50,820 --> 08:20:52,920
of have an opportunity here to describe

7970
08:20:52,920 --> 08:20:54,898
the call for paper process in a laid

7971
08:20:54,898 --> 08:20:57,240
back fashion we never actually did a

7972
08:20:57,240 --> 08:20:58,860
blog post about it or whatever because

7973
08:20:58,860 --> 08:21:01,080
it's it's a lot of little things right

7974
08:21:01,080 --> 08:21:03,240
and and you ask anyone on the on the

7975
08:21:03,240 --> 08:21:05,398
committee how it works and they will say

7976
08:21:05,398 --> 08:21:07,080
slightly different things so I would

7977
08:21:07,080 --> 08:21:09,540
like to have your view of our of North

7978
08:21:09,540 --> 08:21:13,080
sex CFB process like how does it work so

7979
08:21:13,080 --> 08:21:16,200
we have two or at times we've had three

7980
08:21:16,200 --> 08:21:18,120
rounds of submissions and that the

7981
08:21:18,120 --> 08:21:20,940
reason for the the two rounds is that we

7982
08:21:20,940 --> 08:21:22,558
try to get hype when we announce the

7983
08:21:22,558 --> 08:21:24,780
first round of speakers and also because

7984
08:21:24,780 --> 08:21:27,780
we do want to kind of Target the the

7985
08:21:27,780 --> 08:21:30,180
later rounds so as an example yeah you

7986
08:21:30,180 --> 08:21:32,580
know we get a lot of applicants who are

7987
08:21:32,580 --> 08:21:34,740
red teamers then in the second round we

7988
08:21:34,740 --> 08:21:36,298
want to kind of balance that out and we

7989
08:21:36,298 --> 08:21:39,660
want to kind of make that all work

7990
08:21:39,660 --> 08:21:41,700
um but the way it works is we have this

7991
08:21:41,700 --> 08:21:43,378
open source tool that we use and people

7992
08:21:43,378 --> 08:21:46,200
submit their applications which includes

7993
08:21:46,200 --> 08:21:47,398
you know whatever they want to talk

7994
08:21:47,398 --> 08:21:48,478
about

7995
08:21:48,478 --> 08:21:50,700
um full description any materials that

7996
08:21:50,700 --> 08:21:52,080
are related to what they're proposing

7997
08:21:52,080 --> 08:21:53,700
and

7998
08:21:53,700 --> 08:21:56,340
um bio Etc and then we have a committee

7999
08:21:56,340 --> 08:21:59,040
of I want to say it's like six ish

8000
08:21:59,040 --> 08:22:02,280
people it varies from year to year that

8001
08:22:02,280 --> 08:22:05,280
will go through and vote on what you

8002
08:22:05,280 --> 08:22:07,200
know how they feel about the proposal so

8003
08:22:07,200 --> 08:22:09,718
we do that it's not fully blinded at

8004
08:22:09,718 --> 08:22:12,298
this point but we we do not see each

8005
08:22:12,298 --> 08:22:14,398
other's votes so everyone votes and then

8006
08:22:14,398 --> 08:22:16,558
we uh afterwards we we kind of look at

8007
08:22:16,558 --> 08:22:17,638
all of

8008
08:22:17,638 --> 08:22:19,558
um how everyone voted and we discussed

8009
08:22:19,558 --> 08:22:22,138
them ones that are that have high votes

8010
08:22:22,138 --> 08:22:23,820
or medium votes and then debate and then

8011
08:22:23,820 --> 08:22:25,378
kind of pick and then try to make it all

8012
08:22:25,378 --> 08:22:27,478
work so we use Trello to kind of arrange

8013
08:22:27,478 --> 08:22:29,700
it all and see if if the the total

8014
08:22:29,700 --> 08:22:31,080
program makes sense

8015
08:22:31,080 --> 08:22:33,000
does that would that cover it that's

8016
08:22:33,000 --> 08:22:35,160
perfect I'm gonna clip this and we're

8017
08:22:35,160 --> 08:22:36,898
gonna put it on our website or YouTube

8018
08:22:36,898 --> 08:22:39,898
or whatever it's just so much less time

8019
08:22:39,898 --> 08:22:41,520
than writing blog post great grenade

8020
08:22:41,520 --> 08:22:44,580

[Applause]

8024
08:22:57,298 --> 08:22:58,940
Eric

8025
08:22:58,940 --> 08:23:03,478
hello scenario lead is the title I think

8026
08:23:03,478 --> 08:23:06,180
you are attributed yeah game master

8027
08:23:06,180 --> 08:23:08,700
scenario designer or something like that

8028
08:23:08,700 --> 08:23:12,600
so what is the job of a scenario lead

8029
08:23:12,600 --> 08:23:16,280
except yaml

8030
08:23:16,500 --> 08:23:20,638
yaml but yes the Joe the job is to

8031
08:23:20,638 --> 08:23:22,740
to technical challenges of every

8032
08:23:22,740 --> 08:23:25,558
challenge designer and then to wrap it

8033
08:23:25,558 --> 08:23:29,398
up into the entire nordsec team because

8034
08:23:29,398 --> 08:23:31,620
you know this is an event that is it's

8035
08:23:31,620 --> 08:23:33,718
not only the CTF there's the conference

8036
08:23:33,718 --> 08:23:35,760
there's all the the swag that you see

8037
08:23:35,760 --> 08:23:38,638
the t-shirts they're the badges

8038
08:23:38,638 --> 08:23:43,020
the team is everywhere in nordsec so my

8039
08:23:43,020 --> 08:23:46,218
job is to first come up with an idea

8040
08:23:46,218 --> 08:23:48,840
then work with the challenge designers

8041
08:23:48,840 --> 08:23:52,860
to make up that idea to create like an

8042
08:23:52,860 --> 08:23:55,138
entire universe based on their

8043
08:23:55,138 --> 08:23:58,978
challenges so it's it's all about taking

8044
08:23:58,978 --> 08:24:01,920
their challenges building a universe

8045
08:24:01,920 --> 08:24:04,920
around it and then rapid it up so that

8046
08:24:04,920 --> 08:24:08,100
when participants go into the CTF they

8047
08:24:08,100 --> 08:24:11,218
can see a real experience they can see

8048
08:24:11,218 --> 08:24:13,620
something that is cohesive that is not

8049
08:24:13,620 --> 08:24:16,080
just oh this is an SQL injection this is

8050
08:24:16,080 --> 08:24:19,860
a reverse challenge it's a world that

8051
08:24:19,860 --> 08:24:22,020
you're a part of and you're building a

8052
08:24:22,020 --> 08:24:24,478
part of that story so something like

8053
08:24:24,478 --> 08:24:25,440
that

8054
08:24:25,440 --> 08:24:29,478
do people even realize half of that or

8055
08:24:29,478 --> 08:24:31,798
I would say

8056
08:24:31,798 --> 08:24:34,378
maybe not I know there's a lot of people

8057
08:24:34,378 --> 08:24:36,478
that are very competitive and all of

8058
08:24:36,478 --> 08:24:39,120
these messages they don't care it's a

8059
08:24:39,120 --> 08:24:41,458
this is noise we don't care give me the

8060
08:24:41,458 --> 08:24:44,940
URL and I'll go to it but

8061
08:24:44,940 --> 08:24:47,458
when you're building the signature of an

8062
08:24:47,458 --> 08:24:49,500
image

8063
08:24:49,500 --> 08:24:52,978
the team in nordsec is everything like

8064
08:24:52,978 --> 08:24:55,860
the audio that you hear the visuals that

8065
08:24:55,860 --> 08:24:59,520
you see the t-shirts that volunteers so

8066
08:24:59,520 --> 08:25:01,978
in the end that creates an event that is

8067
08:25:01,978 --> 08:25:04,798
interesting so this is why I think even

8068
08:25:04,798 --> 08:25:07,378
if the participants don't understand the

8069
08:25:07,378 --> 08:25:10,200
whole the big picture they can see all

8070
08:25:10,200 --> 08:25:12,780
and the color that we're putting into it

8071
08:25:12,780 --> 08:25:16,138
and I find that absolutely fascinating

8072
08:25:16,138 --> 08:25:18,978
all right I'm gonna ask a trick question

8073
08:25:18,978 --> 08:25:23,760
which theme was your favorite so far uh

8074
08:25:23,760 --> 08:25:26,580
oh this is yeah they

8075
08:25:26,580 --> 08:25:29,398
they hear they are my babies some babies

8076
08:25:29,398 --> 08:25:33,680
are more Troublesome to put into life uh

8077
08:25:33,680 --> 08:25:36,180
some babies they don't really know about

8078
08:25:36,180 --> 08:25:38,600
that

8079
08:25:38,820 --> 08:25:42,120
yeah some of them are very challenging

8080
08:25:42,120 --> 08:25:44,638
but I would say my the one I'm the the

8081
08:25:44,638 --> 08:25:47,700
proudest of is North sectoria where we

8082
08:25:47,700 --> 08:25:51,298
did an entire CTF about medieval cyber

8083
08:25:51,298 --> 08:25:54,600
security it was so wild

8084
08:25:54,600 --> 08:25:57,298
um I've never seen like cyberpunk is

8085
08:25:57,298 --> 08:25:59,760
easy it's part of our culture Us in

8086
08:25:59,760 --> 08:26:03,360
infosec but medieval cyber security that

8087
08:26:03,360 --> 08:26:06,240
doesn't exist so yeah I would say the

8088
08:26:06,240 --> 08:26:08,580
opportunity that I have working in that

8089
08:26:08,580 --> 08:26:11,520
event and creating crazy stuff like that

8090
08:26:11,520 --> 08:26:13,798
is absolutely amazing so I thank you all

8091
08:26:13,798 --> 08:26:17,280
for for that you just mentioned it and I

8092
08:26:17,280 --> 08:26:19,320
have this song in my head yeah yeah

8093
08:26:19,320 --> 08:26:22,440
there's a little whistle and uh yeah

8094
08:26:22,440 --> 08:26:23,820
all right

8095
08:26:23,820 --> 08:26:27,420
um about this year's theme any surprises

8096
08:26:27,420 --> 08:26:31,020
left or hints uh

8097
08:26:31,020 --> 08:26:32,878
to be honest

8098
08:26:32,878 --> 08:26:34,798
um this year's team was supposed to be

8099
08:26:34,798 --> 08:26:37,860
last year's team so

8100
08:26:37,860 --> 08:26:40,378
um we were not sure last year what we

8101
08:26:40,378 --> 08:26:42,718
would do with North sect so last year

8102
08:26:42,718 --> 08:26:45,840
theme was pretty much build up quickly

8103
08:26:45,840 --> 08:26:48,718
so that because we we found out that oh

8104
08:26:48,718 --> 08:26:52,740
yeah we can hold an uh in person event

8105
08:26:52,740 --> 08:26:56,040
so it was really last minute so what

8106
08:26:56,040 --> 08:26:58,138
you're seeing this weekend is

8107
08:26:58,138 --> 08:27:01,978
put yourself back in May 2022 what was

8108
08:27:01,978 --> 08:27:04,440
the life that we were seeing as a

8109
08:27:04,440 --> 08:27:08,458
society coming out of covid so this is

8110
08:27:08,458 --> 08:27:11,878
the kind of Ambience I had in mind back

8111
08:27:11,878 --> 08:27:14,280
then but now this year with all that

8112
08:27:14,280 --> 08:27:16,740
change all the things that that have

8113
08:27:16,740 --> 08:27:20,058
happened things like the um

8114
08:27:20,058 --> 08:27:22,978
democratization of AI That's something

8115
08:27:22,978 --> 08:27:25,260
big that has happened this year so you

8116
08:27:25,260 --> 08:27:26,718
will see little

8117
08:27:26,718 --> 08:27:29,580
hints about that that couldn't have

8118
08:27:29,580 --> 08:27:32,340
happened last year so this is why using

8119
08:27:32,340 --> 08:27:35,398
current events into the theme is

8120
08:27:35,398 --> 08:27:38,218
something that I absolutely love

8121
08:27:38,218 --> 08:27:41,160

there's there's a lot of iconography

8130
08:28:05,160 --> 08:28:09,080
that is very weird very

8131
08:28:09,080 --> 08:28:13,978
Illuminati very mystical well

8132
08:28:13,978 --> 08:28:16,558
keep that in mind in everything that

8133
08:28:16,558 --> 08:28:19,620
we've written in the end there's this

8134
08:28:19,620 --> 08:28:23,218
mystical power structure that is

8135
08:28:23,218 --> 08:28:25,440
controlling everything challenge

8136
08:28:25,440 --> 08:28:28,740
designers might not see it but you will

8137
08:28:28,740 --> 08:28:33,058
feel the awareness and uh yeah I can I

8138
08:28:33,058 --> 08:28:35,040
can't wait to talk about you all about

8139
08:28:35,040 --> 08:28:37,680
what we've created uh challenges this

8140
08:28:37,680 --> 08:28:40,558
year are especially good and the

8141
08:28:40,558 --> 08:28:42,600
integration with the team this year is

8142
08:28:42,600 --> 08:28:45,360
absolutely great so it's an honor to

8143
08:28:45,360 --> 08:28:48,000
showcase that this week excellent so

8144
08:28:48,000 --> 08:28:50,760
please if you may please step aside I'm

8145
08:28:50,760 --> 08:28:54,138
gonna invite Danny to come up on stage

8146
08:28:54,138 --> 08:28:57,780
we were speaking about Sound and Music

8147
08:28:57,780 --> 08:29:01,200
earlier and so Danny is a sound designer

8148
08:29:01,200 --> 08:29:05,638
and DJ for nordsec which is uh something

8149
08:29:05,638 --> 08:29:08,520
I think we should promote more our art

8150
08:29:08,520 --> 08:29:10,978
the connection we are trying and we're

8151
08:29:10,978 --> 08:29:12,540
not good at it but the connection we're

8152
08:29:12,540 --> 08:29:15,660
trying to have with art and Sound and

8153
08:29:15,660 --> 08:29:20,760
Music so Danny you did a live DJ live

8154
08:29:20,760 --> 08:29:24,000
stream on Twitch for nordsec 2020 at the

8155
08:29:24,000 --> 08:29:25,740
peak of the pandemic when we were in

8156
08:29:25,740 --> 08:29:29,700
lockdown how was this experience like

8157
08:29:29,700 --> 08:29:32,040
from your garage I remember like

8158
08:29:32,040 --> 08:29:34,378
drinking in front of my screen with like

8159
08:29:34,378 --> 08:29:36,780
being on Discord with the other buddies

8160
08:29:36,780 --> 08:29:39,000
and listening to the music and having

8161
08:29:39,000 --> 08:29:40,320
fun

8162
08:29:40,320 --> 08:29:44,580
what a weird weird time that was

8163
08:29:44,580 --> 08:29:46,558
um and I was just shocked by the amount

8164
08:29:46,558 --> 08:29:49,320
of fun that I had uh because we had all

8165
08:29:49,320 --> 08:29:51,360
been in our holes and then the idea of

8166
08:29:51,360 --> 08:29:54,240
like we can't do northseek and I see Flo

8167
08:29:54,240 --> 08:29:56,700
freaking out and we can't do northseek

8168
08:29:56,700 --> 08:29:58,440
and then it's like no we can we can pull

8169
08:29:58,440 --> 08:30:01,260
it off we can pull it off digitally

8170
08:30:01,260 --> 08:30:03,958
but having been here before and seen the

8171
08:30:03,958 --> 08:30:05,638
vibe in this room when people are doing

8172
08:30:05,638 --> 08:30:08,940
the CTF to imagine the CTF without that

8173
08:30:08,940 --> 08:30:10,860
Vibe was heartbreaking

8174
08:30:10,860 --> 08:30:13,740
but then to be able to contribute in

8175
08:30:13,740 --> 08:30:16,138
some way to create some kind of unifying

8176
08:30:16,138 --> 08:30:17,760
thing where like where people are

8177
08:30:17,760 --> 08:30:19,440
listening to the same music and they're

8178
08:30:19,440 --> 08:30:22,740
kind of sharing that same spot

8179
08:30:22,740 --> 08:30:25,320
um honestly I like I felt it and it was

8180
08:30:25,320 --> 08:30:28,680
it was a joyful thing to do were you

8181
08:30:28,680 --> 08:30:30,600
like looking at the chat at the same

8182
08:30:30,600 --> 08:30:33,718
time yeah okay yeah so in between tracks

8183
08:30:33,718 --> 08:30:36,780
uh adding yes so

8184
08:30:36,780 --> 08:30:40,558
um uh before doing so and after doing so

8185
08:30:40,558 --> 08:30:43,080
you also designed the sound atmosphere

8186
08:30:43,080 --> 08:30:46,200
yeah so I might I don't recall exactly

8187
08:30:46,200 --> 08:30:49,200
but I remember like it started in 2019

8188
08:30:49,200 --> 08:30:52,320
because we needed royalty-free music for

8189
08:30:52,320 --> 08:30:55,440
our our pauses and our stream and then

8190
08:30:55,440 --> 08:30:58,020
the severity high in 2020 we're already

8191
08:30:58,020 --> 08:31:00,898
planning at a DJ so I think you did some

8192
08:31:00,898 --> 08:31:04,138
sound for us and I um Am I Wrong saying

8193
08:31:04,138 --> 08:31:06,600
the medieval is your stuff so this is

8194
08:31:06,600 --> 08:31:08,580
your stuff and we might have a surprise

8195
08:31:08,580 --> 08:31:09,780
for this year

8196
08:31:09,780 --> 08:31:14,040
um uh and uh so what is uh the process

8197
08:31:14,040 --> 08:31:17,898
of creating a sound atmosphere

8198
08:31:18,058 --> 08:31:19,860
um well you get really really weird

8199
08:31:19,860 --> 08:31:24,840
prompts like medieval hold music or like

8200
08:31:24,840 --> 08:31:26,638
you know you all heard the leak today

8201
08:31:26,638 --> 08:31:31,138
the leak was it's going to feel weird

8202
08:31:31,138 --> 08:31:33,660
so you know getting getting a prompt

8203
08:31:33,660 --> 08:31:36,360
like that is honestly just like the most

8204
08:31:36,360 --> 08:31:39,718
like it's my idea of fun is being like

8205
08:31:39,718 --> 08:31:42,478
okay we need basically filler music

8206
08:31:42,478 --> 08:31:44,160
but

8207
08:31:44,160 --> 08:31:47,040
you know here's a Twist or two and I

8208
08:31:47,040 --> 08:31:49,558
think it infuses art into the tech Vive

8209
08:31:49,558 --> 08:31:51,718
that we have here and honestly like

8210
08:31:51,718 --> 08:31:53,878
you know you can get you can get hold

8211
08:31:53,878 --> 08:31:56,280
music royalty free for free on the

8212
08:31:56,280 --> 08:31:58,440
internet very easily but you could also

8213
08:31:58,440 --> 08:32:00,660
like if you really need a name tag you

8214
08:32:00,660 --> 08:32:02,700
know you can get paper from the dollar

8215
08:32:02,700 --> 08:32:04,378
store and write your names on it but

8216
08:32:04,378 --> 08:32:06,600
like North set clearly

8217
08:32:06,600 --> 08:32:10,378
feels the need to have these badges the

8218
08:32:10,378 --> 08:32:12,898
blinking stuff exactly and so I just

8219
08:32:12,898 --> 08:32:15,240
feel like that's kind of the this the

8220
08:32:15,240 --> 08:32:17,100
spirit of this event is kind of like

8221
08:32:17,100 --> 08:32:19,320
let's go over the top let's bring it

8222
08:32:19,320 --> 08:32:20,340
together

8223
08:32:20,340 --> 08:32:22,500
uh let's contribute our own favorite

8224
08:32:22,500 --> 08:32:24,298
kind of weird

8225
08:32:24,298 --> 08:32:25,860
and uh

8226
08:32:25,860 --> 08:32:28,920
little old music is how I get to the

8227
08:32:28,920 --> 08:32:30,600
little how I get to feel important and

8228
08:32:30,600 --> 08:32:33,478
sit on this if I may there there's a

8229
08:32:33,478 --> 08:32:35,520
there's a saying that I really like

8230
08:32:35,520 --> 08:32:39,180
um uh restriction breeds creativity is

8231
08:32:39,180 --> 08:32:42,298
that when you're giving like limits this

8232
08:32:42,298 --> 08:32:46,440
is when the mind can go and fly so this

8233
08:32:46,440 --> 08:32:48,898
is why working with with the set and

8234
08:32:48,898 --> 08:32:51,240
working with with her like the the prom

8235
08:32:51,240 --> 08:32:54,298
for this year was so weird and it

8236
08:32:54,298 --> 08:32:57,180
the delivery was amazing I can't wait

8237
08:32:57,180 --> 08:33:00,180

8284
08:34:57,420 --> 08:34:59,398
my company we actually have an outing we

8285
08:34:59,398 --> 08:35:01,558
don't do skiing you know in uh in

8286
08:35:01,558 --> 08:35:04,558
Charlotte right and so uh we're writing

8287
08:35:04,558 --> 08:35:05,458
there

8288
08:35:05,458 --> 08:35:08,280
and uh you know Mr Francois Lugo the

8289
08:35:08,280 --> 08:35:11,398
Prime Minister of Quebec announces that

8290
08:35:11,398 --> 08:35:14,520
well you know this is on us right things

8291
08:35:14,520 --> 08:35:16,740
are happening and so we you can't have

8292
08:35:16,740 --> 08:35:19,200
any Gathering indoors more than 250

8293
08:35:19,200 --> 08:35:22,320
people right live when we're freaking

8294
08:35:22,320 --> 08:35:24,600
riding you know on the highway like on

8295
08:35:24,600 --> 08:35:27,420
the 20 and then

8296
08:35:27,420 --> 08:35:30,660
um so we stopped at a place and um

8297
08:35:30,660 --> 08:35:32,280
this is where you got to make tough

8298
08:35:32,280 --> 08:35:35,100
decisions right because if you make the

8299
08:35:35,100 --> 08:35:37,378
wrong decision you're losing the badges

8300
08:35:37,378 --> 08:35:38,580
and stuff like that right you're losing

8301
08:35:38,580 --> 08:35:40,020
70 grand right you're there's a company

8302
08:35:40,020 --> 08:35:41,760
in China that is supposed to be doing

8303
08:35:41,760 --> 08:35:43,378
some things for you and you've already

8304
08:35:43,378 --> 08:35:46,260
paid some amount of money and so

8305
08:35:46,260 --> 08:35:48,000
um you know we had lunch I don't even

8306
08:35:48,000 --> 08:35:51,000
remember what I ate what happened where

8307
08:35:51,000 --> 08:35:52,920
in what restaurant we had lunch it had

8308
08:35:52,920 --> 08:35:54,180
lots of screens that's all I remember

8309
08:35:54,180 --> 08:35:55,798
because like logo was on all these

8310
08:35:55,798 --> 08:35:56,638
screens

8311
08:35:56,638 --> 08:35:59,280
and uh was it was probably an ash no it

8312
08:35:59,280 --> 08:36:00,420
wasn't Ashton I don't think they don't

8313
08:36:00,420 --> 08:36:01,620
have lots of screens but you know

8314
08:36:01,620 --> 08:36:04,080
whatever it is and so yeah we had to

8315
08:36:04,080 --> 08:36:06,780
pull the plug on the badges that meaning

8316

emergency meeting while I was in a in a

8337
08:36:53,760 --> 08:36:56,398
chalet you know in in like uh based on

8338
08:36:56,398 --> 08:36:58,200
Pearl

8339
08:36:58,200 --> 08:36:59,580
and call the emergency meeting and

8340
08:36:59,580 --> 08:37:02,398
initially honestly initially my my

8341
08:37:02,398 --> 08:37:05,160
decision was you know that as a

8342
08:37:05,160 --> 08:37:06,240
president you got to make the

8343
08:37:06,240 --> 08:37:07,978
responsible choice right you got to be

8344
08:37:07,978 --> 08:37:09,600
the adult in the room right you we've

8345
08:37:09,600 --> 08:37:11,638
got crazy ideas crazy Concepts you have

8346
08:37:11,638 --> 08:37:14,040
to make the right choice and so as a

8347
08:37:14,040 --> 08:37:15,478
president my initial decision was like

8348
08:37:15,478 --> 08:37:17,520
oh well we'll just cancel it right it'll

8349
08:37:17,520 --> 08:37:19,978
be easier for everyone but I as a

8350
08:37:19,978 --> 08:37:21,600
president you don't

8351
08:37:21,600 --> 08:37:24,000
um in a volunteer organization you don't

8352
08:37:24,000 --> 08:37:26,100
rule by Authority right that's a trick

8353
08:37:26,100 --> 08:37:27,840
you learn of our time is you know none

8354
08:37:27,840 --> 08:37:29,398
of the people here that are volunteering

8355
08:37:29,398 --> 08:37:31,798
are paid you don't have any Authority so

8356
08:37:31,798 --> 08:37:34,020
you have your idea but you're gonna you

8357
08:37:34,020 --> 08:37:35,660
know have to see you know feel the room

8358
08:37:35,660 --> 08:37:39,718
the first initial feeling of the room of

8359
08:37:39,718 --> 08:37:41,520
the entire organizing comedy at that

8360
08:37:41,520 --> 08:37:44,398
time was well just do it online or just

8361
08:37:44,398 --> 08:37:47,218

8369
08:38:04,260 --> 08:38:05,940

8400
08:39:05,520 --> 08:39:07,200
anyway I didn't have anything prepared

8401
08:39:07,200 --> 08:39:09,660
and we're gonna move to the next era the

8402

last era because full food is ready and

8406
08:39:21,420 --> 08:39:23,780
in the back

8407
08:39:28,280 --> 08:39:33,120
is our cfp on the cfp and has been for a

8408
08:39:33,120 --> 08:39:34,440
long time

8409
08:39:34,440 --> 08:39:36,840
uh yeah a long time so she's part of the

8410
08:39:36,840 --> 08:39:39,360
OG's not OG's but almost like the

8411
08:39:39,360 --> 08:39:42,080
earlier's

8412
08:39:43,940 --> 08:39:46,020
I don't mean that I really don't mean

8413
08:39:46,020 --> 08:39:47,398
that but I think it's great that we're

8414
08:39:47,398 --> 08:39:52,378
getting new people yeah and you also uh

8415
08:39:52,378 --> 08:39:54,420
launched or spearheaded the the

8416
08:39:54,420 --> 08:39:57,420
community room which we're still unsure

8417
08:39:57,420 --> 08:39:59,218
about calling community room and

8418
08:39:59,218 --> 08:40:03,478
Villages but yeah so about this I want

8419
08:40:03,478 --> 08:40:06,240
to say you know I'm in the face of it

8420
08:40:06,240 --> 08:40:08,638
right now but I right there at the back

8421
08:40:08,638 --> 08:40:10,798
right in the alley hello dude you know

8422
08:40:10,798 --> 08:40:13,798
it's it's a common shared Vision by a

8423
08:40:13,798 --> 08:40:15,240
lot of people within the organization

8424
08:40:15,240 --> 08:40:17,040
committee it certainly isn't like a

8425
08:40:17,040 --> 08:40:20,360
one-person thing at all and you know

8426
08:40:20,360 --> 08:40:23,040
VP this year thank you because otherwise

8427
08:40:23,040 --> 08:40:25,920
none of this would be there

8428
08:40:25,920 --> 08:40:27,478
yeah obviously

8429
08:40:27,478 --> 08:40:30,058
but so uh yeah I guess we went through

8430
08:40:30,058 --> 08:40:31,558
the intro

8431
08:40:31,558 --> 08:40:33,958
um the so can you like there's there's

8432
08:40:33,958 --> 08:40:36,420
this thing it's a new object and now we

8433
08:40:36,420 --> 08:40:38,160
have the opportunity to explain it to

8434
08:40:38,160 --> 08:40:40,080
everyone right with more than a couple

8435
08:40:40,080 --> 08:40:43,200
of words uh how would you talk about the

8436
08:40:43,200 --> 08:40:44,700
community room how would you describe it

8437
08:40:44,700 --> 08:40:48,540
so do any conference you go you'll get

8438
08:40:48,540 --> 08:40:50,520
the opportunity to experiment things

8439
08:40:50,520 --> 08:40:53,340
you've never tried right but what we

8440
08:40:53,340 --> 08:40:55,138
wanted to do was to do a little bit more

8441
08:40:55,138 --> 08:40:56,878
than this right so at school you go to

8442
08:40:56,878 --> 08:40:59,160
this room and you get to learn soldering

8443
08:40:59,160 --> 08:41:00,360
if you've never done it or something

8444
08:41:00,360 --> 08:41:03,000
like this yeah yeah but but it's that

8445
08:41:03,000 --> 08:41:05,280
yay it's that moment where you're also

8446
08:41:05,280 --> 08:41:07,080
learning you know what's in your

8447
08:41:07,080 --> 08:41:09,718
environment oh I have this no there's

8448
08:41:09,718 --> 08:41:11,458
this Makerspace in my community and I

8449
08:41:11,458 --> 08:41:13,740
could go there or someone else is

8450
08:41:13,740 --> 08:41:15,958
passionate about climate change and how

8451
08:41:15,958 --> 08:41:18,000
it intersects with Community with in the

8452
08:41:18,000 --> 08:41:20,700
info second so it's having that space to

8453
08:41:20,700 --> 08:41:24,000
build those connections and not consider

8454
08:41:24,000 --> 08:41:26,458
you know you're not in a talk so you

8455
08:41:26,458 --> 08:41:28,798
know nosebleed brain activity it's not

8456
08:41:28,798 --> 08:41:30,540
just about having a break it's about

8457
08:41:30,540 --> 08:41:32,520
learning to engage and make this like

8458
08:41:32,520 --> 08:41:34,138
you know you're here you're passionate

8459
08:41:34,138 --> 08:41:35,820
about info stack you're passionate about

8460
08:41:35,820 --> 08:41:38,458
technology it's a whole of Life thing

8461
08:41:38,458 --> 08:41:41,160
for you well can we enrich that can we

8462
08:41:41,160 --> 08:41:42,898
connect that to other things at the week

8463
08:41:42,898 --> 08:41:44,878
and can we connect that to things are a

8464
08:41:44,878 --> 08:41:48,000
little bit less lateral right if we were

8465
08:41:48,000 --> 08:41:50,160
people were you know in computer science

8466
08:41:50,160 --> 08:41:52,440
in the very you know straightforward

8467
08:41:52,440 --> 08:41:55,558
thing about it we would go one way but

8468
08:41:55,558 --> 08:41:57,718
being creative helps us in our work it

8469
08:41:57,718 --> 08:41:58,920
helps us see things a little bit

8470
08:41:58,920 --> 08:42:00,360
differently so you need to kind of

8471
08:42:00,360 --> 08:42:02,820
enrich that with a bunch of things that

8472
08:42:02,820 --> 08:42:05,520
may or may not seem like they belong

8473
08:42:05,520 --> 08:42:07,798
because this is how you find out where

8474
08:42:07,798 --> 08:42:11,280
you as an individual belong and also how

8475
08:42:11,280 --> 08:42:12,958
you can include more people into this

8476
08:42:12,958 --> 08:42:14,638
because otherwise you know we'll we'll

8477
08:42:14,638 --> 08:42:16,558
keep doing things the same way and we'll

8478
08:42:16,558 --> 08:42:19,138
repeat the same mistakes so it's kind of

8479
08:42:19,138 --> 08:42:22,260
meta like it you know how you learn a

8480
08:42:22,260 --> 08:42:24,420
thing that isn't what you learn easily

8481
08:42:24,420 --> 08:42:26,580
helps you learn better things and more

8482
08:42:26,580 --> 08:42:30,298
things and that's that space in essence

8483
08:42:30,298 --> 08:42:33,298
and also you know I really really really

8484
08:42:33,298 --> 08:42:35,940
like Puzzles so you know puzzles

8485
08:42:35,940 --> 08:42:39,420
everywhere life is a CTF anyway yeah

8486
08:42:39,420 --> 08:42:42,660
so how would you like uh

8487
08:42:42,660 --> 08:42:46,260
I think a cfp is very well formatted and

8488
08:42:46,260 --> 08:42:49,138
people understand what the contract is

8489
08:42:49,138 --> 08:42:51,298
you know you do a pitch basically and

8490
08:42:51,298 --> 08:42:53,580
then it's rated and you get accepted but

8491
08:42:53,580 --> 08:42:55,558
so the process obviously for a community

8492
08:42:55,558 --> 08:43:00,360
room needs to be more uh uh handled how

8493
08:43:00,360 --> 08:43:02,760
like let's say someone has an idea and

8494
08:43:02,760 --> 08:43:05,718
and is unsure if it's a good idea or not

8495
08:43:05,718 --> 08:43:09,058
what would you recommend them do yeah so

8496
08:43:09,058 --> 08:43:11,520
that's a a thing we're looking to build

8497
08:43:11,520 --> 08:43:13,978
right the more we do community room the

8498
08:43:13,978 --> 08:43:15,660
more people know what it is and then

8499
08:43:15,660 --> 08:43:18,420
you're like okay I love sailing and I'd

8500
08:43:18,420 --> 08:43:20,700
love to explain how this works and now

8501
08:43:20,700 --> 08:43:23,398
you know this will become more real as

8502
08:43:23,398 --> 08:43:25,680
years go by I'd say the number one thing

8503
08:43:25,680 --> 08:43:27,780
is just throw yourself in the pool you

8504
08:43:27,780 --> 08:43:29,580
don't need to be a group of people you

8505
08:43:29,580 --> 08:43:31,978
can be one person two people and come in

8506
08:43:31,978 --> 08:43:36,000
with an idea and it we won't like

8507
08:43:36,000 --> 08:43:39,058
when you when you submit to the cfp we

8508
08:43:39,058 --> 08:43:41,040
judge you right we want this to be

8509
08:43:41,040 --> 08:43:42,958
watertight we want this to be perfect

8510
08:43:42,958 --> 08:43:45,660
for Community nurse moment if you're

8511
08:43:45,660 --> 08:43:48,898
thinking about something that could work

8512
08:43:48,898 --> 08:43:51,180
or may not or you would do it but it's

8513
08:43:51,180 --> 08:43:52,740
expensive and you don't have the

8514
08:43:52,740 --> 08:43:54,120
resources to do it or you would do it

8515
08:43:54,120 --> 08:43:56,218
but you know someone would be far better

8516
08:43:56,218 --> 08:43:58,138
than you at this but you just want for

8517
08:43:58,138 --> 08:43:59,638
it to exist

8518
08:43:59,638 --> 08:44:02,760
then you know talk to us and the thing

8519
08:44:02,760 --> 08:44:05,040
is cfp is great for talks because the

8520
08:44:05,040 --> 08:44:07,020
talk you know you sit down you write it

8521
08:44:07,020 --> 08:44:09,000
out and you're good but for these types

8522
08:44:09,000 --> 08:44:11,160
of things it can take a longer time

8523
08:44:11,160 --> 08:44:13,500
right you're building this out well

8524
08:44:13,500 --> 08:44:15,660
maybe we need to talk in the summer so

8525
08:44:15,660 --> 08:44:17,280
what I'd say is you know you're all in

8526
08:44:17,280 --> 08:44:18,180
Discord

8527
08:44:18,180 --> 08:44:20,940
I'm Dengue with many eyes at the end on

8528
08:44:20,940 --> 08:44:23,280
Discord like reach out let's just chat

8529
08:44:23,280 --> 08:44:24,898
you know there's there's if it's a bad

8530
08:44:24,898 --> 08:44:27,478
idea I will tell you my I spend my days

8531
08:44:27,478 --> 08:44:29,458
having bad bad ideas I have a lot of

8532
08:44:29,458 --> 08:44:31,020
experience set up so don't don't worry

8533
08:44:31,020 --> 08:44:33,058
about it you won't face me I have worse

8534
08:44:33,058 --> 08:44:35,160
ideas than you do I'm sure so that's

8535
08:44:35,160 --> 08:44:36,360
what I would say

8536
08:44:36,360 --> 08:44:38,218
um yeah so there will be as every year

8537
08:44:38,218 --> 08:44:40,500
there's a cfp period but don't don't

8538
08:44:40,500 --> 08:44:42,958
have to stop you you know and if cfp is

8539
08:44:42,958 --> 08:44:46,440
closed and your idea just came talk to

8540
08:44:46,440 --> 08:44:49,080
us it's you know we're in a huge space

8541
08:44:49,080 --> 08:44:51,478
and even if we were to go elsewhere I

8542
08:44:51,478 --> 08:44:53,878
don't see us going into a smaller thing

8543
08:44:53,878 --> 08:44:56,700
I haven't seen nordsec get smaller at

8544
08:44:56,700 --> 08:44:59,040
all so so don't be too concerned about

8545
08:44:59,040 --> 08:45:00,840
that what I would be concerned about is

8546
08:45:00,840 --> 08:45:02,878
staying silent right if you went to the

8547
08:45:02,878 --> 08:45:04,860
room today and were like oh I wish I

8548
08:45:04,860 --> 08:45:06,240
wish they had this

8549
08:45:06,240 --> 08:45:09,420
like come to us this is you know

8550
08:45:09,420 --> 08:45:11,820
there's a hacker Spirit Break things you

8551
08:45:11,820 --> 08:45:13,320
know avoid the warranty do all those

8552
08:45:13,320 --> 08:45:14,700
things there's also the maker Spirit

8553
08:45:14,700 --> 08:45:17,878
like get it done get get it done take it

8554
08:45:17,878 --> 08:45:19,260
do it

8555
08:45:19,260 --> 08:45:22,320
No One's Gonna Stop you social engineer

8556
08:45:22,320 --> 08:45:24,420
your way into a better world I'm I'm

8557
08:45:24,420 --> 08:45:26,040
kidding but I mean like like pick it up

8558
08:45:26,040 --> 08:45:27,898
for real because we only have so many

8559
08:45:27,898 --> 08:45:29,520
hands and

8560
08:45:29,520 --> 08:45:33,360

08:45:37,020 --> 08:45:38,820
thing I want to say also like it's not

8564
08:45:38,820 --> 08:45:40,860
just for what's in front of you it's

8565
08:45:40,860 --> 08:45:42,840
also to articulate things like maybe you

8566
08:45:42,840 --> 08:45:45,840
know I'm crying at the temples like

8567
08:45:45,840 --> 08:45:48,540
if there's things you used to see in

8568
08:45:48,540 --> 08:45:51,600
hacker cause and you no longer see

8569
08:45:51,600 --> 08:45:54,180
it's culture we need to keep our culture

8570
08:45:54,180 --> 08:45:57,058
alive so bring it yep that's a great

8571
08:45:57,058 --> 08:45:58,798
great answer

8572
08:45:58,798 --> 08:46:00,600
um I'm gonna I'm gonna switch question

8573
08:46:00,600 --> 08:46:02,878
last minute because I was going for the

8574
08:46:02,878 --> 08:46:05,340
other one but I I'll take this one as a

8575
08:46:05,340 --> 08:46:07,100
parent oh no

8576
08:46:07,100 --> 08:46:10,320
see what I'm going no

8577
08:46:10,320 --> 08:46:13,740
uh with a successful professional career

8578
08:46:13,740 --> 08:46:16,138
involved in northseek at the vice

8579
08:46:16,138 --> 08:46:18,298
president's level

8580
08:46:18,298 --> 08:46:21,240
um with limited time like how do you

8581
08:46:21,240 --> 08:46:24,120
manage your time and advice for people

8582
08:46:24,120 --> 08:46:28,700
who are inspired by by this club

8583
08:46:31,740 --> 08:46:36,780
like it you do something every day I and

8584
08:46:36,780 --> 08:46:38,878
it's the same for my learning I have you

8585
08:46:38,878 --> 08:46:40,680
know if it's going to be 15 minutes I

8586
08:46:40,680 --> 08:46:42,540
look out my week I'm like ugh this is

8587
08:46:42,540 --> 08:46:45,000
going to be tough but you create those

8588
08:46:45,000 --> 08:46:48,360
habits and you stick to it the there's

8589
08:46:48,360 --> 08:46:50,940
no you know there's no sugar coating it

8590
08:46:50,940 --> 08:46:52,378
there's times in the year where it's

8591
08:46:52,378 --> 08:46:54,478
like it is a lot

8592
08:46:54,478 --> 08:46:58,200
but it feeds you and I guarantee you if

8593
08:46:58,200 --> 08:46:59,940
you're focusing on the mundane stuff

8594
08:46:59,940 --> 08:47:01,860
that you feel you have to get done all

8595
08:47:01,860 --> 08:47:03,840
the time it just drags you down

8596
08:47:03,840 --> 08:47:06,000
but if you focus on the things that feed

8597
08:47:06,000 --> 08:47:07,320
you and build you up yeah they're

8598
08:47:07,320 --> 08:47:09,360
difficult like but but doing the

8599
08:47:09,360 --> 08:47:10,680
difficult stuff is what makes it

8600
08:47:10,680 --> 08:47:12,240
worthwhile right and if you're a parent

8601
08:47:12,240 --> 08:47:14,100
you know it like there's a ton of the

8602
08:47:14,100 --> 08:47:16,138
difficult stuff you would never question

8603
08:47:16,138 --> 08:47:17,638
that it's worthwhile at the end of the

8604
08:47:17,638 --> 08:47:19,740
day hello kid I'm not getting woken up

8605
08:47:19,740 --> 08:47:22,020
at 5am to rewarding yay no but I mean

8606
08:47:22,020 --> 08:47:24,478
like the difficult stuff oftentimes ends

8607
08:47:24,478 --> 08:47:25,978
up matching up with the stuff that is

8608
08:47:25,978 --> 08:47:27,840
super worthwhile and

8609
08:47:27,840 --> 08:47:30,898
go for it you know like I I'm not I

8610
08:47:30,898 --> 08:47:32,820
don't think there's anything exceptional

8611
08:47:32,820 --> 08:47:35,820
and the things I do other than I'm

8612
08:47:35,820 --> 08:47:38,520
exceptionally driven to get them done

8613
08:47:38,520 --> 08:47:41,760
let's keep and it excuse me

8614
08:47:41,760 --> 08:47:44,160
another great answer thank you so

8615
08:47:44,160 --> 08:47:46,700
although uh

8616
08:47:46,700 --> 08:47:50,160
and we're gonna have our next guest uh

8617
08:47:50,160 --> 08:47:53,420
who needs no introduction

8618
08:47:54,520 --> 08:48:01,320
[Applause]

8619
08:48:01,320 --> 08:48:04,920
hi hello uh so long is a challenge

8620
08:48:04,920 --> 08:48:06,180
designer

8621
08:48:06,180 --> 08:48:08,718
obviously

8622
08:48:08,718 --> 08:48:11,458
a long time challenge designer are you

8623
08:48:11,458 --> 08:48:13,200
you're what's the first year you

8624
08:48:13,200 --> 08:48:14,458
designed challenges oh they're very

8625
08:48:14,458 --> 08:48:17,398
actually the hacker so before yeah minus

8626
08:48:17,398 --> 08:48:20,040
one yes okay okay so you you didn't play

8627
08:48:20,040 --> 08:48:21,780
in any North SEC you were already

8628
08:48:21,780 --> 08:48:23,760
challenged designer correct all right so

8629
08:48:23,760 --> 08:48:27,180
10 year 11 years challenge designer

8630
08:48:27,180 --> 08:48:29,700
um how many challenges do you think you

8631
08:48:29,700 --> 08:48:31,860
have delivered in total excluding

8632
08:48:31,860 --> 08:48:34,558
trivias excluding trivials I figure

8633
08:48:34,558 --> 08:48:37,620
perhaps let's say six or seven per year

8634
08:48:37,620 --> 08:48:40,798
so I'd say roughly 77.

8635
08:48:40,798 --> 08:48:44,057
all right that's good

8636
08:48:45,240 --> 08:48:49,320
at an average of of points let's say a

8637
08:48:49,320 --> 08:48:51,840
three points average that would be yeah

8638
08:48:51,840 --> 08:48:54,120
that would be you're you're like uh your

8639
08:48:54,120 --> 08:48:56,398
career your North set career is like a

8640
08:48:56,398 --> 08:48:58,798
third of an or it's a regular North SEC

8641
08:48:58,798 --> 08:49:01,440
so the funny thing is and that's amazing

8642
08:49:01,440 --> 08:49:04,200
about nordsec is the very first year we

8643
08:49:04,200 --> 08:49:06,320
were very few there was like

8644
08:49:06,320 --> 08:49:08,700
was doing some and I was doing some but

8645
08:49:08,700 --> 08:49:10,798
you know individually we did a pretty

8646
08:49:10,798 --> 08:49:13,260
big part of the CTF because we were like

8647
08:49:13,260 --> 08:49:15,600
five so if one of us messed up it was 20

8648
08:49:15,600 --> 08:49:19,020
of the CTF no for real nowadays we're

8649
08:49:19,020 --> 08:49:23,160
like 60. so it's amazing how much this

8650
08:49:23,160 --> 08:49:25,920
is more reliable how much we can rely on

8651
08:49:25,920 --> 08:49:27,840
one another and that's basically built

8652
08:49:27,840 --> 08:49:31,260
on this community so I am very thankful

8653
08:49:31,260 --> 08:49:34,080
that I am a minute my new tiny part of

8654
08:49:34,080 --> 08:49:36,058
northseek now since that there's so many

8655
08:49:36,058 --> 08:49:39,378
great child designers around

8656
08:49:39,958 --> 08:49:42,540
um what are your best stories around

8657
08:49:42,540 --> 08:49:44,700
challenges anything comes up to mind

8658
08:49:44,700 --> 08:49:46,798
there were some amazing challenges when

8659
08:49:46,798 --> 08:49:49,260
I had well the personal one I had was uh

8660
08:49:49,260 --> 08:49:51,540
I had a key grinding Challenge and

8661
08:49:51,540 --> 08:49:53,878
people brought dremels and stuff and

8662
08:49:53,878 --> 08:49:55,978
what it was like flying Sparks all over

8663
08:49:55,978 --> 08:49:57,840
the security guy was super worried how

8664
08:49:57,840 --> 08:49:59,700
come people were doing that was pretty

8665
08:49:59,700 --> 08:50:03,298
fun there was a fabled uh bag of chips

8666
08:50:03,298 --> 08:50:05,940
if you recall that there was a vibrating

8667
08:50:05,940 --> 08:50:08,520
stack of chips that you had to

8668
08:50:08,520 --> 08:50:10,440
um decode the word around that was

8669
08:50:10,440 --> 08:50:12,898
really nice there were some really cool

8670
08:50:12,898 --> 08:50:14,520
challenges but those two come to mind

8671
08:50:14,520 --> 08:50:17,100
actually

8672
08:50:17,100 --> 08:50:19,440
um I wanted to elaborate elaborate on

8673
08:50:19,440 --> 08:50:22,680
your obsession about captures all right

8674
08:50:22,680 --> 08:50:26,878
so yes I really really like captchas I

8675
08:50:26,878 --> 08:50:28,620
feel they're clever they're a good way

8676
08:50:28,620 --> 08:50:32,458
to bring different abstract challenges

8677
08:50:32,458 --> 08:50:34,200
and you can talk about crypto about race

8678
08:50:34,200 --> 08:50:37,860
conditions about logic flaws and nobody

8679
08:50:37,860 --> 08:50:39,660
really cares about captcha in real life

8680
08:50:39,660 --> 08:50:42,500
but I am an Enthusiast some would say

8681
08:50:42,500 --> 08:50:46,260
fanatic and I really like to bring in 10

8682
08:50:46,260 --> 08:50:49,558
years I've done 14 capture challenges so

8683
08:50:49,558 --> 08:50:51,120
yeah

8684
08:50:51,120 --> 08:50:53,820
I'm I really really like captures that's

8685
08:50:53,820 --> 08:50:55,680
a hint for Preparation if I ever heard

8686
08:50:55,680 --> 08:50:56,458
one

8687
08:50:56,458 --> 08:50:58,920
the funny thing is one year I keep

8688
08:50:58,920 --> 08:51:01,138
reading that story the very first year

8689
08:51:01,138 --> 08:51:03,718
we had you had to solve 500 capture by

8690
08:51:03,718 --> 08:51:07,740
hand and the lenatus forward thing or a

8691
08:51:07,740 --> 08:51:09,958
team did it by hand like they had

8692
08:51:09,958 --> 08:51:12,478
dissolved it two people it took them

8693
08:51:12,478 --> 08:51:14,280
their whole weekend because if you

8694
08:51:14,280 --> 08:51:16,978
missed it once you had to start over and

8695
08:51:16,978 --> 08:51:19,798
we gave them a Python programming book

8696
08:51:19,798 --> 08:51:22,280
as a gift

8697
08:51:23,760 --> 08:51:25,798
uh that's another one another great

8698
08:51:25,798 --> 08:51:27,058
story

8699
08:51:27,058 --> 08:51:28,920
um how would you describe the approach

8700
08:51:28,920 --> 08:51:32,458
to designing a great challenge so I'm

8701
08:51:32,458 --> 08:51:33,958
really thinking about this because it's

8702
08:51:33,958 --> 08:51:36,000
super challenging because once when you

8703
08:51:36,000 --> 08:51:37,500
know the challenge when you know the

8704
08:51:37,500 --> 08:51:39,780
solution is obvious so the rule now that

8705
08:51:39,780 --> 08:51:41,700
we try is

8706
08:51:41,700 --> 08:51:44,160
what to do should be very obvious the

8707
08:51:44,160 --> 08:51:46,978
how can be very hard but never a child

8708
08:51:46,978 --> 08:51:49,080
in front of a challenge you should ask

8709
08:51:49,080 --> 08:51:51,958
yourself I have no idea what to do for

8710
08:51:51,958 --> 08:51:56,040
example uh in past years I had a web app

8711
08:51:56,040 --> 08:51:57,660
challenge that you that there was like

8712
08:51:57,660 --> 08:52:00,540
one function called search it was the

8713
08:52:00,540 --> 08:52:05,160
very only input in the page so anyone

8714
08:52:05,160 --> 08:52:07,138
trying to hack a web page would say gee

8715
08:52:07,138 --> 08:52:09,660
I have one input I wonder which one

8716
08:52:09,660 --> 08:52:11,940
should it be right so the idea is for it

8717
08:52:11,940 --> 08:52:13,978
to make it as simple as possible on the

8718
08:52:13,978 --> 08:52:16,378
what to do and under how there were

8719
08:52:16,378 --> 08:52:18,540
people having zero days in cryptography

8720
08:52:18,540 --> 08:52:20,760
like somehow were very very difficult

8721
08:52:20,760 --> 08:52:24,180
some challenges were pretty insane

8722
08:52:24,180 --> 08:52:27,000
thank you all right I would like you to

8723
08:52:27,000 --> 08:52:30,420
see all right for the next uh yeah shift

8724
08:52:30,420 --> 08:52:33,298
left I guess from our perspective uh I

8725
08:52:33,298 --> 08:52:35,638
would like to invite David Goulet on the

8726
08:52:35,638 --> 08:52:37,378
stage

8727
08:52:37,378 --> 08:52:42,200
or as we affectionately call him

8728
08:52:42,360 --> 08:52:44,280
um so David is part of the

8729
08:52:44,280 --> 08:52:47,160
infrastructure team now he's a North set

8730
08:52:47,160 --> 08:52:50,878
contributor since Inception former VP of

8731
08:52:50,878 --> 08:52:53,458
the CTF

8732
08:52:53,458 --> 08:52:55,558
um oh yeah yeah yeah exactly that's the

8733
08:52:55,558 --> 08:52:58,440
thing so before North SEC hackers

8734
08:52:58,440 --> 08:53:01,500
existed it's a different beast but it

8735
08:53:01,500 --> 08:53:04,138
had it shared a lot of uh of common

8736
08:53:04,138 --> 08:53:06,740
values and people

8737
08:53:06,740 --> 08:53:10,440
uh so David was a Founder I think of the

8738
08:53:10,440 --> 08:53:12,000
hackers

8739
08:53:12,000 --> 08:53:15,240
um okay but that's a tangent

8740
08:53:15,240 --> 08:53:16,558
um

8741
08:53:16,558 --> 08:53:19,020
is okay my first question I mean I

8742
08:53:19,020 --> 08:53:22,020
didn't do a bio weapon I'm sorry okay is

8743
08:53:22,020 --> 08:53:24,360
it true that you are the one who

8744
08:53:24,360 --> 08:53:26,818
introduced the scooters

8745
08:53:26,818 --> 08:53:28,740
that's not

8746
08:53:28,740 --> 08:53:31,260
uh yeah I think at some point I was

8747
08:53:31,260 --> 08:53:34,260
really sick of walking uh over and over

8748
08:53:34,260 --> 08:53:37,378
again and yeah we we did uh I did ask

8749
08:53:37,378 --> 08:53:39,718
for for the for the small scooters and

8750
08:53:39,718 --> 08:53:42,600
actually Kevin which was the or you know

8751
08:53:42,600 --> 08:53:45,780
with us at that time when to buy three

8752
08:53:45,780 --> 08:53:48,958
of them and they were 40 pound maximum

8753
08:53:48,958 --> 08:53:51,500
so scooter

8754
08:53:51,500 --> 08:53:55,318
a very small green and we still have one

8755
08:53:55,318 --> 08:53:58,440
working 10 years later

8756
08:53:58,440 --> 08:54:01,260
so why are they necessary like for

8757
08:54:01,260 --> 08:54:04,378
people who don't build nordsec oh well

8758
08:54:04,378 --> 08:54:06,540
we we I mean we you've seen the size of

8759
08:54:06,540 --> 08:54:08,520
these rooms we go over and over again

8760
08:54:08,520 --> 08:54:10,798
and we oh we forgot the cutter we forgot

8761
08:54:10,798 --> 08:54:13,138
the we forgot this this Gizmo blah blah

8762
08:54:13,138 --> 08:54:16,798
blah we run wires but only that but uh

8763
08:54:16,798 --> 08:54:19,620
and these years the late the the last

8764
08:54:19,620 --> 08:54:21,540
couple years uh almost everything is

8765
08:54:21,540 --> 08:54:24,120
Wi-Fi but before that we had to run you

8766
08:54:24,120 --> 08:54:27,058
know hundreds of wires uh and so the

8767
08:54:27,058 --> 08:54:29,100
scooters became You Know instrumental in

8768
08:54:29,100 --> 08:54:31,978
our livelihood all right so it's not

8769
08:54:31,978 --> 08:54:34,740
just for to roam around looking cool

8770
08:54:34,740 --> 08:54:36,660
right it's not that the hacker movie

8771
08:54:36,660 --> 08:54:39,840
style longboard and uh no not at

8772
08:54:39,840 --> 08:54:42,240
all not at all has a practical side to

8773
08:54:42,240 --> 08:54:44,638
it it is true story

8774
08:54:44,638 --> 08:54:47,398
um so can you talk about hackers like

8775
08:54:47,398 --> 08:54:49,138
what what is it for people who don't

8776
08:54:49,138 --> 08:54:53,520
know so a long story short uh 12 30 it

8777
08:54:53,520 --> 08:54:57,058
was in 2009 uh we uh a couple of friends

8778
08:54:57,058 --> 08:54:59,100
of mine uh I don't think they're in the

8779
08:54:59,100 --> 08:55:01,558
room right now but we went to this uh

8780
08:55:01,558 --> 08:55:06,378
contest it was uh created by the Kim

8781
08:55:06,740 --> 08:55:09,920
there you go

8782
08:55:09,920 --> 08:55:13,020
and they created this contest and the

8783
08:55:13,020 --> 08:55:14,638
entire point of this contest I think was

8784
08:55:14,638 --> 08:55:16,920
to bring people from different

8785
08:55:16,920 --> 08:55:20,878
universities in college and uh exposed

8786
08:55:20,878 --> 08:55:22,680
them to cyber security and at the end

8787
08:55:22,680 --> 08:55:24,780
they were this a bunch of private

8788
08:55:24,780 --> 08:55:27,298
Corporation trying to hire us and I

8789
08:55:27,298 --> 08:55:29,100
think that was the whole idea so we had

8790
08:55:29,100 --> 08:55:33,958
some fun but not really so we ended up

8791
08:55:33,958 --> 08:55:35,700
talking on the way back because we were

8792
08:55:35,700 --> 08:55:36,958
studying at sherbrook in the University

8793
08:55:36,958 --> 08:55:39,000
of sherbrook which is an hour and uh

8794
08:55:39,000 --> 08:55:41,280
almost two hours from here and uh with

8795
08:55:41,280 --> 08:55:42,718
this like maybe we could do something

8796
08:55:42,718 --> 08:55:44,520
better than this maybe you're gonna have

8797
08:55:44,520 --> 08:55:46,440
like more fun introduce some New Concept

8798
08:55:46,440 --> 08:55:48,120
existing concept like the accurate

8799
08:55:48,120 --> 08:55:49,978
Jeopardy that you know has been existing

8800
08:55:49,978 --> 08:55:53,700
in Defcon for a long time and CCC uh and

8801
08:55:53,700 --> 08:55:56,100
so we we were three at that time and we

8802
08:55:56,100 --> 08:55:58,558
started uh

8803
08:55:58,558 --> 08:56:01,260
um discussing few couple weeks later we

8804
08:56:01,260 --> 08:56:04,318
created us which is AC us is very clever

8805
08:56:04,318 --> 08:56:07,040
thing you know hack us you get it okay

8806
08:56:07,040 --> 08:56:09,898
but also act Universe for sure book so

8807
08:56:09,898 --> 08:56:13,318
uh us and

8808
08:56:13,318 --> 08:56:15,298
um we started this and the first edition

8809
08:56:15,298 --> 08:56:19,680
was run in 2010 with 67 people and I was

8810
08:56:19,680 --> 08:56:22,440
actually in the cafeteria of the the

8811
08:56:22,440 --> 08:56:24,840
university and actually was pretty fun

8812
08:56:24,840 --> 08:56:26,898
it was indeed I remember

8813
08:56:26,898 --> 08:56:29,458
uh we were playing with Amish security

8814
08:56:29,458 --> 08:56:32,280
back then having lots of fun

8815
08:56:32,280 --> 08:56:34,440
um so what motivates you to keep giving

8816
08:56:34,440 --> 08:56:37,920
a considerable amount of time to nordsec

8817
08:56:37,920 --> 08:56:41,100
after 11 years plus hackers plus the one

8818
08:56:41,100 --> 08:56:44,540
year off what means like it's 15 years

8819
08:56:44,540 --> 08:56:49,080
career contributing not for as a player

8820
08:56:49,080 --> 08:56:52,680
but as a giver a builder of worlds for

8821
08:56:52,680 --> 08:56:55,680
others uh I mean it's pretty fun a lot

8822
08:56:55,680 --> 08:56:57,420
of people came before here that says

8823
08:56:57,420 --> 08:56:59,160
that you know they meet people and then

8824
08:56:59,160 --> 08:57:01,080
it just actually very true we meet a lot

8825
08:57:01,080 --> 08:57:02,580
of people it's extremely fun the

8826
08:57:02,580 --> 08:57:04,860
logistics of it but there's one thing

8827
08:57:04,860 --> 08:57:08,100
that is uh very very cool for me is and

8828
08:57:08,100 --> 08:57:09,120
I used to do that I don't do that

8829
08:57:09,120 --> 08:57:10,440
anymore but it was the challenge

8830
08:57:10,440 --> 08:57:11,878
designer

8831
08:57:11,878 --> 08:57:14,700
and through eight months of work you do

8832
08:57:14,700 --> 08:57:16,318
this challenge it comes to and it

8833
08:57:16,318 --> 08:57:18,420
becomes the thing that you polish that

8834
08:57:18,420 --> 08:57:20,760
you love that you ate and everything and

8835
08:57:20,760 --> 08:57:23,100
then for two days people go at it and

8836
08:57:23,100 --> 08:57:24,660
that is the most amazing experience ever

8837
08:57:24,660 --> 08:57:26,100
because then you have so much fun

8838
08:57:26,100 --> 08:57:30,120
looking at people sweating enjoying and

8839
08:57:30,120 --> 08:57:33,298
and so that is a big driver for me and

8840
08:57:33,298 --> 08:57:35,040
for a lot of challenge designers so I

8841
08:57:35,040 --> 08:57:36,660
encourage everyone here that wants to

8842
08:57:36,660 --> 08:57:39,478
challenge to actually join the team uh

8843
08:57:39,478 --> 08:57:42,120
but apart from that why am I still doing

8844
08:57:42,120 --> 08:57:45,120
this and not the challenge uh I think

8845
08:57:45,120 --> 08:57:46,558
it's just fun yeah

8846
08:57:46,558 --> 08:57:50,638
fun excellent so it's time now to bring

8847
08:57:50,638 --> 08:57:54,478
the last guest the OG president

8848
08:57:54,478 --> 08:57:57,620
Gabriel probably come up on stage please

8849
08:57:57,620 --> 08:58:04,649
[Applause]

8850
08:58:05,818 --> 08:58:08,218
all right Gabrielle you were president I

8851
08:58:08,218 --> 08:58:10,200
didn't realize just how long your tenure

8852
08:58:10,200 --> 08:58:13,260
was before I wrote this it's PTSD every

8853
08:58:13,260 --> 08:58:15,478
time we speak you were president from

8854
08:58:15,478 --> 08:58:19,318
2013 to 2018

8855
08:58:19,318 --> 08:58:22,440
um to maintain and create an event like

8856
08:58:22,440 --> 08:58:25,680
this is a great accomplishment so what

8857
08:58:25,680 --> 08:58:29,280
is North sex original idea

8858
08:58:29,280 --> 08:58:31,740
idea it's not an idea but it's cool

8859
08:58:31,740 --> 08:58:33,840
because David is there

8860
08:58:33,840 --> 08:58:37,978
um a short story long which is usually

8861
08:58:37,978 --> 08:58:39,298
the Universe

8862
08:58:39,298 --> 08:58:41,940
um for for the people we weren't there

8863
08:58:41,940 --> 08:58:45,180
back in the days we used to love doing

8864
08:58:45,180 --> 08:58:47,940
cyber security but we felt a bit alone

8865
08:58:47,940 --> 08:58:49,440
so

8866
08:58:49,440 --> 08:58:51,360
um we had this competition in Sherbrooke

8867
08:58:51,360 --> 08:58:53,878
called hackers where we would go we

8868
08:58:53,878 --> 08:58:56,040
would compete and we would really

8869
08:58:56,040 --> 08:58:58,580
succeed at it just to say

8870
08:58:58,580 --> 08:59:01,080
and then the people that were competing

8871
08:59:01,080 --> 08:59:03,660
with us we were building team and the

8872
08:59:03,660 --> 08:59:05,940
team that was organizing back then the

8873
08:59:05,940 --> 08:59:09,120
the uh the competition we decided to get

8874
08:59:09,120 --> 08:59:11,580
together and build a team to do

8875
08:59:11,580 --> 08:59:14,878
International CDF to go and do the

8876
08:59:14,878 --> 08:59:18,600
Defcon course to go to ictf and mo a lot

8877
08:59:18,600 --> 08:59:21,360
of us met during these days

8878
08:59:21,360 --> 08:59:23,818
um but there was it's funny because we

8879
08:59:23,818 --> 08:59:26,000
had a we had a good success back then

8880
08:59:26,000 --> 08:59:30,540
but we had a problem we had difficulties

8881
08:59:30,540 --> 08:59:32,160
recruiting new people

8882
08:59:32,160 --> 08:59:35,580
because back then the amount of elite

8883
08:59:35,580 --> 08:59:36,600
level

8884
08:59:36,600 --> 08:59:39,478
security pen tester was kind of limited

8885
08:59:39,478 --> 08:59:41,280
and

8886
08:59:41,280 --> 08:59:43,378
um there was this this competition in

8887
08:59:43,378 --> 08:59:45,180
sherbrock that kind of

8888
08:59:45,180 --> 08:59:48,000
it did this time it was in sherbrock

8889
08:59:48,000 --> 08:59:50,580
they had problem financing themselves is

8890
08:59:50,580 --> 08:59:53,100
it yeah it's fine that's what happened

8891
08:59:53,100 --> 08:59:55,798
um so we were looking for ways to

8892
08:59:55,798 --> 08:59:58,260
recruit more people and we thought like

8893
08:59:58,260 --> 09:00:00,478
that would be nice if we built something

8894
09:00:00,478 --> 09:00:03,718
in Montreal like just a CTF just to

8895
09:00:03,718 --> 09:00:06,360
train people in what we were doing it's

8896
09:00:06,360 --> 09:00:09,120
it's as stupid as that so we decided to

8897
09:00:09,120 --> 09:00:11,940
build a competition that would be as

8898
09:00:11,940 --> 09:00:15,298
hard as the we were doing uh on the

8899
09:00:15,298 --> 09:00:18,058
international scene which was like nose

8900
09:00:18,058 --> 09:00:20,940
bleeding level at back then

8901
09:00:20,940 --> 09:00:22,860
um so slowly but surely we built that

8902
09:00:22,860 --> 09:00:25,440
competition that was I remember one of

8903
09:00:25,440 --> 09:00:27,120
the the first goal we gave ourselves was

8904
09:00:27,120 --> 09:00:29,340
you shouldn't be able to do all the

8905
09:00:29,340 --> 09:00:32,878
flags like it should be so hard that if

8906
09:00:32,878 --> 09:00:36,240
you manage to do a flag or two you had a

8907
09:00:36,240 --> 09:00:38,458
good competition

8908
09:00:38,458 --> 09:00:40,558
um so it was it was the basic idea

8909
09:00:40,558 --> 09:00:42,478
because it was out of a need that was

8910
09:00:42,478 --> 09:00:46,200
the need so I went to to the old people

8911
09:00:46,200 --> 09:00:49,138
that were doing hackers which stopped

8912
09:00:49,138 --> 09:00:51,660
back then and I said why don't we move

8913
09:00:51,660 --> 09:00:53,638
it to Montreal why don't we rename it

8914
09:00:53,638 --> 09:00:55,860
why don't we rebuild the way it's done

8915
09:00:55,860 --> 09:00:57,718
why don't we just change the way it's

8916
09:00:57,718 --> 09:01:01,680
financed and this is how literally

8917
09:01:01,680 --> 09:01:04,920
nutsack came to be as a way to become

8918
09:01:04,920 --> 09:01:08,218
better at what we were doing

8919
09:01:08,218 --> 09:01:11,058
yeah great answer

8920
09:01:14,700 --> 09:01:18,420
and so from there how did you decide to

8921
09:01:18,420 --> 09:01:21,740
grow from a CTF to a week-long event

8922
09:01:21,740 --> 09:01:24,898
spanning training conference and CTF

8923
09:01:24,898 --> 09:01:29,458
what I call today North sex Festival

8924
09:01:29,458 --> 09:01:33,120
so a fun fact being poor when you make

8925
09:01:33,120 --> 09:01:37,440
an event sucks like you have to make

8926
09:01:37,440 --> 09:01:39,420
everything happen and I the first year

8927
09:01:39,420 --> 09:01:42,298
we had 5K as a budget that was that was

8928
09:01:42,298 --> 09:01:44,940
the budget 5K yeah that was five five

8929
09:01:44,940 --> 09:01:47,580
thousand dollars but the room was free

8930
09:01:47,580 --> 09:01:51,840
at ETS so so fair enough that was solved

8931
09:01:51,840 --> 09:01:54,540
um so we ran at least I think one year

8932
09:01:54,540 --> 09:01:57,420
and I I thought to myself and the guys I

8933
09:01:57,420 --> 09:02:00,360
said and it was only guys back then

8934
09:02:00,360 --> 09:02:02,878
sorry about that we weren't that good

8935
09:02:02,878 --> 09:02:06,298
um so I said if we want to grow we need

8936
09:02:06,298 --> 09:02:09,058
money and what's the best way to make

8937
09:02:09,058 --> 09:02:11,280
money let's do a conference

8938
09:02:11,280 --> 09:02:13,920
because and that was it that the idea

8939
09:02:13,920 --> 09:02:16,680
was that the conference probably will be

8940
09:02:16,680 --> 09:02:19,500
able to fund the CTF and believe it

8941
09:02:19,500 --> 09:02:21,958
worked like we we recruited yeah David

8942
09:02:21,958 --> 09:02:24,240
back then and we told him like you want

8943
09:02:24,240 --> 09:02:25,978
to make a conference because we need

8944
09:02:25,978 --> 09:02:29,398
money he said like I can do that and

8945
09:02:29,398 --> 09:02:32,100
that's how it came to be and a couple of

8946
09:02:32,100 --> 09:02:34,798
years later we had we were here now it

8947
09:02:34,798 --> 09:02:37,440
was amazing but we were still really

8948
09:02:37,440 --> 09:02:40,020
poor like we weren't able to do like

8949
09:02:40,020 --> 09:02:42,600
crazy stuff like like you see these days

8950
09:02:42,600 --> 09:02:46,020
so we went to see I think it was you

8951
09:02:46,020 --> 09:02:48,298
and we told you we need money you want

8952
09:02:48,298 --> 09:02:51,240
to do trainings and that's our training

8953
09:02:51,240 --> 09:02:54,240
came to be out of necessity so training

8954
09:02:54,240 --> 09:02:56,580
Were Meant to fund the gun friends so

8955
09:02:56,580 --> 09:02:58,138
the conference could fund the

8956
09:02:58,138 --> 09:03:00,000
competition

8957
09:03:00,000 --> 09:03:02,058
yeah that worked

8958
09:03:02,058 --> 09:03:04,378
but that's pretty much how it came to be

8959
09:03:04,378 --> 09:03:06,420
so This Is How They even grow out of

8960
09:03:06,420 --> 09:03:10,200
necessity to fund the CDF

8961
09:03:10,200 --> 09:03:15,558
so you talk yeah go ahead clap clap clap

8962
09:03:17,040 --> 09:03:19,680
so I have like I guess so we're uh short

8963
09:03:19,680 --> 09:03:21,540
on time it's my fault

8964
09:03:21,540 --> 09:03:24,298
um but I have two angles here we can

8965
09:03:24,298 --> 09:03:26,458
take so you'll pick the one you like we

8966
09:03:26,458 --> 09:03:28,558
talked you talked about money already so

8967
09:03:28,558 --> 09:03:30,600
I don't know how much you want to talk

8968
09:03:30,600 --> 09:03:32,700
about budgeting but I know that we had

8969
09:03:32,700 --> 09:03:34,558
in the early days we had some pretty

8970
09:03:34,558 --> 09:03:37,318
gorilla meeting about budget and it's

8971
09:03:37,318 --> 09:03:40,260
like cut this for that or more of that

8972
09:03:40,260 --> 09:03:42,540
less of that and we were like arguing

8973
09:03:42,540 --> 09:03:45,780
over stuff we cut or not

8974
09:03:45,780 --> 09:03:47,638
um do you want to talk about that or do

8975
09:03:47,638 --> 09:03:49,860
you want to get into the anecdotes

8976
09:03:49,860 --> 09:03:53,040
uh uh no I'm gonna I'm gonna go bad

8977
09:03:53,040 --> 09:03:55,280
budget all right

8978
09:03:55,280 --> 09:03:59,280
all right anecdotes anecdotes

8979
09:03:59,280 --> 09:04:02,458
all right so uh I have like

8980
09:04:02,458 --> 09:04:05,340
um I I mean I have stuff that will just

8981
09:04:05,340 --> 09:04:08,398
reveal the whole anecdote you wanna you

8982
09:04:08,398 --> 09:04:10,680
wanna talk about that yes but don't name

8983
09:04:10,680 --> 09:04:12,540
anyone

8984
09:04:12,540 --> 09:04:15,298
go ahead all right so so the fun thing

8985
09:04:15,298 --> 09:04:16,920
is you look at this event and you look

8986
09:04:16,920 --> 09:04:18,298
at all the people they're sitting there

8987
09:04:18,298 --> 09:04:20,040
they look responsible because they've

8988
09:04:20,040 --> 09:04:23,040
aged quite a lot quite a lot since since

8989
09:04:23,040 --> 09:04:25,200
we've started but the beginning were

8990
09:04:25,200 --> 09:04:27,660
kind of rough like think about like the

8991
09:04:27,660 --> 09:04:30,000
people that hangs in CTF have too much

8992
09:04:30,000 --> 09:04:33,058
beer fighting bars and like these these

8993
09:04:33,058 --> 09:04:35,878
peoples so we're building an event and I

8994
09:04:35,878 --> 09:04:37,978
would I would say like because it's kind

8995
09:04:37,978 --> 09:04:42,500
of going and I don't know

8996
09:04:43,218 --> 09:04:46,740
but uh it's it's brilliant people do

8997
09:04:46,740 --> 09:04:48,660
shitty like this is what they do

8998
09:04:48,660 --> 09:04:51,478
and so we did the first uh first year of

8999
09:04:51,478 --> 09:04:54,420
northseek and uh we get to the hotel

9000
09:04:54,420 --> 09:04:57,240
first night we had an epic actor

9001
09:04:57,240 --> 09:04:58,860
Jeopardy like I think that would be

9002
09:04:58,860 --> 09:05:01,260
illegal today because that's how things

9003
09:05:01,260 --> 09:05:03,540
were back then and not to do any apology

9004
09:05:03,540 --> 09:05:06,058
but it was we didn't know what we were

9005
09:05:06,058 --> 09:05:09,440
doing so it ended up in some ways

9006
09:05:09,440 --> 09:05:12,180
and then we get a call from the hotel

9007
09:05:12,180 --> 09:05:15,180
the next morning someone stole all our

9008
09:05:15,180 --> 09:05:16,740
APS

9009
09:05:16,740 --> 09:05:19,680
wireless access points someone so stole

9010
09:05:19,680 --> 09:05:21,898
all of the wireless antennas in the

9011
09:05:21,898 --> 09:05:23,940
hotel and they're like we have them on

9012
09:05:23,940 --> 09:05:25,920
camera

9013
09:05:25,920 --> 09:05:28,318
so either they bring them back

9014
09:05:28,318 --> 09:05:30,120
or we're gonna call the cops and we're

9015
09:05:30,120 --> 09:05:32,600
like oh I know who is this

9016
09:05:32,600 --> 09:05:35,100
we knew we were there like the Knight

9017
09:05:35,100 --> 09:05:37,080
would never end so

9018
09:05:37,080 --> 09:05:39,420
these people were you know it's it's we

9019
09:05:39,420 --> 09:05:41,458
were part of it we didn't steal it but

9020
09:05:41,458 --> 09:05:44,760
it was borrowable the people which we we

9021
09:05:44,760 --> 09:05:47,398
worked with were not it was not as

9022
09:05:47,398 --> 09:05:49,978
serious as it is today so that was a a

9023
09:05:49,978 --> 09:05:51,898
good thing I think we returned the AP

9024
09:05:51,898 --> 09:05:54,120
nobody got arrested

9025
09:05:54,120 --> 09:05:56,280
that was a good thing I guess these are

9026
09:05:56,280 --> 09:05:59,218
pictures of the first hacker Jeopardy in

9027
09:05:59,218 --> 09:06:02,818
uh uh in ETS so first a hacker jeopard

9028
09:06:02,818 --> 09:06:06,240
of northseek but we had prior hacker

9029
09:06:06,240 --> 09:06:09,122
jeopardies in at hackers this initiative

9030
09:06:09,122 --> 09:06:11,519
was started at hakkas we're always on

9031
09:06:11,519 --> 09:06:13,438
the old pictures because it was like 10

9032
09:06:13,438 --> 09:06:16,258
of us so that's why you want another one

9033
09:06:16,258 --> 09:06:19,500
or ah yeah sure did I throw this away

9034
09:06:19,500 --> 09:06:21,258
already nope

9035
09:06:21,258 --> 09:06:23,640
uh yeah that one I don't know about that

9036
09:06:23,640 --> 09:06:25,758
one

9037
09:06:26,480 --> 09:06:29,282
oh yes I think I think this one is

9038
09:06:29,282 --> 09:06:31,258
better okay go ahead and it's the last

9039
09:06:31,258 --> 09:06:34,320
one okay no I I won't go I go I will go

9040
09:06:34,320 --> 09:06:36,718
with budgeting now anyways um ask me a

9041
09:06:36,718 --> 09:06:40,019
different question oh ask me I threw it

9042
09:06:40,019 --> 09:06:41,640
on the floor oh I know I know I love

9043
09:06:41,640 --> 09:06:42,598
blue

9044
09:06:42,598 --> 09:06:43,860
um let's go

9045
09:06:43,860 --> 09:06:45,839
I could I could propose one

9046
09:06:45,839 --> 09:06:47,398
it would be a good except for what

9047
09:06:47,398 --> 09:06:48,898
you're gonna answer your own question

9048
09:06:48,898 --> 09:06:51,898
yes okay go ahead

9049
09:06:51,898 --> 09:06:55,758
as Olivia was about to ask me

9050
09:06:56,758 --> 09:06:58,199
it's great we were having this

9051
09:06:58,199 --> 09:06:59,699
discussion in my head

9052
09:06:59,699 --> 09:07:02,160
um he said what's the hardest thing

9053
09:07:02,160 --> 09:07:04,320
about leaving nordsec because it's gonna

9054
09:07:04,320 --> 09:07:06,598
happen to everyone sitting on that stage

9055
09:07:06,598 --> 09:07:10,019
at some point some people here did some

9056
09:07:10,019 --> 09:07:12,057
people are planning to it and it's

9057
09:07:12,057 --> 09:07:13,500
interesting because I had to leave

9058
09:07:13,500 --> 09:07:15,540
norseck at some point like like somebody

9059
09:07:15,540 --> 09:07:17,218
mentioned babies at some point it was

9060
09:07:17,218 --> 09:07:19,438
edgy that's cool

9061
09:07:19,438 --> 09:07:22,377
but uh but yeah um one of the thing I I

9062
09:07:22,377 --> 09:07:23,758
found the hardest thing was to leave

9063
09:07:23,758 --> 09:07:25,980
Northside because that's some it's what

9064
09:07:25,980 --> 09:07:30,000
I did and as I I remember

9065
09:07:30,000 --> 09:07:33,417
um It's You Are Never As Good in fact

9066
09:07:33,417 --> 09:07:35,398
the organization is always as good as

9067
09:07:35,398 --> 09:07:39,782
you are so at some point you become the

9068
09:07:39,782 --> 09:07:42,180
limitation of the event so the event

9069
09:07:42,180 --> 09:07:44,040
you're seeing today

9070
09:07:44,040 --> 09:07:47,040
could have couldn't have existed with me

9071
09:07:47,040 --> 09:07:49,557
because I I headed up to a point where

9072
09:07:49,557 --> 09:07:52,438
what I knew as a president as as the guy

9073
09:07:52,438 --> 09:07:55,140
that ran the show wasn't I sucked with

9074
09:07:55,140 --> 09:07:57,960
diversity I I wasn't good in many things

9075
09:07:57,960 --> 09:08:00,782
so I found people that were better than

9076
09:08:00,782 --> 09:08:04,078
me to take away but even today after I

9077
09:08:04,078 --> 09:08:06,540
left I don't know 2018

9078
09:08:06,540 --> 09:08:09,000
even today I want to come back I want to

9079
09:08:09,000 --> 09:08:11,282
help and I always tell myself Nana don't

9080
