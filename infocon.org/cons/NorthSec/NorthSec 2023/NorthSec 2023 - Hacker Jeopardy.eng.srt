this isn't that okay

41
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:12,839
so we decided to bring the team up on

42
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,540
stage early so that we will

43
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,959
um have them uh have drinks in advance

44
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,260
uh on stage now I'm not sure who is

45
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,440
where so on the stage we have 34 6 and

46
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,700
Bravo

47
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,300

48
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,699
we have zorbed the all

49
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,899
and we have system de torch

50
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,300
all right so

51
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:52,740
this is a a semi-serious competition and

52
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,139
competition means that there will be

53
00:13:55,139 --> 00:14:00,120
prizes uh our prices uh tonight so the

54
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,220
prices are at the end of the three games

55
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,339
so we will have a ladder so this game

56
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:08,220
will create a winner that winner will go

57
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,019
on the third round

58
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:12,600
what was that

59
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,500
play that again

60

okay you lost the button I guess

61
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,959

62
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,540
will also reach the third round and in

63
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,700
the third round we bring in the north

64
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,660
SEC crew against the two best teams and

65
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,279

on top of that a UB key

71
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,980
yeah we felt cheap with one bottle of

72
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,199
Clemente but those who were there last

73
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,300
year remember that that was the second

74
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,360
place uh Prize last year so we're not

75
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,980
innovating that much we're gonna get

76
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,160
more money we added the UB key but

77
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,459
Jokes Aside or you know trying to be

78
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:17,760
funny aside uh the first place is uh we

79
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,459
have so for each individual we have uh

80
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:22,800
well I should step back here because you

81
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,079
you think this is crazy so we have three

82
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:27,660
prizes so the three person one price

83
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,779

85
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,959

86
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,139
contestants accept that yes and a covert

87
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,079
luck pick starter kit and USB rubber

88
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:47,060
ducky for the Third contester

89
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,240
and of course North SEC can't win so

90
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,519
this will go to the winners of the

91
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,139
rounds

92
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:03,839
okay well oh my God I will not wear that

93
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,579
jacket the whole time it's hot here

94
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,800
um we uh I'm gonna just go quickly

95
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,360
through the game rules for those who

96
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,480
haven't been with us for 11 years

97
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,560
um

98
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,839
so the start of the game is picked

99
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:21,779
randomly you remember our famous random

100
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:24,000
number generator

101
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,620
any team can answer you smash the button

102
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,680
Jeopardy is negative scoring so an

103
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,180
attempted answer that is wrong uh

104
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,100
means negative points

105
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,740
the winning team team that answers

106
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,800
successfully keeps the control so they

107
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,500
will tell the next clue that they want

108
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,560
to have that they want to see

109
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,920
um uh yeah and then so it's you know 100

110
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,920
Point 100 is worth 100.200 is worth 200

111
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,959
points and all that and it's summed up

112
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:00,540
and you'll see the score as we go I'm

113
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,519
gonna recap the scores from time to time

114
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:05,520
I'm not going to tell these rules every

115
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,819
round so here we go

116
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:11,520
and we don't have a final Jeopardy since

117
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,240
uh six years I think this didn't change

118
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,040
president now

119
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,459
didn't get time to do that

120
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:23,339
all right so I

121
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:26,150
um let's are you ready

122
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,020
[Applause]

123
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:33,200
okay okay okay so cheers everyone

124
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,700
let's get this over with

125
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,120
oh yeah true true thank you thank you so

126
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,860
contestant you need to answer in the

127
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,200
form of a question obviously which I

128
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,260
always forget but our wonderful crowd

129
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,380
always remembers

130
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,020
so we'll get that sorted out now I

131
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,720
realize my cue cards are not sword they

132
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,120
are bundled together by round but I

133
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,340
didn't put the round in order so when we

134
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,080
will reveal the category I'll take a few

135
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,660
seconds to order that and then we'll

136
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,940
start

137
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,660
we have

138
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,520
I can't I can't like

139
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,559
um succeed at all of the little things

140
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,620
right so we have better lighting than

141
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,059
last year

142
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:30,059
but the cue cards are [ __ ] up

143
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:35,418
okay let's reveal the categories please

144
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,520
so we have it's over nine thousand it's

145
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,580

148
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,039
set of clues that I have here so I

149
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:52,740

I mean you guys should wait for the rest

342
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,919
before doing that right

343
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:37,620
it's not gonna be any better

344
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:42,379
all right so let's do a random selection

345
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,640
oh yeah yeah oh yeah we need to uh you

346
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,520
need to score the people and no one uh

347
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,559
did anything so you just submit the

348
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:57,059
score enter

349
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:59,220
or Summit score

350
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,159
yeah okay

351
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,260
yeah yeah it's although it's ue2 no

352
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,500
worries

353
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:09,840
we uh we uh has got mode on the software

354
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,860
we can do whatever we want

355
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,020
so for

356
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:19,158
300 messages

357
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:29,940
okay I'm gonna accept a broader answer

358
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:33,360
than the previous one but a key is not

359
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,700
it's too broad I need like an in-between

360
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,620
or some of some sort

361
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,380
it can be the purpose of the key or

362
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,279
where is it commonly used like very

363
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:47,179
commonly used

364
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,360
I never thought I would be in a room

365
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,340
full of key enthusiasts

366
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:05,640
so no one come on you're at minus

367
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,539
anyways

368
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,760
let you just gonna be back to zero

369
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,740
you're gonna be

370
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:17,000

00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,939
all right

372
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,760
okay I thought it would be like elevator

373
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,679
key or something like that this is not

374
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:30,779
what I heard but this is an elevator key

375
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:32,279
or

376
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:35,880

all right we're back to the board and

382
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,580
let's do a random pick

383
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:59,880
you're on the board the 34 6 in Bravo

384

will do it's over 9000 for 200 please

385
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,279
over nine thousand four hundred this

386
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,340
transport layer protocol has meme like

387
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,360
RFC number

388
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:18,000
some would even say it's related with

389
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,360
the web

this um

393
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:40,019
this is the RFC questions and hacker

00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:50,760
I don't know what he has with rfcs but

396
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,170
it's a thing really

398
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,979
nice one all right so anyone knows

399
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,039
no that's not the one great attempt

400
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,339
though the avian carrier TCP over event

401
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:10,980
carrier no it's a quick so quick which

402
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:14,760
became or is the father of HTTP 2 so the

403
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,820
quick protocol uh was uh is actually RFC

404
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:22,339
9000 and do I have I think I have

405
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,520
exactly so it's not over nine thousand

406
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,000
but I would have accepted TLS

407
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,879
integration of quick protocol which is

408
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,879
9001.

409
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,760
I didn't say it in the form of a

410
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,740
question either you guys didn't get it

411
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:50,779
okay let's do a random

00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:53,119
all right

431
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,599
you are in control

432
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,940
uh it's gonna be uh 400 for the same

433
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,440
category please

434
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,140
which one for it's over nine thousand

435
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:07,940
over nine thousand four hundred

436
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:11,760
this CPU broke the 9 000 megahertz

barrier when overclocked

438
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:21,720
I will accept uh uh a broad answer

439
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,460
but it's not like

440
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:27,300
your uncle's CPU like experimental CPU

441
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,460
it's a it's a product an actual product

442
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:43,640
all right timeout anyone has any idea

443
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:48,180
so it's the I9 13900k

sqli 100 sqli 100.

449
00:37:19,579 --> 00:37:22,859
what is union-based SQL injection I

450
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:25,520
think that's it

451
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,540
yeah you got it

452
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,599
football bosses let's go

453
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:47,180
sqlite they need 200 please sqli 200.

454
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,619
Union select load file

455
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:00,540
load pile

456
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:05,520
this was supposed to be a quick one like

457
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,260
everyone

458
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:11,099
34 Sig what is the injection

459
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:15,060
what is injection is incorrect

460
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:19,800
oh you're so close very incorrect

461
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,579
so this category we like the the

462
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:26,220
beginning of the first character is like

463
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,320
the the injection point if you want

464
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,780
maybe the single quotes is not showing

465
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,900
here I don't I don't have it my notes

466
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,980
but here the the the the focus is on the

467
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,880
load file like this is a technique

468
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,720
allows you to do stuff

469
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,220
you're done you're done

470
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:52,320
no no

[Music]

472
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,740
all right so the answer is

473
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:00,900
arbitrary file read I would have

474
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,480
accepted lfi although it's not an lfi

475
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,060
but I would have accepted the NFI I

476
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,619
would have accepted it but it's uh

477
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:11,400
arbitrary file read like uh ATC past W

478
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,500
whatever there's an SQL track don't you

479
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,079
guys try it during the CTF

480
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,720
anyway all right so let's pick let's go

481
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,460
with the random

482
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,660
you're on the board

483
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,320
name that key for 400. name that key

484
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,540
400.

485
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,099
yes

486
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:33,960
so it's a bit small we'll have to look

487
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,400
over here

488
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,660
so it's uh four e nine nine zero six e

489
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,899
eight

490
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,960
fcb66c9 hard-coded key and this is

491
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,960
um

492
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,680
this is uh

493
00:39:56,339 --> 00:39:59,940
here it is so this is a screenshot of

494
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:03,020
Microsoft's website

495
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:06,960
they they they they had some hard-coded

496
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,920
keys in there apparently

497
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,640
documented anyone

498
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,560
what is gpp is correct

500
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,320

00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,520
board

508
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
guess what name that t500

509
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,900
let's do it

510
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,380
[Laughter]

511
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:59,960
I guess I hang out with the wrong people

512
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,400
they tell me no no it's a little bit

513
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,720
hard but it's obvious

514
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:12,000
so this is a hard-coded key in Hardware

515
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,760
which means that you know a whole class

516
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,240
of devices are [ __ ] one this once this

517
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,040
is exposed

518
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,579
uh it's related I need to have a eye

519
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:25,800
contact with someone to not say anything

520
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,520
stupid but it's related with a key card

521
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,099
access am I right yeah

522
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:35,540
it's related to key card access

523
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,800
I would accept only the company name as

524
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,520
a correct answer

525
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,180
no shaming we all made mistakes we all

526
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:51,660
hardcoded the keys and you know secure

527
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:55,220
building access systems

528
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,940
all right we're gonna time this out

529
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:03,200
um this was

530
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,520
oh I hear it in the back

531
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,079
so this is the hid eye class master key

532
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:15,420
which means you can derive all key all

533
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,880
that type of card if you have it

534
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:21,680
all right so let's do random

535
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,780
you're in control

536
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:33,500
sqli 300 sqli 300.

537
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:37,859
so we have the injection point where

538
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:41,700
which begins with a single quote

539
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,680
or one equals one

540
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:49,279
divided by select frag from Flags

541
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,180
it looks suspicious

542
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,040
what is an error based SQL injection

543
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,020
what is an error base is going injection

544
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,619
is correct

545
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:04,560
so I'll take a second here to explain it

546
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,720
it's

547
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,779
uh yeah

548
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:17,700
so what we have here is that the the

549
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,640
division by a string will generate will

550
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,520
throw an error but in the error will be

551
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,400
the result of the select so this is y is

552
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,800
an error-based sqli

553
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,079
a little bit of Education here

554
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:34,760
now go do that track

555
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,260
all right stand that thought you're in

556
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,099
control

557
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:41,240
sqli 400

558
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,280
yeah I I uh it's okay it's clipped it's

559
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,200
missing a little bit here and there but

560
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,260
everything's there yes what is a

561
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,960
time-based blindness good injection

562
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,800
what is it time

563
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:01,500
[Applause]

564
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:06,260
here was the sleep function obviously

565
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,300
so you guys are good at sqli oh you're

566
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,099
back on in positive scoring

567
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:12,860
congratulations

568
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:17,599
[Applause]

569
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:21,359
uh leading oh oh the score was not there

570
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,400
yet okay okay so now you're leading

571
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,319
sorry about that

572
00:44:25,319 --> 00:44:27,240
you have plenty of opportunity to [ __ ]

573
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,700
it up though

574
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,960
oh I'll take more beer too

575
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,779
thank you

576
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,579
okay assistant

577
00:44:40,579 --> 00:44:45,859
sqli 500 sqli 500.

578
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,940
this is a spicy one

579
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,940
Caliente

580
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:57,900
so we have a load file

581
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,020
uh concatenation

582
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:03,900
way too many backslashes

583
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,640
then there's some information

584
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:11,339
and oh why are we concatenating like why

585
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:14,420
didn't we just put it all beginning yes

586
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,700
what is a remote file inclusion

587
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:20,640
no this is incorrect

588
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:26,839
[Music]

589
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:29,940
I didn't hear it speaking the mic

590
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,040
you accepted local when it was clearly

591
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,200
not an answer earlier and now it's the

592
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,760
same thing but I didn't accept that no

593
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,480
one solved it

594
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:41,760
so here what's happened oh no anyone

595
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,800
else want to try

596
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:48,900
after this not in that ground just yet

597
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,720
pass okay pass is good pass is good

598
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:55,819
so yes in the crowd

599
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,200
no

600
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,780
out of bounds so DNS X fail is kind of

601
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,640
the side effect but the name of the sqli

602
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,180
is an out of bound injection

603
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:08,220
out of band sorry out of band

604
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,619
so here there was a domain name and it

605
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:12,660
was related to our domain name in the

606
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:16,500
CTF so I kind of mixed some CTF stuff in

607
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,319
there you know we're only Excel trading

608
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:21,900
the version but still the the the whole

609
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,980
concept is expressed here

610
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:30,060
for actually doing this track with me

611
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,520
all right so let's go back and do a

612
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,880
random

613
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,380
system with 400.

614
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:44,060
with 400.

615
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:49,560
any um pts yeah

616
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:53,280
Amazon web token Amazon web token is

617
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,880
incorrect

618
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:00,390
yeah he [ __ ] it up anyways

619
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:02,099
[Applause]

620
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:05,280
Amazon web token was incorrect though

621
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,460
it is uh we are in the case of acronym

622
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:11,339
Clash uh but I will not accept the

623
00:47:11,339 --> 00:47:15,140
answer although it could have been good

624
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:20,940
I'm uh I'm in douchebag mode right now

625
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:23,460
so anyone else want to try

626
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,619
okay I'm gonna get a slide a couple of

627
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:28,079
hints here and there anyone did Java in

628
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:29,520
the 2000s

629
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,740
[Music]

630
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:35,220
now you need to remember that yeah

631
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:38,220
yeah no I'm sorry no it's SEC is 11

632
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:41,940
years old so we are like uh we uh we

633
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:44,280
need to work on

634
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,220
on newer Technologies

635
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:49,700
no

636
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:54,240
what is Apache web toolkit what is

637
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:58,339
Apache web toolkit is incorrect

638
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,679
[Applause]

639
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,680
foreign

640
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,859
no it's not even close like it doesn't

641
00:48:10,859 --> 00:48:13,680
it's there's no like Apache there's no

642
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,140
web there's no there is toolkit there is

643
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:17,880
toolkit did you say toolkit yeah two Kit

644
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:22,280
is there no so what are we looking for

645
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:27,180
abstract Windows toolkit awt it's a Java

646
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:29,520
technology that no one used except in

647
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,920
universities in the 2000s

648
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,819
sorry about that it's a 400th question

649
00:48:35,819 --> 00:48:37,740
all right let's take a look at the score

650
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,839
we're near the end of the game

651
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:45,020
34 6 and Bravo zero zorda or minus 100

652
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:49,130
and system detosh minus 400.

653
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:51,380
[Music]

654
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:56,660
we'll do it live all right

655
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,720
what will web team

656
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,240
we'll pick what

657
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:07,578
you're on the board you're in control

658
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,020
it's over nine thousand over nine

659
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:18,380
thousand

660
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:24,060
this geological Epoch saw the last major

661
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,900
ice age

662
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:32,720
it's over 9 000 years ago

663
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:43,560
the game can be played right now what is

664
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:46,140
the younger driest the what the younger

665
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:49,380
driest the younger driest sounds very

666
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:51,720
scientific and correct although it is

667
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:54,560
incorrect

668
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:57,980
[Music]

669
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:59,960
thank you

670
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:02,280
all right do we have anyone who want to

671
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,460
try

672
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:13,380
okay anyone any uh Ice Age people in the

673
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,839
room

674
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:17,760
I never thought I would say the the

675
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,819
phrase ice aged people before

676
00:50:20,819 --> 00:50:23,520
the answer is and I should have double

677
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,400
checked actually Francois but um it's

678
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:31,380
the Holocene period what I had it

679
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:35,640
oh my God interesting so what is the

680
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,579
Holocene period

681
00:50:37,579 --> 00:50:40,880
he said it like a mouse

682
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,160
Holocene period

683
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,720
no he didn't get the point because it

684
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,819
was a second answer but he was the

685
00:50:47,819 --> 00:50:51,300
second best guess bruh

686
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:52,770
okay

687

[Music]

688
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:56,640
we are though everyone's ready we're

689
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,280
gonna jump right into the 500. all right

690
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,619
it's gonna be a quick one you're on the

691
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:02,540
board

692
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:06,660
easiest question of the board by far

693
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:08,880
go ahead

694
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,240
no no no no one needs to pick just click

695
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,580
on the 500 points ah [ __ ]

696
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:17,640
[Laughter]

697
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:21,078
346 in Bravo

698
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:30,119
what it what is what

699
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:34,099
what is what is incorrect

700
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:37,980
unfortunately

701
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:40,099
thank you

702
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:46,740
we have no choice all right so I think

703
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:49,200
people are now trying to play strategic

704
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,579
here I don't know if you saw that

705
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:53,400
happening but there is some like you're

706
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,220
not the game they say here so that they

707
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:58,680
would like try and then slide right

708
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,800
under we have a clear winner at minus

709
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,119
100 point so

710
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,430
all right

711
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:14,880
[Music]

712
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,660
what's funny like I'll take a couple one

713
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,640
minute to explain I was looking for like

714
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,460
of course something ending with WT and I

715
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:25,800
was like ah what what does and I I tried

716
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:29,099
chat GPT it completely sucked at it and

717
00:52:29,099 --> 00:52:32,940
in the end I just like framework WT and

718
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:35,339
I ended up on a framework I have already

719
00:52:35,339 --> 00:52:37,740
bookmarked before in my life

720
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:39,780
and listen to this I mean you can't make

721
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:43,859
this up it's a web GUI library in modern

722
00:52:43,859 --> 00:52:46,578
C plus plus

723
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,220
who's gonna do that

724
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:53,640
anyway so this was WT

725
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,300
and this ends our game

726
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:00,740
we have 34 6 on Bravo at minus 1000

the way in any sense or fashion

775
00:56:21,059 --> 00:56:23,400

776
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,640

783
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:14,540

784
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:16,700
okay

ready

787
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:29,419
yes excellent let's reveal the board

788
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:33,000
[Music]

789
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,059
in the cookie jar

790
00:57:36,059 --> 00:57:40,020
child GPT ATM

791
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:44,640
the internet Iceberg and famous authors

792
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,319
let's do the random

793
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:50,599
you're on the

794
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:55,579
boards and friends you have control

795
00:57:58,819 --> 00:58:02,839
Chad GPD 100

796
00:58:03,059 --> 00:58:07,619
so this is a prompt to chat GPD last

797
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:09,839
year's nordsec theme was a startup

798
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:12,240
cryptocurrency company dealing with

799
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,380
mushrooms

800
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,540
this year's theme is a dystopian

801
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:18,380
Corporation with hints of Freemason lore

802
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:21,660
suggest a theme for next year in one

803
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:24,200
sentence

804
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:33,020
so you need to guess what chat GPT

805
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:35,579
answered to that

806
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:38,339
and remember answer in the form of a

807
00:58:38,339 --> 00:58:40,578
question

808
00:58:47,579 --> 00:58:51,480
it just saying like it's it's uh he went

809
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,880
with two with straight into the obvious

810
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:58,040
this is why it's the 100.

811
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:04,500
also another another hint or like this

812
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,720
is the hundred points it's the time to

813
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,839
try and fail like later not the best

814
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:13,319
time now why not try something

815
00:59:13,319 --> 00:59:17,339
I also will accept Loosely like anything

816
00:59:17,339 --> 00:59:20,280
that is in the realm of what it answered

817
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:23,040
I'm gonna accept of course

818
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,980
no we'll do it live [ __ ] it

819
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:30,680
all right it's gonna be a boring one

820
00:59:33,059 --> 00:59:35,540
people

821
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:42,180
it's not uh it doesn't know about Rao at

822
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:43,440
all

823
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,460
no

824
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:48,599
not not Chad GPT I don't think so no so

825
00:59:48,599 --> 00:59:51,660
it went straight into cyberpunk

826
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:54,420
rebellion in a post-apocalyptic City

827
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:58,579
ruled by a sentient AI

828
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:04,920
he went straight for it I would have

829
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:08,540
accepted cyberpunk Rebellion you know

830
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:11,040
post-apocalyptic any of these would have

831
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:14,940
been good you see sentient AI all themes

832
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:17,280
that we explored before also

833
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,619
so we have a theme I guess

834
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:22,200
all right let's go back to the board and

835
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,859
do a random

836
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,680
you're on the board and friends

837
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:32,400
um ATM 100 ATM 100 can you please not

838
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,260
stand in front of the monitors we use

839
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:37,440
them as uh I I reported the word all the

840
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:44,099
time okay ATM 100. what ATM stands for

841
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:46,619
what is automated teller machine

01:07:17,819 --> 01:07:19,799
immunity Usenet is written in the

955
01:07:19,799 --> 01:07:22,038
question

is correct

959
01:07:30,359 --> 01:07:34,680
so news bin website indexing binaries

960
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,900
from Usenet so basically you could see

961
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:39,299
you download a lot of stuff that exists

962
01:07:39,299 --> 01:07:41,339
because they were indexing it hard to

963
01:07:41,339 --> 01:07:43,440
find stuff I don't know about any of

964
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:44,460
this

965
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:48,059

a large worldwide Corporation why would

972
01:08:08,099 --> 01:08:12,079

power and erosion of individualism

993
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:20,580
humans may be reduced to Mere numbers

994
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:23,580
and members of a global Corporation as

995
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:26,219
control and efficiency supersede

996
01:09:26,219 --> 01:09:30,679
personal identity and autonomy

it's uh you know it's a string

1012
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:25,920
oh here it is okay what is PHP says ID

1013
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:30,679
what is PHP says IDs correct

1014
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:33,179
[Applause]

1015
01:10:33,179 --> 01:10:35,040
I wasn't sure if I wasn't

1016
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:39,140
an o or not so I had to use my cue cards

1017
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:41,580
uh now that's you're in control sorry

1018
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:43,380
about that

1019
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:46,140
um well famous authors do other famous

1020
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:49,520
others 200.

1021
01:10:57,570 --> 01:11:00,688
[Music]

1022
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:05,880
it's in the URL on GitHub

1023
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:10,580
like you get clone the tool it's there

1024
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:17,760
uh cyber ridges

1025
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:20,340
what is spider labs

1026
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:24,000
uh this is the yeah it moved since then

1027
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,659
but it was the original author

1028
01:11:27,659 --> 01:11:30,360
so the spider Lazar bursary is archived

1029
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:32,760
and and it's he used to work at spider

1030
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:35,340
labs but this is not the answer we're

1031
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:38,820
looking for unfortunately

1032
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:42,980
anyone else

1033
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:46,679
anyone knows in the crowd

1034
01:11:46,679 --> 01:11:50,400
who is correct

1035
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:53,780
or uh

1036
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:58,080
LG and X not sure how I would pronounce

1037
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,239
that actually

1038
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:03,500
uh let's do random

1039
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:07,519
cyberages you are in control

1040
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:19,040
Chad GPT for 300. Chad GPD 300.

1041
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:22,140
right now here are the top three themes

1042
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:26,040
of our CTF cold root system detosh and

1043
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:30,120
Hoover hacken who is going to win based

1044
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,280
on the team name alone

1045
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:35,940
you need to choose one and answer in one

1046
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:38,580
sentence cold root

1047
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:42,060
uh who is cold root because

1048
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:44,400
um they drink malord

1049
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,739
do you think the AI would have said that

1050
01:12:46,739 --> 01:12:48,360
yeah like I wrote this this afternoon

1051
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:49,800
they didn't know yet that you were

1052
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:52,260
drinking like dandelion juice I don't

1053
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:53,760
think that's accurate

1054
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,980
I think they know yeah oh you think they

1055
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:58,560
yeah they know all right I like that I

1056
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,300
like that okay so let's do this of

1057
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:02,400
course it's wrong

1058
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,140
hahaha

1059
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:06,960
anyone else want to try

1060
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:09,719
oh one sec

1061
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:12,800
the buzzers are lucky

1062
01:13:14,219 --> 01:13:15,659
yes

1063
01:13:15,659 --> 01:13:18,000
who are cold root and probably because

1064
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,560
they have the word root in the name of

1065
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,060
their team

1066
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:23,280
but but it just said cold root and it

1067
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:26,059
was not the answer

1068
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:39,120
oh I mean yeah the name is pretty

1069
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,100
important for the whole thing to work

1070
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:44,540
right so it's not that

1071
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:47,580
I'm leaking some information here

1072
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:50,840
anyone else want to try

1073
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:53,820
what is Uber hacking because they're

1074
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:55,280
hacking

1075
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,070
you are correct

1076
01:13:57,070 --> 01:14:02,420
[Applause]

1077
01:14:05,159 --> 01:14:07,320
okay listen to this listen to this this

1078
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,420
is I you can't make this up

1079
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:12,420
what is Hooper hacking is likely to win

1080
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:14,820
because it suggests a combination of

1081
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:17,480
technical expertise and a playful

1082
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:20,480
determined attitude

1083
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:23,340
[Applause]

1084
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:24,500
yeah

1085
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:28,199
praise the AI Lord

1086
01:14:28,199 --> 01:14:30,900
they are not no longer top three I think

1087
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:33,300
anyways so

1088
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:38,300
AI is wrong cyber ages you're in control

1089
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:41,640
what is in the cookie

1090
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:45,140
cookie cookie jar 300.

1091
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,960
um yeah now that's what is the Json web

1092
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:54,420
token what is it Json web token is

1093
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:58,820
correct right you are

1094
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:03,739
Madness you are in control

1095
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:07,440
uh in the cookie jar 400. cookie jar

1096
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,540
400.

1097
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:11,880
the cookie attribute name and value that

1098
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:14,159
prevents sending the cookie on any cross

1099
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:16,260
site requests

1100
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:20,340
cold root what is same site

1101
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:23,300
I don't recall

1102
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:31,020
okay yeah name and value so oh same side

1103
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:33,719
uh none

1104
01:15:33,719 --> 01:15:38,420
what is safe site none is incorrect

1105
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:42,719
anyone else want to try

1106
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:45,380
so close

1107
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:54,480
so inside what is same side strict same

1108
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,370
side and strict is correct

1109
01:15:56,370 --> 01:15:59,540
[Applause]

1110
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:03,320
unfortunately so close

1111
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:06,840
you want to control navits you're on the

1112
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:10,380
board in the cookie jar 500. cookie jar

1113
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:13,159
500.

1114
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:16,440
uh underscore underscore CF underscore

1115
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,659
BM

1116
01:16:18,659 --> 01:16:21,739
that's the clue

1117
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:33,480
it's a difficult one

1118
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:35,820
it's 500 points

1119
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:37,560
we're gonna time it out

1120
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:41,179
anyone knows in the crowd

1121
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:46,260
cold fusion default cookie incorrect

1122
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:48,659
great attempt though CF

1123
01:16:48,659 --> 01:16:52,679
clouds there but what specifically

1124
01:16:52,679 --> 01:16:54,900
what

1125
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:57,060
but management cookie is correct

1126
01:16:57,060 --> 01:17:01,100
cloudflare butt management cookie

1127
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:04,020
you know

1128
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:08,239
stuff you deal with every day

1129
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:12,179
all right let's do a random please

1130
01:17:12,179 --> 01:17:15,480
again we're playing for maybe one Club

1131
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:17,340
matte each

1132
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:20,280
think about it uh the internet iceberg

1133
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:24,840
400. internet iceberg 400.

1134
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:28,020
a very secure net punching and Anonymous

1135
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:31,140
system allowing to reach the very bottom

1136
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:36,719
of the iceberg cold root uh what is UPnP

1137
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:40,140
what is UPnP is incorrect

1138
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:45,620
never reached the dark net through UPnP

1139
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,000
navits

1140
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,420
what is tor what is tor what is Taurus

1141
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:53,780
correct

1142
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:02,159
um

1143
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:04,739
the internet Iceberg 500. internet

1144
01:18:04,739 --> 01:18:07,380
iceberg 500.

1145
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:10,080
the anonymity Network gained popularity

1146
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:13,739
after the Silk Road takedown in 2013. it

1147
01:18:13,739 --> 01:18:16,199
implements this food related protocol

1148
01:18:16,199 --> 01:18:19,320
named garlic routing

1149
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:22,159
cold root

1150
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:25,739
what is the onion router what is the

1151
01:18:25,739 --> 01:18:28,440
onion router is incorrect

1152
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:31,699
it's a trick question

1153
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:35,640
onion router was the answer of the

1154
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:38,780
previous Clues

1155
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:43,440
it's kind of a trolling like garlic

1156
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:45,960
onion like these guys are playing games

1157
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:48,320
right

1158
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:51,840
it got popular after the Silk Road

1159
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:54,480
takedown which was on tour so

1160
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,760
they were like come to our Network it's

1161
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:00,500
better it's more anonymous

1162
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:03,060
sponsored by the Russians maybe I don't

1163
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:04,260
know

1164
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:07,260
don't quote me on that

1165
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:08,699
no one

1166
01:19:08,699 --> 01:19:11,299
crowd

1167
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:15,980
what is i2p is correct

1168
01:19:16,739 --> 01:19:17,760
thank you

1169
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:20,040
[Applause]

1170
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:22,080
it's pretty intense techno right there

1171
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:24,780
okay let's look at the scores so we have

1172
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:28,560
cyber ages at 400 cold route at minus

1173
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:32,159
1200 and navids and friends at above

1174
01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:36,179
1200. it's over nine thousand pretty

1175
01:19:36,179 --> 01:19:39,120
broad range of scoring here but nothing

1176
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:42,360
is done yet everything can go in all

1177
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:43,739
directions

1178
01:19:43,739 --> 01:19:48,080
so uh cold root you are in control

1179
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:51,239
uh let's do famous authors 300. famous

1180
01:19:51,239 --> 01:19:54,620
author 300.

1181
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:59,460

[Applause]

1185

famous authors 400 famous authors 400.

1186
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:26,940
so North SEC is 11 years old I remember

1187
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:29,880
I attended Defcon you know around the

1188
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:32,400
beginning of northseek and I I sat on a

1189
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,020
talk that he was giving I was really

1190
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:36,780
close to the stage and and back then the

1191
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:38,580
room was used we were lineups and stuff

1192
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:42,120
and I was just like in awe in admiration

1193
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:45,960
of this person who created nmap uh you

1194
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:47,580
know build a business model around the

1195
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:50,580
GPL you know security software but uh

1196
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:53,219
his uh he's using a handle everywhere

1197
01:20:53,219 --> 01:20:55,320
trying to give some Clues here and there

1198
01:20:55,320 --> 01:21:00,000
but uh he he is not

1199
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,219
he's running very important stuff but

1200
01:21:02,219 --> 01:21:05,400
he's not about the the fame so it's a

1201
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,739
harder one to know but he's super

1202
01:21:07,739 --> 01:21:10,140
important like he's hosting critical

1203
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:12,120
mailing lists and doing a lot of good

1204
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:15,179
service for the community

1205
01:21:15,179 --> 01:21:18,239
that doesn't give any hint but he's a

1206
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:19,620
good guy

1207
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:21,860
anyone

1208
01:21:21,860 --> 01:21:24,600
who is Theodore is correct

1209
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,400
not in the form of a question

1210
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,199
[Applause]

1211
01:21:28,199 --> 01:21:31,860
all right random

1212
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:35,820
navits uh ATM 300.

1213
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:39,620
ATM for 300.

1214
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:46,679
so we're talking attacks techniques you

1215
01:21:46,679 --> 01:21:49,800
know you describe what you see cyberages

1216
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:52,260
what is card skimmer what is a card

1217
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:55,159
skimmer is correct

1218
01:21:56,699 --> 01:21:58,080
you got it

1219
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:01,260
cyberages you are in control

1220
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:03,780
what is ATM 500

1221
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:07,920
500 jumping to the 500 400. you could

1222
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:11,420
you can there are no rules

1223
01:22:11,950 --> 01:22:16,239
[Applause]

1224
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:21,140
all right ATM 500

1225
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:24,239
[ __ ] it the full name of the standards

1226
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:28,739
body governing the xfs standard

1227
01:22:28,739 --> 01:22:32,120
cyberages what is

1228
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,739
the full name

1229
01:22:34,739 --> 01:22:38,239
not the acronym

1230
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:42,020
so you're close I think

1231
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:52,320
all right so nope

1232
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:56,299
anyone else yes but it's bananas

1233
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:01,500
trying the

1234
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:04,860
track would probably have come through

1235
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:07,020
this several times by now and we're

1236
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:08,940
probably embody that name I've come

1237
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:11,159
across the xcf but I didn't read the

1238
01:23:11,159 --> 01:23:14,820
name of the it's going on the top of the

1239
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:16,739
document yeah but that was not important

1240
01:23:16,739 --> 01:23:21,360
all spelled out all right so anyone

1241
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:24,120
anyone playing the ATM track who is

1242
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:26,940
grinding xfs right now and struggling

1243
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:30,600
their name is a European committee for

1244
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:36,300
standardization the acronym is c e m

1245
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:37,580
big climax here

1246
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:40,280
[Music]

1247
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:44,400
all right thank you so no one succeeded

1248
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:48,199
and let's go back to the random

1249
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:52,400
now and friends let's go with ATM 400

1250
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:55,380
ATM 400.

1251
01:23:55,380 --> 01:23:57,900
what issue caused by poor Bank coding

1252
01:23:57,900 --> 01:24:01,500
practices are most exploited to skim EMV

1253
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:04,100
cars

1254
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:09,480
it's a ongoing problem right now

1255
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:11,760
oh I see our badges are

1256
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:15,900
having a similar pattern activity now

1257
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:19,320
there's someone messing with them

1258
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:22,260
interesting look around

1259
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:25,219
we're all like

1260
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:29,420
it's not really into the question

1261
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:31,860
that's cool

1262
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:35,280
I wonder like don't have I Security on

1263
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,140
this thing

1264
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:39,739
maybe not

1265
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:43,199
so no one's trying all right so they uh

1266
01:24:43,199 --> 01:24:45,360
the the answer it's a pretty tough one I

1267
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,880
realize now uh

1268
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:51,480
it's the lack of CVV validation so they

1269
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:53,820
validate a lot of stuff but not the CVV

1270
01:24:53,820 --> 01:24:57,239
or the icbv so it causes right now it's

1271
01:24:57,239 --> 01:25:00,360
a big problem foreign

1272
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:02,040
thank you

1273
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:04,620
all right back to the the board and do a

1274
01:25:04,620 --> 01:25:06,920
random

1275
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:12,000
unfortunately uh Chad GPT 400. Chad GPT

1276
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,219
400.

1277
01:25:14,219 --> 01:25:17,300
which is the superior annotation format

1278
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:21,199
tab spaces or no characters

1279
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:25,140
answer in one sentence and don't be

1280
01:25:25,140 --> 01:25:28,920
nuanced you need to choose one

1281
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:33,659
cold root uh the answer was tabs and it

1282
01:25:33,659 --> 01:25:37,639
there is no justification it's just tabs

1283
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:41,820
you wish you would be through but it's

1284
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:44,100
not the case

1285
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:47,000
wrong answer

1286
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:49,980
so anyone else can try maybe it's null

1287
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:52,140
characters

1288
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:55,860
we don't know it's a computer it's an AI

1289
01:25:55,860 --> 01:25:59,280
I I can't believe you guys are not like

1290
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:02,960
spamming the button right now

1291
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:08,719
so there's like tabs

1292
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:12,300
Paces or no

1293
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:15,719
they tried tabs

1294
01:26:15,719 --> 01:26:19,219
and it didn't work

1295
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:21,840
[Music]

1296
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:23,420
cyberages

1297
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:26,159
spaces because it could be used across

1298
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:30,440
multiple uh coding platforms

1299
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:32,100
[Applause]

1300
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:33,060
oh

1301
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:36,420
what if it was not in the form of a

1302
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:39,620
question unfortunately

1303
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:42,360
I'm sorry

1304
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:45,179
it's wrong

1305
01:26:45,179 --> 01:26:47,699
I can't tell yep they had they can't

1306
01:26:47,699 --> 01:26:49,920
take the answer

1307
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:52,219
anything

1308
01:27:04,140 --> 01:27:08,880
[Applause]

1309
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:11,880
what are spaces what are spaces is

1310
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:14,300
correct

1311
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:17,780
bazinga

1312
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:21,080
and that was it

1313
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:23,880
no explanation

1314
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:27,120
uh let's go it was tough to make it

1315
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:30,000
decide like we had to really like drill

1316
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,679
it down to like

1317
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:34,679
shut the [ __ ] up and choose

1318
01:27:34,679 --> 01:27:37,500
yes navits let's go with charging PT

1319
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:41,280
again four five hundred chat gbt 500.

1320
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:43,679
be ready what is the most important

1321
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:47,880
software vulnerability in one sentence

1322
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:52,159
navits what are humans

1323
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:56,860
that's

[Music]

1328
01:28:14,940 --> 01:28:19,820
anyone else Hawaii he [ __ ] it up

anyone else

1330
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:25,440
I guess I should have wrote I this is

1331
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,900
the exact prompt we're not playing games

1332
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:30,120
here but I guess I should have added

1333
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:33,360
class of software available

1334
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:34,860
you see

1335
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:38,159
can help you choose Maybe

1336
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:41,839
and it's not Exorcist

1337
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,580
look guys

1338
01:28:44,580 --> 01:28:46,679
surprised

1339
01:28:46,679 --> 01:28:49,080
look I want several of our early

1340
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:52,320
competitions solely with xss back in the

1341
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:55,580
bulldogging style days

to say honestly like stage fright is

1412
01:33:28,739 --> 01:33:32,100
real like a lot of the smartest person

1413
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:34,199
in the audience and we did this with

1414
01:33:34,199 --> 01:33:37,080
Alex guidon and not too long ago he was

1415
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:39,600
like always answering in the back all

1416
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:42,120
questions no matter how hard and then

1417
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:44,639
one year he came up on stage as nordsec

1418
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:48,239
and he totally sucked

1419
01:33:48,239 --> 01:33:51,239

01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:24,719
badges and we're the ones stupid enough

1430

1433
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:35,360
handle though

1434
01:34:35,699 --> 01:34:39,480

1509
01:38:57,659 --> 01:39:01,679
let's do a random you got it

1510
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:03,900
another one

1511
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:07,280
they've been in control long enough

1512
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:11,420
and suck

1513
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:21,060
Skynet 100. Skynet 100.

1514

[Music]

1517
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,159
what is mid-journey what is min journey

1518
01:39:32,159 --> 01:39:33,600
is correct

1519

that's right you are

1522
01:39:40,620 --> 01:39:44,840
so no no you're in control I guess

1523
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:46,860
I guess yes you have to play this game

1524
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:48,600
now

1525
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:50,280
you're there

1526
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:56,480
of buy one 100 off buy one 100.

1527
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:06,500
what is QWERTY what is QWERTY is correct

1528
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:15,239
North six ten year anniversary is also

1529
01:40:15,239 --> 01:40:17,520
one by one because it's actually our

1530
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:21,960
11th year thus this category

1531
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:24,659
off by one two hundred of by one two

1532
01:40:24,659 --> 01:40:26,960
hundred

1533
01:40:28,139 --> 01:40:30,560
thank you

1534
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:42,900
think about it

1535
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:45,960
picture the keyboard

1536
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:49,580
picture the keyboard

1537
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:53,639
and suck

1538
01:40:53,639 --> 01:40:56,040
what is adj

1539
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:59,520
what is sdj I don't know what keyboard

1540
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:03,739
layout you have but this is incorrect

1541
01:41:05,159 --> 01:41:08,059
anyone else

1542
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:12,179
now take a good look at this and

1543
01:41:12,179 --> 01:41:14,340
remember the answer because it's going

1544
01:41:14,340 --> 01:41:17,540
to help you on the next one

1545
01:41:25,139 --> 01:41:28,020
all right anyone else

1546
01:41:28,020 --> 01:41:31,760
what is SSH is correct

1547
01:41:35,030 --> 01:41:38,159
[Laughter]

1548
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:41,040
I live for moments like this

1549
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:45,980
all right so uh let's do a random please

1550
01:41:47,580 --> 01:41:49,500
navits

1551
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:51,300
let's go with up by one three hundred

1552
01:41:51,300 --> 01:41:54,600
I'll buy one 300

1553

I love it

1554
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:02,900
let's compute

1555
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:06,179
we don't really know our keyboard do we

1556
01:42:06,179 --> 01:42:10,040
we just know how to type

1557
01:42:15,780 --> 01:42:18,060
I use the tool to generate this because

1558
01:42:18,060 --> 01:42:20,940
I was not able to do it by my mind

1559
01:42:20,940 --> 01:42:23,839
I was tired

1560
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:26,620
okay it's taking too long

1561
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:30,480
[Music]

1562
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:33,199
so

1563
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:38,239
wow what a success is correct

1564
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:41,340
oh my God you should move away from that

1565
01:42:41,340 --> 01:42:43,820
category

1566
01:42:44,159 --> 01:42:46,260
uh you know what no just finish it now

1567
01:42:46,260 --> 01:42:48,179
it's gonna you know the rest of the game

1568
01:42:48,179 --> 01:42:49,619
will be better

1569
01:42:49,619 --> 01:42:53,119
uh random please

1570
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:55,139
navits

1571
01:42:55,139 --> 01:42:58,920
uh unstable diffusion 100. unstable the

1572
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:00,840
fusion 100.

1573
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:03,920
take a good look

1574
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:08,880
these are two images generated

1575
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:11,159
we need to figure out what it's talking

1576
01:43:11,159 --> 01:43:13,199
about

1577
01:43:13,199 --> 01:43:16,139
it's very simple what we're looking for

1578
01:43:16,139 --> 01:43:19,760
is very simple

1579
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:22,260
and suck

1580
01:43:22,260 --> 01:43:26,120
poor what is tor what is Taurus correct

[Applause]

1584
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:35,900
so it was an onion with a router like

1585
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:39,300
inbred together on one end and the other

1586
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:41,280
one was just weird an onion on top of

1587
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:43,759
some Hardware

1588
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:46,199
so we're using like here we have like I

1589
01:43:46,199 --> 01:43:48,239
think stable diffusion and mid-journey

1590
01:43:48,239 --> 01:43:49,980
side by side

1591
01:43:49,980 --> 01:43:53,718
all right so you are in control

1592
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:58,800
don't overthink the whole thing just a

1593
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:01,440
simple diffusion 200. stable unstable

1594
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:04,580
diffusion 200.

1595
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:10,560
navits what is netcat what is netcat is

1596
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:12,860
correct

1597
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:19,100
it's pretty good one right

1598
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:21,540
okay I like this one so unstable

1599
01:44:21,540 --> 01:44:26,340
diffusion again unstable 300.

1600
01:44:30,239 --> 01:44:32,580

Cantina is correct yes success we have a

1662
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:30,080
battle of the Wi-Fi right now

1663
01:48:30,179 --> 01:48:33,600
okay one second let's take a stop look

1664
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:36,300
at the scoring at the score sorry and

1665
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:40,380
suck minus 200 Zelda 600 and navids in

1676
01:49:19,380 --> 01:49:21,060
correct

1677
01:49:21,060 --> 01:49:22,210

1682
01:49:45,659 --> 01:49:47,760
probably only one person in this room

1683
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:49,500
knows

1684
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:53,060
he's the one who sent me the question

1685
01:49:54,420 --> 01:49:56,159
you might even need the Google hint

1686
01:49:56,159 --> 01:49:58,199
himself

1687
01:49:58,199 --> 01:50:00,000
do you usually

1688
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,800
no you know by heart

1689
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:04,699
do you read it

1690
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:07,800
he read it

1691
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:11,900
all right uh anyone

1692
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:14,940
it's a 8 out of 11 something I'm looking

1693
01:50:14,940 --> 01:50:16,020
for

1694
01:50:16,020 --> 01:50:19,340
so like with the extensions

1695
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:20,780
so it's

1696
01:50:20,780 --> 01:50:24,659
802.11mc is the fine time measurements I

1697
01:50:24,659 --> 01:50:27,659
don't even know what it's used for

1698
01:50:27,659 --> 01:50:31,260
come on it's good you suck it's a good

1699
01:50:31,260 --> 01:50:33,560
question

1700
01:50:33,719 --> 01:50:36,719
or clue

1701
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:40,400
all right let's do a random

1702
01:50:40,739 --> 01:50:43,440
almost done navits and friends you are

1703
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:46,920
in control uh Skynet 300 200

cleverly sued into the Jeopardy

1713
01:51:14,940 --> 01:51:17,040
uh now that's you're in control let's go

1718
01:51:36,719 --> 01:51:38,460
you basically just

1719
01:51:38,460 --> 01:51:41,460
make something up and add GPT to it it's

1720
01:51:41,460 --> 01:51:43,139
like now a thing

1721
01:51:43,139 --> 01:51:46,560
like a toilet GPT

1722
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:49,820
Facebook GPT

1723
01:51:50,159 --> 01:51:53,000
all right anyone

1724
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:57,920
Panthers GPT is the correct answer

1725
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:02,159
they're not clever yeah it's true it's a

1726
01:52:02,159 --> 01:52:04,320
tool I'm not saying it's good yeah I'm

1727
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:07,320
just saying it exists

1728
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:10,940
all right random please

1729
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:14,280

1736
01:52:33,780 --> 01:52:36,320
wrong

1737
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:43,080
I guess if you hang out in the right

1738
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:46,080
Reddit uh subreddits you know about that

1739
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:48,000
one otherwise you don't because it's

1740
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:51,260
probably a fraud

1741
01:52:55,739 --> 01:52:58,459
nice

1742
01:52:59,100 --> 01:53:02,780

all right so uh anyone

1744
01:53:13,739 --> 01:53:15,780
it's probably a better name than this

1745
01:53:15,780 --> 01:53:18,420
one so you should register that domain

1746
01:53:18,420 --> 01:53:19,679
or whatever

1747
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:22,860

1748
01:53:22,860 --> 01:53:25,260
pick the right one yeah

1749
01:53:25,260 --> 01:53:30,300
all right so let's uh do another random

1750
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:33,540
uh navits and Friends uh let's go back

1751

for proper handling of latencies

1773
01:55:02,159 --> 01:55:06,480
it's for a big ass computers

1774
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:09,860
no multi-processor system

1775

Hardware

1776
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:21,300
all right anyone

1777

what is pneuma is correct for

1778
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:34,080
non-uniform memory access

1779
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:37,100
Numa nodes

1780
01:55:37,380 --> 01:55:40,860
all right random

1781
01:55:41,880 --> 01:55:43,440
and suck

1782
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:47,040
you are in control Hardware 500.

1783
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:50,400
Hardware 500.

1784
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:53,880
in modern AMD CPUs this component holds

1785
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:56,400
one or more core complex as well as

1786
01:55:56,400 --> 01:56:00,840
their Associated L3 cache what are ccds

1787
01:56:00,840 --> 01:56:04,800
what are ccds no no he didn't [ __ ] it up

1788
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:07,800
bazinga

1789
01:56:08,580 --> 01:56:11,840
you [ __ ] it up

1790
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:15,780
correctly so what are CCD what is what

1791
01:56:15,780 --> 01:56:19,860
are CCD uh core complex dye is correct

1792
01:56:19,860 --> 01:56:22,800
oh wow

1793
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:28,139
a big 500 points this late in the game

1794
01:56:28,139 --> 01:56:30,480
they're gonna be careful now okay let's

1795
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:33,780
try again last one off by one

1796

The Last of Us by one 500.

1797
01:56:43,619 --> 01:56:45,659
I think I'm gonna give hints until

1798
01:56:45,659 --> 01:56:49,199
someone figures it figures it up

1799
01:56:49,199 --> 01:56:52,800
it's an important piece of

1800
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:56,699
hacker lore

1801
01:56:56,780 --> 01:57:00,199
it's uh it's a flag

1802
01:57:00,199 --> 01:57:03,480
yes what is hack the planet what is hack

1803
01:57:03,480 --> 01:57:05,040
the planet is correct

1804
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:07,750

great stuff

1808
01:57:19,099 --> 01:57:22,380
yes you are in control

1809
01:57:22,380 --> 01:57:25,020
I mean there there's one there's one I

1810
01:57:25,020 --> 01:57:26,159
know I know I know but you're in control

1811
01:57:26,159 --> 01:57:28,560
the last two rounds no one was in

1812
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:31,980
control so now take the control you know

1813
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:34,020
yes grasp it

1814
01:57:34,020 --> 01:57:37,880
Skynet 500.

1815
01:57:38,340 --> 01:57:41,040
according to a bird tweeting billionaire

1816
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:43,860
this AI will understand the nature of

1817
01:57:43,860 --> 01:57:46,380
the universe

1818
01:57:46,380 --> 01:57:50,580
for someone tired of AI he sent me a lot

1819
01:57:50,580 --> 01:57:54,019
of AI question this year

1820
01:57:54,420 --> 01:57:57,560
didn't you love him

1821
01:58:00,719 --> 01:58:03,659
he's tweeting so much crap then it's

1822
01:58:03,659 --> 01:58:06,780
like just like filtering what makes

1823
01:58:06,780 --> 01:58:09,060
sense what doesn't make sense

1824
01:58:09,060 --> 01:58:12,139
now I want to try

1825
01:58:12,179 --> 01:58:15,360
this is this could be a game changer

1826
01:58:15,360 --> 01:58:19,920
right if someone strives and wins or

1827
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:24,679
loses can change the outcome of the game

1828
01:58:26,250 --> 01:58:33,120
[Applause]

1829
01:58:33,239 --> 01:58:35,099

anyone

1835
01:58:52,619 --> 01:58:57,080
what is true GPT is correct

1836
