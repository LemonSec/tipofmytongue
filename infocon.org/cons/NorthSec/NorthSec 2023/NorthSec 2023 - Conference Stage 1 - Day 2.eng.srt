um so uh just before we begin uh I just

9
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,500
wanted to reiterate the code of conduct

10
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,540
uh so some behaviors were reported

11
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,299
yesterday it's very important for us uh

12
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,520

the keynote speaker so I'll try to be

30
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,739
brief there I just want to present Jeff

31
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:16,140
Yates there that is our keynote speaker

32
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,860
today so thank you Jeff for being here I

33
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,860
just wanted to Quick presentation it's

34
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,780
not going to be product related right

35
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,099
don't worry it's not going to be

36
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:28,260
marketing related

37
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,420
um just you know there's a Hot Topic

38
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,120
that we're hearing you know from many

39
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,319
customers and a lot of

40
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,640
board members csos the c-suite in most

41
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,040
companies tried to figure out what is

42
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,620
zero trust right who has heard about

43
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,440
zero trust just raise your hand there

44
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,720
well everybody has heard about zero

45
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,420
trust and I'm pretty sure everybody has

46
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,260
their own definition of zero trust right

47
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,720
so I'll try to shed some lights around

48
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,220
that

49
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,580
so just we did a survey uh in

50
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,180
collaboration with a company and 75

51
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,980
percent of organization

52
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,680
have some sort of a zero trust project

53
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,159
right they're discussing zero trusts

54
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,200
what it means for them how we can

55
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,920
Implement zero trusts uh uh but only 14

56
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,379
percent of organizations have reported

57
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,239
that they have done a zero trust

58
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:28,680
deployment right

59
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,620
and the reason for that is the lack of

60
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,860
clarity right everybody has their own

61
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,739
definition of what is zero trust

62
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,739
you know zscaler we had our definition

63
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,340
you talked to other vendors we all had

64
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,560
you know our own definition around zero

65
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,580
trust but now what's really cool is that

66
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,640
there's a framework that has been uh

67
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,739
built around zero trust and I'll present

68
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:57,180
you that framework

69
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,780
first just before we start right John

70
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,340
kindervag

71
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,760
initiated zero trust in 2010 right he

72
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,519
was a Forester analyst and this is when

73
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,980
zero trust was kind of created and until

74
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,439
two years ago we didn't have any really

75
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,260
a framework you can't agree or not with

76
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,839
the framework uh but there was no

77
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,120
framework so everybody had its own

78
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,340
definition about zero trust

79
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,320
but what we're trying to achieve from a

80
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,360
zero trust perspective you know our son

81
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,800
our Crown Jewel is your data right

82
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,520
and what we need to protect is that data

83
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,180
uh and we have users that connect

84
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,699
that are using device that connect to a

85
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,680
network to an application to get access

86
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,800
to your data right so this is the five

87
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,280
pillars of a zero trust Foundation its

88
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,600
identity device Network segmentation

89
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,060
application and data so that's you know

90
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,160
from a high level concept from a

91
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,740
Forester perspective you know the the

92
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,340
zero trusts that was developed by John

93
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,919
and that we still use today but the good

94
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,880
thing is now everybody have their own

95
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,460
definition of what is zero trust right

96
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,280
and this came with a zero trust

97
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,340
framework we can have many discussion

98
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,000
around the framework is it good is it

99
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,860
bad should it be

100
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,259
this should it be that but at least now

101
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:30,600
we have a framework and this will work

102
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,120
to improve that framework and bottom

103
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,800
line you know what you need to

104
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,900
understand from the nist framework is

105
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,759
most customers

106
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,759
you know today you have users that

107
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,740
connect to resources and you have an

108
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,720
enforcement point which is a firewall

109
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,699
right that is connected with your

110
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:50,400
identity and depending on your identity

111
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,060
you'll access the proper resources

112
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,060
you know what niss is bringing into the

113
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,220
framework is a policy decision point

114
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,560
right which is a true policy engine

115
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,220
right that understands the user the

116
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,280
device the contacts and that is

117
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,120
integrated in constant feedback loops

118
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,539
with your policy enforcement

119
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:17,479
information points right your endpoint

120
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:22,080
your sim all the tools you have that are

121
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,419
able to detect something you need to

122
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:26,759
have a feedback loop between those

123
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,580
systems and the policy decision point

124
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,960
and from there

125
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,319
you know depending on the user the

126
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,139
device and the context of all that

127
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,240
information that you have on the right

128
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,419
will be able to make good policy

129
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:45,180
decision of who is accessing what

130
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,780
and where as an example of a policy you

131
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,080
know a user could access an application

132
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,800
but when he's located in China

133
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,259
is subset of application that he can

134
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,660
access is reduced right so we need to

135
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,539
understand that's an example of

136
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:05,460
understanding the context and the more

137
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,020
context we have

138
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,360
the more information we have from those

139
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,300
policy inform information points the

140
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,900
better decision we can make from a

141
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,840
policy decision perspective so this is

142
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,240
really what you need to understand

143
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,940
is before

144
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,919
you know this is mainly where all

145
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,319
customers are and within the nist

146
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,900
framework this is kind of the uh this uh

147
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,319
addition which is the PDP and the PIP

148
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,139
okay really simple

149
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:39,840
uh so what does it mean

150
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,639
very easy

151
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,880
right you need to verify uh everything

152
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,759
every session needs to be authenticated

153
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,580
and we need to understand the context

154
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,580
right from those policy information

155
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,759
points once we understand that context

156
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,460
we control and we scan the traffic

157
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,220
against all malware known and unknown

158
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,400
and after we just enforce the policy so

159
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,220
we connect the user with the appropriate

160
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,919
resources or our applications right so

161
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,620
this is from a high level perspective

162
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,020
what we're trying to achieve from a zero

163
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,180
trust perspective and I think a picture

164
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,680
is worth

165
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,979
you know uh is worth any words there

166
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:27,060
most customers today this is still what

167
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,819
you have you are authenticate the user

168
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:33,779
and the user is on the network and sees

169
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:37,020
a lot of resources from that perspective

170
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,099
right

171
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:41,760
not good not bad you know most of the

172
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,740
control points that we have today are

173
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,620
bolted to the network and every time you

174
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,620
touch the network it's complex right

175
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,899
so and you cannot stop the business

176
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,779
right as a security person you want to

177
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,060
be there to support the business and not

178
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,279
slow down them so most of the time

179
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,339
you'll be a bit loose right because if

180
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:04,519
you do too much changes on the network

181
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:07,200
uh you're gonna break something and

182
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,180
you're going to slow down the business

183
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,279
so what we're trying to do from a zero

184
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,220
trust perspective is just Ensure

185
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,580
that each user has access to the right

186
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,120
doors they need to do their job right

187
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,300
so it's kind of a like John kindervac

188
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,040
mentioned it's the least privileged

189
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,740
access that we're trying to achieve with

190
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,140
zero trust and at the end if you're

191
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,300
successful in a zero trust

192
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,800
implementation

193
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,860
the users will access only the

194
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,959
applications that they need to work

195
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:43,680
so this is no product related I Andrew's

196
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,440
going to be happy Andrew he told me Seth

197
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,540
don't talk about products marketing and

198
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,640
everything so thank you for your time

199
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,640
and just Jeff up to you thank you for

200

um

213
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,940

220
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:53,839
I'm gonna have to

221
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,018
sorry for this

222
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,120

ah there you go

225
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,980
please ignore the higher Hitman

226
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,440
um bookmark that's work related I

227
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,800
promise

228
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,940
I swear this will make sense in a couple

229
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,560
minutes

230
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,019
um okay

231
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:29,100
so why do I have a hire a hitman uh

232
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,860
so yeah I work with the cryptar at KATU

233
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,019
Canada which is um

234
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:35,579
so we're the team that looks at

235
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:39,420
basically bad stuff online so we cover

236
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,959
uh disinformation uh you know fake news

237
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,640
stuff like that we also Cover online

238
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,640
extremism scams stuff like that so the

239
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,260
higher Hitman obviously is not a real

240
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,240
Hitman it's a scam website that I was

241
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,820
looking at and forgot to remove the uh

242
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,579
the uh The Bookmark before coming here

243
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:58,320
and freaking everybody out

244
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,459
um so thanks to uh you go and Jean

245
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:03,899
Philippe for inviting me I don't think

246
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:07,440
John Philip made it nope okay cool I

247
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,120
guess uh he had a bit of a party last

248
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,959
night

249
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,940
um so they wanted me to come and give

250
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,040
you my uh perspective

251
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,800
um on the

252
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,380
topic of AI so I know this is a really

253
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,079
loaded term there's a lot of hype a lot

254
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,200
of moral Panic around this and I know

255
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,339
that uh

256
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:29,399
AI is probably not the correct term

257
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,680
um for for what everybody's referring to

258
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,019
so I still think it's a useful shorthand

259
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,940
for

260
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,519
um so the the generative AI tools that

261
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,019
have been given to the public so like

262
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:42,540
Chachi PT mid-journey stuff like that

263
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,540
that is causing all of this hype and

264
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,120
panic so I'm going to use AI as a you

265
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,459
know useful uh shorthand for these

266
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:52,260
systems

267
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,519
um so that's what I'm talking about when

268
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,959
I'm talking about AI it's just like

269
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,519
these these tools that have been given

270
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:57,959
to the public

271
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:00,680
um so a bit of background about you know

272
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,839
what we work on

273
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,019
um a couple years ago we exposed a

274
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,779
company working right here in Montreal

275
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:11,339
um downtown that was running

276
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,800
subscription trap scams they were making

277
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,560
100 million dollars a year they were

278
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,600
working on Peel Street right downtown

279
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,680
here

280
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,959
um we uncovered this the company shut

281
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:25,019
down so we were kind of

282
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:27,060
we were kind of happy about that that

283
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,440
outcome because you know this this

284
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,500
company was basically running fake

285
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,019
um Netflix type websites people would

286
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,519
sign up and then their credit card would

287
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,440
get you know charged and billed over

288
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,660
months and that's how they made their

289
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,620
money

290
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,260
um we also uh just this year

291
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,779
um covered um a network of criminals in

292
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:49,500
Montreal that are operating those little

293
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,540
scam text that everybody gets you know

294
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,339
so you get a text on your phone that

295
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:56,940
says uh you know you owe 300 for your

296
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,560
power bill or stuff like that they use

297
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,540
you know a link

298
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,700
that they um they didn't they then used

299
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,160
to steal the person's identity so we

300
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,079
discovered this whole um

301
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,880
this whole parallel economy in Montreal

302
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,920
is these kids in Montreal that operate a

303
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,680
lot of these uh these scams

304
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,620
um and this this they've built a whole

305
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,320
parallel economy using uh stolen credit

306
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,940
cards and stuff like that

307
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,980
um so that's the type of stuff that we

308
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,860
work on and that's the framework

309
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,380
um through which I look at these new

310
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,139
tools that um have been made available

311
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:32,639
to the public

312
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,459
um I think the kind of debate around

313
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:39,660
these tools is a bit exaggerated

314
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,660
um so if you look at you know the

315
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,860
nightmare scenarios that are often um in

316
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,980
the media sorry uh so you'll have

317
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,420
something like this so you have a deep

318
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,279
fake of Joe Biden

319
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,160
yada yada yada we're all dead

320
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,980
um that's that's a simplistic framework

321
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,820
that a lot of people uh think

322
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,079
um these tools are going to be used for

323
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,060
so you know you know they'll make

324
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,240
political deep fakes that'll cause all

325
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,920
sorts of political strife and stuff like

326
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,820
that

327
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,040
um that's possible

328
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,699
um

329
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:16,500
I'm not saying it's not going to happen

330
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,459
but I think a lot of the misuses of

331
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:22,079
these Technologies for political

332
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,240
purposes are going to be much simpler

333
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,940
and much less sophisticated than that

334
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,760
when I saw the first image generators

335
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,279
come online last summer I kind of had

336
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:35,279
the feeling that these AI tools like

337
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,440
mid-journey would be used almost as

338
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,959
political cartoons so not necessarily to

339
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,420
convince people of you know create a

340
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,399
fake image and convince people that this

341
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,440
is actually happening but more

342
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,339
um to create a kind of an image of what

343
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:52,380
of your opinion of what's happening in

344
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,540
the world so for example a good example

345
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,800
of this was When Donald Trump was uh

346
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,540
arrested a couple months ago people were

347
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,279
creating these images

348
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,199
showing Donald Trump getting arrested so

349
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:05,639
they're kind of creating these images as

350
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:08,220
an idealized version of what they want

351
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,100
reality reality to be like so it's kind

352
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,199
of like

353
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:13,940
less

354
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,260
using these tools to convince people and

355
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,320
more to like to to show your opinion and

356
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,120
you know to to

357
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,120
um to kind of like a political cartoon

358
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,420
basically to kind of parody a reality

359
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,860
um

360
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,079
the inverse opinion that I see a lot and

361
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:33,600
from a lot of you know experts that I

362
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,760
follow on Twitter is you know a lot of

363
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,860
people say well these tools are just bad

364
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,320
they suck right uh they'll say look at

365
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,420
how many teeth this girl has

366
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,620
um

367
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,880
so like

368
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,279
they're they're like how could anybody

369
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,440
think that this is a real image you know

370
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,040
it'll never convince anybody uh this

371
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,779
image that was shared by a Donald Trump

372
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:56,279
Jr you know

373
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,259
what the hell is this guy's face you

374
00:16:58,259 --> 00:16:58,980
know

375
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,920
um so so there's a there's an attitude

376
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,959
you know that is very prevalent where

377
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,780
it's like these things will never or

378
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,520
maybe not never but as they are right

379
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,319
now they're they're not good enough to

380
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,559
actually cause very you know important

381
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,000
damage

382
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,059
um

383
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:19,439
I've seen a lot of opinions that it's

384
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,679
just a glorified auto complete that does

385
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:25,020
a lot of makes a lot of mistakes and it

386
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,900
really does this um I asked chat gbt to

387
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,240
write a biography of me and it um it

388
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,240
says I was born in 1980 not true uh it

389
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,100
says I went to University of Montreal

390
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,080
not true just

391
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,720
says this really confidently so a lot of

392
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,919
people look at this and they're like

393
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,760
well you know this is not good you know

394
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,340
if you get chat gbt to write articles

395
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,039
for you whatever it's just very low

396
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:53,520
quality and most people would maybe be

397
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,980
able to see through that um

398
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,440
what I think though is that it's already

399
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,400
good enough to cause damage because

400
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,299
um

401
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:06,200
these systems are optimized for spam so

402
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,460
when you think about spam what is it

403
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,940
it's low quality content that is cheap

404
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,700
to produce and that can be you know

405
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,980
sent to thousands hundreds of thousands

406
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,980
millions of people and well these

407
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,940
systems

408
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,260
take one of the things out of the

409
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,539
equation so they

410
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,880
they make it extremely cheap to create

411
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,980
infinite content

412
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,740
um and it's pretty much instantaneous so

413
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,440
it's it's perfect for spammers and and

414
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,559
um people who are doing The Click bait

415
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:40,260
or stuff like that on social media now

416
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,520
if you think

417
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,740
um who would want to click on crappy

418
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,380
articles written by chat GPT or you know

419
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,919
images that are have too many teeth and

420
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,840
stuff like that I invite you to go look

421
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,480
at Facebook's most widely viewed content

422
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,740
they um

423
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,919
they produce a quarterly

424
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:01,020
um a quarterly report

425
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,460
um where they show the most popular

426
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,039
posts on Facebook for the past three

427
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,240
months This was um last last report and

428
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,260
you see you can see that the most

429
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,080
popular stuff online is basically

430
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,480
um fish food right it's it's not good

431
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,179
content and um so these systems are like

432
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:20,460
perfectly adapted to create an infinite

433
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,320
flow of content that people will

434
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,380
mindlessly uh click on we're already

435
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,140
seeing chat GPT being used for all sorts

436
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,580
of spam online

437
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,240
um

438
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,760
so this is a funny

439
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,160
um funny situation where a lot of people

440
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,140
use chat GPT and they'll copy the whole

441
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,480
thing and for forget to not copy the

442
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,760
regenerate response at the bottom

443
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,280
so if you search for regenerate response

444
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,980
on Google on Amazon or stuff like that

445
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,440
you'll see a ton of like these this is a

446
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,539
Drop Shipping type of operation that

447
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:53,940
uses to write

448
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,480
um to write a you know

449
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,340
some ad copy for their soap uh here's um

450
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,880
this is a real estate listing written by

451
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,440
regenerate response

452
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,340
um

453
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,600
so you know obviously I think that um

454
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,400
these systems are already here

455
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,700
um you might not see that much harm in

456
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,760
spam it's annoying uh it's it's low

457
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,440
quality crap that

458
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,299
everybody says they don't click on it

459
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:26,039
but obviously people do click on it

460
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,600
because it's you know

461
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,580
um it's often some of the most popular

462
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,520
content on social media

463
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,299
um

464
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,940
you know honestly on a personal level I

465
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,700
think that this might

466
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,660
one day make large platforms like

467
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,640
Facebook basically unusable for people

468
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,220
so you know if you have infinite content

469
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,320
you don't know what is written by humans

470
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,080
you don't know uh if the pictures or of

471
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,580
the people are real if the accounts are

472
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,919
real you know they're

473
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,520
they can use chatbt for to answer

474
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,520
um questions or direct messages

475
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,320
um I can't show you this because we

476
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,620
haven't reported it yet but we did last

477
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,740
week find a network of 300 something

478
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,600
Facebook pages

479
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,059
um that are running thousands of ads on

480
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:18,419
Facebook all using basically these

481
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:20,220
systems so they'll create

482
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,559
the images with social with uh with

483
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,980
mid-journey they'll um answer comments

484
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,260
using chat GPT almost instantaneously

485
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,059
they'll answer

486
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:32,039
um direct messages

487
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,980
um using chat GPT these people are are

488
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,659
they don't speak English as a language

489
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,940
but they're able to have English

490
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,360
speaking uh content they'll use Chachi

491
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,840
PT to create these clickbaity articles

492
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,100
um

493
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,720
so I can't show you that because we

494
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,980
haven't reported it but it's already

495
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,600
here they're already using this for

496
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,460
these purposes

497
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,159
um and it's kind of funny because

498
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,700
these click-baity type of of uh of

499
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,580
Articles were kind of not in style for a

500
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,280
couple years you know like Facebook and

501
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,380
and Google kind of Crackdown on this

502
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,840
type of content you know they they want

503
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,140
to you Google demonetized or said they

504
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,720
wanted to demonetize click bait websites

505
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,980
and stuff like that

506
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,760
um

507
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,740
Facebook said that they cracked down on

508
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,900
on this type of content we're seeing a

509
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,419
Resurgence of this now because it's so

510
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:26,400
cheap to produce using these systems so

511
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,260
you don't have to pay someone you know

512
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,600
five dollars an hour to write articles

513
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,000
anymore you can just generate them

514
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,440
automatically

515
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,419
um and you can have an infinite amount

516
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:38,340
of content so

517
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,100
this is

518
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,080
I think it's going to be a problem uh in

519
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,780
the in the upcoming months years

520
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,580
um for people who use social media I

521
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,260
don't know what it's going to do

522
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,520
um it'll be interesting to see how the

523
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,559
platforms actually react and and try to

524
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,380
moderate these uh this new reality but

525
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,179
it's it's it's it's coming fast that's

526
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:58,200
for sure

527
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,940
but um

528
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,179
I want to drill down today on one

529
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:04,919
specific case

530
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:08,360
um where I see this already being used

531
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:13,080
and I can see kind of

532
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,720
um future potential uses of these

533
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,700
Technologies to cause some you know real

534
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,900
damage

535
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,059
um in the world so I want to talk to you

536
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:23,159
about the world's biggest scam

537
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:25,280
um

538
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,340
and this is I started researching

539
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,140
um I started covering this scam two

540
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,260
years ago uh when I first realized how

541
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,360
massive this scam is it completely blew

542
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,320
my mind

543
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,620
um I had no idea that this existed it's

544
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,620
under our feet it's it's a massive

545
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,380
fraudulent industry that um

546
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,960
steals billions of dollars

547
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,720
um from normal people uh every year and

548
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,179
not many people are talking about this

549
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:55,919
unfortunately it's really hard to get

550
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,659
the the word out on this and

551
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:00,659
unfortunately World governments aren't

552
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:04,679
um really acting either so the um the

553
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:07,620
scam is pretty simple on this surface so

554
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,919
people will end up on a trading website

555
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:13,260
that looks legit

556
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,580
um they're often promised that they're

557
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,940
going to be making you know 200 300

558
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,919
percent returns

559
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,159
um they're asked to

560
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,500
put in a small amount of money to invest

561
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,620
usually 250 dollars

562
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,320
um when they do invest so they send

563
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,539
money you know they're they're shown a

564
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:36,480
trading platform that looks real it

565
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,059
shows their investment it's all fake so

566
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:40,919
the people running this scam they they

567
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:43,200
can show the user absolutely anything on

568
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,659
this so the person

569
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:46,260
um

570
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,440
usually puts more money uh puts more

571
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,620
money more money they have an investment

572
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:55,020
agent that calls them basically every

573
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,640
day

574
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,500
um some of these victims form

575
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,960
relationships with these um with these

576
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,520
agents you know they feel like they're

577
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,799
almost a member of their family

578
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,440
um I've seen cases where this goes on

579
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,140
for a year so they'll call the person

580
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,900
how's your kids doing okay cool yeah you

581
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,640
should invest because look you made a

582
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,020
lot of money last month and you should

583
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,299
put more money more money and these

584
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:21,179
people get absolutely cleaned they lose

585
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:23,580
everything so at the kazoo Canada we

586
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,840
talked to

587
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,500
um a woman from utawei region she lost

588
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,100
250 000 basically all her home equity

589
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:36,020
gone to this scam

590
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,580
you lost a million dollars his entire

591
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,799
life savings completely wiped out

592
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,539
because he thought he was investing in

593
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:43,919
Bitcoin

594
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,740
um you know I get that most people here

595
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,120
would probably not fall for this type of

596
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,679
scam and you're probably thinking these

597
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,960
people are kind of dumb for clicking on

598
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,299
this uh this guy's a psychologist you

599
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:58,080
know like um he's not dumb uh maybe

600
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,419
um has a bit of trouble

601
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:02,700
understanding how the internet works or

602
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,980
how crypto works or stuff like that but

603
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,440
a lot of people are getting wiped out by

604
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,679
this in Canada just last year

605
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:11,340
um

606
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,679
the amount of money lost in these frauds

607
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,140
doubled in Canada so it was almost 100

608
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,900
million dollars lost and this is an

609
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,260
understatement even the government

610
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,880
admit that it's only five or ten percent

611
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,299
of victims actually report uh being a

612
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:29,220
victim of this type of scam

613
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,380
average victim loses seventy thousand

614
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,380
dollars so that's a considerable chunk

615
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,430
of change

616
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:35,880
[Music]

617
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,659
um

618
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:40,440
if if you're interested in this um in

619
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,260
this scam I invite you to watch this

620
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,200
documentary from BBC it was made by

621
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,940
Simona wineglass who we see here she's

622
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,039
an absolute Beast of an investigative

623
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:51,179
reporter

624
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:53,460
um she uh she works at the Times of

625
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,580
Israel where this fraud started

626
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,200
basically

627
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,240
um and so in this documentary she she

628
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,760
uncovers one of these criminal gangs she

629
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,460
finds out that uh

630
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,559
it's being run by an ex-politician in

631
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,720
Georgia it's really wild stuff I really

632
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,419
really recommend watching it but just to

633
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:14,580
give you a quick idea of what we're

634
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,020
talking about here

635
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,240
um Simona describes it as the Uber of

636
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,320
fraud

637
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,140
um and it really is that it's applying

638
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,020
the lessons of big technology to fraud

639
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,059
so like a lot of people when they

640
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:29,400
imagine fraudsters doing this type of

641
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,720
stuff they imagine you know a couple

642
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,480
guys in a basement with hoodies on uh

643
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,620
you know that are stealing these

644
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,080
people's money it's not that it's it's

645
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,760
an industry so there's like

646
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,480
we don't know exactly how much but

647
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,880
between 10 and 15 of these criminal

648
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,760
gangs running these uh these um

649
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,539
these scams they have dozens of call

650
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:54,020
centers each each call center has like

651
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,340
150 employees

652
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,640
um this their their salaried people

653
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,279
um and

654
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,480
this is a business

655
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,880
um and they've also now started doing is

656
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,940
they've they've basically uberized this

657
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,100
this system so they it's kind of like

658
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,279
fraud as a service basically so

659
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:17,100
how it started was in Israel they used

660
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,080
to run these call centers running what's

661
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,860
called a binary option scams so

662
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,960
basically it's it's a way of betting on

663
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,940
the stock market so you bet that the

664
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,100
stock goes up or the stock goes down and

665
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,720
you either win or you lose most people

666
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,980
lose money

667
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,380
um what happened is these guys realized

668
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,159
that

669
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:37,020
most people lost money so that's good

670
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,900
for them and if people win money you can

671
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,900
just not give them their money so that's

672
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,600
how this scam started is basically

673
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,820
um when people made gains they would

674
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:51,120
stall they would say oh we need kyc know

675
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,580
your client uh you'll need to pay income

676
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,260
tax you need to pay the Israeli income

677
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,360
tax on your on your gain stuff like that

678
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,400
and if all else failed they could just

679
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,279
close the website and start a new one

680
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:04,200
it's it costs nothing to start um

681
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,760
websites

682
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,820
um 2017

683
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:11,820
Israel ban binary options so they had to

684
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,620
find something else

685
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:17,400
they started doing crypto so if you've

686
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,820
ever heard of the Ico boom in 2017 2018

687
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,659
a lot of these guys were into that

688
00:29:23,659 --> 00:29:26,279
but they also developed a system where

689
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:27,840
they sell

690
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,539
their they sell this fraud as a service

691
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:33,360
so instead of running the call centers

692
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,820
themselves they basically sell it as a

693
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,700
service so for a fee and a cut of the

694
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,340
profits they'll help you set up a call

695
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,380
center they'll help you train

696
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,039
um

697
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:47,000
they'll help you train your employees

698
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,039
they'll help you launder your money show

699
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:52,559
you how to do it in a way that is uh

700
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,840
safer safe ish

701
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,480
um and so in the past five six years

702
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,279
we've seen a lot of these call centers

703
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:03,000
popping up pretty much everywhere in in

704
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,200
Europe uh we've seen some in Lithuania

705
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,720
Poland Ukraine

706
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,020
uh there's some in there was a couple

707
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,840
last month in Malaysia that got busted

708
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,240
there's even some in South Africa so

709
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,760
it's all these criminal operations run

710
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,919
remotely like that

711
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:25,740
um it's basically a massive massive

712
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,840
massive industry

713
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,279
um

714
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,279
on this live stream from offshore alert

715
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:34,919
um Ken gamble who's um who's a fraud

716
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:37,760
researcher in the in Australia

717
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,740
he basically this was four years three

718
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,120
or four years ago he was basically

719
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,980
saying already that

720
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,919
um this fraud had basically escaped most

721
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:49,559
governments ability to do anything

722
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:52,620
because the money travels so fast it

723
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,940
goes from bank account to bank account

724
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,580
to bank account it's almost impossible

725
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,860
for local police to actually investigate

726
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,059
these crimes

727
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:02,460
um one of the really messed up things

728
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,919
that the these criminals do is

729
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:07,140
um so when you sign up to the platforms

730
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,580
they'll ask for

731
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:11,039
kyc because you know they act like

732
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,600
they're a legitimate

733
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,700
um financial service so they'll ask for

734
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,799
photo ID for all your personal

735
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,899
information date of birth and social

736
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:20,159
security number

737
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,960
um they don't care about doing kyc

738
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,299
obviously they're criminals um but what

739
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,620
they will do is they'll use that

740
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:28,919
information to open a crypto account on

741
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:32,880
you know Kraken or crypto.com and then

742
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,100
use that to launder money

743
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,200
uh and then once they're done with it

744
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,600
they'll actually sell the uh they'll

745
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,159
sell the personal info on the on the

746
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:42,840
black market so they'll make even more

747
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,720
money with the info that they stole

748
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,880
um it makes it almost basically

749
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,919
impossible for local police officers to

750
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,500
do anything so if they've managed to

751
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,440
track the crypto payments to the crypto

752
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,960
exchange well you know the the person

753
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,240
who cashed out is basically someone

754
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,399
whose info was stolen by the same

755
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,559
criminal group so you know it makes it

756
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,720
exceedingly hard and most countries

757
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,340
don't really do anything

758
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,059
um

759
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:12,779
the U.S is one uh they these criminals

760
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:14,460
don't accept U.S clients so if you go on

761
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,399
the websites using a

762
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,380
u.sip their geofence you can't you can't

763
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:22,500
go there uh to sign up you have to swear

764
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,940
that you're not a U.S citizen they're

765
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,880
extremely afraid of the US one reason is

766
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,620
a couple years ago

767
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,140
um one of these crime bosses she went to

768
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,539
the U.S to visit her family and she got

769
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:36,120
picked up 22 years of prison in U.S

770
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,039
prison so they're very afraid of the U.S

771
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:41,340
Germany is doing some pushback on this

772
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,039
fraud there's been a couple crackdowns

773
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,779
in call centers in the past two years in

774
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:47,820
Europe there was one a couple months ago

775
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:51,720
in Lithuania and and Serbia I think

776
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,419
um but it's most most countries aren't

777
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:57,419
doing anything I can tell you that um

778
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:01,260
Canada is not doing much of anything for

779
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,360
these uh for these frauds unfortunately

780
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,760
so the victims we spoke to they're

781
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,140
talking to a wall basically they lost

782
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,240
their life savings and

783
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,919
um it's they're being told by the police

784
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:13,559
that there's nothing nothing to be done

785
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,779
they can't do anything why am I talking

786
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:17,640
about this why don't I talk about this

787
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,519
for the last 15 SEC 15 minutes when

788
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:22,980
um I'm supposed to be talking about AI

789
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,380
um it's because

790
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,140
this whole sophisticated industry of

791
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,460
fraud has one major

792
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,440
entry point so I described the back end

793
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,500
the front end looks like this

794
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,960
um

795
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,240
it's Facebook ads basically

796
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:42,840
um

797
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,299
so it's these Facebook ads that usually

798
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:47,340
have a local celebrity so they'll Target

799
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,840
Canada with

800
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,440
um

801
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,580
the 90 of the ads have Elon Musk but

802
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,399
they use local politicians in Canada to

803
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,080
try to get people to click on these as

804
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,440
they use uh local celebrities I saw one

805
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,500
uh two days ago with Seth Rogen

806
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,299
um so they'll try to convince people to

807
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:08,520
click on these ads using

808
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,099
um local celebrities when you click on

809
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:12,418
the ad

810
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:15,119
um you get sent to a fake newspaper

811
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,540
article that says oh you know Elon Musk

812
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,219
invented a new way to make money click

813
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:22,980
on this and then you're sent to the um

814
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,500
you're sent to the uh to the actual

815
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,199
fraud now I know once again most people

816
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,239
here would never fall for this

817
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,260
um and you probably think it's

818
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:35,219
ridiculous this works this works

819
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:36,899
extremely well

820
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:38,460
um it's really hard to pin down how much

821
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,918
money these criminals make but

822
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:43,260
upwards of 10 billion a year probably

823
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:46,379
more uh you know one of the criminal

824
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:48,119
groups the biggest one makes you know

825
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:51,060
one or two billion dollars a year

826
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,159
um and it's not it's not the biggest one

827
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,899
so you know it's

828
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:57,960
extremely massive and the entryway into

829
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,440
these scams is really simple it's spam

830
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,500
basically it's really low quality most

831
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,260
people would read this and realize that

832
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,200
it's complete crap but it unfortunately

833
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,520
it works and you know we often say well

834
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,020
if you you know if you sign up for this

835
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,060
you should have uh done your own

836
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,099
research you should have tried to you

837
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:21,599
know at least know what you're investing

838
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:22,680
in

839
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:26,099
um here's one of these crime products uh

840
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:28,619
so called Quantum AI so let's say you're

841
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:31,460
someone who sees this and you're like oh

842
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:35,460
I want to look at what this is so you

843
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,680
Google Quantum Ai and every single

844
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,640
result on the first page is

845
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,140
ads bought by these scammers

846
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:43,859
um

847
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:46,560
and uh there's actually one real result

848
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,200
on the first Google page it's for a

849
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,300
Google product called Quantum AI as well

850
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,940
so these people beat Google at their own

851
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,520
SEO on their own platform

852
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,240
um

853
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,660
and so

854
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:02,700
how I'm tying this into AI is that these

855
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,079
ads are not run by the criminals

856
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,060
themselves they're run by affiliate

857
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,160
marketers so the the the the the the

858
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,920
these crime syndicates don't run their

859
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,119
own ads because they want plausible

860
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:13,800
deniability

861
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,740
um so they'll pay Affiliates often

862
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,079
people in countries like Bangladesh

863
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:22,200
Pakistan uh Vietnam stuff like that uh

864
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,060
who will run these ads on Facebook for

865
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,079
them

866
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:26,040
um

867
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,260
this is really lucrative for the people

868
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,880
running the ad so this was on an

869
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,040
affiliate marketing website yesterday

870
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,560
um the payout is twelve hundred fifty

871
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,140
dollars so if you manage to get someone

872
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,060
to click on your ad and make a minimum

873
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,460
deposit of 250 you get twelve hundred

874
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,920
dollars U.S

875
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,020
um that's a lot of money in in a lot of

876
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,820
countries and if you can get a lot of

877
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,440
people to click on these ads you're

878
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,260
going to make a lot of money

879
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:54,060
these systems the AI systems like Chachi

880
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,280
PT they're a boon for these people

881
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,140
um

882
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,460
oftentimes they don't speak English

883
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,359
they don't know the local uh culture or

884
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,240
political uh context and they want

885
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,760
to create ads that will make people

886
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,640
click on them so already they can use

887
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,760
systems like you know uh like the the

888
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,540
Bing AI or Chachi pt4 that now can

889
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,520
browse the internet uh to ask for oh

um craft ads with that uh they can use

893
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,960
of course Chachi PT to create the the

894
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,579
actual ad copy

895
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:33,359
um

896
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,000
the only thing holding these uh these

897
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,940
scammers back was that it cost money to

898
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,859
create these ads right so they would

899
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:43,320
have to pay people on Fiverr to write

900
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,480
these fake news articles

901
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,839
um that cost money that takes time

902
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:50,820
um now they can just do it automatically

903
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,160
with these systems they can create

904
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,960
images of course and we're already

905
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,680
starting to see these scammers use

906
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,560
um the the AI systems to uh to run their

907
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,320
scams this is when I saw on Twitter a

908
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,020
couple days ago the this is clearly

909
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,359
written by chat GPT you can just sense

910
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:10,260
it

911
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:14,280
umt has a certain style to it so they're

912
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,780
already starting to use this to write

913
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,560
these ads to write these articles

914
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,300
um I saw one yesterday I don't know if

915
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,720
it'll play

916
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,119
no sound okay

917
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,280
um so it's a it's a deep fake of Tucker

918
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,720
Carlson

919
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,180
um they used 11 Labs which is a vocal

920
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,579
cloner to clone his voice and he's

921
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:37,859
talking about how uh Elon Musk created

922
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:41,220
this wonderful new way to uh to make

923
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,540
money

924
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,440
um

925
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,880
once again I don't think most people

926
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,619
here would fall for this you know the

927
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:49,619
the lips are kind of off

928
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:52,440
um but these things work they've been

929
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,420
working for years and this is just like

930
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,540
another tool that

931
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,680
um they're going to be uh using to to

932
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,720
ruin people's lives basically

933
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,960
um and basically the the Last Frontier

934
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,020
that these scammers had was it costs

935
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,839
money and time to create the content to

936
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:15,660
get people to click and sign up to these

937
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,359
these frauds and that barrier is now

938
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:19,920
gone

939
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,540
just to finish up

940
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:26,060
um it's not just using these tools to to

941
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,380
create content for people to click on

942
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,540
they're already using

943
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:34,500
AI in their ad campaigns so crypto is

944
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,720
kind of not it's kind of down and

945
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,380
there's less of a buzz on crypto lately

946
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:42,540
so they've started of course including

947
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,000
chat GPT and open AI in their ads

948
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,560
because that's the new hotness people

949
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,540
want to invest in this

950
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,260
um

951
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:53,280
so yeah so basically I'm personally kind

952
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,820
of worried about where this is is going

953
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,220
uh it's already a huge problem it's

954
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,740
already a problem that is exploding

955
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,079
um what we're hearing is these

956
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,660
um these criminals are targeting

957
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:09,180
Canadians specifically Canadians are a

958
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,099
prime target for these uh these frauds

959
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:12,540
because

960
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,760
um authorities aren't very aggressive in

961
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,160
pursuing uh and pursuing the people

962
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,859
behind this uh and Canadians you know

963
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:20,940
are

964
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,180
Canada is a relatively rich country

965
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:27,900
um and so we're you know our citizens

966
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,420
you know are being targeted by the by

967
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:33,300
these massive criminal gangs and I just

968
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,500
want to finish on this you know like

969
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,800
often with fraud we're under the

970
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,000
impression that it's well it's just you

971
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,859
know it's it's too bad but it's money

972
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:42,540
stolen

973
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,940
um and you know you can always make more

974
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,560
money or whatever

975
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,320
um but these are criminal gangs they you

976
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,800
know they're they use this money

977
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,599
to finance corruption in certain

978
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:56,220
countries they're they're paying off

979
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,900
authorities to run their their call

980
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,480
centers it's organized crime so there's

981
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,240
there's always the the violence

982
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,339
um you know the the the uh the presence

983
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:08,040
of violence in these circles so these

984
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,020
the money that's being stolen from

985
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,660
basically Canadian retirees is going to

986
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,160
these criminal gangs and financing

987
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,320
criminal activities

988
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,700
um overseas so it's a huge problem and

989
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,560
unfortunately these these systems have

990
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,680
basically given them a huge gift to

991
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,780
continue doing their uh their operations

992
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:31,320
and and uh nuking people's lives

993
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,440
unfortunately so that's

994
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,040
all I have to say about that thanks

995
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:45,900
[Applause]

00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:22,940
all right

1003
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:11,850
hello

1004
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:14,400
[Music]

1005
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,420
all right uh so moving on from the

1006
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:20,940
keynote we have a vulnerability research

1007
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:25,020
block of two talks and uh here I have my

1008
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:27,420
moderator for the vulnerability research

1009
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,780
blog uh so after particularly enjoying

1010
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:32,400
his master's degree on symbolic

1011
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,220
execution of binary software Phillip

1012
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:37,680
pepper spitzclair is now a PhD candidate

1013
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,260
obsessing over automated antivirus

1014
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:42,059
evasion he's working on red and blue

1015
00:53:42,059 --> 00:53:45,180
teams uh he's a founding member of Co-op

1016
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,339
and a member of the Eternal seconds Uber

1017
00:53:47,339 --> 00:53:50,280
okay CTF team who participated in North

1018
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,619
tech for multiple years so welcome

1019
00:53:52,619 --> 00:53:55,380
Philip enjoy

1020
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:58,020
thank you Google

1021
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:01,559
so we have a very cute block with two

1022
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:03,480
very nice speakers that have presented

1023
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,280
something that was really cool so um

1024
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,040
first up we have uh

1025
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,200
that will well you probably know him

1026
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,000
already so I won't take too much time

1027
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,640
but he's a hacker security researcher a

1028
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,980
red teamer he's been Microsoft most

1029
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:19,680
valuable researcher multiple times

1030
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,300
um and he recently started his own

1031
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,599
company 2022 if I remember correctly

1032
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:26,940
which is called Outsider security

1033
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:27,720
um

1034
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,180
so I'll leave you guys with you uh with

1035
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:31,800
uh

1036
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:35,160
um he actually is here he usually works

1037
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,859
on active directory security Azure ID

1038
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:39,960
stuff like that so today he's gonna give

1039
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,599
us his little Deep dive on Windows or

1040
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:44,040
Microsoft hello

1041
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:48,000
so the four is yours amaze us thank you

1042
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,099
all right good morning everyone and

1043
00:54:50,099 --> 00:54:51,839
today we're going to talk about Windows

1044
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:52,619
hello

1045
00:54:52,619 --> 00:54:54,900
um I had to make some fun with hello so

1046
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,460
call it hello from the other side I'm

1047
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,020
not going to sing No One's Gonna want

1048
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:59,160
that

1049
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,200
um a little bit about me I'm dirkian I'm

1050
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,180
from the Netherlands last year I started

1051
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:05,339
my own company I do a bit of a mix of

1052
00:55:05,339 --> 00:55:07,980
research consultancy pen testing and

1053
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:11,099
also trainings on Azure ad I really like

1054
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:14,240
to to research these things most of my

1055
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,980
time researching I first built some

1056
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,599
tools and then I used the tools to

1057
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:20,160
analyze like okay how does this actually

1058
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,359
work

1059
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,099
um so that means I wrote quite some

1060
00:55:23,099 --> 00:55:24,900
tools almost all of them are available

1061
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:27,000
as open source tools

1062
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,500
um I have a Blog where I write about

1063
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,819
these tools I have a Twitter account

1064
00:55:29,819 --> 00:55:31,559
where you can stay up to date with my

1065
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:33,000
research so if you want to follow me

1066
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,280
there go ahead

1067
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,380
um in this talk well we're gonna cover

1068
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:40,200
quite a lot of content content I'm gonna

1069
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,119
start with explaining some of the

1070
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:44,579
windows hello for business Concepts

1071
00:55:44,579 --> 00:55:47,400
um I'm going to shorten it to whfb from

1072
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,200
here on because writing it out it's

1073
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,119
going to be very long and I also got a

1074
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:53,040
short on it to just saying Windows hello

1075
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,480
instead of Windows hello for business

1076
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,980
technically there are some differences

1077
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:58,440
but for our purposes um just call it

1078
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:59,520
Windows hello

1079
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,859
I'm going to look at like what flavors

1080
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:03,359
of Windows hello there are how you can

1081
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,880
deploy it how they work on a technical

1082
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,579
level and what we can do with it or what

1083
00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:11,460
we could do with it which also involves

1084
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:13,319
like bypassing things multi-factor

1085
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:15,839
authentication lateral movements so a

1086
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:18,000
lot of fun

1087
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,680
um for those of you who don't know

1088
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,119
exactly what Windows hello for business

1089
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:23,339
is and basically it's one of Microsoft

1090
00:56:23,339 --> 00:56:25,500
products which allows you to go

1091
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,200
passwordless so instead of a using a

1092
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,180
password Windows allow users

1093
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:31,980
cryptographic keys that are stored

1094
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:35,220
hopefully securely on your device and

1095
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:37,319
then you can basically unlock that key

1096
00:56:37,319 --> 00:56:40,500
Either by Biometrics or via bin or a

1097
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,960
fingerprint or something and then you

1098
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,220
can authenticate

1099
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:46,980
and each device that you're using that

1100
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:49,559
uses Windows hello it has a separate key

1101
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:52,500
and that key can be used to authenticate

1102
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,300
to things like Azure active directory

1103
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,280
there's also flavors that are purely for

1104
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,619
on-prem active directory but in this

1105
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:00,540
talk we're mostly focusing on Azure

1106
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:02,520
active directory and on some hybrid

1107
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:05,460
Parts in which Azure active directory is

1108
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:08,339
actually the key component

1109
00:57:08,339 --> 00:57:11,099
so there's some prior work that this

1110
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:13,619
talk is partially based on the most

1111
00:57:13,619 --> 00:57:16,079
interesting one is I think the Talk

1112
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:18,240
exploiting Windows hello for business by

1113
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,160
Michael gruffnetter it's from a couple

1114
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,859
years ago from blackout Europe where he

1115
00:57:22,859 --> 00:57:25,559
presented about the windows hello for

1116
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:27,180
business internals in active directory

1117
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:30,000
and this was one the inspiration for the

1118
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,099
shadow credentials attack which you may

1119
00:57:32,099 --> 00:57:33,960
be familiar with which is basically an

1120
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,960
attack for on-prem active directory

1121
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,760
um there's also been quite some research

1122
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,980
in like bypassing the facial detection

1123
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:43,740
of Windows hello on how it actually

1124
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:46,079
works with the TPM and stuff Benjamin

1125
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:48,660
Delphi did some research on the Windows

1126
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:50,280
internal things how the internal things

1127
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:52,619
are handled but I couldn't really find

1128
00:57:52,619 --> 00:57:54,720
anything that was specifically on how

1129
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,300
window seller works with Azure ID so I

1130
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:00,180
basically started researching that

1131
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:02,640
um and before I started I like okay

1132
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,220
what's the key protections and the key

1133
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:07,859
components and and basically came up

1134
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:09,540
with this list this is mostly what

1135
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:12,240
Microsoft advertises at so

1136
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,920
um Microsoft basically says okay windows

1137
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,960
low for business it provides strong

1138
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,880
phishing resistance multi-factor

1139
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,680
authentication so it's very secure

1140
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,380
obviously one of the reasons why it's so

1141
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:24,240
secure is because you need MFA to

1142
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,280
provision it so it works as a second

1143
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,800
factor it's bound to a specific device

1144
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,680
so you cannot just like steal it and use

1145
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,440
it on some other device and they also

1146
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,540
Focus heavily on Hardware protection of

1147
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:39,359
keys so they store these things in a

1148
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:41,579
trusted platform module which prevents

1149
00:58:41,579 --> 00:58:43,859
attackers from like extracting the keys

1150
00:58:43,859 --> 00:58:45,359
even if they have full control of the

1151
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:47,520
operating system and and this all makes

1152
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,980
it much more secure than a password

1153
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:52,559
authentication

1154
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:53,520
um so

1155
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,200
keep these give this list in mind

1156
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,960
because we'll get back to it later

1157
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,880
um and there's a couple of flavors that

1158
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,260
you can deploy Windows hello for

1159
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:03,960
business ads so we're focusing mostly on

1160
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,119
the Azure ad native scenario

1161
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:08,400
um today but there's also some hybrid

1162
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,859
scenarios and a way that you can deploy

1163
00:59:10,859 --> 00:59:13,319
it in active directory only

1164
00:59:13,319 --> 00:59:14,819
um the thing is if you're using Azure

1165
00:59:14,819 --> 00:59:17,160
active directory then you already have

1166
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,720
Windows hello for business basically

1167
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,700
whether you're actively using it or not

1168
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:23,640
it's always enabled I haven't found a

1169
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:25,380
way to disable it I don't know if it's

1170
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:27,480
even possible to disable it and so if

1171
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,099
you are using Azure active directory

1172
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:30,900
then you have Windows hello for business

1173
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,480
and all the other flavors that work in

1174
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:35,819
hybrid configuration they require some

1175
00:59:35,819 --> 00:59:38,819
sort of configuration so unless someone

1176
00:59:38,819 --> 00:59:41,339
specifically configured that then you

1177
00:59:41,339 --> 00:59:43,140
usually don't have it in your network

1178
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:45,599
but they're actually ad native one it's

1179
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,760
always there basically

1180
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,980
and there's a few components that are

1181
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:52,680
important if you have winners low in

1182
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,980
Azure ID so you always need some device

1183
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:58,140
so this could be Azure 80 joint or

1184
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:00,240
registered devices so they could be

1185
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,640
managed using a NDM such as InTune for

1186
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,099
example and then Windows hello for

1187
01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:06,900
business enrollment will take place as

1188
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,780
the final part of of the Windows setup

1189
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:12,299
or alternatively if it's enabled later

1190
01:00:12,299 --> 01:00:14,339
on then the OS will basically prompt you

1191
01:00:14,339 --> 01:00:16,980
to to replace your signing credentials

1192
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:19,020
with Windows hello for business

1193
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:21,180
and that will show The Following screen

1194
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:23,579
and using Windows 11 just to show that

1195
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:25,079
it's this works on the most modern

1196
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:27,299
version of the operating system and so

1197
01:00:27,299 --> 01:00:29,040
basically it will give a pop-up and say

1198
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,660
okay well you sign in with your

1199
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,819
passwords now let's set up some

1200
01:00:32,819 --> 01:00:34,380
Biometrics authentication or pin

1201
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:37,140
authentication to use Windows hello

1202
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:38,640
and it will then prompt you for

1203
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,559
multi-factor authentication so an

1204
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:42,720
important part is that to enroll these

1205
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,359
things you normally always need note

1206
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:47,099
effector authentication and of course

1207
01:00:47,099 --> 01:00:48,660
we'll look at into how that works a bit

1208
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:51,299
later on and once you enter the

1209
01:00:51,299 --> 01:00:53,579
multi-factor authentication then it

1210
01:00:53,579 --> 01:00:55,859
prompts you to set up a pin so that pin

1211
01:00:55,859 --> 01:00:57,599
you can use on the device to basically

1212
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,700
unlock the keys and then authenticate

1213
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:01,079
you can also use that with the

1214
01:01:01,079 --> 01:01:02,700
fingerprint or whatever is present on

1215
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,940
your system to to unlock these keys

1216
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:07,680
and there's some technical components

1217
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:08,940
involved here

1218
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:11,339
and one of these is the device identity

1219
01:01:11,339 --> 01:01:13,559
so in Azure ad each device that's

1220
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:15,180
registered has an identity that

1221
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:17,400
basically uses a public and private keys

1222
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:20,220
to prove the device identity and using

1223
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:22,260
the device identity the device can

1224
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:24,780
request a primary refresh token so

1225
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:27,180
primary refresh tokens are basically

1226
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:29,700
tokens that are stored on your device

1227
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:32,700
with which you can use single sign-on to

1228
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:35,280
all Azure ad connected resources so once

1229
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,960
you have a device that has a primary

1230
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,540
refresh token you no longer need to sign

1231
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:41,880
in every time do MFA every time it's

1232
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,559
it's tied to your device

1233
01:01:43,559 --> 01:01:46,440
and also a important component is a

1234
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,660
trusted platform module because all of

1235
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:51,359
these above keys they are protected by

1236
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:53,160
Hardware if you have a TPM on your

1237
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,140
system and so this is the device key the

1238
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:58,140
session key of the PRT and the keys that

1239
01:01:58,140 --> 01:01:59,460
back the Winner's low for business

1240
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:01,920
components so that ensures the security

1241
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,260
of these keys

1242
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:06,299
so if we look at the technical flow

1243
01:02:06,299 --> 01:02:08,579
basically that happens when we configure

1244
01:02:08,579 --> 01:02:11,160
Windows hello for business we see that

1245
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:14,579
it starts with a request for that like

1246
01:02:14,579 --> 01:02:17,099
MFA upgrade so if you set up your device

1247
01:02:17,099 --> 01:02:19,740
you will first enter your username and

1248
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:22,920
password and then it will ask you for

1249
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,140
additional NFA to provision this key

1250
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:27,359
basically and how it does that is it

1251
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:29,819
puts in the request a value which has

1252
01:02:29,819 --> 01:02:33,660
AMR values as NGC MFA and that's a kind

1253
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:35,700
of a special parameter which indicates

1254
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:38,460
that okay for this next step we need

1255
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:41,640
like a fresh MFA token so of course if

1256
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,680
you are already signed in for a long

1257
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,680
time then MFA is usually cached in the

1258
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,440
browser or on your device but NGC MFA

1259
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,900
means that it should be a fresh MFA so

1260
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,520
you will get interactively prompted

1261
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,440
whether or not you already did MFA like

1262
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,020
five minutes ago or not and this

1263
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:00,059
indicates that there should be a fresh

1264
01:03:00,059 --> 01:03:02,280
like MFA prompt

1265
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,900
um NTC actually stands for Next

1266
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:06,119
Generation credentials and this is a

1267
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:08,280
term that we'll see more often and so

1268
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:10,619
internally Microsoft calls Windows hello

1269
01:03:10,619 --> 01:03:13,559
for business Keys NDC keys and the NCC

1270
01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:16,079
MFA is also like where this term is used

1271
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:17,700
to indicate that this is MFA to

1272
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:20,640
provision like a next-gen credential so

1273
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,740
it's too provision a passwordless

1274
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:24,240
credential set

1275
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,579
and if we use this NGC MFA

1276
01:03:26,579 --> 01:03:28,500
authentication that's basically

1277
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,960
reflected as a claim in the access token

1278
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,839
that we get so if we decode the access

1279
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:35,160
token that results from this

1280
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,900
authentication we see that we

1281
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,760
authenticate with the passwords and

1282
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,160
there's the RSA which means that we did

1283
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:43,319
the device authentication as well and

1284
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:46,020
also the MFA and NGC MFA claims so that

1285
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:48,540
indicates to the receiving service that

1286
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:51,420
I just did a fresh MFA evaluation and

1287
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:53,940
that the Mi MFA methods is our actual

1288
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:58,400
are actual and not just some cached MFA

1289
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:02,520
so if we want to provision a Windows low

1290
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:03,839
for business Keys there's a few

1291
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:06,140
technical requirements so

1292
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:08,940
these Keys needs always to be from a

1293
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:10,680
certain device so you need to do the

1294
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,480
authentication from a joint or

1295
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,119
registered device and basically that

1296
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:17,700
will get you a device ID claim in your

1297
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:19,740
token so you cannot just like

1298
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:22,020
login on the browser and then start

1299
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:23,760
provisioning hello Keys you need to do

1300
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,099
that on a

1301
01:04:25,099 --> 01:04:28,260
registered or joined device

1302
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:30,900
um it should also contain the NGC MFA

1303
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,960
claim in a token so that means that you

1304
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:36,960
performed NFA like within the past about

1305
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,280
10 minutes I don't know what the exact

1306
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,559
time is

1307
01:04:39,559 --> 01:04:42,240
and of course you need a token for the

1308
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:45,359
right service and in this case the the

1309
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:47,760
service that handles this key enrollment

1310
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,980
is the device registration service which

1311
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:50,819
lives on the Enterprise

1312
01:04:50,819 --> 01:04:53,640
registration.windows.net

1313
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:57,119
so we have a look at how these key is

1314
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:59,280
registered and we found out that is

1315
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,920
actually like a very simple post request

1316
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,380
like all it does is like here I have an

1317
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:06,839
access token here's my public key that's

1318
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:08,760
just RSA key that's encoded in a

1319
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:11,579
specific way and that's it and I was a

1320
01:05:11,579 --> 01:05:13,799
bit surprised by this because of course

1321
01:05:13,799 --> 01:05:15,599
Microsoft is very big on the whole

1322
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:18,420
Hardware protection Keys need to be in a

1323
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:20,700
TPM and then the registration is just oh

1324
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:22,740
here's public key that's it there's no

1325
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:25,260
proof that this key is in like in a TPM

1326
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:27,540
there's no attestation going on it just

1327
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:29,760
here's an access token here's the key

1328
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,260
good luck

1329
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,880
right

1330
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:37,200
um so the response basically is just a

1331
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,180
status that's hey the the key is

1332
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:41,220
registered and here's some additional

1333
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:43,140
context and we don't need this context

1334
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:45,059
in most cases it's needed for some

1335
01:05:45,059 --> 01:05:47,460
specific hybrid scenarios but in this

1336
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:49,859
case we just can can ignore it and

1337
01:05:49,859 --> 01:05:51,960
because our key has now been provisioned

1338
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:54,720
and we can authenticate with this this

1339
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,540
RSA key that we've registered

1340
01:05:57,540 --> 01:06:01,319
and so to do that that's basically a PRT

1341
01:06:01,319 --> 01:06:04,440
request so if you're familiar with how

1342
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,720
primer refresh tokens are issued and

1343
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,960
it's it usually goes via a request that

1344
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:12,180
involves a Json web token Bearer and

1345
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:14,220
that's assigned request using the

1346
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,319
certificate of the device to prove that

1347
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:18,839
it's from a legitimate device and it's

1348
01:06:18,839 --> 01:06:21,000
just a oauth request to the to the Token

1349
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,020
endpoint

1350
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,780
and it contains this um this this

1351
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:26,880
request which is like an embedded Json

1352
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,079
web token

1353
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:31,079
and if we decode that we see that in the

1354
01:06:31,079 --> 01:06:32,940
header we have the device certificate so

1355
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:34,859
that's to indicate to Azure ad okay it's

1356
01:06:34,859 --> 01:06:36,960
doing it's this device that's doing the

1357
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,359
requests and the device also signs this

1358
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:40,859
Json web token so that's actually

1359
01:06:40,859 --> 01:06:44,640
validate it and in the payload we see a

1360
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:47,280
few parameters one is a nonce so that's

1361
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,380
a very common thing just to make sure

1362
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:51,180
that you cannot do a replay attack with

1363
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:52,859
this because the nodes expires after a

1364
01:06:52,859 --> 01:06:54,900
few minutes and the username that you're

1365
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:57,180
authenticating as so in this case the

1366
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:59,280
TPM test user

1367
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,319
um and we have an assertion which is

1368
01:07:01,319 --> 01:07:03,720
another Json web token so if we take the

1369
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,819
Json web token out of the Json web token

1370
01:07:05,819 --> 01:07:08,880
then we actually see the parts that's

1371
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,220
actually signed with the windows hello

1372
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:13,799
key and so you see in the top you see

1373
01:07:13,799 --> 01:07:16,440
the key identifier so that's indicates

1374
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:19,859
which key was used to sign this the use

1375
01:07:19,859 --> 01:07:22,500
is NDC so that's the next gen credential

1376
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,660
key that indicates that hey this is

1377
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:28,020
token from a next gen credential and in

1378
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:31,680
the assertion we see a timestamp that is

1379
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,359
again against replay attacks because the

1380
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:35,039
assertion will expire after a certain

1381
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:37,500
time and it also contains the tenant ID

1382
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:39,599
so that Azure ID knows like okay this

1383
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:41,819
request goes to this specific Azure ID

1384
01:07:41,819 --> 01:07:43,740
tenant

1385
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:46,140
so if we send this request then we

1386
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:47,760
basically get a response and the

1387
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,200
response will be encrypted but the

1388
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:53,160
device can then decrypt that and then we

1389
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:56,039
get a primary refresh token we get an

1390
01:07:56,039 --> 01:07:58,260
encrypted session key that's neat that's

1391
01:07:58,260 --> 01:08:00,720
needed to use the primary refresh token

1392
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,780
and we'd also get some Kerberos things

1393
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:05,700
we'll get into the Kerberos part later

1394
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:08,039
but for now basically the important part

1395
01:08:08,039 --> 01:08:10,200
is that with this Windows hello key we

1396
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,240
can get a primary refresh token and a

1397
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:15,420
primary refresh token session key

1398
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:19,080
um so I integrated this flow into my my

1399
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:21,299
road tools set in row to row TX

1400
01:08:21,299 --> 01:08:24,420
specifically so row TX now supports like

1401
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:26,759
generating these keys and rolling the

1402
01:08:26,759 --> 01:08:29,160
keys and also getting the tokens that

1403
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:31,500
are required to enroll these keys so

1404
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:34,500
that means it's a token with the NGC MFA

1405
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:37,859
claim so it's with a fresh MFA MFA

1406
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:40,020
upgrades so to say

1407
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:42,600
so just to demonstrate that

1408
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,520
um with this short video I'm going to

1409
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,040
start with requesting a normal primary

1410
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,020
refresh token so this is one with just a

1411
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:51,120
username and passwords and we need to

1412
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:54,120
enrich that with the MFA claim so it

1413
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:56,640
will automatically prompt us for MFA and

1414
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,979
we'll enter the NFA in there and that

1415
01:08:58,979 --> 01:09:01,620
will give us a new token and with this

1416
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:03,420
token we can basically provision this

1417
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:05,698
new windows hello key

1418
01:09:05,698 --> 01:09:08,299
so we provisioned it and then we can

1419
01:09:08,299 --> 01:09:10,439
authenticate with this Windows hello key

1420
01:09:10,439 --> 01:09:13,979
and get a primary refresh token and with

1421
01:09:13,979 --> 01:09:16,560
the primary refresh token we can get new

1422
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:20,100
tokens that include this the

1423
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:22,738
authentication methods RSA and MFA which

1424
01:09:22,738 --> 01:09:24,779
indicates that this was a Windows hello

1425
01:09:24,779 --> 01:09:27,120
authentication because it was done using

1426
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:30,359
a private key which also counts as MFA

1427
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:32,580
so if you see RSA MFA it means that it's

1428
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:35,100
we don't we didn't use passwords but we

1429
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:38,460
used a key to authenticate the user so

1430
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:41,339
we can do this whole flow with with row

1431
01:09:41,339 --> 01:09:44,179
TX if we want

1432
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:45,960
um so there's a few interesting

1433
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:48,299
observations in there so first of all

1434
01:09:48,299 --> 01:09:51,299
this full provisioning process so

1435
01:09:51,299 --> 01:09:53,399
um deciding to start using Windows hello

1436
01:09:53,399 --> 01:09:55,500
it's completely controlled by the

1437
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:56,880
clients I mean you can set as

1438
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,320
administrator you can set policies

1439
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:59,820
whether you want to use Windows hello

1440
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:02,160
for business or not but if you're using

1441
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:04,440
Azure ID devices only it's basically

1442
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:06,960
always enabled so if you're if you can

1443
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,760
convince your device to start the

1444
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:10,260
enrollment you can do it whether it's

1445
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:12,179
enabled or not

1446
01:10:12,179 --> 01:10:12,840
um

1447
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,880
it's fully up to the device to do it or

1448
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,699
not and of course any device and user

1449
01:10:17,699 --> 01:10:19,679
combination in the tenant can create

1450
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:22,080
these keys and can register these keys

1451
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:25,320
on on users so you don't have a lot of

1452
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:28,400
control over this

1453
01:10:28,679 --> 01:10:31,260
um going back to this well quite simple

1454
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,780
pre-provisioning protocol there's um

1455
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:35,520
some interesting well basically there's

1456
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,560
two parts one is the key and one is the

1457
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:40,020
token and so I had a look at this how

1458
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:42,780
this token works and I found out that

1459
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:45,780
you didn't actually need this NGC MFA

1460
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:49,320
claim so you could just register a key

1461
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:52,020
with a normal token with normal MFA so

1462
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:53,880
you did need multiple authentication but

1463
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:56,820
it didn't need to be recent so you could

1464
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:59,280
have some cached MFA claim in the

1465
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,800
browser and that you could use to also

1466
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:04,860
provision a new key so if you are an

1467
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:06,719
attacker and you have access to a sign

1468
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:08,880
in browser session or you are on a

1469
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:11,159
user's device already then you can just

1470
01:11:11,159 --> 01:11:13,980
use a single sign-on token or a cache

1471
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,840
token somewhere to actually provision a

1472
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,480
new key without needing to do this MFA

1473
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,760
process again

1474
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:23,159
um so just an example of an attack in

1475
01:11:23,159 --> 01:11:25,980
this case we are using the most recent

1476
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:28,020
version so the windows allow for

1477
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:30,300
business keys are safely stored or

1478
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:32,940
protected by the TPM and the ls process

1479
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:34,800
can access them

1480
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,440
um but we cannot extract these keys but

1481
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:40,080
if you are as an attacker burning some

1482
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,179
malware on this laptop you can basically

1483
01:11:42,179 --> 01:11:44,880
ask LCS for some single sign-on data you

1484
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,440
could say hey I want a token to this

1485
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:48,719
specific service in this case the device

1486
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:51,540
registration service with which we can

1487
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:54,120
provision a new key and then basically

1488
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:56,580
we can get a token we can register a new

1489
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:58,920
key and now we have a key that we

1490
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,900
generated ourselves so it's no longer in

1491
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,520
the TPM we don't need to bother with

1492
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:05,100
trying to extract this TPM from the DPM

1493
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:07,260
we don't even need admin privilege to do

1494
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:09,360
this you can do this from a normal user

1495
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,060
session and then basically you just

1496
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:14,340
register a new key that can be used to

1497
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:16,739
authenticate as that user

1498
01:12:16,739 --> 01:12:19,080
so just to show this

1499
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:21,120
um I'm using a road token which is a

1500
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:22,739
tool I wrote quite a while ago to

1501
01:12:22,739 --> 01:12:24,600
request this single sign-on data and

1502
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,040
there's some references here on my blog

1503
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:27,540
and there's also some alternative

1504
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:29,820
methods to do this and but basically I

1505
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:34,560
get a a single sign-on data or PRT

1506
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:35,940
cookie as it's called

1507
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:39,360
and this I can use with row TX to get a

1508
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,040
token for the device registration

1509
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,679
service so the device registration

1510
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:45,600
service token is needed to provision

1511
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,159
that key

1512
01:12:47,159 --> 01:12:47,820
um

1513
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:50,580
then I get the token I store the token

1514
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:52,620
on disk and with this token I provision

1515
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:55,380
this new key so it saves the key to disk

1516
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:57,719
it sends the post request using the

1517
01:12:57,719 --> 01:12:59,820
access token that we just got we didn't

1518
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:01,560
need to authenticate we just asked the

1519
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,900
operating system for hey give me a token

1520
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:05,760
for this using single sign-on and then

1521
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:08,780
override new key

1522
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:12,300
so we can get a PRT with this with this

1523
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:15,179
key and basically now we have a primer

1524
01:13:15,179 --> 01:13:17,340
refresh token with which we can do

1525
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:19,739
single sign-on as the user it's valid

1526
01:13:19,739 --> 01:13:21,900
indefinitely we can do re-authentication

1527
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:23,400
because it counts as a multi-factor

1528
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:26,040
authentication and we can put it

1529
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:28,159
somewhere it's not protected by anything

1530
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:30,719
it's quite hard for the user to see

1531
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:32,880
actually that they have a new windows

1532
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,340
low for business key enrolled and we can

1533
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:37,380
just get tokens for it we can use this

1534
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:39,120
in a browser whatever we want we can

1535
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:40,800
access anything as the user basically at

1536
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,780
this point

1537
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:46,620
so the short version it was possible to

1538
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:49,440
basically overwrite the key from a

1539
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:51,600
device using single sign-on which

1540
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,340
basically completely defeats this

1541
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:55,679
protection of the DPM because what

1542
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:57,300
doesn't matter if the key is in the TPM

1543
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:59,340
if you can just provision a new key that

1544
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:01,140
you control

1545
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:02,460
um this provides persistence for

1546
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:04,320
attackers pretty easily because the new

1547
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:07,980
key is wherever the attacker decide this

1548
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:10,020
um and an interesting thing is that a

1549
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:11,640
Windows low for business key can be used

1550
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:14,760
with any device so rather than the key

1551
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:17,400
being specific to a device the key is

1552
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,320
valid for any device in the tenant so

1553
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:22,800
you will need to have a real device or a

1554
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,659
fake device as an attacker but any

1555
01:14:24,659 --> 01:14:26,520
device will work with any key as long as

1556
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:28,020
you have the key material

1557
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:30,420
and there's also some tricks that you

1558
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:32,640
can basically restore the original key

1559
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:34,920
from the original device so that the

1560
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:36,480
user device will keep working and you

1561
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,980
just have an additional backdoor key

1562
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:39,239
there basically

1563
01:14:39,239 --> 01:14:43,440
I won't get into it but it's possible

1564
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:47,100
so there's some aspects here left so um

1565
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:48,900
of course we also have windows allow for

1566
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:50,400
business from the perspective of azure

1567
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,679
80 itself so how does Azure ad store

1568
01:14:52,679 --> 01:14:54,600
these credentials

1569
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:57,420
um and it turns out that the keys are

1570
01:14:57,420 --> 01:14:59,880
stored on a user property called

1571
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:02,340
searchable device keys and this is

1572
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:04,620
visible the best in the internal version

1573
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:07,199
of the Azure ID graph and basically

1574
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:10,199
there we see this key material which is

1575
01:15:10,199 --> 01:15:12,120
the the public key so that's the same

1576
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:14,280
key that we put in a post request

1577
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:16,980
earlier just the public key of the um

1578
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:19,260
that belongs to the private RSA key that

1579
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:22,080
stores hopefully in TPM and we see this

1580
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,540
device ID as well so this key belongs to

1581
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:27,560
this specific device

1582
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:30,960
um so it turns out that users can modify

1583
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,060
their own searchable device Keys

1584
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:34,500
property

1585
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,780
um and as long as you have a token for

1586
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:39,000
the Azure ad graph then you can

1587
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,400
basically modify this and just add new

1588
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,679
keys as much as you want and this

1589
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:46,860
doesn't require MFA because it's just as

1590
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:48,659
long as you have a token to modify it it

1591
01:15:48,659 --> 01:15:49,580
works

1592
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:51,659
of course if you have very strict

1593
01:15:51,659 --> 01:15:53,460
conditional access policies and you

1594
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:55,080
require MFA for literally everything

1595
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:58,500
then you would still need MFA but often

1596
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:01,080
companies have some some gaps in their

1597
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:03,120
policies they don't require MFA from

1598
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:06,420
on-prem VPN ranges or from some trusted

1599
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:08,219
devices and then you can basically do

1600
01:16:08,219 --> 01:16:10,080
this without MFA and basically bypass

1601
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:12,360
the whole you need MFA to provision a

1602
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:14,460
key because you can just provision The

1603
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:16,679
Key by writing it to the user object

1604
01:16:16,679 --> 01:16:17,880
directly

1605
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:20,100
so this is a nice bypass for the

1606
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:22,159
conditional access MFA

1607
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:24,420
there are some prerequisites for this so

1608
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:26,280
you will need a device as an attacker

1609
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,140
which you could either register on the

1610
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:30,060
Fly I mean if you can get tokens for the

1611
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:31,679
device registration service you can also

1612
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:33,380
register a device

1613
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:36,420
and you also need a valid access token

1614
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:39,960
so you will need access token to do this

1615
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,699
um but as long as you have that then

1616
01:16:41,699 --> 01:16:43,860
you're fine basically

1617
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:47,100
so that's also possible with row TX so I

1618
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:49,800
made a gen hello key command that just

1619
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,600
generates the key and gives you it in

1620
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:52,920
the right format

1621
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:55,020
and and then you just take this Json

1622
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:58,080
blob and you send a patch request

1623
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,560
created with this basically an extra key

1624
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:03,239
in there so the only difference between

1625
01:17:03,239 --> 01:17:05,760
this is that now we do a patch so we

1626
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:08,460
have the user's access token we patch

1627
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:11,000
their device keys and then we can

1628
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,199
authenticate with this with this key

1629
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:15,000
without having to do the whole

1630
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,699
provisioning process normally

1631
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:19,920
and so just an example of what you can

1632
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,380
do with this there's the

1633
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:23,820
um there's a way to do this like

1634
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:25,380
basically fire fishing so that you

1635
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:27,600
didn't need any external access

1636
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:28,199
um

1637
01:17:28,199 --> 01:17:30,179
I'm assuming that people are familiar

1638
01:17:30,179 --> 01:17:31,679
with the vice code fishing I don't know

1639
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:33,659
if we have time to explain it

1640
01:17:33,659 --> 01:17:35,520
um but basically it's a technique where

1641
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:37,440
you initiate the authentication on a

1642
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,179
different device than what your user is

1643
01:17:39,179 --> 01:17:42,420
on so as an attacker you would talk to

1644
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:43,920
Azure ad and say Hey I want to

1645
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:47,100
initialize the device code flow then you

1646
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:48,900
fish the user and basically convince

1647
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:52,020
them to to do the device authentication

1648
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:53,880
on their part so it can be done with an

1649
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:55,620
email just saying hey go to this website

1650
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:58,320
enter this code and authenticate and if

1651
01:17:58,320 --> 01:17:59,820
you can convince the user to do that

1652
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:02,940
then you can get a access token on

1653
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:05,760
behalf of the user for the for the

1654
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:08,600
correct API now this this token

1655
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,980
it's already quite powerful because you

1656
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:13,199
can do a lot of things with it but with

1657
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:16,140
this token we can now also register a

1658
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:18,000
new windows hello key and then basically

1659
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,940
have persistent access to the to the

1660
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:23,940
user's information and basically can get

1661
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:25,920
access in any way that we want which is

1662
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:27,659
a lot more of course than this single

1663
01:18:27,659 --> 01:18:30,300
access token we fish with it

1664
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:33,020
so the attacker can register the device

1665
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:35,340
register the windows hello Keys as

1666
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:37,080
backdoor credentials and then from then

1667
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,960
on the attacker can just use the the

1668
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:43,080
keys and get a a token for whatever they

1669
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:45,239
want they can log interactively in the

1670
01:18:45,239 --> 01:18:47,159
browser as the user and access the

1671
01:18:47,159 --> 01:18:49,140
user's resources

1672
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:51,179
and there are some alternative scenarios

1673
01:18:51,179 --> 01:18:54,540
so you can also abuse this with like

1674
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:56,340
normal credential phishing so if you can

1675
01:18:56,340 --> 01:18:58,920
convince users to log in on your fake

1676
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:00,780
websites you can also get a token

1677
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:03,239
register the key again if you have

1678
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:05,340
access to their device temporarily so if

1679
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:06,780
you have malware running on there or

1680
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:08,760
they leave their laptop unlocked you can

1681
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:10,380
also get the correct tokens and then

1682
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:12,840
just create these backdoor credentials

1683
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:14,640
and the nice thing is that this also

1684
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,920
works on other accounts as long as you

1685
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:19,080
have permissions to modify them so

1686
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:21,480
there's roles in Azure ad that allow you

1687
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:23,580
to modify other accounts which include

1688
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:25,260
like the user administrator of course

1689
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:27,480
Global administrator and they can

1690
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:30,239
basically create keys on other user

1691
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:31,500
objects

1692
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,540
we'll look a bit more of this in a

1693
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:35,480
second

1694
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:39,420
so this was purely Azure ad and we also

1695
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:42,060
can do this with hybrid scenarios

1696
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:44,219
and if you want to use Windows hello for

1697
01:19:44,219 --> 01:19:46,260
business in a hybrid scenario then

1698
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:49,400
there's different methods with different

1699
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:51,480
requirements and different complexities

1700
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:54,540
I think the simplest one and also the

1701
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:56,580
one that's recommended by Microsoft is

1702
01:19:56,580 --> 01:19:59,100
the cloud Kerberos trust and this

1703
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:01,199
doesn't require that much on-prem

1704
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:03,179
infrastructure it doesn't require adfs

1705
01:20:03,179 --> 01:20:06,060
it doesn't require a pqi infrastructure

1706
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:08,400
on-prem so this is the recommended way

1707
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,560
and the easiest way

1708
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:13,440
and the nice thing about Cloud Kerberos

1709
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:17,100
trust is that it basically creates a

1710
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:18,960
trust between active directory and Azure

1711
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:21,480
ad using the Kerberos protocol

1712
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:25,020
so if you set this up then basically

1713
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:28,800
what it does it it creates a read-only

1714
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,480
domain controller it's not real one

1715
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,159
because there's no real server behind it

1716
01:20:32,159 --> 01:20:33,900
but basically it creates read-only

1717
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:36,000
domain controller accounts which has

1718
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,219
some Kerberos Keys registered and it

1719
01:20:38,219 --> 01:20:41,219
replicates these keys to to Azure ad

1720
01:20:41,219 --> 01:20:43,620
so when a user authenticates with

1721
01:20:43,620 --> 01:20:46,440
Windows hello then basically Azure ad

1722
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:49,380
can give them a a ticket and ticket

1723
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:51,560
granting ticket in this case which is

1724
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:55,080
signed with this these keys of this is

1725
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:57,120
the read-only domain controller and this

1726
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,219
is what we call a partial THC because

1727
01:20:59,219 --> 01:21:01,980
Azure 80 doesn't know all the user

1728
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:04,320
information that stored on-prem but it

1729
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,659
sends a ticket granting ticket with just

1730
01:21:06,659 --> 01:21:08,520
enough information to authenticate the

1731
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:10,620
user to the to the on-prem domain

1732
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:12,420
basically

1733
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:16,020
and the user can then exchange this for

1734
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:17,880
a full ticket granting ticket and with

1735
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:19,560
this full ticket granting tickets they

1736
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:21,900
can authenticate to any on-prem

1737
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:24,480
resources using Kerberos

1738
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,040
um and if the resources don't use

1739
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:28,920
Kerberos then you can also obtain the

1740
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:31,560
anti-hash of the user so then the user

1741
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:35,640
can also use ntlm authentication by

1742
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:38,340
getting the NT hash using the Kerberos

1743
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:40,640
protocol

1744
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,320
um some technical details again

1745
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:45,360
basically when you request a primary

1746
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:48,300
refresh token using a Windows hello for

1747
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:50,400
business key we can obtain the partial

1748
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:53,460
3dt we can exchange this for a full gdt

1749
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:55,320
that can be used to access directory

1750
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:57,780
resources and of course this only works

1751
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:59,699
for hybrid accounts so the accounts

1752
01:21:59,699 --> 01:22:01,800
should already exist in the on-prem

1753
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,960
active directory and in Azure ID because

1754
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:07,440
otherwise I mean it can send a TGT for

1755
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:08,760
that account but if the on-prem doesn't

1756
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:10,860
know about the user then it's not going

1757
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:12,360
to work

1758
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,940
and basically this DET looks like this

1759
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:18,360
so we previously saw the TT response

1760
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:21,360
here's the primer refresh token primary

1761
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:23,640
first token session key and then we also

1762
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:25,679
get a ticket granting ticket included in

1763
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:28,260
that this is the partial tdt

1764
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:32,219
and we can exchange that for a full DHC

1765
01:22:32,219 --> 01:22:34,679
and this also allows some nice lateral

1766
01:22:34,679 --> 01:22:37,679
movement opportunities so because user

1767
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:39,420
administrators in Azure 80 could

1768
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:41,340
provision these keys or user accounts

1769
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:43,800
and so if you had high privilege Azure

1770
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:46,440
ad access you could just create Windows

1771
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:48,600
hello keys for everybody that you are

1772
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:50,000
allowed to modify

1773
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,199
to provide that you have the normal

1774
01:22:52,199 --> 01:22:54,360
access right so there are some things in

1775
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:55,920
Azure ID it preference like user

1776
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,679
administrators creating keys on higher

1777
01:22:58,679 --> 01:23:00,600
administrator roles but if you have the

1778
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:03,120
correct privileges then you can assign

1779
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:05,400
new windows hello keys

1780
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:07,260
um so you could add Vector credentials

1781
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:11,640
to any user you could then also get a

1782
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:14,159
PRT for them also get a ticket printing

1783
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:16,380
ticket for them and as long as you have

1784
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:18,300
connectivity to an on-prem domain

1785
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:19,820
controller then you could also

1786
01:23:19,820 --> 01:23:23,219
authenticate to any on-prem resources

1787
01:23:23,219 --> 01:23:24,900
and the only account this doesn't work

1788
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:26,640
for is like domain admin accounts

1789
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:28,980
because these have special protections

1790
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:30,900
so you could not do this for domain

1791
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:33,179
admin accounts but any regular users you

1792
01:23:33,179 --> 01:23:35,760
could basically by modifying their keys

1793
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,820
in Azure ad gets a ticket renting ticket

1794
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:40,260
for them and then move to their

1795
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:43,340
identities on-prem

1796
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:47,699
last example for this so we request the

1797
01:23:47,699 --> 01:23:51,120
PRT for the for a hybrid user

1798
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:54,900
so in this case the um the user has a

1799
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:58,380
hybrid account it's a synced user so it

1800
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:01,380
exists in Azure ad and on-prem AD using

1801
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:04,020
this hello key and a device that we

1802
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:05,760
registered so you still always need a

1803
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:08,159
device as an attacker and basically we

1804
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:11,699
can we get this PRT which also includes

1805
01:24:11,699 --> 01:24:14,100
the ticket branding tickets

1806
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:17,040
we can extract the tickets branding

1807
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,659
tickets from the primary first token

1808
01:24:18,659 --> 01:24:22,800
data and basically save it in a c cache

1809
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,420
file so I'm using some impact tools for

1810
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:26,880
this and we can also exchange this for a

1811
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,800
full ticket branding ticket and by

1812
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,320
simply asking for a for a ticket

1813
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:34,199
granting ticket using the partial tdt

1814
01:24:34,199 --> 01:24:36,719
and what we also can do is recover the

1815
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:39,179
anti-hash for this user so

1816
01:24:39,179 --> 01:24:41,880
um I could probably give an entire talk

1817
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:43,560
about how this vertical works exactly

1818
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:45,120
and if you want to read about that it

1819
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:47,280
was some nice research done a couple of

1820
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,320
years ago by Leandro

1821
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:51,960
um but basically because of this whole

1822
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:54,540
setup then if you authenticate with

1823
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:56,940
Windows hello for business in a cloud

1824
01:24:56,940 --> 01:25:00,659
Kerberos trust then you can also get the

1825
01:25:00,659 --> 01:25:03,239
NT hash when you authenticate so as an

1826
01:25:03,239 --> 01:25:05,940
end result if I am a global admin or

1827
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:07,980
user admin in Azure 80 I could use

1828
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:09,780
provision keys for anybody that I want

1829
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:11,880
and if I also have line of sight to the

1830
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,620
on-prem ad domain controllers I could

1831
01:25:13,620 --> 01:25:15,719
then also get there and T hashes and

1832
01:25:15,719 --> 01:25:19,380
crack them get their passwords etc etc

1833
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:21,060
and I still need to upload these tools

1834
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:22,679
they're not fully finished yet but

1835
01:25:22,679 --> 01:25:25,800
they'll be part of my roto's hybrid tool

1836
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:28,140
set basically

1837
01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:29,820
so

1838
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:31,980
last part about the disclosure to

1839
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:35,100
Microsoft and of course I submitted all

1840
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:36,659
this to Microsoft because those are

1841
01:25:36,659 --> 01:25:39,179
quite some sphere vulnerabilities and

1842
01:25:39,179 --> 01:25:41,520
lateral movement opportunities

1843
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:44,640
um so I submitted this in October 2022

1844
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,620
and basically from then on they

1845
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:48,540
acknowledge the issue started working on

1846
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:51,179
fixes and basically in February to April

1847
01:25:51,179 --> 01:25:52,980
some back and forth about the fixed

1848
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:57,600
timeline and the it was not always the

1849
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,280
case that the issues would be fixed

1850
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,199
before this talk and eventually they

1851
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:03,540
fixed most of it before the talk and we

1852
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:05,340
also had some discussions about whether

1853
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:06,960
or not this was an identity bug or

1854
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:09,420
another bug I'll save you that story as

1855
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:10,620
well

1856
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:13,380
um basically the end result is that last

1857
01:26:13,380 --> 01:26:15,120
week and this week they rolled out the

1858
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:17,100
fixes for this so just in time for me to

1859
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:19,020
talk about this and basically they

1860
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:22,500
removed the option to add new keys via

1861
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:24,360
the searchable device key property so if

1862
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:25,739
you try to do that now it won't work

1863
01:26:25,739 --> 01:26:28,320
anymore and they now also properly

1864
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:31,980
require the NGC MFA to provision a new

1865
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:33,540
key fired the device registration

1866
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:35,540
service so you cannot do this with like

1867
01:26:35,540 --> 01:26:38,520
old an old MFA claim that's cached

1868
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:40,580
somewhere you need to actually do MFA

1869
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:42,480
interactively in order to provision

1870
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:44,760
these new keys

1871
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:47,100
so getting back to our initial

1872
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:49,739
assumptions

1873
01:26:49,739 --> 01:26:52,199
um it provides strong fishing resistance

1874
01:26:52,199 --> 01:26:55,679
mfas a bit questionable

1875
01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:58,560
um I don't fully agree that this is MFA

1876
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,780
at all I mean it's just a key somewhere

1877
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:03,300
and everything about where that key is

1878
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:05,460
stored how it's handled It's All Pure

1879
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:07,920
assumptions and I mean you fully trust

1880
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:09,480
that the device actually puts it in the

1881
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:12,000
TPM Azure ad cannot see whether it's in

1882
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,040
a TPM or not it doesn't have any data it

1883
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:16,100
just has a key somewhere

1884
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:18,659
fishing resistant well hopefully now it

1885
01:27:18,659 --> 01:27:20,639
is definitely before you could actually

1886
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:23,280
register a key fire fishing so not fully

1887
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,020
fishing resistant

1888
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:27,420
require MFA to provision well that's

1889
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:29,760
definitely was not the case since we

1890
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:32,100
could provision it with just an access

1891
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:34,500
token to the API and whether or not you

1892
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:36,900
needed MFA for that was purely up to the

1893
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:38,699
tenant configuration

1894
01:27:38,699 --> 01:27:41,100
it's not bound to a specific device so

1895
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:42,900
if you can dump the windows hello key

1896
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:45,060
from one device you can just use it with

1897
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:47,639
another device just fine

1898
01:27:47,639 --> 01:27:50,940
the keys are protected by the TPM and

1899
01:27:50,940 --> 01:27:53,580
that still doesn't prevent attackers if

1900
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:55,560
they have some form of access to the

1901
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:57,840
device from actually using that

1902
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,219
um there's another story here that I

1903
01:27:59,219 --> 01:28:01,380
can't talk about yet but that's for next

1904
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:03,300
talk

1905
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:04,739
um but though it's still more secure

1906
01:28:04,739 --> 01:28:06,900
than password authentication so

1907
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:08,159
um it's definitely not that it's

1908
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:09,659
completely horrible broken and we should

1909
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:11,940
all go back to weak passwords

1910
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:14,280
um I like Windows hello it's not perfect

1911
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:16,139
there are some improvements now it's

1912
01:28:16,139 --> 01:28:18,120
hopefully a bit more secure

1913
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:20,639
um let's try to move away from passwords

1914
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:23,100
because well we all know that having

1915
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:25,199
secure passwords is still a unsolved

1916
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:27,120
problem in our industry

1917
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:30,600
so to end all the two false yeah the two

1918
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:33,420
tools in this talk are based on my road

1919
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:35,580
tools framework they're open source I

1920
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:37,380
already pushed the windows hello

1921
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:38,760
features for that so you can play with

1922
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:41,880
it yourself I'll try to push the hybrid

1923
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:45,000
tools later this afternoon as well

1924
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,679
um I do have some Road tool stickers so

1925
01:28:46,679 --> 01:28:47,760
definitely

1926
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:50,520
um if you see me walking around then ask

1927
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:53,460
me for some and there's no time for

1928
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:55,080
questions now but after the next

1929
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:57,179
presentation there's a q a in this room

1930
01:28:57,179 --> 01:28:59,699
later so um I'd be happy to take any

1931
01:28:59,699 --> 01:29:01,860
questions then or via email or via

1932
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:03,780
Twitter or if you see me around then

1933
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:06,420
definitely just ask and I'll be happy to

1934
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:07,560
answer

1935
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:09,240
thank you

1936
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:18,358
[Applause]

1937
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:22,040
hello

1938
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:25,199
all right so we'll be back in like 15

1939
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:26,880
minutes with Ron

1940
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:30,920
five actually five so short break

1941
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:38,360
yeah

1942
01:30:39,620 --> 01:30:43,760
they're not the ciders you have here

1943
01:38:01,219 --> 01:38:03,120
hello everyone

1944
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:04,679
please have a seat we're going to go

1945
01:38:04,679 --> 01:38:07,380
ahead and proceed with the next stock so

1946
01:38:07,380 --> 01:38:10,679
we have with us Ron here uh Ron is the

1947
01:38:10,679 --> 01:38:14,400
lead vulnerability researcher at rapid7

1948
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:17,520
um he uh in his job he actually does

1949
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,620
some vulnerability research or deep

1950
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:21,420
Dives some vulnerabilities that already

1951
01:38:21,420 --> 01:38:23,280
exist so that we can understand what the

1952
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:24,780
hell is happening

1953
01:38:24,780 --> 01:38:25,500
um

1954
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:27,900
otherwise he is uh one of the main

1955
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:29,880
organizers of the CTF of the B-side San

1956
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:32,639
Francisco and he also helps with the CTF

1957
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:35,159
in his hometown in Winnipeg which is

1958
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:37,380
called the long con CTF I don't live in

1959
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:39,420
Winnipeg so I have heard of it

1960
01:38:39,420 --> 01:38:40,080
um

1961
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,360
he also has a bird so if you want to ask

1962
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:44,639
him some really fun question ask about

1963
01:38:44,639 --> 01:38:47,060
his bird

1964
01:38:47,219 --> 01:38:49,980
so Ron thank you and go ahead

1965
01:38:49,980 --> 01:38:52,020
hi everyone thanks for having me back

1966
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:54,060
for I think my second time speaking here

1967
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:56,219
sort of hard time being here so thanks

1968
01:38:56,219 --> 01:38:58,980
for having me back over and over again

1969
01:38:58,980 --> 01:39:01,320
so quick introduction as I mentioned I

1970
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:04,860
have Birds those are clang and sharp

1971
01:39:04,860 --> 01:39:07,020
um so yeah I'm a lead singer researcher

1972
01:39:07,020 --> 01:39:10,440
at rapid7 my job is 50 looking at

1973
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:11,699
vulnerabilities that come out that we

1974
01:39:11,699 --> 01:39:13,440
think are important telling our

1975
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:15,600
customers like should you panic should

1976
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:18,000
you patch should you like not worry and

1977
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,020
the other half is finding

1978
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:20,820
vulnerabilities ourselves so like

1979
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:23,580
picking a piece of software like say the

1980
01:39:23,580 --> 01:39:26,100
one we're talking about today diving

1981
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:28,020
into it as deeply as I can and finding

1982
01:39:28,020 --> 01:39:29,580
all the bugs I can and I'm going to talk

1983
01:39:29,580 --> 01:39:30,659
about the results of one of those

1984
01:39:30,659 --> 01:39:31,620
projects

1985
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:35,159
uh you can find me online Iago xa6 is my

1986
01:39:35,159 --> 01:39:37,440
general Alias everywhere if Twitter's

1987
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:39,300
still up today it will work otherwise

1988
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:42,239
Macedon or GitHub or whatever whatever

1989
01:39:42,239 --> 01:39:43,739
and I've done lots of volunteer stuff

1990
01:39:43,739 --> 01:39:46,139
and yeah I guess I work at rapid seven I

1991
01:39:46,139 --> 01:39:47,520
should mention that because

1992
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:50,460
they're paying for my travel

1993
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:52,260
so this is going to be a deep dive sort

1994
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:54,360
of looking at some vulnerabilities in

1995
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:56,340
specifically in rocket software you need

1996
01:39:56,340 --> 01:39:59,280
RPC server I didn't name this software

1997
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:02,639
in the title because the volunteer made

1998
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:04,820
this talk I found these back in January

1999
01:40:04,820 --> 01:40:07,860
submit this talk in I think January and

2000
01:40:07,860 --> 01:40:09,900
then we disclosed everything in March so

2001
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:11,219
it's all out now

2002
01:40:11,219 --> 01:40:13,860
but at the time I submit this it wasn't

2003
01:40:13,860 --> 01:40:15,179
so we're gonna look at software called

2004
01:40:15,179 --> 01:40:16,460
Unidad

2005
01:40:16,460 --> 01:40:19,020
8.2.4 that was the one they had on their

2006
01:40:19,020 --> 01:40:21,300
trials page so this is the one I chose

2007
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:23,280
it's finding software is often the hard

2008
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:25,440
part of these projects

2009
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:27,360
and I'm gonna

2010
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:29,940
talk about a lot of like protocol stuff

2011
01:40:29,940 --> 01:40:32,040
and show some packet captures and show

2012
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:34,260
some like assembly and stuff like that

2013
01:40:34,260 --> 01:40:35,760
and I'll try to explain everything as I

2014
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:36,840
go and just kind of give you an idea of

2015
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:39,719
how I approach these kinds of projects

2016
01:40:39,719 --> 01:40:41,760
one of the questions I got asked

2017
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:44,400
by rocket software themselves and others

2018
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:46,380
as why did you actually choose this no

2019
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:48,420
one's really heard of the software and

2020
01:40:48,420 --> 01:40:49,320
like

2021
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:50,820
it was kind of personal I won't say

2022
01:40:50,820 --> 01:40:53,280
vendetta but a personal project because

2023
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:55,260
when I worked at tenable in like 2010 or

2024
01:40:55,260 --> 01:40:57,360
so this vulnerability came across my

2025
01:40:57,360 --> 01:41:01,380
plate a packet header Heap overflow and

2026
01:41:01,380 --> 01:41:03,300
I figured out the protocol back then in

2027
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:05,340
like 2010 and thought this looks really

2028
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:06,540
interesting and I wrote the check for

2029
01:41:06,540 --> 01:41:08,580
nessus that I changed jobs and never

2030
01:41:08,580 --> 01:41:10,620
came back to it until recently and I

2031
01:41:10,620 --> 01:41:12,540
thought I really want to go back to this

2032
01:41:12,540 --> 01:41:14,100
and see the software

2033
01:41:14,100 --> 01:41:16,080
so I found it and convinced my boss said

2034
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:18,000
it was worthwhile despite not being well

2035
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,040
known software it's apparently typically

2036
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:21,780
found on back ends so most large

2037
01:41:21,780 --> 01:41:23,820
aerospace companies and Banks and other

2038
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:26,400
companies use this just on the back end

2039
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,199
so it's not it's not usually internet

2040
01:41:28,199 --> 01:41:31,580
facing but it's popular

2041
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:34,980
so I'm going to talk about what uni RBC

2042
01:41:34,980 --> 01:41:38,599
is how it works stuff like that

2043
01:41:39,780 --> 01:41:42,600
so basically you need data and universe

2044
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:44,100
and other tools made by this company

2045
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:46,920
come with a service called uni RPC unit

2046
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:48,719
remote procedure calls

2047
01:41:48,719 --> 01:41:52,500
and uni RPC is an RPC server which

2048
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:54,300
basically has a list of services and

2049
01:41:54,300 --> 01:41:57,300
those that execute a user connects on a

2050
01:41:57,300 --> 01:41:58,619
specific TCP Port that I'll mention

2051
01:41:58,619 --> 01:42:00,719
after and says I want to use this

2052
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:02,699
service and it checksets database and

2053
01:42:02,699 --> 01:42:03,900
says oh I have access to the service

2054
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:05,940
here you go it just gives you a TCP

2055
01:42:05,940 --> 01:42:07,500
connection to that service and then you

2056
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:08,820
talk to that service directly from then

2057
01:42:08,820 --> 01:42:10,199
on

2058
01:42:10,199 --> 01:42:12,540
all the all the communication is done by

2059
01:42:12,540 --> 01:42:14,280
standard packets they have a header they

2060
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:15,900
have metadata they have a body we'll see

2061
01:42:15,900 --> 01:42:19,219
what those details are in a minute

2062
01:42:19,619 --> 01:42:20,940
so one of the first things I do is look

2063
01:42:20,940 --> 01:42:23,520
for attack surface so I install the

2064
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:25,679
software I execute the software that

2065
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:26,880
usually takes two or three days because

2066
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:28,500
of Licensing and because of other like

2067
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:30,659
either wrong Os or the wrong version of

2068
01:42:30,659 --> 01:42:32,340
Fedora or whatever whatever but when you

2069
01:42:32,340 --> 01:42:33,960
eventually get it running you can run

2070
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:36,360
netstat and see that it listens on TCP

2071
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:38,520
Port three one four three eight which

2072
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:39,900
I'm going to forget during a talk but

2073
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:43,500
that is the port that is interesting

2074
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:46,980
so what services can I actually execute

2075
01:42:46,980 --> 01:42:48,600
when you install the software it comes

2076
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:51,380
with a file called uni RPC Services

2077
01:42:51,380 --> 01:42:54,179
I saw the file I saw it being read by

2078
01:42:54,179 --> 01:42:56,699
the process and the first instinct I

2079
01:42:56,699 --> 01:42:58,020
have is to like reverse engineer the

2080
01:42:58,020 --> 01:43:00,060
process to like figure out what this

2081
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:01,199
file means

2082
01:43:01,199 --> 01:43:02,760
and like if you look at the file I think

2083
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:05,100
a lot of fields you can kind of guess

2084
01:43:05,100 --> 01:43:08,340
from Context the First Column udcs and

2085
01:43:08,340 --> 01:43:11,639
Etc looks like a name the second one or

2086
01:43:11,639 --> 01:43:13,500
obviously binaries they're in like a

2087
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:15,000
slash bin directory

2088
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,820
the star we can guess might be in ACL of

2089
01:43:17,820 --> 01:43:20,159
some sort a protocol

2090
01:43:20,159 --> 01:43:23,400
a zero and then 3600 is an hour in

2091
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:26,639
seconds so I'm guessing it's a timeout

2092
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:28,920
so I spent probably a day learning how a

2093
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:30,300
processes field and what the fields mean

2094
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:31,320
and everything

2095
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:33,780
is talk I Googled the name of the file

2096
01:43:33,780 --> 01:43:35,760
and it's actually documented

2097
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:37,739
so it turns out I should just read the

2098
01:43:37,739 --> 01:43:38,760
manual

2099
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:40,619
so I was correct

2100
01:43:40,619 --> 01:43:44,340
but this is what I often forget to do

2101
01:43:44,340 --> 01:43:46,980
so one such service in that is a UD

2102
01:43:46,980 --> 01:43:49,679
server and I'm just going to choose a

2103
01:43:49,679 --> 01:43:51,119
service to talk about completely

2104
01:43:51,119 --> 01:43:53,280
arbitrarily this time for now

2105
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:55,020
so on the top line You'll see the entry

2106
01:43:55,020 --> 01:43:56,880
from that file we just saw it's one of

2107
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:58,760
the lines in this file

2108
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:00,840
so if you have an entry in that file

2109
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:03,179
when a client connects it can send this

2110
01:44:03,179 --> 01:44:05,580
packet that's here if it's too small to

2111
01:44:05,580 --> 01:44:07,139
read it's not a big deal this is not

2112
01:44:07,139 --> 01:44:09,179
super important all the bytes mean but

2113
01:44:09,179 --> 01:44:10,800
the first packet that client sends will

2114
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:14,159
be hey please use the ud server service

2115
01:44:14,159 --> 01:44:17,760
and the the uni RPC will parse its file

2116
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:19,980
and say is one of our services called UD

2117
01:44:19,980 --> 01:44:21,300
server

2118
01:44:21,300 --> 01:44:23,219
um oh there it is and then it'll execute

2119
01:44:23,219 --> 01:44:24,360
that binary

2120
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:25,739
so you can see in the on the bottom

2121
01:44:25,739 --> 01:44:27,780
there's a there's a debug log it says

2122
01:44:27,780 --> 01:44:29,940
found service executing

2123
01:44:29,940 --> 01:44:31,440
UD servd

2124
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:33,719
obviously if I'm doing an application

2125
01:44:33,719 --> 01:44:35,699
review I want to see I see the executing

2126
01:44:35,699 --> 01:44:38,219
think can I execute my own thing or can

2127
01:44:38,219 --> 01:44:40,020
I only exceed with their stuff and in

2128
01:44:40,020 --> 01:44:41,340
this case I can only execute their

2129
01:44:41,340 --> 01:44:43,080
binaries but that's definitely a thing I

2130
01:44:43,080 --> 01:44:45,239
looked at

2131
01:44:45,239 --> 01:44:46,739
so we've seen it we've seen this packet

2132
01:44:46,739 --> 01:44:48,300
capture a couple times let's kind of

2133
01:44:48,300 --> 01:44:49,980
dive into what it means

2134
01:44:49,980 --> 01:44:51,900
I want to give sort of a quick overview

2135
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:53,219
I have a lot of slides with a lot of

2136
01:44:53,219 --> 01:44:54,840
packets on them I'm going to skip to

2137
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:56,400
them Subway quickly because I just want

2138
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:57,900
to give you give the idea of how this

2139
01:44:57,900 --> 01:44:59,760
works not necessarily every single

2140
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:01,860
detail and then we'll look along the way

2141
01:45:01,860 --> 01:45:03,719
at the vulnerabilities we found while

2142
01:45:03,719 --> 01:45:06,739
actually looking at these packets

2143
01:45:08,460 --> 01:45:11,699
so as far as I can tell uni RBC uses a

2144
01:45:11,699 --> 01:45:13,860
custom binary protocol but I didn't

2145
01:45:13,860 --> 01:45:15,540
actually Google it so maybe it's

2146
01:45:15,540 --> 01:45:17,820
documented I don't know

2147
01:45:17,820 --> 01:45:19,440
um but even in the cases if it was a

2148
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:21,840
standard protocol or was documented it's

2149
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:23,340
always nice to reverse engineer it from

2150
01:45:23,340 --> 01:45:24,900
the binary to see if there's anything

2151
01:45:24,900 --> 01:45:26,940
interesting like how they handle length

2152
01:45:26,940 --> 01:45:29,159
fields and how is it execute other

2153
01:45:29,159 --> 01:45:31,619
processes and how does it you know look

2154
01:45:31,619 --> 01:45:32,880
looking for vulnerabilities are there

2155
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:34,500
undocumented header Flags stuff like

2156
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:36,619
that

2157
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:38,940
so this was originally the end of the

2158
01:45:38,940 --> 01:45:40,800
section but I realized I was gonna dive

2159
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:41,940
into a bunch so I wanted to put the

2160
01:45:41,940 --> 01:45:43,739
beginning of the section instead

2161
01:45:43,739 --> 01:45:45,719
so every message you see will have a 20

2162
01:45:45,719 --> 01:45:49,199
byte header which contains the version

2163
01:45:49,199 --> 01:45:51,600
um the size number of parameters stuff

2164
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:52,560
like that

2165
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:54,420
then there's some metadata which is

2166
01:45:54,420 --> 01:45:56,880
types so basically the client will say

2167
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:58,219
like I'm going to send you a string and

2168
01:45:58,219 --> 01:46:01,199
a string and that's what the metadata is

2169
01:46:01,199 --> 01:46:03,360
I'm going to send you a 10 byte string

2170
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:05,460
and then an integer and then the data

2171
01:46:05,460 --> 01:46:08,820
which is the actual string integer

2172
01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:11,580
so just really quickly looking at this

2173
01:46:11,580 --> 01:46:13,080
that is what you're seeing here is a 20

2174
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:14,340
byte header

2175
01:46:14,340 --> 01:46:16,679
16 bytes of metadata and then the rest

2176
01:46:16,679 --> 01:46:19,260
is the uh strings we'll see more

2177
01:46:19,260 --> 01:46:21,860
examples of that

2178
01:46:22,139 --> 01:46:23,460
so when I'm looking at these kinds of

2179
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:24,719
applications I want to look for attack

2180
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:26,699
surface where is the parsing packets

2181
01:46:26,699 --> 01:46:28,080
where is it actually doing the things

2182
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:29,159
it's doing

2183
01:46:29,159 --> 01:46:31,440
so thankfully when it's on when it's a

2184
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:32,940
Linux binary I can run it in debugger

2185
01:46:32,940 --> 01:46:34,860
and you see I'm using a GDP debugger

2186
01:46:34,860 --> 01:46:37,020
which is just built-in Linux debugger

2187
01:46:37,020 --> 01:46:39,060
that most people use on Linux

2188
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:41,400
I also hacked the executable to get rid

2189
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:43,199
of the forking you'll see any RPC one

2190
01:46:43,199 --> 01:46:45,060
shot that just removes the four Connect

2191
01:46:45,060 --> 01:46:46,920
Four command I used to say sorry about

2192
01:46:46,920 --> 01:46:49,320
that but it was boring so I put my blog

2193
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:50,940
instead

2194
01:46:50,940 --> 01:46:52,980
so basically I run it in a debugger and

2195
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:54,900
I put a breakpoint on the accept command

2196
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:57,840
the accept Cisco the accept accept

2197
01:46:57,840 --> 01:46:59,639
happens or does this call the accept

2198
01:46:59,639 --> 01:47:02,580
function that function is called by the

2199
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:03,960
uh

2200
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:06,360
by the in your PC server to accept a new

2201
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:09,659
connection so a client connects this

2202
01:47:09,659 --> 01:47:11,699
accept call will complete and there'll

2203
01:47:11,699 --> 01:47:13,199
be a new socket created

2204
01:47:13,199 --> 01:47:14,460
so I want to look at where that happens

2205
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:16,080
in the code and there's a little bit of

2206
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:18,000
assembly code at the bottom it's not a

2207
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,500
big deal there's not actually anything

2208
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:21,480
too exciting happening one thing I

2209
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:22,739
always like is looking at debug messages

2210
01:47:22,739 --> 01:47:25,199
though like accepted socket is from IP

2211
01:47:25,199 --> 01:47:27,659
number which tells me that like if I can

2212
01:47:27,659 --> 01:47:31,380
match up that debug message with a few

2213
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:32,520
slides back

2214
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:34,380
you'll see the same debug message here

2215
01:47:34,380 --> 01:47:36,600
accepted socket is from IP number so

2216
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:38,400
being able to match up things you see in

2217
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:40,739
the debugger port with things you see in

2218
01:47:40,739 --> 01:47:43,139
the binary is good

2219
01:47:43,139 --> 01:47:44,820
but this the accept function is not

2220
01:47:44,820 --> 01:47:46,139
super interesting so I'll move on to

2221
01:47:46,139 --> 01:47:47,460
where it does get interesting which is

2222
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:49,020
receive

2223
01:47:49,020 --> 01:47:50,820
the first place I want to see is where

2224
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:52,619
the connection is accepted the second

2225
01:47:52,619 --> 01:47:54,239
place I want to look at is where the

2226
01:47:54,239 --> 01:47:56,520
data comes in because the clients can

2227
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:58,980
send it 100 bytes of data the receive

2228
01:47:58,980 --> 01:48:00,239
function is going to receive that data

2229
01:48:00,239 --> 01:48:02,159
and then it's gonna get parsed so the

2230
01:48:02,159 --> 01:48:03,780
beginning of what's interesting or

2231
01:48:03,780 --> 01:48:05,639
what's attackable is going to be what

2232
01:48:05,639 --> 01:48:08,580
the receive function does

2233
01:48:08,580 --> 01:48:11,639
so you'll see I put a break I run the

2234
01:48:11,639 --> 01:48:14,699
uni RPC one shot in GDB I put a

2235
01:48:14,699 --> 01:48:15,960
breakpoint on the receive function then

2236
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:19,020
I run it and then using some like

2237
01:48:19,020 --> 01:48:20,520
Netcare or whatever I just send

2238
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:23,100
something it doesn't matter what and if

2239
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:25,020
things work correctly it should hit the

2240
01:48:25,020 --> 01:48:27,420
breakpoint it should say I break while

2241
01:48:27,420 --> 01:48:29,159
receiving data

2242
01:48:29,159 --> 01:48:31,560
from file descriptor 8 which doesn't

2243
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:35,520
really matter a buffer that is at this

2244
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:37,320
address again doesn't really matter we

2245
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:40,260
see it receives 8216 bytes or less

2246
01:48:40,260 --> 01:48:41,760
that's an interesting number because

2247
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:43,860
it's close to a power of two eight

2248
01:48:43,860 --> 01:48:45,600
thousand one hundred and ninety two is a

2249
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:47,940
power of two so it's a power of two plus

2250
01:48:47,940 --> 01:48:51,239
a little bit plus 20 or so which sort of

2251
01:48:51,239 --> 01:48:53,820
means something not terribly important

2252
01:48:53,820 --> 01:48:56,340
what is important is the stack Trace so

2253
01:48:56,340 --> 01:48:58,139
I run the BT command which is backtrace

2254
01:48:58,139 --> 01:49:00,719
and that asks the debugger to tell me

2255
01:49:00,719 --> 01:49:02,340
how do we get here what function called

2256
01:49:02,340 --> 01:49:03,840
what function what called what function

2257
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:06,119
to get us here and what we see is the

2258
01:49:06,119 --> 01:49:08,760
main function calls accept connection I

2259
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:10,440
should say because we have like named

2260
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:12,960
functions not memory addresses we have

2261
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:14,580
symbols and that makes it much much

2262
01:49:14,580 --> 01:49:16,380
easier to reverse than if we had to

2263
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:18,119
figure out what each function does

2264
01:49:18,119 --> 01:49:19,980
but we have accept connection which

2265
01:49:19,980 --> 01:49:21,960
calls read packet which calls read

2266
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:24,540
message which calls read n

2267
01:49:24,540 --> 01:49:29,280
read and reads n bytes it's it's called

2268
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:30,540
with a function parameter of like a

2269
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:32,040
thousand and then reads a thousand bytes

2270
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:34,500
that's all read n does

2271
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:37,440
and then read message is what's going to

2272
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:39,000
parse the header so I mentioned there's

2273
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,040
a 20 by packet header

2274
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:42,540
um these are just a couple examples of

2275
01:49:42,540 --> 01:49:44,400
code from it what what they're actually

2276
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:47,219
doing isn't super important but when it

2277
01:49:47,219 --> 01:49:48,360
reaches the header it reads those 20

2278
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:50,360
bytes and then it does checks like

2279
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:54,780
compare the first two bytes to to 6C if

2280
01:49:54,780 --> 01:49:57,860
they're 6C proceed if they're not 6C

2281
01:49:57,860 --> 01:50:01,020
return the error version this match

2282
01:50:01,020 --> 01:50:03,719
so basically the first six by the first

2283
01:50:03,719 --> 01:50:06,300
one byte has to be 60 then the second

2284
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:08,460
byte has to be zero one to zero two then

2285
01:50:08,460 --> 01:50:09,840
the third and fourth byte or ignored

2286
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:11,520
then the fifth and so on so I'm gonna

2287
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:12,659
look for all these things and what's

2288
01:50:12,659 --> 01:50:14,340
happening

2289
01:50:14,340 --> 01:50:15,960
one of the fields that's interesting and

2290
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:16,739
this is we're gonna get into a

2291
01:50:16,739 --> 01:50:19,739
vulnerability is the length field

2292
01:50:19,739 --> 01:50:21,659
so one of the one there's a 32-bit

2293
01:50:21,659 --> 01:50:24,000
length field in the packet header and it

2294
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,199
says the length of the body of this

2295
01:50:25,199 --> 01:50:27,300
packet is going to be 20 bytes or 100

2296
01:50:27,300 --> 01:50:29,460
bytes or a thousand bytes and it's going

2297
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:31,560
to do some checks on it first of all

2298
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:34,980
this one where it can

2299
01:50:34,980 --> 01:50:37,560
hard to read my own stuff here it checks

2300
01:50:37,560 --> 01:50:39,000
the length

2301
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,520
of the field yeah

2302
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:43,679
I circled in red I should see it so it

2303
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:46,199
tests EDI and EDI Ed has like a variable

2304
01:50:46,199 --> 01:50:48,600
it happens to be the length so it's

2305
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:51,420
going to say test the length jump if

2306
01:50:51,420 --> 01:50:54,119
it's less or equal to zero so make sure

2307
01:50:54,119 --> 01:50:55,860
the length isn't zero and make sure

2308
01:50:55,860 --> 01:50:57,480
length isn't negative

2309
01:50:57,480 --> 01:50:59,820
that's good because you don't want to if

2310
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:01,500
if the client said like hey I'm sending

2311
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:03,119
you negative 10 bytes the server is like

2312
01:51:03,119 --> 01:51:05,159
it doesn't make sense

2313
01:51:05,159 --> 01:51:06,540
so it's going to make sure it's not

2314
01:51:06,540 --> 01:51:08,040
negative

2315
01:51:08,040 --> 01:51:11,340
then it adds 17 to the value and then it

2316
01:51:11,340 --> 01:51:13,500
does a second comparison it compares the

2317
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:18,420
the length after adding 17 hex to the

2318
01:51:18,420 --> 01:51:20,340
size of the buffer which is 2018 by

2319
01:51:20,340 --> 01:51:23,040
default but that can change

2320
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:25,440
so something you learn to look for when

2321
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:27,480
you're looking for vulnerabilities is

2322
01:51:27,480 --> 01:51:29,159
doing a check to see if something's

2323
01:51:29,159 --> 01:51:31,739
above zero adding something to it then

2324
01:51:31,739 --> 01:51:33,179
doing a different check

2325
01:51:33,179 --> 01:51:35,400
because integer overflows are a thing

2326
01:51:35,400 --> 01:51:38,159
and if your size happens to be very very

2327
01:51:38,159 --> 01:51:40,860
high like 7f ffff

2328
01:51:40,860 --> 01:51:42,960
and you add 17 to it the size is now

2329
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:45,840
negative so the size was positive you

2330
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:49,739
add 17 and now is it less than 2018 if

2331
01:51:49,739 --> 01:51:51,840
if it's now negative yeah it's less than

2332
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:53,460
2018 by a lot

2333
01:51:53,460 --> 01:51:55,320
and that's what we can do

2334
01:51:55,320 --> 01:51:58,500
so if we send the size of 7fffff and

2335
01:51:58,500 --> 01:52:01,380
then print it we see 2.14 billion I

2336
01:52:01,380 --> 01:52:04,800
think which is the highest integer then

2337
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:07,619
down at the bottom it adds 17 to it we

2338
01:52:07,619 --> 01:52:10,440
then print Rax and now it's negative 2.1

2339
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:11,639
million

2340
01:52:11,639 --> 01:52:13,800
which means that it's wrapped around and

2341
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:15,420
now it's negative

2342
01:52:15,420 --> 01:52:17,639
so if we send if we send a body length

2343
01:52:17,639 --> 01:52:19,280
of 7ff

2344
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:21,239
when it goes back to the receive

2345
01:52:21,239 --> 01:52:22,980
function it's going to try to receive

2346
01:52:22,980 --> 01:52:25,860
2.1 billion bytes into a buffer that's 2

2347
01:52:25,860 --> 01:52:27,300
000 bytes

2348
01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:29,159
2 billions higher than two thousand so

2349
01:52:29,159 --> 01:52:30,420
that overflows

2350
01:52:30,420 --> 01:52:32,639
and it overwrites memory and causes a

2351
01:52:32,639 --> 01:52:34,500
heat corruption

2352
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:36,980
so we call this vulnerability CV 2023

2353
01:52:36,980 --> 01:52:40,020
28501 it's a likely exploitable Heap

2354
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:41,820
overflow that I didn't bring the exploit

2355
01:52:41,820 --> 01:52:43,800
for because it seems really hard

2356
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:46,980
and there were easier ones

2357
01:52:46,980 --> 01:52:49,320
so that's one vulnerability this slide I

2358
01:52:49,320 --> 01:52:50,940
debated keeping or not because it's not

2359
01:52:50,940 --> 01:52:52,199
really an interesting vulnerability but

2360
01:52:52,199 --> 01:52:55,020
it's a silly mistake that they made

2361
01:52:55,020 --> 01:52:56,699
so one one of the bytes in the packet

2362
01:52:56,699 --> 01:52:58,619
header is um

2363
01:52:58,619 --> 01:53:00,900
compression if it's set to one the

2364
01:53:00,900 --> 01:53:02,520
packet's compressed if it's at the zero

2365
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:03,900
it's not compressed

2366
01:53:03,900 --> 01:53:06,480
the compression function they have is

2367
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:08,400
called LZ for something something

2368
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:09,600
something

2369
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:11,760
uh

2370
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:15,060
lz4 decompress safe

2371
01:53:15,060 --> 01:53:17,460
so I try to I try to make test data for

2372
01:53:17,460 --> 01:53:19,260
this I tried the lz4 compress that in

2373
01:53:19,260 --> 01:53:20,340
different ways and I never did figure

2374
01:53:20,340 --> 01:53:21,540
out how to make data that actually

2375
01:53:21,540 --> 01:53:24,000
worked which is sort of funny I wrote a

2376
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,080
Blog that's linked to the bottom I'll

2377
01:53:25,080 --> 01:53:26,699
send you these slides afterwards if you

2378
01:53:26,699 --> 01:53:29,340
want to check these links out but I made

2379
01:53:29,340 --> 01:53:30,719
the program generates only compressed

2380
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:32,100
data and then I was able to test this

2381
01:53:32,100 --> 01:53:33,179
and all that

2382
01:53:33,179 --> 01:53:35,159
what's interesting is if you send

2383
01:53:35,159 --> 01:53:36,840
invalid data

2384
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:39,360
if the LG fart can press safe

2385
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:42,420
returns a failure there's only one thing

2386
01:53:42,420 --> 01:53:44,639
and it's either success or failed it's

2387
01:53:44,639 --> 01:53:46,860
not why it failed which means it had

2388
01:53:46,860 --> 01:53:49,199
failed the program assumes that the

2389
01:53:49,199 --> 01:53:50,940
compressed data was too long and it

2390
01:53:50,940 --> 01:53:53,100
allocates more memory and tries again if

2391
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:54,480
it fails again it allocates more memory

2392
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:56,820
and tries again and it'll keep on it'll

2393
01:53:56,820 --> 01:53:58,260
keep on reallocating more and more

2394
01:53:58,260 --> 01:54:00,480
memory until it tries to allocate like

2395
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:05,159
18 billion billion bytes and then fail

2396
01:54:05,159 --> 01:54:06,719
so that's just a really silly Detail

2397
01:54:06,719 --> 01:54:09,420
Service just from forgetting to check

2398
01:54:09,420 --> 01:54:10,739
buffer sizes

2399
01:54:10,739 --> 01:54:13,500
it's not not exploitable but just kind

2400
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:16,380
of a weird vulnerability

2401
01:54:16,380 --> 01:54:18,540
there's also an encryption field so we

2402
01:54:18,540 --> 01:54:20,040
looked at the length field we looked at

2403
01:54:20,040 --> 01:54:22,679
the um the compression field there's

2404
01:54:22,679 --> 01:54:24,360
also an encryption field

2405
01:54:24,360 --> 01:54:26,159
telling the server that if this field is

2406
01:54:26,159 --> 01:54:30,619
set to non-zero the packets encrypted

2407
01:54:30,900 --> 01:54:33,600
and by encrypted I mean export by one

2408
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:35,460
so

2409
01:54:35,460 --> 01:54:37,560
basically if the encryption's on the

2410
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:39,060
encryption key is either two or one

2411
01:54:39,060 --> 01:54:41,940
depending on the version and then the

2412
01:54:41,940 --> 01:54:44,280
each byte is xored with that key and

2413
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:46,739
that's encrypting

2414
01:54:46,739 --> 01:54:48,840
as as far as I can tell the real clients

2415
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:50,940
and servers never use this but like my

2416
01:54:50,940 --> 01:54:52,080
mass flight multi I wrote for this

2417
01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:54,179
eventually does because I mean why not

2418
01:54:54,179 --> 01:54:57,900
keep the payloads off the clear text

2419
01:54:57,900 --> 01:55:00,719
so once the message is read uh we talked

2420
01:55:00,719 --> 01:55:01,860
about the header there's all these

2421
01:55:01,860 --> 01:55:03,480
different header fields and I have a

2422
01:55:03,480 --> 01:55:04,920
list of them that I should put earlier

2423
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:06,179
but

2424
01:55:06,179 --> 01:55:07,800
after the header is finished it then

2425
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:09,900
reads the body the body of the message

2426
01:55:09,900 --> 01:55:12,239
is much much more complex than the

2427
01:55:12,239 --> 01:55:15,480
header so I'm so rather than like going

2428
01:55:15,480 --> 01:55:17,400
through the assembly and all these

2429
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:18,780
different notes I made and all this junk

2430
01:55:18,780 --> 01:55:20,639
we're just going to look at the packet

2431
01:55:20,639 --> 01:55:22,380
captures and figure things out from the

2432
01:55:22,380 --> 01:55:24,480
packets

2433
01:55:24,480 --> 01:55:25,739
um

2434
01:55:25,739 --> 01:55:26,940
so this is where I'm going to actually

2435
01:55:26,940 --> 01:55:30,320
look at the traffic on The Wire

2436
01:55:32,820 --> 01:55:34,679
the um

2437
01:55:34,679 --> 01:55:36,420
at the top you'll see the package we've

2438
01:55:36,420 --> 01:55:38,520
seen before where you say please connect

2439
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:41,159
with the ud server and at the bottom you

2440
01:55:41,159 --> 01:55:42,840
see the version ever come back it's

2441
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:44,340
basically a success

2442
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:47,760
what you're seeing is a header metadata

2443
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:50,580
and then freeform body

2444
01:55:50,580 --> 01:55:52,980
we'll see what he shows mean

2445
01:55:52,980 --> 01:55:54,540
so this is a header we looked at this a

2446
01:55:54,540 --> 01:55:56,219
couple times we talked about the version

2447
01:55:56,219 --> 01:55:58,980
but it has to be 6C the body length has

2448
01:55:58,980 --> 01:56:02,460
to be non-zero or above zero

2449
01:56:02,460 --> 01:56:03,960
um lz4 is a compression field

2450
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:06,300
encryption's encryption field there are

2451
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:07,800
several padding fields that can be

2452
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:10,139
anything I set them to like ABCD and my

2453
01:56:10,139 --> 01:56:12,000
implementations

2454
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,980
um there's a number of arguments and

2455
01:56:13,980 --> 01:56:16,020
then there's a length of the data data

2456
01:56:16,020 --> 01:56:17,760
length is not really used I think that's

2457
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:20,880
a um it's parched and processed but it's

2458
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:22,199
not used by anything so I think it's

2459
01:56:22,199 --> 01:56:23,760
Legacy

2460
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:25,380
but our account is what's interesting

2461
01:56:25,380 --> 01:56:26,460
because it's how many arguments are

2462
01:56:26,460 --> 01:56:28,619
being sent

2463
01:56:28,619 --> 01:56:30,780
so here's some examples on Google tease

2464
01:56:30,780 --> 01:56:32,460
pretty quickly but this is where you can

2465
01:56:32,460 --> 01:56:34,739
match up the packets you see a Wireshark

2466
01:56:34,739 --> 01:56:37,020
to the packets to the uh structure I

2467
01:56:37,020 --> 01:56:38,100
gave

2468
01:56:38,100 --> 01:56:39,300
if you actually want to implement this

2469
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:40,320
protocol or something you can probably

2470
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:42,000
go back and use these slides but I'm

2471
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,100
going to skip through them pretty quick

2472
01:56:44,100 --> 01:56:47,280
so after the header there's argument

2473
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:48,600
definitions

2474
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:52,139
so you'll have zero or more fields

2475
01:56:52,139 --> 01:56:54,420
that's Base number of arguments so this

2476
01:56:54,420 --> 01:56:56,400
packet has two arguments the first

2477
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:59,460
argument is type two which is a string

2478
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:01,560
and the second argument is type zero

2479
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:03,600
which is an integer

2480
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:06,300
so a string and integer are the metadata

2481
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:08,820
and then the actual data section you'll

2482
01:57:08,820 --> 01:57:12,179
see the string is UD server the yyy is

2483
01:57:12,179 --> 01:57:15,179
just padding and then the integer is 539

2484
01:57:15,179 --> 01:57:17,040
which is hex for one three three seven

2485
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:19,800
that's the secure flag and sometimes

2486
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:21,960
it's required to be set but you can set

2487
01:57:21,960 --> 01:57:23,760
yourself so it doesn't actually secure

2488
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:25,880
anything

2489
01:57:26,099 --> 01:57:28,080
so this just shows what I did what I

2490
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:30,360
just showed in a graphical way

2491
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:32,520
the actual data section of packet is

2492
01:57:32,520 --> 01:57:34,800
just a data so we saw in this we have a

2493
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:37,080
type 2 which is a string the string is

2494
01:57:37,080 --> 01:57:39,659
UD server then I just talked about this

2495
01:57:39,659 --> 01:57:41,400
and when the server responds it does the

2496
01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:43,139
same thing the server says I have two

2497
01:57:43,139 --> 01:57:44,760
arguments the first one's a string

2498
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:47,099
second one's integer the string is

2499
01:57:47,099 --> 01:57:50,040
udserv 8.2.4 the integer zero the zero

2500
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:51,179
is just success

2501
01:57:51,179 --> 01:57:52,920
if the server doesn't exist it'll be

2502
01:57:52,920 --> 01:57:55,500
something that's not zero

2503
01:57:55,500 --> 01:57:58,320
and that's just showing the same stuff

2504
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:00,360
so the tldr this is what the messages

2505
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:02,839
look like

2506
01:58:03,599 --> 01:58:05,099
yeah I don't want to out too much but I

2507
01:58:05,099 --> 01:58:06,420
did do it I did do open source

2508
01:58:06,420 --> 01:58:08,639
invitation of this whole thing this is

2509
01:58:08,639 --> 01:58:10,800
from something I called lib Neptune

2510
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:13,199
and lib Neptune is a implementation of

2511
01:58:13,199 --> 01:58:15,719
the library that's in Ruby and it's

2512
01:58:15,719 --> 01:58:17,760
integrated metaphor as well so if you

2513
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:18,659
ever want to write something from

2514
01:58:18,659 --> 01:58:21,139
Metasploit involving uh

2515
01:58:21,139 --> 01:58:25,139
uni data you can my name I'm named lib

2516
01:58:25,139 --> 01:58:26,699
Neptune after the net psk broker and

2517
01:58:26,699 --> 01:58:29,580
subnautica anyone play subnautica

2518
01:58:29,580 --> 01:58:33,440
because rocket Neptune yeah

2519
01:58:34,020 --> 01:58:36,260
so I'm going to show you three messages

2520
01:58:36,260 --> 01:58:38,820
that do a thing that's interesting which

2521
01:58:38,820 --> 01:58:40,800
is run an OS command then I'm going to

2522
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:42,360
show you two ways to bypass all the

2523
01:58:42,360 --> 01:58:44,219
checks that we're going to see and then

2524
01:58:44,219 --> 01:58:46,679
we're going to call it done

2525
01:58:46,679 --> 01:58:49,860
so here is a conversation

2526
01:58:49,860 --> 01:58:51,900
the first one is please use a service

2527
01:58:51,900 --> 01:58:54,179
we're going to use the service UD admin

2528
01:58:54,179 --> 01:58:56,219
I think I've decided why we chose UD

2529
01:58:56,219 --> 01:58:58,320
admin but I don't know where it went so

2530
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:00,420
we'll see when it turns up

2531
01:59:00,420 --> 01:59:03,480
basically this says please use UD admin

2532
01:59:03,480 --> 01:59:07,080
my secure flag is 1337 which means I'm

2533
01:59:07,080 --> 01:59:10,199
a thousand three hundred times secure

2534
01:59:10,199 --> 01:59:11,699
then

2535
01:59:11,699 --> 01:59:13,739
when you do that it's going to run the

2536
01:59:13,739 --> 01:59:15,960
ud server process and the ud server

2537
01:59:15,960 --> 01:59:18,300
process wants you to authenticate it

2538
01:59:18,300 --> 01:59:20,340
says before you can do anything please

2539
01:59:20,340 --> 01:59:23,159
send me the packet code F which is 15

2540
01:59:23,159 --> 01:59:26,460
which says authenticate and the username

2541
01:59:26,460 --> 01:59:28,920
string and the password string the

2542
01:59:28,920 --> 01:59:30,360
username string you'll see is plain text

2543
01:59:30,360 --> 01:59:33,840
it's r-o-n and then why why because I

2544
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:35,219
just pad with wise till I can see what's

2545
01:59:35,219 --> 01:59:36,239
going on

2546
01:59:36,239 --> 01:59:38,820
and then the integer is going to be yeah

2547
01:59:38,820 --> 01:59:40,800
the introduce 15 the string username is

2548
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:45,000
Ron the string password is 96 998 it's

2549
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,699
it's encrypted quotation marks

2550
01:59:47,699 --> 01:59:49,139
so I send the username I send that

2551
01:59:49,139 --> 01:59:50,940
password and this simply responds with

2552
01:59:50,940 --> 01:59:53,820
this with one integer value zero one

2553
01:59:53,820 --> 01:59:55,440
integer value zero says authentication

2554
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:57,480
is successful if you failed it would be

2555
01:59:57,480 --> 02:00:00,000
a non-zero integer

2556
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,119
then you can run a command so opcode 6

2557
02:00:03,119 --> 02:00:05,699
means OS command once you've

2558
02:00:05,699 --> 02:00:07,440
authenticated and you have to take it as

2559
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:09,960
a Linux user on the machine so you're

2560
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:12,179
basically as good as sshing you could

2561
02:00:12,179 --> 02:00:13,679
tell it to run a command there's like

2562
02:00:13,679 --> 02:00:16,440
150 op codes I've only tested the one

2563
02:00:16,440 --> 02:00:18,060
because once I run that command I don't

2564
02:00:18,060 --> 02:00:19,260
need the rest

2565
02:00:19,260 --> 02:00:21,360
so basically it's in the op code six and

2566
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:22,920
then you send it a string with what to

2567
02:00:22,920 --> 02:00:25,320
run in this example I just do who am I

2568
02:00:25,320 --> 02:00:28,199
and then the response it returns wrong

2569
02:00:28,199 --> 02:00:30,420
it returns negative two for the command

2570
02:00:30,420 --> 02:00:31,679
result which I'm not sure why it's

2571
02:00:31,679 --> 02:00:33,719
negative two but it is and then the

2572
02:00:33,719 --> 02:00:35,580
string run

2573
02:00:35,580 --> 02:00:38,099
so we so with username password we can

2574
02:00:38,099 --> 02:00:40,860
run code is what I'm saying

2575
02:00:40,860 --> 02:00:42,659
this is why I chose a service I knew I

2576
02:00:42,659 --> 02:00:44,639
put the site somewhere so why you these

2577
02:00:44,639 --> 02:00:47,760
why UD admin server it's because I ran

2578
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:49,679
strings and saw OS command and once

2579
02:00:49,679 --> 02:00:51,659
that's the OS command I'm just going to

2580
02:00:51,659 --> 02:00:52,800
use that one because

2581
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:54,659
it sounds like fun it's also the biggest

2582
02:00:54,659 --> 02:00:56,699
it's by far bigger than the other

2583
02:00:56,699 --> 02:00:59,040
processes it's 300 kilobytes the rest

2584
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:02,099
are like 20 to 60. so it's maybe the

2585
02:01:02,099 --> 02:01:03,960
most interesting the most code and has

2586
02:01:03,960 --> 02:01:07,699
OS command who can resist

2587
02:01:08,040 --> 02:01:10,440
so once you connect as I said you need

2588
02:01:10,440 --> 02:01:12,599
this authentication you either send the

2589
02:01:12,599 --> 02:01:14,040
code 15

2590
02:01:14,040 --> 02:01:17,460
or you send the code I think six no

2591
02:01:17,460 --> 02:01:19,920
eight if you send eight it returns

2592
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:21,239
coming soon and then closes the

2593
02:01:21,239 --> 02:01:24,480
connection it never came soon

2594
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:27,900
but if you give it 15 it's like A2

2595
02:01:27,900 --> 02:01:30,060
um it'll look at your username as a

2596
02:01:30,060 --> 02:01:32,340
string and then stir copy it into a

2597
02:01:32,340 --> 02:01:33,599
buffer

2598
02:01:33,599 --> 02:01:35,639
oh

2599
02:01:35,639 --> 02:01:37,920
um if you send I'll name of 200 letter

2600
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:40,320
A's you can overflight over that

2601
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:42,000
overflow your address and set your hair

2602
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:43,560
address to all A's

2603
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:47,580
this is we called CV 2023 28 502

2604
02:01:47,580 --> 02:01:50,460
but now I'm lazy and stir copy doesn't

2605
02:01:50,460 --> 02:01:52,320
like null bytes and I do like null bytes

2606
02:01:52,320 --> 02:01:53,219
because I want to return to memory

2607
02:01:53,219 --> 02:01:54,060
address

2608
02:01:54,060 --> 02:01:57,599
so I want to write easy exploits

2609
02:01:57,599 --> 02:01:59,400
let's look at the password

2610
02:01:59,400 --> 02:02:01,199
the password is also store copied into a

2611
02:02:01,199 --> 02:02:03,540
buffer after a store copies it and

2612
02:02:03,540 --> 02:02:05,580
terminates it null it then calls a

2613
02:02:05,580 --> 02:02:07,920
function called RPC encrypt you would

2614
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:09,480
think the RPC encrypt would encrypt the

2615
02:02:09,480 --> 02:02:11,280
packet

2616
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:14,400
and it well it extracts it by or negates

2617
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:16,980
each byte it's like encryption

2618
02:02:16,980 --> 02:02:18,840
it basically goes through each byte in

2619
02:02:18,840 --> 02:02:22,139
the password and that's it

2620
02:02:22,139 --> 02:02:26,040
so 0 0 becomes ff01 becomes Fe and so on

2621
02:02:26,040 --> 02:02:27,780
and so and so on

2622
02:02:27,780 --> 02:02:29,880
that's not really encryption

2623
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:31,920
what it does mean is I can now use null

2624
02:02:31,920 --> 02:02:33,540
bytes in an exploit

2625
02:02:33,540 --> 02:02:35,580
so basically we send

2626
02:02:35,580 --> 02:02:37,500
I can't remember how many every charges

2627
02:02:37,500 --> 02:02:40,500
offset is but we send like 150 letter

2628
02:02:40,500 --> 02:02:43,800
A's then a return address there's

2629
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:45,000
actually a return address in the

2630
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:46,679
software that will run whatever's on the

2631
02:02:46,679 --> 02:02:48,599
stack which if your exploit Dev is

2632
02:02:48,599 --> 02:02:51,659
really nice all it does is just

2633
02:02:51,659 --> 02:02:54,360
pass whatever is in the rrsp into the

2634
02:02:54,360 --> 02:02:57,060
system call and then run

2635
02:02:57,060 --> 02:02:59,280
so we can run like a reverse shell like

2636
02:02:59,280 --> 02:03:01,260
netcat we can do whatever

2637
02:03:01,260 --> 02:03:05,159
so that this is the actual form of CV

2638
02:03:05,159 --> 02:03:08,880
2023 28502 which is

2639
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:10,500
basically a stack Overflow which lets us

2640
02:03:10,500 --> 02:03:12,480
execute arbitrary code and we wrote this

2641
02:03:12,480 --> 02:03:14,219
exploit and we released his exploit and

2642
02:03:14,219 --> 02:03:15,239
it's out there

2643
02:03:15,239 --> 02:03:16,440
but

2644
02:03:16,440 --> 02:03:18,300
it's still hard you have to overreach

2645
02:03:18,300 --> 02:03:20,880
her addresses and do a bunch of work

2646
02:03:20,880 --> 02:03:23,400
so let's say we don't overflow the

2647
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:25,560
fields which takes all the willpower I

2648
02:03:25,560 --> 02:03:27,060
have to not overfill them

2649
02:03:27,060 --> 02:03:28,860
but if we don't overflow them we get

2650
02:03:28,860 --> 02:03:30,719
into a call called impersonate user

2651
02:03:30,719 --> 02:03:32,580
impersonate user takes username and

2652
02:03:32,580 --> 02:03:35,880
password as parameters

2653
02:03:35,880 --> 02:03:36,719
um

2654
02:03:36,719 --> 02:03:39,420
so if we look at the code for it this is

2655
02:03:39,420 --> 02:03:40,860
in the library now it's not in the main

2656
02:03:40,860 --> 02:03:43,860
XC level it the impersonate user just

2657
02:03:43,860 --> 02:03:46,139
calls do logon user basically and

2658
02:03:46,139 --> 02:03:48,179
nothing else

2659
02:03:48,179 --> 02:03:50,760
do log on users interesting because it

2660
02:03:50,760 --> 02:03:52,380
checks if the username is colon local

2661
02:03:52,380 --> 02:03:53,520
colon

2662
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:55,500
it looks for a very specific username

2663
02:03:55,500 --> 02:03:58,560
and if it matches that username then it

2664
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:01,440
calls dirtier to find a colon then it

2665
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:02,639
calls torture again to find a second

2666
02:04:02,639 --> 02:04:04,619
colon in the password

2667
02:04:04,619 --> 02:04:05,820
so you have a username called local

2668
02:04:05,820 --> 02:04:08,280
colon and a password of like a colon B

2669
02:04:08,280 --> 02:04:11,460
colon c something special happens

2670
02:04:11,460 --> 02:04:12,840
something special means I get code

2671
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:14,820
execution

2672
02:04:14,820 --> 02:04:17,699
so basically after it parses it into a

2673
02:04:17,699 --> 02:04:20,880
colon B Colon c it passes B the second

2674
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:23,639
field into stir to L which converts to

2675
02:04:23,639 --> 02:04:25,560
an integer so the number one three three

2676
02:04:25,560 --> 02:04:26,940
seven becomes the integer one three

2677
02:04:26,940 --> 02:04:27,960
three seven

2678
02:04:27,960 --> 02:04:30,599
it also passes the third field into star

2679
02:04:30,599 --> 02:04:31,739
2L

2680
02:04:31,739 --> 02:04:34,260
and then it does a couple checks

2681
02:04:34,260 --> 02:04:37,500
it passes the first field into get pwm

2682
02:04:37,500 --> 02:04:40,560
get PW Nam gets looks up a username on

2683
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:42,599
the local Linux system so if I pass it

2684
02:04:42,599 --> 02:04:45,480
wrong it Returns the data for Ron if it

2685
02:04:45,480 --> 02:04:46,920
passes in root it Returns the data for

2686
02:04:46,920 --> 02:04:47,880
root

2687
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:49,800
so if the first field of the password is

2688
02:04:49,800 --> 02:04:53,400
run this will succeed get pwm

2689
02:04:53,400 --> 02:04:55,500
the second thing it does is compares the

2690
02:04:55,500 --> 02:04:57,420
second field to the user ID of that user

2691
02:04:57,420 --> 02:05:00,659
so if the username is run it checks if

2692
02:05:00,659 --> 02:05:03,840
the the Middle Field was a thousand if

2693
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:05,340
the username was root it checks the

2694
02:05:05,340 --> 02:05:08,040
Middle Field of zero and if that matches

2695
02:05:08,040 --> 02:05:10,500
it keeps going the Third Field it only

2696
02:05:10,500 --> 02:05:12,480
checks if it's non-zero if it's zero it

2697
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:15,119
fails if it's one two three it works so

2698
02:05:15,119 --> 02:05:16,440
basically with the username colon local

2699
02:05:16,440 --> 02:05:18,840
colon the password wrong colon a

2700
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:20,760
thousand call a thousand will succeed if

2701
02:05:20,760 --> 02:05:23,159
the wrong account exists it has your ID

2702
02:05:23,159 --> 02:05:25,560
a thousand uh root column zero colon one

2703
02:05:25,560 --> 02:05:27,780
two three will always work because Roots

2704
02:05:27,780 --> 02:05:29,219
is basically always there and always uid

2705
02:05:29,219 --> 02:05:31,020
zero

2706
02:05:31,020 --> 02:05:32,460
so here's a session

2707
02:05:32,460 --> 02:05:34,760
uh we we connect to the ud admin service

2708
02:05:34,760 --> 02:05:37,139
we say please connect your username

2709
02:05:37,139 --> 02:05:40,440
local password is encrypted but it's

2710
02:05:40,440 --> 02:05:43,080
root column zero column one two three

2711
02:05:43,080 --> 02:05:45,239
and then you say please run the command

2712
02:05:45,239 --> 02:05:49,380
ID Dash a and it returns a uid 0 root

2713
02:05:49,380 --> 02:05:51,060
the nice thing about this too is your

2714
02:05:51,060 --> 02:05:53,040
root it doesn't draw privileges so

2715
02:05:53,040 --> 02:05:56,340
basically this is remote code as root

2716
02:05:56,340 --> 02:05:58,080
so here's some of the exploit code I

2717
02:05:58,080 --> 02:05:59,940
wrote this is the proof of concept

2718
02:05:59,940 --> 02:06:02,219
that's in the lib Neptune repo

2719
02:06:02,219 --> 02:06:04,320
um yeah you just pass the username local

2720
02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:06,540
and the password root column zero call

2721
02:06:06,540 --> 02:06:08,280
one two three there's also mansplate

2722
02:06:08,280 --> 02:06:10,820
modules for this

2723
02:06:11,340 --> 02:06:12,599
so just kind of wrapping up and

2724
02:06:12,599 --> 02:06:14,820
summarizing the work we did we ended up

2725
02:06:14,820 --> 02:06:18,840
with nine cves four different things two

2726
02:06:18,840 --> 02:06:20,940
of them we wrote full exploits for the

2727
02:06:20,940 --> 02:06:23,400
other seven we either crashed them or

2728
02:06:23,400 --> 02:06:25,080
demonstrate them or whatever some stuff

2729
02:06:25,080 --> 02:06:27,900
like memory exhaustion is like the OS

2730
02:06:27,900 --> 02:06:30,239
the weak encryption was kind of vague

2731
02:06:30,239 --> 02:06:32,400
but like I thought it was a pretty good

2732
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:34,679
outcome all in all

2733
02:06:34,679 --> 02:06:36,780
these are just screenshots of Metasploit

2734
02:06:36,780 --> 02:06:38,159
um that's why has modules for the two

2735
02:06:38,159 --> 02:06:40,139
vulnerabilities I mentioned

2736
02:06:40,139 --> 02:06:41,460
um

2737
02:06:41,460 --> 02:06:44,159
yeah and that is pretty much the end

2738
02:06:44,159 --> 02:06:46,560
I think yeah one minute left perfect I

2739
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:48,000
think we need a question session in 10

2740
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,980
minutes and other than that

2741
02:06:49,980 --> 02:06:51,599
um that's a link to the slides feel free

2742
02:06:51,599 --> 02:06:53,940
to use it feel free to reach out to me

2743
02:06:53,940 --> 02:06:56,280
on Twitter Macedon GitHub whatever and

2744
02:06:56,280 --> 02:06:58,130
thank you for coming

2745
02:06:58,130 --> 02:07:01,249
[Applause]

2746
02:18:05,700 --> 02:18:08,719
hello everyone

2747
02:18:09,780 --> 02:18:11,700
hello everyone welcome to the

2748
02:18:11,700 --> 02:18:14,280
vulnerability research panel uh we still

2749
02:18:14,280 --> 02:18:17,519
have uh dirkian and Ron with us here

2750
02:18:17,519 --> 02:18:20,760
um so I'm gonna start things off with a

2751
02:18:20,760 --> 02:18:22,379
very important question

2752
02:18:22,379 --> 02:18:24,299
um will your birds ever have a

2753
02:18:24,299 --> 02:18:26,939
vulnerability logo

2754
02:18:26,939 --> 02:18:27,660
um

2755
02:18:27,660 --> 02:18:29,638
they don't have a hallway logo but I can

2756
02:18:29,638 --> 02:18:31,859
imagine discovering a vulnerability it

2757
02:18:31,859 --> 02:18:33,299
was actually I was playing a computer

2758
02:18:33,299 --> 02:18:35,580
game a few weeks ago called valheim and

2759
02:18:35,580 --> 02:18:36,840
it turns out there's a hidden shortcut

2760
02:18:36,840 --> 02:18:39,718
Ctrl F3 to hide the UI and I was holding

2761
02:18:39,718 --> 02:18:41,459
control and my bird jumped and landed on

2762
02:18:41,459 --> 02:18:43,138
the F3 key and I couldn't figure out

2763
02:18:43,138 --> 02:18:45,000
where the UI went I had to like Google

2764
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:48,840
it so they're definitely little fuzzers

2765
02:18:48,840 --> 02:18:50,398
all right

2766
02:18:50,398 --> 02:18:52,978
um let's go with a more serious question

2767
02:18:52,978 --> 02:18:55,320
um let's go with uh

2768
02:18:55,320 --> 02:18:58,439
um how do you choose a Target or a

2769
02:18:58,439 --> 02:19:00,299
system that you're interested in would

2770
02:19:00,299 --> 02:19:03,138
like to research

2771
02:19:03,179 --> 02:19:05,879
oh it's a good question usually I just

2772
02:19:05,879 --> 02:19:08,218
so I got a lot of my ideas from actually

2773
02:19:08,218 --> 02:19:10,799
doing real world assessments look at a

2774
02:19:10,799 --> 02:19:12,540
client environment they'll explain to me

2775
02:19:12,540 --> 02:19:13,859
oh we're using this and this and I'm

2776
02:19:13,859 --> 02:19:15,179
like oh I didn't know that was possible

2777
02:19:15,179 --> 02:19:17,040
like how did you configure this and then

2778
02:19:17,040 --> 02:19:20,340
my head starts my the gears start

2779
02:19:20,340 --> 02:19:22,138
turning and like oh so do you do this

2780
02:19:22,138 --> 02:19:23,820
this how it works I start researching

2781
02:19:23,820 --> 02:19:25,620
the protocols involved right instead of

2782
02:19:25,620 --> 02:19:28,260
them myself and just figure out like how

2783
02:19:28,260 --> 02:19:30,420
it works and if there's anything that I

2784
02:19:30,420 --> 02:19:33,718
can do that like defeats the assumptions

2785
02:19:33,718 --> 02:19:36,058
that they made so I I mostly look for

2786
02:19:36,058 --> 02:19:38,120
logic bugs I'm not really into the

2787
02:19:38,120 --> 02:19:41,099
binary exploitation that's different

2788
02:19:41,099 --> 02:19:44,099
different kind of skill set

2789
02:19:44,099 --> 02:19:47,280
um so yeah I usually look at real world

2790
02:19:47,280 --> 02:19:49,380
things that have not been researched yet

2791
02:19:49,380 --> 02:19:51,300
that much but are used by a lot of

2792
02:19:51,300 --> 02:19:53,880
people so that things that are relevant

2793
02:19:53,880 --> 02:19:55,320
so that's also why I focus a lot of

2794
02:19:55,320 --> 02:19:57,240
Microsoft's vulnerabilities because like

2795
02:19:57,240 --> 02:19:59,880
like 90 of the Enterprises in the world

2796
02:19:59,880 --> 02:20:02,340
are using it so it's very big it's

2797
02:20:02,340 --> 02:20:04,740
relevant and that's that's uh usually

2798
02:20:04,740 --> 02:20:06,720
how I progress in my things and I have a

2799
02:20:06,720 --> 02:20:09,120
very long mental to do of all the things

2800
02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:10,859
that I want to look at someday if I have

2801
02:20:10,859 --> 02:20:13,680
time so no shortage of research subjects

2802
02:20:13,680 --> 02:20:15,720
for me yet

2803
02:20:15,720 --> 02:20:18,960
and uh Ron do you uh use other

2804
02:20:18,960 --> 02:20:20,700
meaningful ways of choosing targets

2805
02:20:20,700 --> 02:20:22,979
except personal Vendetta

2806
02:20:22,979 --> 02:20:25,740
personal Vendetta is about half of it

2807
02:20:25,740 --> 02:20:28,859
um yeah at rapid7 we don't have a ton of

2808
02:20:28,859 --> 02:20:30,000
Direction on what we're supposed to

2809
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:31,680
research but our general approach is

2810
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:33,420
things that are meaningful to like our

2811
02:20:33,420 --> 02:20:35,399
customers and to the internet large so

2812
02:20:35,399 --> 02:20:37,320
we're often looking for trends like

2813
02:20:37,320 --> 02:20:39,780
what's what's been popular in the past

2814
02:20:39,780 --> 02:20:42,060
year there was a vulnerability a couple

2815
02:20:42,060 --> 02:20:43,500
months ago in a specific piece of

2816
02:20:43,500 --> 02:20:45,600
software and we take a reactive approach

2817
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:47,160
sometimes we heard about the

2818
02:20:47,160 --> 02:20:49,920
vulnerability we researched it we built

2819
02:20:49,920 --> 02:20:52,080
a POC and we released details and I

2820
02:20:52,080 --> 02:20:53,340
thought this is an interesting class of

2821
02:20:53,340 --> 02:20:54,359
software I don't want to say

2822
02:20:54,359 --> 02:20:56,580
specifically what it is right now but it

2823
02:20:56,580 --> 02:20:58,560
was interesting class of software one of

2824
02:20:58,560 --> 02:21:00,240
those other things that do the same

2825
02:21:00,240 --> 02:21:01,680
thing and it's like it was Network

2826
02:21:01,680 --> 02:21:03,780
perimeters so it was something that is

2827
02:21:03,780 --> 02:21:05,640
pointing the internet and was

2828
02:21:05,640 --> 02:21:08,160
semi-popular as a class of software I

2829
02:21:08,160 --> 02:21:09,540
thought I'm going to dig into this and

2830
02:21:09,540 --> 02:21:11,460
see what other software exists so I

2831
02:21:11,460 --> 02:21:13,260
picked out three I installed them all

2832
02:21:13,260 --> 02:21:15,300
and I found one that was like

2833
02:21:15,300 --> 02:21:17,819
it it felt worse than the other ones so

2834
02:21:17,819 --> 02:21:19,800
I chose it and found some

2835
02:21:19,800 --> 02:21:21,960
vulnerabilities that I reported now

2836
02:21:21,960 --> 02:21:23,640
yeah usually if you do this often enough

2837
02:21:23,640 --> 02:21:25,560
you get like a spidey sense if you look

2838
02:21:25,560 --> 02:21:28,140
at a software and it's like ah this is

2839
02:21:28,140 --> 02:21:29,580
probably gonna end up vulnerable it's

2840
02:21:29,580 --> 02:21:31,800
it's not always Telltale science but

2841
02:21:31,800 --> 02:21:33,359
I've added with a lot of products like

2842
02:21:33,359 --> 02:21:34,800
you look at it five minutes you

2843
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:36,420
decompile a bit of the code and you're

2844
02:21:36,420 --> 02:21:37,920
like oh this is this is going to be fun

2845
02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:40,680
or it's like well this looks quite all

2846
02:21:40,680 --> 02:21:42,899
right maybe I can find something but

2847
02:21:42,899 --> 02:21:44,819
it's not gonna be like golden things so

2848
02:21:44,819 --> 02:21:48,060
put it on the backlog a little bit

2849
02:21:48,060 --> 02:21:49,859
uh we'll take a moment to talk about

2850
02:21:49,859 --> 02:21:51,960
time framing a little bit later but uh

2851
02:21:51,960 --> 02:21:54,420
you mentioned that uh you do have a

2852
02:21:54,420 --> 02:21:56,640
backlog or work log of stuff that you

2853
02:21:56,640 --> 02:21:58,680
would like to dive into

2854
02:21:58,680 --> 02:22:01,020
um without spoiling anything but maybe

2855
02:22:01,020 --> 02:22:03,300
getting getting hints out about what

2856
02:22:03,300 --> 02:22:04,920
looks to be interesting for people that

2857
02:22:04,920 --> 02:22:06,720
would like to research some stuff do you

2858
02:22:06,720 --> 02:22:08,939
have stuff in your backlog that you

2859
02:22:08,939 --> 02:22:10,800
might never get to but you know will be

2860
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:12,479
interesting that you could Point people

2861
02:22:12,479 --> 02:22:14,160
out to look at

2862
02:22:14,160 --> 02:22:15,840
so the things that I already know are

2863
02:22:15,840 --> 02:22:17,939
interesting they'll go to the top of my

2864
02:22:17,939 --> 02:22:19,439
list usually

2865
02:22:19,439 --> 02:22:22,380
um I mean in general with Azure ID

2866
02:22:22,380 --> 02:22:25,020
research and with Cloud research in

2867
02:22:25,020 --> 02:22:27,899
general I felt like the past few years I

2868
02:22:27,899 --> 02:22:29,399
was one of the only ones doing it

2869
02:22:29,399 --> 02:22:31,140
nowadays luckily the more people are

2870
02:22:31,140 --> 02:22:33,420
looking at it but it's still like a lot

2871
02:22:33,420 --> 02:22:36,060
of things are just not looked at much by

2872
02:22:36,060 --> 02:22:38,100
the Panthers Community researcher

2873
02:22:38,100 --> 02:22:39,899
Community there's still a lot of focus

2874
02:22:39,899 --> 02:22:43,740
on on-prem ad while like everyone is

2875
02:22:43,740 --> 02:22:45,420
already migrating to the cloud already

2876
02:22:45,420 --> 02:22:47,340
migrated to the clouds or it's working

2877
02:22:47,340 --> 02:22:49,200
with these hybrid things and I I think

2878
02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:51,060
there's still a lot of things to look at

2879
02:22:51,060 --> 02:22:53,819
there no specific Topics in general but

2880
02:22:53,819 --> 02:22:56,100
like if you look at what is implemented

2881
02:22:56,100 --> 02:22:59,040
attack wise tools wise then just go

2882
02:22:59,040 --> 02:23:01,080
build on that and I'm sure there's a lot

2883
02:23:01,080 --> 02:23:02,580
of things that um

2884
02:23:02,580 --> 02:23:04,740
are still with vulnerabilities with

2885
02:23:04,740 --> 02:23:07,020
holes with with flaws things you could

2886
02:23:07,020 --> 02:23:09,060
explain better because there's no not

2887
02:23:09,060 --> 02:23:12,000
much blogs about it yet so I think

2888
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:13,560
there's quite a lot left to do in that

2889
02:23:13,560 --> 02:23:15,300
area

2890
02:23:15,300 --> 02:23:18,540
any extra input

2891
02:23:18,540 --> 02:23:20,399
I feel like I take the opposite approach

2892
02:23:20,399 --> 02:23:22,260
or I don't really have a backlog I

2893
02:23:22,260 --> 02:23:23,819
finish a project and I go oh crap what

2894
02:23:23,819 --> 02:23:27,260
do I do next and I kind of like look at

2895
02:23:27,260 --> 02:23:29,880
Showdown and look at other sources and

2896
02:23:29,880 --> 02:23:31,680
look at what was interesting we keep a

2897
02:23:31,680 --> 02:23:33,000
list of the top vulnerabilities of the

2898
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:34,439
year and look back at those and try to

2899
02:23:34,439 --> 02:23:35,939
get inspiration but really I have

2900
02:23:35,939 --> 02:23:37,020
trouble coming up with the next project

2901
02:23:37,020 --> 02:23:39,560
every time

2902
02:23:40,080 --> 02:23:41,399
all right

2903
02:23:41,399 --> 02:23:43,620
um you've just spoke about uh Showdown

2904
02:23:43,620 --> 02:23:45,720
do you use some special tools or are

2905
02:23:45,720 --> 02:23:47,640
there particular tools that you really

2906
02:23:47,640 --> 02:23:51,300
enjoy finding a use case for so you're

2907
02:23:51,300 --> 02:23:52,800
building on whatever research you're

2908
02:23:52,800 --> 02:23:55,140
doing and you have the opportunity to do

2909
02:23:55,140 --> 02:23:56,700
something and just you're just impressed

2910
02:23:56,700 --> 02:23:58,140
by this tool that does something really

2911
02:23:58,140 --> 02:24:02,779
nice are there some little secrets there

2912
02:24:03,920 --> 02:24:06,780
I don't really have answer for that

2913
02:24:06,780 --> 02:24:10,740
um I for tools I tend to be really bad

2914
02:24:10,740 --> 02:24:12,780
at learning new tools so I tend to stick

2915
02:24:12,780 --> 02:24:15,240
with things I learned 10 15 years ago so

2916
02:24:15,240 --> 02:24:16,620
I wind up using like the old versions of

2917
02:24:16,620 --> 02:24:19,439
wind debug and GDB with no plugins and

2918
02:24:19,439 --> 02:24:22,140
stuff like that and I feel like I use

2919
02:24:22,140 --> 02:24:23,819
Vim as my editor and I have a million

2920
02:24:23,819 --> 02:24:25,620
plugins a million configs well I'm

2921
02:24:25,620 --> 02:24:27,240
hacking I'm just using like a monochrome

2922
02:24:27,240 --> 02:24:29,340
GDB terminal I really feel like I should

2923
02:24:29,340 --> 02:24:31,380
learn tools that aren't just the basic

2924
02:24:31,380 --> 02:24:33,619
crap

2925
02:24:34,620 --> 02:24:36,600
like I said I'm not really a binary

2926
02:24:36,600 --> 02:24:38,520
researcher sometimes if I look at

2927
02:24:38,520 --> 02:24:41,160
Windows internals I have to look at LSS

2928
02:24:41,160 --> 02:24:43,859
um I like the if it's net at least there

2929
02:24:43,859 --> 02:24:46,020
are some tools like decompile tools

2930
02:24:46,020 --> 02:24:47,640
that's that I really appreciate that can

2931
02:24:47,640 --> 02:24:49,200
decompile things into short document

2932
02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:51,240
readable codes

2933
02:24:51,240 --> 02:24:54,240
um otherwise if I have to use git where

2934
02:24:54,240 --> 02:24:56,880
I use x64 dbg

2935
02:24:56,880 --> 02:24:58,740
they're quite essential if you really

2936
02:24:58,740 --> 02:25:00,660
start looking at the windows internals

2937
02:25:00,660 --> 02:25:03,180
part how else has handles data TPM stuff

2938
02:25:03,180 --> 02:25:06,479
so those tools in general the rest I

2939
02:25:06,479 --> 02:25:08,280
prefer to just use the web things like

2940
02:25:08,280 --> 02:25:10,800
burp as a proxy that's all I do with

2941
02:25:10,800 --> 02:25:13,880
burp it just uses a glorified proxy

2942
02:25:13,880 --> 02:25:18,060
but it's a very useful tool to have here

2943
02:25:18,060 --> 02:25:20,819
I know you develop a lot of tools by

2944
02:25:20,819 --> 02:25:23,640
yourself is it for the learning curve or

2945
02:25:23,640 --> 02:25:25,920
is it really just you want your own spin

2946
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:27,420
on some

2947
02:25:27,420 --> 02:25:30,060
stuff that exists or is it just the

2948
02:25:30,060 --> 02:25:31,859
technology preference for building them

2949
02:25:31,859 --> 02:25:33,960
in Python

2950
02:25:33,960 --> 02:25:36,120
um I always want to understand how

2951
02:25:36,120 --> 02:25:38,460
things work and I think the only way to

2952
02:25:38,460 --> 02:25:40,020
know how things work is to implement

2953
02:25:40,020 --> 02:25:41,580
them yourself at least not for

2954
02:25:41,580 --> 02:25:43,620
everything but for most things

2955
02:25:43,620 --> 02:25:46,020
um like if I take someone else's code I

2956
02:25:46,020 --> 02:25:48,300
like if you just pick it the one time I

2957
02:25:48,300 --> 02:25:50,580
did that was when I wrote something I

2958
02:25:50,580 --> 02:25:52,439
used someone else's code and I didn't

2959
02:25:52,439 --> 02:25:53,640
look at it too much and there are some

2960
02:25:53,640 --> 02:25:55,140
vulnerabilities in there and I was like

2961
02:25:55,140 --> 02:25:56,640
well from now on I'll just write my own

2962
02:25:56,640 --> 02:25:57,899
code thanks

2963
02:25:57,899 --> 02:26:00,899
um but basically if you use other

2964
02:26:00,899 --> 02:26:03,060
people's codes without knowing the

2965
02:26:03,060 --> 02:26:04,560
journey that they went through in order

2966
02:26:04,560 --> 02:26:07,260
to analyze it then I don't think you

2967
02:26:07,260 --> 02:26:08,760
will get to these branches when you're

2968
02:26:08,760 --> 02:26:10,560
like well okay so this step it does this

2969
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:13,680
but what if I change something here and

2970
02:26:13,680 --> 02:26:15,060
do something different what would that

2971
02:26:15,060 --> 02:26:17,520
do and with most of my research like the

2972
02:26:17,520 --> 02:26:19,380
whole Windows hello flow as well it's

2973
02:26:19,380 --> 02:26:21,540
just separate separate steps of course

2974
02:26:21,540 --> 02:26:23,939
Windows does them all at once but if you

2975
02:26:23,939 --> 02:26:26,340
implement them in a library then you can

2976
02:26:26,340 --> 02:26:28,560
do all the steps like in a different

2977
02:26:28,560 --> 02:26:31,620
order with different parameters some

2978
02:26:31,620 --> 02:26:35,399
basic fuzzing so you just yeah if you

2979
02:26:35,399 --> 02:26:37,979
put it apart then you can really analyze

2980
02:26:37,979 --> 02:26:40,380
it and if you want to do these things

2981
02:26:40,380 --> 02:26:42,060
then you will need your own tools

2982
02:26:42,060 --> 02:26:44,340
because if you just like if I have to

2983
02:26:44,340 --> 02:26:46,680
modify the the windows memory in order

2984
02:26:46,680 --> 02:26:48,960
to inject like new certificates that is

2985
02:26:48,960 --> 02:26:50,939
going to be really inefficient so that

2986
02:26:50,939 --> 02:26:52,620
usually I write my own tools for every

2987
02:26:52,620 --> 02:26:54,720
research project that I do

2988
02:26:54,720 --> 02:26:57,600
um and that brings me to like

2989
02:26:57,600 --> 02:26:59,399
understanding the implementation finding

2990
02:26:59,399 --> 02:27:01,979
flaws in that and I also like to to have

2991
02:27:01,979 --> 02:27:04,800
tools to make my life easier like a lot

2992
02:27:04,800 --> 02:27:06,899
of my research that I do is also with my

2993
02:27:06,899 --> 02:27:09,180
own tools that I built to automate sign

2994
02:27:09,180 --> 02:27:11,819
in with selenium so I don't have to

2995
02:27:11,819 --> 02:27:14,399
enter the codes all the time copy paste

2996
02:27:14,399 --> 02:27:16,260
passwords it just does it all for me so

2997
02:27:16,260 --> 02:27:19,580
it's also making my own life easier

2998
02:27:19,920 --> 02:27:22,740
you know you have a similar process

2999
02:27:22,740 --> 02:27:24,740
um kind of twofold's answer to that one

3000
02:27:24,740 --> 02:27:27,540
sometimes I find it really hard to read

3001
02:27:27,540 --> 02:27:29,359
academic papers and to like understand

3002
02:27:29,359 --> 02:27:32,819
like big Concepts but if I write them

3003
02:27:32,819 --> 02:27:34,260
myself or Implement them I can usually

3004
02:27:34,260 --> 02:27:36,180
get my head around them eventually so I

3005
02:27:36,180 --> 02:27:37,620
wrote The Tool many years ago for

3006
02:27:37,620 --> 02:27:39,899
petting Oracle text for example and for

3007
02:27:39,899 --> 02:27:41,460
hash extensions even better one I wrote

3008
02:27:41,460 --> 02:27:44,100
Google hash extender and like I ran to

3009
02:27:44,100 --> 02:27:45,600
this in a CTF and I was like there's no

3010
02:27:45,600 --> 02:27:46,740
good tools for this and I don't

3011
02:27:46,740 --> 02:27:48,840
understand how it works I wonder if I

3012
02:27:48,840 --> 02:27:51,359
could figure this out so like mixture of

3013
02:27:51,359 --> 02:27:53,340
reading white papers and trying code

3014
02:27:53,340 --> 02:27:55,620
eventually I kind of got the concept and

3015
02:27:55,620 --> 02:27:57,180
then I was able to write my own tool

3016
02:27:57,180 --> 02:27:58,800
that others use now which I'm kind of

3017
02:27:58,800 --> 02:28:01,160
proud of the other part

3018
02:28:01,160 --> 02:28:04,140
is one of my favorite things to work on

3019
02:28:04,140 --> 02:28:06,180
is Network protocols and typically

3020
02:28:06,180 --> 02:28:07,979
besides like netcat there's no good

3021
02:28:07,979 --> 02:28:11,220
tools for like testing protocols because

3022
02:28:11,220 --> 02:28:13,140
I'm just building it as I go so I'll

3023
02:28:13,140 --> 02:28:14,880
figure out the header is 20 bytes and

3024
02:28:14,880 --> 02:28:16,319
then if this looks like a length field

3025
02:28:16,319 --> 02:28:17,640
so if I send the wrong length field or

3026
02:28:17,640 --> 02:28:18,840
this looks like a version what if I send

3027
02:28:18,840 --> 02:28:20,399
the wrong version or this looks like an

3028
02:28:20,399 --> 02:28:22,140
OP code if I send every op code like 0

3029
02:28:22,140 --> 02:28:25,859
to 55 and like as I as I figure out what

3030
02:28:25,859 --> 02:28:27,180
things mean I'll just build functions

3031
02:28:27,180 --> 02:28:28,800
and build tools and at the end I have

3032
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:30,840
like a library of sorts for this

3033
02:28:30,840 --> 02:28:32,880
protocol and then I'll try to clean it

3034
02:28:32,880 --> 02:28:34,439
up and merge into Metasploit and then

3035
02:28:34,439 --> 02:28:36,060
we'll have like protocol support immense

3036
02:28:36,060 --> 02:28:38,760
play for it so I find it useful as a

3037
02:28:38,760 --> 02:28:40,319
reverse engineering thing as well

3038
02:28:40,319 --> 02:28:42,600
speaking of uh protocol reversing we

3039
02:28:42,600 --> 02:28:44,460
have a question from the public here

3040
02:28:44,460 --> 02:28:47,340
um asking if you have any particular

3041
02:28:47,340 --> 02:28:50,100
tools or special

3042
02:28:50,100 --> 02:28:52,620
tricks I'm guessing when you're looking

3043
02:28:52,620 --> 02:28:54,300
at reversing some opaque protocols that

3044
02:28:54,300 --> 02:28:56,399
you don't know nothing about I know in

3045
02:28:56,399 --> 02:28:57,060
your talk you talked about

3046
02:28:57,060 --> 02:28:59,220
re-implementing a client which often

3047
02:28:59,220 --> 02:29:01,620
helps a lot and we saw you use GDB

3048
02:29:01,620 --> 02:29:04,700
either and uh Wireshark I'm guessing

3049
02:29:04,700 --> 02:29:07,439
anything else in your toolbox

3050
02:29:07,439 --> 02:29:10,500
I think that's largely it and like Ruby

3051
02:29:10,500 --> 02:29:12,359
like writing code for it

3052
02:29:12,359 --> 02:29:14,100
um when possible my favorite thing to do

3053
02:29:14,100 --> 02:29:16,500
is to use a packet capture tool capture

3054
02:29:16,500 --> 02:29:18,300
a conversation and try to identify

3055
02:29:18,300 --> 02:29:19,800
things when you're looking to have

3056
02:29:19,800 --> 02:29:21,300
Network protocols

3057
02:29:21,300 --> 02:29:23,880
similar things usually happen there's

3058
02:29:23,880 --> 02:29:25,260
usually a length field near the

3059
02:29:25,260 --> 02:29:26,340
beginning or at the beginning of each

3060
02:29:26,340 --> 02:29:28,140
packet and you want to find a length

3061
02:29:28,140 --> 02:29:29,939
field just because TCP is a stream you

3062
02:29:29,939 --> 02:29:31,620
need to be able to chop it up there's

3063
02:29:31,620 --> 02:29:32,880
usually a version number of some sort

3064
02:29:32,880 --> 02:29:34,080
and usually a version number doesn't

3065
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:35,580
change or if it does change it's going

3066
02:29:35,580 --> 02:29:36,720
to be interesting because you can use

3067
02:29:36,720 --> 02:29:38,220
old versions

3068
02:29:38,220 --> 02:29:39,960
um usually there's stuff like that then

3069
02:29:39,960 --> 02:29:43,200
usually there's a list of values the

3070
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:45,000
most typical thing I see is type length

3071
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,220
value whether it's a type like string a

3072
02:29:47,220 --> 02:29:50,100
length like 10 bytes and a value like I

3073
02:29:50,100 --> 02:29:52,500
tend what characters

3074
02:29:52,500 --> 02:29:53,640
um so I'm looking for stuff like that

3075
02:29:53,640 --> 02:29:55,920
and almost every protocol ultimately

3076
02:29:55,920 --> 02:29:58,200
comes down to that sometimes it's more

3077
02:29:58,200 --> 02:29:59,880
complex sometimes it's less complex but

3078
02:29:59,880 --> 02:30:02,040
that's usually what I'm looking for and

3079
02:30:02,040 --> 02:30:04,020
if I don't have Wireshark available if

3080
02:30:04,020 --> 02:30:05,220
it's

3081
02:30:05,220 --> 02:30:06,960
I guess I should mentioned one other

3082
02:30:06,960 --> 02:30:08,399
thing there's been several projects I've

3083
02:30:08,399 --> 02:30:10,080
worked on where I'm looking at a client

3084
02:30:10,080 --> 02:30:12,479
app like I install this service on

3085
02:30:12,479 --> 02:30:14,460
Windows and that double hook and exe

3086
02:30:14,460 --> 02:30:16,740
file and it gives me a UI for it

3087
02:30:16,740 --> 02:30:18,240
um if you pack it after that unless a

3088
02:30:18,240 --> 02:30:19,859
local host sometimes they'll still

3089
02:30:19,859 --> 02:30:22,020
communicate over TCP the current thing

3090
02:30:22,020 --> 02:30:24,420
I'm working on that is not public yet I

3091
02:30:24,420 --> 02:30:26,760
did that I I ran it I packet captured

3092
02:30:26,760 --> 02:30:29,520
the like local client and then I use

3093
02:30:29,520 --> 02:30:31,260
that same protocol remotely and what's

3094
02:30:31,260 --> 02:30:33,060
funny is sometimes the local client this

3095
02:30:33,060 --> 02:30:34,859
goes back a couple projects ago but

3096
02:30:34,859 --> 02:30:36,479
sometimes the local the local client

3097
02:30:36,479 --> 02:30:38,100
will say like

3098
02:30:38,100 --> 02:30:40,380
I am a local client here's a field that

3099
02:30:40,380 --> 02:30:42,600
says like I am authenticated and remote

3100
02:30:42,600 --> 02:30:44,520
users don't set that field but if you

3101
02:30:44,520 --> 02:30:46,620
set that field it actually works there

3102
02:30:46,620 --> 02:30:49,140
was a tool called Flex slices manager or

3103
02:30:49,140 --> 02:30:51,060
something that was used by Citrix and

3104
02:30:51,060 --> 02:30:52,319
that was exactly vulnerability I report

3105
02:30:52,319 --> 02:30:53,760
on that which I'm not sure actually ever

3106
02:30:53,760 --> 02:30:56,160
got fixed but it's on the represent blog

3107
02:30:56,160 --> 02:30:58,260
where the local client would say is

3108
02:30:58,260 --> 02:31:01,700
local true and the foreign

3109
02:31:01,700 --> 02:31:05,340
bypass the auth checks so like that kind

3110
02:31:05,340 --> 02:31:06,960
of thing works sometimes

3111
02:31:06,960 --> 02:31:08,640
yeah I sometimes have a bit of a chicken

3112
02:31:08,640 --> 02:31:11,220
and egg problem because like also in

3113
02:31:11,220 --> 02:31:13,560
this research it's a lot about analyzing

3114
02:31:13,560 --> 02:31:16,380
how Windows joins itself but that's

3115
02:31:16,380 --> 02:31:18,000
that's all happening like when you

3116
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:19,560
install the operating system so

3117
02:31:19,560 --> 02:31:21,000
obviously at the Windows installation

3118
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:22,859
screen there's no tools yet there's

3119
02:31:22,859 --> 02:31:24,359
there's nothing

3120
02:31:24,359 --> 02:31:27,359
um and most of it is web traffic so it's

3121
02:31:27,359 --> 02:31:29,580
quite well you can if you can get it to

3122
02:31:29,580 --> 02:31:32,399
a proxy it's quite easy to analyze

3123
02:31:32,399 --> 02:31:34,380
um that's how you tell Windows like at

3124
02:31:34,380 --> 02:31:36,240
the the very first moment you boot it up

3125
02:31:36,240 --> 02:31:38,399
after installation to use the proxy and

3126
02:31:38,399 --> 02:31:40,800
to think put everything through that and

3127
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:42,600
then also there's

3128
02:31:42,600 --> 02:31:44,580
um like when you have Azure ad joins

3129
02:31:44,580 --> 02:31:46,859
managed systems there's an MDM involved

3130
02:31:46,859 --> 02:31:49,260
which uses client certificates so then

3131
02:31:49,260 --> 02:31:51,120
you need to intercept the registration

3132
02:31:51,120 --> 02:31:52,500
and then intercept the client

3133
02:31:52,500 --> 02:31:54,120
certificate and then do that and then

3134
02:31:54,120 --> 02:31:55,380
you can decrypt the traffic because

3135
02:31:55,380 --> 02:31:57,840
otherwise things will break

3136
02:31:57,840 --> 02:32:00,720
um So eventually I figured out that

3137
02:32:00,720 --> 02:32:03,540
instead of having everything trying to

3138
02:32:03,540 --> 02:32:05,280
do everything manually and import these

3139
02:32:05,280 --> 02:32:07,460
certificates during the installation

3140
02:32:07,460 --> 02:32:10,200
I can just use the device management

3141
02:32:10,200 --> 02:32:12,300
solution to push my certificate and to

3142
02:32:12,300 --> 02:32:13,800
push myself as a proxy and then it will

3143
02:32:13,800 --> 02:32:15,780
happen automatically so then you won't

3144
02:32:15,780 --> 02:32:17,580
catch the very beginning but at least

3145
02:32:17,580 --> 02:32:21,359
from the uh once the the windows

3146
02:32:21,359 --> 02:32:23,399
contacts the MDM it will put the right

3147
02:32:23,399 --> 02:32:25,080
settings and after that everything goes

3148
02:32:25,080 --> 02:32:26,880
through automatically so

3149
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:30,240
use the tools that you have as well

3150
02:32:30,240 --> 02:32:32,359
so you're both Professional Security

3151
02:32:32,359 --> 02:32:34,439
vulnerability professionality

3152
02:32:34,439 --> 02:32:36,800
researchers we have some questions about

3153
02:32:36,800 --> 02:32:39,960
your workflows um I'm guessing some

3154
02:32:39,960 --> 02:32:42,060
people want to learn or understand how

3155
02:32:42,060 --> 02:32:44,040
do you manage your time are you a very

3156
02:32:44,040 --> 02:32:46,080
free form person or do you time box a

3157
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:48,479
lot the U.S science specific time

3158
02:32:48,479 --> 02:32:51,300
lengths or periods for specific parts of

3159
02:32:51,300 --> 02:32:53,160
your research can you elaborate a little

3160
02:32:53,160 --> 02:32:56,220
on how you organize your time

3161
02:32:56,220 --> 02:32:58,620
yeah for me I would say I'm on a

3162
02:32:58,620 --> 02:33:00,600
disorganized side I usually have some

3163
02:33:00,600 --> 02:33:02,520
idea of the project I'm working on

3164
02:33:02,520 --> 02:33:06,479
usually and the outcomes I'm looking for

3165
02:33:06,479 --> 02:33:08,280
um the first thing I usually do is look

3166
02:33:08,280 --> 02:33:10,500
for attack surface and sort of mentally

3167
02:33:10,500 --> 02:33:12,060
break down all the things I want to look

3168
02:33:12,060 --> 02:33:14,399
at are the network services are there

3169
02:33:14,399 --> 02:33:17,460
TCP UDP services are there like Windows

3170
02:33:17,460 --> 02:33:19,439
services are there startup files are

3171
02:33:19,439 --> 02:33:21,479
there like configuration files or is

3172
02:33:21,479 --> 02:33:23,340
there encryption is there web is there

3173
02:33:23,340 --> 02:33:25,859
whatever and try to get like an idea for

3174
02:33:25,859 --> 02:33:27,720
all the things I want to look at and

3175
02:33:27,720 --> 02:33:30,240
like just experience intuition telling

3176
02:33:30,240 --> 02:33:31,920
me how long it's going to take like

3177
02:33:31,920 --> 02:33:33,420
probably this will take a couple weeks

3178
02:33:33,420 --> 02:33:35,640
plus plan a month kind of thing

3179
02:33:35,640 --> 02:33:38,220
and then like once I start working on it

3180
02:33:38,220 --> 02:33:40,500
I as long as I'm making like steady

3181
02:33:40,500 --> 02:33:42,300
progress I'm not just hung up on

3182
02:33:42,300 --> 02:33:44,160
something I feel like I can go for a

3183
02:33:44,160 --> 02:33:47,520
long time and eventually I get

3184
02:33:47,520 --> 02:33:49,500
again it's kind of intuitive of knowing

3185
02:33:49,500 --> 02:33:51,180
when I've explored the major attack

3186
02:33:51,180 --> 02:33:53,399
surface I want to look at or when I feel

3187
02:33:53,399 --> 02:33:54,660
like I've

3188
02:33:54,660 --> 02:33:56,760
I'm not gonna find anything and after a

3189
02:33:56,760 --> 02:33:57,780
while

3190
02:33:57,780 --> 02:33:59,880
it's hard like the current project I'm

3191
02:33:59,880 --> 02:34:01,260
working on has like eight different

3192
02:34:01,260 --> 02:34:04,260
protocols implements and I worked on one

3193
02:34:04,260 --> 02:34:06,479
for about two months and got some nice

3194
02:34:06,479 --> 02:34:08,160
findings and sent them to the vendor now

3195
02:34:08,160 --> 02:34:09,359
I'm like do I really want to work on the

3196
02:34:09,359 --> 02:34:10,800
other seven or do I call this good

3197
02:34:10,800 --> 02:34:11,880
because I feel like I have a lot of

3198
02:34:11,880 --> 02:34:13,319
context in that project now I know how

3199
02:34:13,319 --> 02:34:15,600
to install it I know how the code kind

3200
02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:17,819
of is laid out C plus plus and the

3201
02:34:17,819 --> 02:34:20,760
classes it uses and stuff like I want to

3202
02:34:20,760 --> 02:34:22,200
continue on it but I also feel like I

3203
02:34:22,200 --> 02:34:24,000
could do better work elsewhere so I

3204
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:25,380
think once I get back from Montreal I'm

3205
02:34:25,380 --> 02:34:26,700
gonna have to answer that question

3206
02:34:26,700 --> 02:34:27,479
because

3207
02:34:27,479 --> 02:34:30,420
I'm pretty free form in that sense

3208
02:34:30,420 --> 02:34:33,960
yeah so I'm not a very organized person

3209
02:34:33,960 --> 02:34:35,520
um that also goes into my research

3210
02:34:35,520 --> 02:34:38,040
sometimes I just look at something uh

3211
02:34:38,040 --> 02:34:40,800
for a day day or two and then abandon it

3212
02:34:40,800 --> 02:34:43,080
in order to get back to it later

3213
02:34:43,080 --> 02:34:45,899
um usually when I do research a certain

3214
02:34:45,899 --> 02:34:48,060
topic then once I have the feeling that

3215
02:34:48,060 --> 02:34:51,180
I found what I could find and I have a

3216
02:34:51,180 --> 02:34:52,740
rough understanding of the things that

3217
02:34:52,740 --> 02:34:54,780
are at play there then that's enough

3218
02:34:54,780 --> 02:34:56,700
that's usually also the point that I

3219
02:34:56,700 --> 02:34:59,000
send the reports of to Microsoft

3220
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,979
and it always takes a while to fix these

3221
02:35:01,979 --> 02:35:03,479
things so

3222
02:35:03,479 --> 02:35:05,760
um usually like that's just a waiting

3223
02:35:05,760 --> 02:35:07,979
period then I have to wait for them to

3224
02:35:07,979 --> 02:35:09,720
fix it and see how they fixed it and

3225
02:35:09,720 --> 02:35:11,520
then then I can release my tools and

3226
02:35:11,520 --> 02:35:12,960
then I figure out there's a few more

3227
02:35:12,960 --> 02:35:15,479
things here that I assumed and don't

3228
02:35:15,479 --> 02:35:18,060
know fully yet and then when I make my

3229
02:35:18,060 --> 02:35:20,460
slides when I make a Blog then

3230
02:35:20,460 --> 02:35:22,800
look at it again and then find some more

3231
02:35:22,800 --> 02:35:24,600
things sometimes or find some

3232
02:35:24,600 --> 02:35:26,540
alternative ways or

3233
02:35:26,540 --> 02:35:29,640
research some more parts like for this

3234
02:35:29,640 --> 02:35:31,979
talk also I had a feeling what was

3235
02:35:31,979 --> 02:35:34,200
possible but like the empty hash

3236
02:35:34,200 --> 02:35:36,120
extraction I actually got it working

3237
02:35:36,120 --> 02:35:39,420
yesterday so I knew it was possible I I

3238
02:35:39,420 --> 02:35:41,760
had read seen it in the past but I

3239
02:35:41,760 --> 02:35:43,620
didn't remember the exact implementation

3240
02:35:43,620 --> 02:35:45,960
and then I got it working got a

3241
02:35:45,960 --> 02:35:47,340
screenshot put it in the slides and then

3242
02:35:47,340 --> 02:35:50,100
it was done but it's good to be made a

3243
02:35:50,100 --> 02:35:52,200
little bit better so also need to brush

3244
02:35:52,200 --> 02:35:53,700
up those tools a little bit before I

3245
02:35:53,700 --> 02:35:55,620
push him to uh together so it's not

3246
02:35:55,620 --> 02:35:57,720
always very organized it doesn't help

3247
02:35:57,720 --> 02:35:59,880
that there's not well obviously you want

3248
02:35:59,880 --> 02:36:01,680
to report these things and make sure

3249
02:36:01,680 --> 02:36:03,960
they get fixed so you cannot just write

3250
02:36:03,960 --> 02:36:07,520
it push it and then blog it in one week

3251
02:36:07,520 --> 02:36:10,020
but yeah I do have a lot of like

3252
02:36:10,020 --> 02:36:12,120
Concepts things that I have locally that

3253
02:36:12,120 --> 02:36:14,359
I work that I have working

3254
02:36:14,359 --> 02:36:17,460
some things that work they can do things

3255
02:36:17,460 --> 02:36:19,859
but they're so vague that I don't even

3256
02:36:19,859 --> 02:36:22,080
understand why work so that needs some

3257
02:36:22,080 --> 02:36:23,700
more research as well

3258
02:36:23,700 --> 02:36:25,620
um that's yeah it's a it's always

3259
02:36:25,620 --> 02:36:27,600
challenging to to focus to find the

3260
02:36:27,600 --> 02:36:28,859
focus to

3261
02:36:28,859 --> 02:36:32,280
deeply focus on the projects and then to

3262
02:36:32,280 --> 02:36:34,020
finish it to wrap it up to write it all

3263
02:36:34,020 --> 02:36:36,140
down to make screenshots make it

3264
02:36:36,140 --> 02:36:38,340
understandable for people that haven't

3265
02:36:38,340 --> 02:36:40,740
dedicated that much time in it so

3266
02:36:40,740 --> 02:36:42,840
but well it works

3267
02:36:42,840 --> 02:36:44,640
I've also got a problem that I call like

3268
02:36:44,640 --> 02:36:46,439
one lasting problem where I feel like

3269
02:36:46,439 --> 02:36:47,640
the last thing I do is always half my

3270
02:36:47,640 --> 02:36:49,920
time where like I did a project a few

3271
02:36:49,920 --> 02:36:53,040
months ago and F5 big IP and I found

3272
02:36:53,040 --> 02:36:54,300
some vulnerabilities airport to the

3273
02:36:54,300 --> 02:36:56,220
vendor they confirmed everything and I

3274
02:36:56,220 --> 02:36:57,359
wanted to write the blog and I was like

3275
02:36:57,359 --> 02:36:58,800
you know I never did run burps with this

3276
02:36:58,800 --> 02:37:00,240
one endpoint and I crashed the server

3277
02:37:00,240 --> 02:37:01,620
and was like oh crap I'll get to a

3278
02:37:01,620 --> 02:37:03,600
second instead of this and the current

3279
02:37:03,600 --> 02:37:05,640
project was the same thing like I got to

3280
02:37:05,640 --> 02:37:06,600
the end I'm like I got some okay

3281
02:37:06,600 --> 02:37:08,880
findings nothing exciting what if I just

3282
02:37:08,880 --> 02:37:10,740
do a quick crappy fuzzer and just flip

3283
02:37:10,740 --> 02:37:12,300
bits in the package I know I crashed it

3284
02:37:12,300 --> 02:37:15,060
oh no and like the last thing is often

3285
02:37:15,060 --> 02:37:16,800
the biggest thing I did that when I was

3286
02:37:16,800 --> 02:37:18,240
a pen tester too I'd be wearing the

3287
02:37:18,240 --> 02:37:19,800
report and be like hey wait what about

3288
02:37:19,800 --> 02:37:23,280
and then it just becomes an avalanche

3289
02:37:23,280 --> 02:37:26,340
are you some very individual researchers

3290
02:37:26,340 --> 02:37:29,340
or do you uh exchange a lot when you

3291
02:37:29,340 --> 02:37:30,540
find something that you're you aren't

3292
02:37:30,540 --> 02:37:32,100
sure you have some stuff on the table

3293
02:37:32,100 --> 02:37:34,680
but you they would need more research do

3294
02:37:34,680 --> 02:37:37,380
you rely on friends and contacts at that

3295
02:37:37,380 --> 02:37:40,759
point or do you push by yourself

3296
02:37:40,920 --> 02:37:43,560
things in context of work and I have one

3297
02:37:43,560 --> 02:37:45,180
co-worker who's in Ireland I'm on the

3298
02:37:45,180 --> 02:37:47,280
west coast of the US so like we're nine

3299
02:37:47,280 --> 02:37:48,660
hours apart so we don't really work

3300
02:37:48,660 --> 02:37:50,700
together all that much and I like to

3301
02:37:50,700 --> 02:37:52,020
work with other people at my company but

3302
02:37:52,020 --> 02:37:54,359
realistically my team is very uh very

3303
02:37:54,359 --> 02:37:55,140
small

3304
02:37:55,140 --> 02:37:57,300
so I don't get to do it much there are

3305
02:37:57,300 --> 02:37:58,740
like before we have findings and before

3306
02:37:58,740 --> 02:38:00,899
we have old days I'll occasionally tag

3307
02:38:00,899 --> 02:38:02,819
friends I'm working I was working a

3308
02:38:02,819 --> 02:38:04,500
weird compression issue a couple weeks

3309
02:38:04,500 --> 02:38:05,939
ago and I have a friend who's a big like

3310
02:38:05,939 --> 02:38:08,340
crypto and compression nerd so I reached

3311
02:38:08,340 --> 02:38:10,439
out to him and said like hey I have a

3312
02:38:10,439 --> 02:38:12,479
weird problem can you can you help me

3313
02:38:12,479 --> 02:38:14,040
make a file that compresses to itself or

3314
02:38:14,040 --> 02:38:15,899
do you compress it to itself and he said

3315
02:38:15,899 --> 02:38:17,160
sure and we built it and that ended up

3316
02:38:17,160 --> 02:38:18,479
being like a finding

3317
02:38:18,479 --> 02:38:20,100
so like I'll reach out to friends

3318
02:38:20,100 --> 02:38:22,500
sometimes but realistically I can't do

3319
02:38:22,500 --> 02:38:24,479
it much just because of I'm doing

3320
02:38:24,479 --> 02:38:27,060
everything for work

3321
02:38:27,060 --> 02:38:28,979
so I don't collaborate with other

3322
02:38:28,979 --> 02:38:31,500
researchers that often um of course we

3323
02:38:31,500 --> 02:38:33,660
all learn from each other's Works

3324
02:38:33,660 --> 02:38:35,520
um get inspired by each other's research

3325
02:38:35,520 --> 02:38:37,979
so there will be a lot of people that do

3326
02:38:37,979 --> 02:38:39,720
the research I read about it build

3327
02:38:39,720 --> 02:38:41,939
forward on it I do have some projects

3328
02:38:41,939 --> 02:38:44,280
that I do together like I'm working on a

3329
02:38:44,280 --> 02:38:46,620
project with with Olaf right now as well

3330
02:38:46,620 --> 02:38:51,000
on some some Azure ID research it comes

3331
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,700
with new challenges like if I have just

3332
02:38:53,700 --> 02:38:55,319
my labs on my own machine it's very easy

3333
02:38:55,319 --> 02:38:57,120
if you need to share a lab environment

3334
02:38:57,120 --> 02:38:59,700
with virtual machines then get into all

3335
02:38:59,700 --> 02:39:01,200
new kind of issues like where are you

3336
02:39:01,200 --> 02:39:02,160
going to host it how are you going to

3337
02:39:02,160 --> 02:39:04,200
make sure that we both access it gonna

3338
02:39:04,200 --> 02:39:07,620
keep nodes share each other how do I get

3339
02:39:07,620 --> 02:39:09,180
the better version of my tool that

3340
02:39:09,180 --> 02:39:11,760
contains all this non-documented stuff

3341
02:39:11,760 --> 02:39:14,939
and get it over to that but yeah it's of

3342
02:39:14,939 --> 02:39:16,680
course it's great to collaborate and get

3343
02:39:16,680 --> 02:39:18,660
some different perspective usually I do

3344
02:39:18,660 --> 02:39:20,460
things on my own

3345
02:39:20,460 --> 02:39:22,140
we had some questions from the public

3346
02:39:22,140 --> 02:39:25,260
that are asking about uh disclosure

3347
02:39:25,260 --> 02:39:28,680
vendors and funny stories any uh

3348
02:39:28,680 --> 02:39:31,939
worthwhile anecdotes here

3349
02:39:31,979 --> 02:39:33,720
um yeah disclosure is sort of an

3350
02:39:33,720 --> 02:39:35,520
interesting issue because every

3351
02:39:35,520 --> 02:39:36,840
researcher in every company has their

3352
02:39:36,840 --> 02:39:38,160
own policies

3353
02:39:38,160 --> 02:39:40,560
our typical one at rapid seven

3354
02:39:40,560 --> 02:39:42,479
a guy named Todd Beardsley worked for us

3355
02:39:42,479 --> 02:39:45,300
until fairly recently now he works for

3356
02:39:45,300 --> 02:39:47,160
government something something sizza or

3357
02:39:47,160 --> 02:39:49,979
something but

3358
02:39:49,979 --> 02:39:51,780
he helped draft his culture policy with

3359
02:39:51,780 --> 02:39:54,359
my manager and with me that said like

3360
02:39:54,359 --> 02:39:56,580
when we send a vendor reports we say we

3361
02:39:56,580 --> 02:39:58,979
here's our typical policy with a bunch

3362
02:39:58,979 --> 02:40:00,899
of asterixes we'll publish in 60 days

3363
02:40:00,899 --> 02:40:02,939
unless we agree on something mutually

3364
02:40:02,939 --> 02:40:05,939
better and usually we'll push it out to

3365
02:40:05,939 --> 02:40:07,439
90 days or a little bit more if the

3366
02:40:07,439 --> 02:40:08,880
vendor requests it and they're being

3367
02:40:08,880 --> 02:40:10,319
like communicative

3368
02:40:10,319 --> 02:40:13,020
but we've had interesting issues in the

3369
02:40:13,020 --> 02:40:15,060
past there was one vendor who we

3370
02:40:15,060 --> 02:40:16,859
reported vulnerability to and it turns

3371
02:40:16,859 --> 02:40:17,880
out they were a customer which doesn't

3372
02:40:17,880 --> 02:40:19,800
affect us at all but we've got to be

3373
02:40:19,800 --> 02:40:22,859
nice to customers and they asked if they

3374
02:40:22,859 --> 02:40:24,840
could like chat with us the researchers

3375
02:40:24,840 --> 02:40:26,100
and we don't typically do that but we're

3376
02:40:26,100 --> 02:40:28,800
like sure whatever and there's they were

3377
02:40:28,800 --> 02:40:30,300
really interested in like how we got the

3378
02:40:30,300 --> 02:40:32,160
software and I'm like sweet so I found

3379
02:40:32,160 --> 02:40:34,020
these cool vulnerabilities and like I

3380
02:40:34,020 --> 02:40:35,100
have a lot of interesting advice for how

3381
02:40:35,100 --> 02:40:36,240
to make a software more secure and he's

3382
02:40:36,240 --> 02:40:38,280
like so how do you download it and it

3383
02:40:38,280 --> 02:40:40,800
felt like kind of a waste of time

3384
02:40:40,800 --> 02:40:41,399
um

3385
02:40:41,399 --> 02:40:43,380
and they ended up actually fixing things

3386
02:40:43,380 --> 02:40:45,180
without an extension so ended up being

3387
02:40:45,180 --> 02:40:46,260
okay

3388
02:40:46,260 --> 02:40:46,859
um

3389
02:40:46,859 --> 02:40:48,180
I feel like I have other stories I can't

3390
02:40:48,180 --> 02:40:50,040
remember right now but maybe I'll think

3391
02:40:50,040 --> 02:40:50,939
of them

3392
02:40:50,939 --> 02:40:53,939
yeah so I almost exclusively disclosed

3393
02:40:53,939 --> 02:40:55,680
things to Microsoft

3394
02:40:55,680 --> 02:40:57,780
um I would describe that usually as a

3395
02:40:57,780 --> 02:40:59,640
bit of a roller coaster

3396
02:40:59,640 --> 02:41:02,880
um a lot of every time they there's a

3397
02:41:02,880 --> 02:41:05,340
new way that I think I think I've had it

3398
02:41:05,340 --> 02:41:07,380
all by now but then there's always some

3399
02:41:07,380 --> 02:41:08,700
new things

3400
02:41:08,700 --> 02:41:10,439
um I've actually had

3401
02:41:10,439 --> 02:41:13,380
a case that I assumed was fixed then I

3402
02:41:13,380 --> 02:41:14,880
talked about it at a Microsoft

3403
02:41:14,880 --> 02:41:16,380
conference no less and it turns out it

3404
02:41:16,380 --> 02:41:17,540
was not fixed

3405
02:41:17,540 --> 02:41:20,399
so I accidentally dropped the zero day

3406
02:41:20,399 --> 02:41:22,439
on a Microsoft stage and one for the

3407
02:41:22,439 --> 02:41:26,760
bucket list and I've also had one that I

3408
02:41:26,760 --> 02:41:28,740
talked about it last year I assumed it

3409
02:41:28,740 --> 02:41:30,720
was fixed I didn't look at it I had a

3410
02:41:30,720 --> 02:41:32,880
talk again a couple of months later then

3411
02:41:32,880 --> 02:41:35,100
found a really trivial bypass and

3412
02:41:35,100 --> 02:41:36,420
apparently no one else bothered to

3413
02:41:36,420 --> 02:41:38,160
actually test my things that I say that

3414
02:41:38,160 --> 02:41:39,479
is actually true and whether it's

3415
02:41:39,479 --> 02:41:41,520
actually fixed or not so

3416
02:41:41,520 --> 02:41:43,680
maybe there's some interesting stuff in

3417
02:41:43,680 --> 02:41:46,620
there but then they very quickly fixed

3418
02:41:46,620 --> 02:41:48,479
that like within a day their specific

3419
02:41:48,479 --> 02:41:50,819
bypass so I could have my talk in the

3420
02:41:50,819 --> 02:41:51,960
next day

3421
02:41:51,960 --> 02:41:54,120
um that was well a good collaborative

3422
02:41:54,120 --> 02:41:56,460
experience

3423
02:41:56,460 --> 02:41:59,760
um other than that yeah I've had one

3424
02:41:59,760 --> 02:42:02,700
non-microsoft case where the only way to

3425
02:42:02,700 --> 02:42:05,520
report the vulnerability was that they

3426
02:42:05,520 --> 02:42:07,080
well they basically required you to do

3427
02:42:07,080 --> 02:42:08,880
it via hacker one

3428
02:42:08,880 --> 02:42:10,500
um their terms were basically like you

3429
02:42:10,500 --> 02:42:11,880
don't get anything but you're not

3430
02:42:11,880 --> 02:42:14,399
allowed to disclose it so I was like

3431
02:42:14,399 --> 02:42:16,560
so give me some alternative way if you

3432
02:42:16,560 --> 02:42:18,560
want my work which they eventually did

3433
02:42:18,560 --> 02:42:21,660
but yeah it's it's a bit of a wild west

3434
02:42:21,660 --> 02:42:23,640
out there somewhere but

3435
02:42:23,640 --> 02:42:26,700
um at least Microsoft has a good good

3436
02:42:26,700 --> 02:42:29,819
reporting process and I I get to talk to

3437
02:42:29,819 --> 02:42:31,979
them nowadays and get some collaboration

3438
02:42:31,979 --> 02:42:34,319
on how they fix it when they fix it and

3439
02:42:34,319 --> 02:42:36,180
that usually works out all right

3440
02:42:36,180 --> 02:42:37,859
so we have five minutes left so I'm

3441
02:42:37,859 --> 02:42:40,140
gonna switch subjects and move on to how

3442
02:42:40,140 --> 02:42:41,939
do you break into a career in

3443
02:42:41,939 --> 02:42:43,740
vulnerability research so what's your

3444
02:42:43,740 --> 02:42:46,560
first step if you want to do that

3445
02:42:46,560 --> 02:42:48,780
so I have an old friend Jeff mcjunkin

3446
02:42:48,780 --> 02:42:50,640
who talks about this a lot he's a

3447
02:42:50,640 --> 02:42:52,020
science instructor among other things

3448
02:42:52,020 --> 02:42:54,540
and I always like saying he said is that

3449
02:42:54,540 --> 02:42:56,819
security especially research is like a

3450
02:42:56,819 --> 02:42:59,220
Prestige class if ever play D D you'll

3451
02:42:59,220 --> 02:43:00,420
know Prestige classes or what you can

3452
02:43:00,420 --> 02:43:02,100
get to after you max out your normal

3453
02:43:02,100 --> 02:43:04,260
class I think it's really true is that

3454
02:43:04,260 --> 02:43:05,220
like

3455
02:43:05,220 --> 02:43:07,319
if you are really good at something

3456
02:43:07,319 --> 02:43:08,760
whether it's networking whether it's

3457
02:43:08,760 --> 02:43:10,500
Windows whether it's protocols

3458
02:43:10,500 --> 02:43:12,420
development whatever

3459
02:43:12,420 --> 02:43:14,580
once you get good enough security stuff

3460
02:43:14,580 --> 02:43:16,620
is a lot more a lot easier to get into

3461
02:43:16,620 --> 02:43:19,260
because security is often looking at how

3462
02:43:19,260 --> 02:43:20,939
things work and how they connect and

3463
02:43:20,939 --> 02:43:22,620
where that breaks down where the

3464
02:43:22,620 --> 02:43:24,479
assumptions May developing it break down

3465
02:43:24,479 --> 02:43:26,819
and it's a lot easier to understand the

3466
02:43:26,819 --> 02:43:28,500
assumptions if you're a programmer and

3467
02:43:28,500 --> 02:43:30,000
you're trying to find assumptions in

3468
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:31,979
someone made in their code or if you're

3469
02:43:31,979 --> 02:43:33,720
a devops and you're looking for a

3470
02:43:33,720 --> 02:43:34,800
substance people made in like they're

3471
02:43:34,800 --> 02:43:37,020
deploying pipelines or whatever you're a

3472
02:43:37,020 --> 02:43:39,180
lot more qualified to understand it

3473
02:43:39,180 --> 02:43:40,979
once you've gotten really good at the

3474
02:43:40,979 --> 02:43:42,420
thing that's kind of based on

3475
02:43:42,420 --> 02:43:45,000
so as as a result like I think the

3476
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:46,380
reason I got where I am is because I was

3477
02:43:46,380 --> 02:43:47,819
a programmer I did a computer science

3478
02:43:47,819 --> 02:43:51,180
degree and it was a developer for a

3479
02:43:51,180 --> 02:43:52,140
while and I found security really

3480
02:43:52,140 --> 02:43:54,540
interesting and I would develop a lot of

3481
02:43:54,540 --> 02:43:57,780
tools and release things open source and

3482
02:43:57,780 --> 02:44:00,300
it seems like there's like a lack of

3483
02:44:00,300 --> 02:44:02,420
that in infosec sometimes that people

3484
02:44:02,420 --> 02:44:04,560
use tools but not necessarily right

3485
02:44:04,560 --> 02:44:07,140
tools and I found like writing tools and

3486
02:44:07,140 --> 02:44:09,300
then explaining research and then I

3487
02:44:09,300 --> 02:44:10,560
don't say a basic way but in a way

3488
02:44:10,560 --> 02:44:12,120
that's easily approachable

3489
02:44:12,120 --> 02:44:14,340
is really useful like reading white

3490
02:44:14,340 --> 02:44:16,140
papers is tough for me and for a lot of

3491
02:44:16,140 --> 02:44:18,840
us but if someone writes takes a white

3492
02:44:18,840 --> 02:44:20,280
paper and writes a Blog in a more casual

3493
02:44:20,280 --> 02:44:22,500
way with examples sometimes that can be

3494
02:44:22,500 --> 02:44:24,300
like a really great way to learn and

3495
02:44:24,300 --> 02:44:26,340
people really appreciate that so I feel

3496
02:44:26,340 --> 02:44:28,080
like writing tools and explaining the

3497
02:44:28,080 --> 02:44:31,380
tools is kind of how I got where I am

3498
02:44:31,380 --> 02:44:33,780
yeah I think it mostly takes just a lot

3499
02:44:33,780 --> 02:44:37,939
of investment mostly time wise

3500
02:44:38,100 --> 02:44:40,740
and then maybe Natural Curiosity is what

3501
02:44:40,740 --> 02:44:42,420
what helped me I just want to know how

3502
02:44:42,420 --> 02:44:44,399
things work but if you want to get

3503
02:44:44,399 --> 02:44:47,399
started in security research I mean the

3504
02:44:47,399 --> 02:44:49,620
easiest way I think is just to try to

3505
02:44:49,620 --> 02:44:51,180
understand the things that you're doing

3506
02:44:51,180 --> 02:44:52,979
like Ron already mentions don't just

3507
02:44:52,979 --> 02:44:54,960
blindly run the tools try to read the

3508
02:44:54,960 --> 02:44:57,780
source code try to understand it try to

3509
02:44:57,780 --> 02:45:00,600
find some topics that don't have a lot

3510
02:45:00,600 --> 02:45:03,060
of tools maybe or that don't have a lot

3511
02:45:03,060 --> 02:45:03,800
of

3512
02:45:03,800 --> 02:45:06,899
resources like blogs that how to that

3513
02:45:06,899 --> 02:45:09,600
explain how the process works and I mean

3514
02:45:09,600 --> 02:45:12,000
if you want to start low keyed and just

3515
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,040
write a blog explaining how a certain

3516
02:45:14,040 --> 02:45:15,720
process works make sure you understand

3517
02:45:15,720 --> 02:45:17,640
it for yourself you don't need to find

3518
02:45:17,640 --> 02:45:19,800
all the kind of zero days the first time

3519
02:45:19,800 --> 02:45:21,540
in order to write a blog that's useful

3520
02:45:21,540 --> 02:45:23,340
for artists like if you start on your

3521
02:45:23,340 --> 02:45:25,080
journey and you find some things that

3522
02:45:25,080 --> 02:45:27,240
you run into it's quite likely others

3523
02:45:27,240 --> 02:45:29,520
will run into that as well so if you

3524
02:45:29,520 --> 02:45:31,220
want to start Loki just start

3525
02:45:31,220 --> 02:45:34,800
understanding it start sharing that and

3526
02:45:34,800 --> 02:45:36,780
then once you understand the topic

3527
02:45:36,780 --> 02:45:39,060
enough you'll find part that no one else

3528
02:45:39,060 --> 02:45:41,160
went yet that you can research and then

3529
02:45:41,160 --> 02:45:43,800
I think the vulnerabilities will come by

3530
02:45:43,800 --> 02:45:45,660
themselves but at that point you've

3531
02:45:45,660 --> 02:45:47,760
probably invested a lot of time in it

3532
02:45:47,760 --> 02:45:49,280
already so

3533
02:45:49,280 --> 02:45:52,080
it's just also really challenging

3534
02:45:52,080 --> 02:45:54,000
sometimes because a lot of people

3535
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,520
especially in consultancy it's just you

3536
02:45:56,520 --> 02:45:58,620
do your assessments you have to write

3537
02:45:58,620 --> 02:46:00,359
the report and then the next week is the

3538
02:46:00,359 --> 02:46:03,780
next time so it's mostly if you want to

3539
02:46:03,780 --> 02:46:05,819
really learn how the things work beyond

3540
02:46:05,819 --> 02:46:08,399
that either your employer has to give

3541
02:46:08,399 --> 02:46:09,840
you space or you have to do it in your

3542
02:46:09,840 --> 02:46:12,540
free time if you want to do other things

3543
02:46:12,540 --> 02:46:13,800
in your free time I completely

3544
02:46:13,800 --> 02:46:16,979
understand it as well but like then I

3545
02:46:16,979 --> 02:46:19,100
don't think he will get into the

3546
02:46:19,100 --> 02:46:22,020
research level if you don't have any

3547
02:46:22,020 --> 02:46:24,240
time to invest into it it's just an

3548
02:46:24,240 --> 02:46:27,000
investment and not everyone has that not

3549
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,280
everyone prioritizes that that's fine as

3550
02:46:29,280 --> 02:46:30,420
well but

3551
02:46:30,420 --> 02:46:32,220
um yeah it's it's different ways of of

3552
02:46:32,220 --> 02:46:35,599
doing things I think and getting there

3553
02:46:36,660 --> 02:46:39,180
I think we're pretty much done so thank

3554
02:46:39,180 --> 02:46:40,380
you very much for spending some time

3555
02:46:40,380 --> 02:46:42,600
with us I hope everybody like that thank

3556
02:46:42,600 --> 02:46:44,920
you have a great lunch you're welcome

3557
02:46:44,920 --> 02:46:50,320
[Applause]

3558
02:46:52,560 --> 02:46:55,319
so I think our two guests mentioned that

3559
02:46:55,319 --> 02:46:56,880
they will be around for the rest of the

3560
02:46:56,880 --> 02:46:58,859
conference and we should also maybe

3561
02:46:58,859 --> 02:47:01,020
cross them at the CTF so if you have

3562
02:47:01,020 --> 02:47:02,939
some other extra questions you can chase

3563
02:47:02,939 --> 02:47:05,240
them

3564
02:55:56,779 --> 02:56:00,439
that's the test

3565
02:56:00,540 --> 02:56:03,140
foreign

3566
02:56:40,200 --> 02:56:44,040
welcome everyone good afternoon we're

3567
02:56:44,040 --> 02:56:47,700
not North sick 2023

3568
02:56:47,700 --> 02:56:50,000
we will have a great afternoon

3569
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:52,020
[Music]

3570
02:56:52,020 --> 02:56:54,439
wait

3571
03:52:53,720 --> 03:52:56,720
thank you

3572
03:53:16,040 --> 03:53:19,220
for myself

3573
03:53:45,899 --> 03:53:48,380
I think

3574
03:54:52,979 --> 03:54:55,020
it's very nice

3575
03:54:55,020 --> 03:54:57,140
thank you

3576
03:55:05,040 --> 03:55:06,840
all right

3577
03:55:06,840 --> 03:55:10,680
um so uh welcome back to day two uh we

3578
03:55:10,680 --> 03:55:12,479
are continuing with the criminology

3579
03:55:12,479 --> 03:55:14,760
block so mostly from University of

3580
03:55:14,760 --> 03:55:18,120
Montreal to be to be precise uh also

3581
03:55:18,120 --> 03:55:19,620
from the University of Montreal our

3582
03:55:19,620 --> 03:55:22,380
moderator masara pakeluston is a

3583
03:55:22,380 --> 03:55:24,120
professor at University of Montreal and

3584
03:55:24,120 --> 03:55:26,239

really nice we have three great

3597
03:55:56,100 --> 03:55:58,319
presentation coming up so we'll first

3598
03:55:58,319 --> 03:56:01,199
start with Vicky de jarde she's an

3599
03:56:01,199 --> 03:56:03,359
English major sorry an English Lit major

3600
03:56:03,359 --> 03:56:05,399
turned criminologist turned cyber threat

3601
03:56:05,399 --> 03:56:08,340
intelligence analyst she's eternally

3602
03:56:08,340 --> 03:56:10,080
optimistic that research can make the

3603
03:56:10,080 --> 03:56:12,359
world a better place she turns crazy

3604
03:56:12,359 --> 03:56:14,760
ideas into research projects and figures

3605
03:56:14,760 --> 03:56:16,380
out later if they're actually possible

3606
03:56:16,380 --> 03:56:19,380
so welcome Vicky and thank you for your

3607
03:56:19,380 --> 03:56:22,199
presentation thank you

3608
03:56:22,199 --> 03:56:24,239
so hi thank you all for coming after

3609
03:56:24,239 --> 03:56:26,340

03:56:26,340 --> 03:56:28,380
to have you today so thank you for

3611
03:56:28,380 --> 03:56:30,300
coming for my presentation Checkmate

3612
03:56:30,300 --> 03:56:32,100
using Game Theory to study the evolution

3613
03:56:32,100 --> 03:56:34,800
of ransomware this is going to be a

3614
03:56:34,800 --> 03:56:35,939
presentation about my preliminary

3615
03:56:35,939 --> 03:56:39,439
results for my doctoral research

3616
03:56:41,340 --> 03:56:43,380
okay why is this okay okay perfect so

3617
03:56:43,380 --> 03:56:44,640
who am I well I mean Miss Sarah

3618
03:56:44,640 --> 03:56:46,920
described me pretty well I'm a PhD

3619
03:56:46,920 --> 03:56:48,660
candidate full-time but I also work at

3620
03:56:48,660 --> 03:56:50,939
Hitachi system security full-time as a

3621
03:56:50,939 --> 03:56:55,020
CTI analyst I enjoyed reading a lot uh

3622
03:56:55,020 --> 03:56:57,060
boxing way too much and growing potatoes

3623
03:56:57,060 --> 03:56:59,880
on my balcony and above all I'm also a

3624
03:56:59,880 --> 03:57:02,399
crazy cat mom so this is my little one

3625
03:57:02,399 --> 03:57:04,800
his name is Mr Darcy and he's pure evil

3626
03:57:04,800 --> 03:57:07,680
don't get fooled by this face

3627
03:57:07,680 --> 03:57:08,939
oh

3628
03:57:08,939 --> 03:57:11,220
let's go over really quickly the

3629
03:57:11,220 --> 03:57:13,439
presentation plan uh so I'm going to

3630
03:57:13,439 --> 03:57:15,359
introduce Game Theory really in simple

3631
03:57:15,359 --> 03:57:16,979
terms because otherwise I could spend

3632
03:57:16,979 --> 03:57:18,960
three hours just on this I'm going to

3633
03:57:18,960 --> 03:57:20,760
discuss the reality of the Cyber battles

3634
03:57:20,760 --> 03:57:22,500
against ransomware because this was

3635
03:57:22,500 --> 03:57:24,180
something that I didn't anticipate until

3636
03:57:24,180 --> 03:57:27,180
I started in the industry and that

3637
03:57:27,180 --> 03:57:29,040
really impacted my research then I'll

3638
03:57:29,040 --> 03:57:30,960
present the research methodology in the

3639
03:57:30,960 --> 03:57:33,479
sample uh because this is only a 30

3640
03:57:33,479 --> 03:57:35,399
minute talk I'm only going to present

3641
03:57:35,399 --> 03:57:37,800
certain results and Analysis I'll

3642
03:57:37,800 --> 03:57:39,540
discuss the limits because there is no

3643
03:57:39,540 --> 03:57:41,520
research that is perfect and then I'll

3644
03:57:41,520 --> 03:57:43,680
conclude with some of the future steps

3645
03:57:43,680 --> 03:57:45,540
that this research will take

3646
03:57:45,540 --> 03:57:47,399
so what is Game Theory Game Theory

3647
03:57:47,399 --> 03:57:48,960
analyzes the interaction between

3648
03:57:48,960 --> 03:57:50,699
self-interested groups who behave

3649
03:57:50,699 --> 03:57:54,239
strategically to maximize their their um

3650
03:57:54,239 --> 03:57:56,580
the probabilities of getting their end

3651
03:57:56,580 --> 03:57:58,380
game if we wanted to use this definition

3652
03:57:58,380 --> 03:58:01,260
in terms of cyber security what we could

3653
03:58:01,260 --> 03:58:03,899
say is that we study the interaction

3654
03:58:03,899 --> 03:58:06,479
between attackers and defenders in a way

3655
03:58:06,479 --> 03:58:08,160
to predict the outcome of that

3656
03:58:08,160 --> 03:58:11,460
interaction however for This research

3657
03:58:11,460 --> 03:58:13,380
I'm not using Game Theory to predict

3658
03:58:13,380 --> 03:58:17,220
Behavior I was worn by my my director

3659
03:58:17,220 --> 03:58:20,040
and my supervisor that if I did I'd fail

3660
03:58:20,040 --> 03:58:21,840
automatically my thesis and if you've

3661
03:58:21,840 --> 03:58:23,160
done a thesis you know you don't want to

3662
03:58:23,160 --> 03:58:24,899
fail for something so stupid

3663
03:58:24,899 --> 03:58:27,960
so let's get back on topic here so game

3664
03:58:27,960 --> 03:58:30,359
theory is an economic theory which is

3665
03:58:30,359 --> 03:58:32,760
often used in Warfare or in Conflict

3666
03:58:32,760 --> 03:58:34,859
Management right it's you've probably

3667
03:58:34,859 --> 03:58:36,779
heard of it on TV shows but it gets

3668
03:58:36,779 --> 03:58:38,699
usually very simplified and dumbed down

3669
03:58:38,699 --> 03:58:41,279
the only one show that I saw that did it

3670
03:58:41,279 --> 03:58:43,140
pretty good was Prison Break season five

3671
03:58:43,140 --> 03:58:46,500
and even that was pretty simplified

3672
03:58:46,500 --> 03:58:47,340
um

3673
03:58:47,340 --> 03:58:49,199
I did pick this Theory when I thought it

3674
03:58:49,199 --> 03:58:50,880
was cool and now I'm regretting it every

3675
03:58:50,880 --> 03:58:52,680
step of the way but we're three years in

3676
03:58:52,680 --> 03:58:54,540
and we're going with it right

3677
03:58:54,540 --> 03:58:58,620
so what uh game three brings is that you

3678
03:58:58,620 --> 03:59:01,020
can look at how people behave how they

3679
03:59:01,020 --> 03:59:02,880
play together and how they're going to

3680
03:59:02,880 --> 03:59:04,739
pick their strategies based on this

3681
03:59:04,739 --> 03:59:06,060
interaction

3682
03:59:06,060 --> 03:59:08,939
so one way of doing this is you can look

3683
03:59:08,939 --> 03:59:10,979
at what the person wants what's their

3684
03:59:10,979 --> 03:59:12,300
end game that they want to take away

3685
03:59:12,300 --> 03:59:13,859
from this right the reason they're in

3686
03:59:13,859 --> 03:59:16,560
this game so if we want to simplify this

3687
03:59:16,560 --> 03:59:17,840
in in

3688
03:59:17,840 --> 03:59:20,399
cyber security we can say that attackers

3689
03:59:20,399 --> 03:59:22,439
want to make their taxes successful

3690
03:59:22,439 --> 03:59:24,479
whereas Defenders want to block all

3691
03:59:24,479 --> 03:59:25,500
these attack

3692
03:59:25,500 --> 03:59:28,260
so their behaviors are going to be the

3693
03:59:28,260 --> 03:59:29,640
choice of strategies is going to be

3694
03:59:29,640 --> 03:59:32,040
according to their end game

3695
03:59:32,040 --> 03:59:34,859
so the only problem is that they can't

3696
03:59:34,859 --> 03:59:37,319
both be winners and both can't be losers

3697
03:59:37,319 --> 03:59:40,560
right so this is why we're hoping we're

3698
03:59:40,560 --> 03:59:43,439
in a situation of zero-sum game which is

3699
03:59:43,439 --> 03:59:46,800
defined as the the win of one causes the

3700
03:59:46,800 --> 03:59:48,420
direct loss of the other so in cyber

3701
03:59:48,420 --> 03:59:50,880
security for an attacker to win the

3702
03:59:50,880 --> 03:59:53,040
defender must have lost you can't have

3703
03:59:53,040 --> 03:59:55,680
half wins right you didn't just half-ass

3704
03:59:55,680 --> 03:59:57,120
it whoops I don't know if I'm allowed to

3705
03:59:57,120 --> 03:59:59,100
say ass but whatever

3706
03:59:59,100 --> 04:00:01,020
um you didn't halfway do it you you were

3707
04:00:01,020 --> 04:00:03,060
successful so I've talked a lot about

3708
04:00:03,060 --> 04:00:04,560
definitions and you're probably thinking

3709
04:00:04,560 --> 04:00:06,600
like I really don't care about econ 101

3710
04:00:06,600 --> 04:00:09,060
I skipped it for for pints so let's just

3711
04:00:09,060 --> 04:00:10,979
bring it back to the main subject

3712
04:00:10,979 --> 04:00:13,739
so in ransomware uh the end game of the

3713
04:00:13,739 --> 04:00:15,779
attack will be to launch that successful

3714
04:00:15,779 --> 04:00:17,460
attack and I'm going to stick on the

3715
04:00:17,460 --> 04:00:19,500
technical side I'm not going to focus on

3716
04:00:19,500 --> 04:00:21,899
the extortion side today

3717
04:00:21,899 --> 04:00:23,160
um because

3718
04:00:23,160 --> 04:00:24,479
30 minutes

3719
04:00:24,479 --> 04:00:26,760
but so let's just say that for a

3720
04:00:26,760 --> 04:00:28,979
successful ransomware to be to be done

3721
04:00:28,979 --> 04:00:31,560
the technically speaking the threat

3722
04:00:31,560 --> 04:00:33,060
actors need to be able to encrypt

3723
04:00:33,060 --> 04:00:35,580
corrupt or steal the data if not the

3724
04:00:35,580 --> 04:00:37,739
attack is not successful

3725
04:00:37,739 --> 04:00:39,899
so this is why we're in a zero-sum game

3726
04:00:39,899 --> 04:00:42,540
the cause of one the win of one causes

3727
04:00:42,540 --> 04:00:44,279
the direct loss of the other so there

3728
04:00:44,279 --> 04:00:45,479
are two types of game that I'm going to

3729
04:00:45,479 --> 04:00:47,520
talk about today there's the static and

3730
04:00:47,520 --> 04:00:50,520
dynamic games so static game is when the

3731
04:00:50,520 --> 04:00:52,560
players are both acting at the same time

3732
04:00:52,560 --> 04:00:55,199
and so you have limited ways that you

3733
04:00:55,199 --> 04:00:56,880
can prioritize strategies right you can

3734
04:00:56,880 --> 04:00:58,920
think of rock paper scissors technically

3735
04:00:58,920 --> 04:01:01,140
there's only three strategies but unless

3736
04:01:01,140 --> 04:01:02,819
you've played with the person multiple

3737
04:01:02,819 --> 04:01:05,399
times you're limited in what the person

3738
04:01:05,399 --> 04:01:07,319
is going to choose as a strategy and

3739
04:01:07,319 --> 04:01:09,479
again there's only three I feel like

3740
04:01:09,479 --> 04:01:11,760
most people start with rock first like

3741
04:01:11,760 --> 04:01:13,680
that's just the easy one so if you're

3742
04:01:13,680 --> 04:01:14,880
thinking about this and you're like okay

3743
04:01:14,880 --> 04:01:16,500
I should prioritize paper because then

3744
04:01:16,500 --> 04:01:17,880
I'll win but then everyone's thinking

3745
04:01:17,880 --> 04:01:20,100
the same way so then scissors

3746
04:01:20,100 --> 04:01:22,080
technically becomes the main the the

3747
04:01:22,080 --> 04:01:23,880
main strategy that would lead you to win

3748
04:01:23,880 --> 04:01:26,220
but if you haven't played this person

3749
04:01:26,220 --> 04:01:28,920
before you're still kind of guessing and

3750
04:01:28,920 --> 04:01:30,479
you're well you have one third of a

3751
04:01:30,479 --> 04:01:31,859
chance to be right

3752
04:01:31,859 --> 04:01:34,380
Dynamic games are different because it's

3753
04:01:34,380 --> 04:01:36,060
more of in a sequence so it's one after

3754
04:01:36,060 --> 04:01:37,620
the other you can think of a game of

3755
04:01:37,620 --> 04:01:42,120
chess as being Dynamic right so in a

3756
04:01:42,120 --> 04:01:44,160
dynamic setting you have more time to

3757
04:01:44,160 --> 04:01:45,899
plan and more time to prioritize certain

3758
04:01:45,899 --> 04:01:47,580
strategy over the other and you see with

3759
04:01:47,580 --> 04:01:49,560
the other are playing now you take for

3760
04:01:49,560 --> 04:01:51,720
granted that you both know the end game

3761
04:01:51,720 --> 04:01:53,460
of the other because we're playing chess

3762
04:01:53,460 --> 04:01:54,540
we're going to stick to the chess

3763
04:01:54,540 --> 04:01:55,800
example for now

3764
04:01:55,800 --> 04:01:57,359
but there are two ways you can go about

3765
04:01:57,359 --> 04:01:59,760
this if you want to win or make them

3766
04:01:59,760 --> 04:02:01,560
lose which in Game Theory those are two

3767
04:02:01,560 --> 04:02:03,300
different things right depending on the

3768
04:02:03,300 --> 04:02:04,979
type of settings you're in

3769
04:02:04,979 --> 04:02:07,020
so if player one does not want player

3770
04:02:07,020 --> 04:02:10,020
two to win player one can decide to take

3771
04:02:10,020 --> 04:02:11,699
strategies that would block the other

3772
04:02:11,699 --> 04:02:15,000
player or take strategies that will make

3773
04:02:15,000 --> 04:02:16,279
them win

3774
04:02:16,279 --> 04:02:20,160
so in a sequence in a dynamic setting

3775
04:02:20,160 --> 04:02:22,020
you have a lot more opportunities to

3776
04:02:22,020 --> 04:02:24,479
learn from your partner and dictate how

3777
04:02:24,479 --> 04:02:26,279
you want to either maybe push them into

3778
04:02:26,279 --> 04:02:28,979
our corner or make yourself get ahead of

3779
04:02:28,979 --> 04:02:31,439
the game see when I first started this

3780
04:02:31,439 --> 04:02:33,479
research I thought cyber security was a

3781
04:02:33,479 --> 04:02:37,319
clean-cut dynamic setting and uh well I

3782
04:02:37,319 --> 04:02:39,359
was wrong so let's figure out why I was

3783
04:02:39,359 --> 04:02:40,439
wrong

3784
04:02:40,439 --> 04:02:43,199
so the reality of cyber vital uh I

3785
04:02:43,199 --> 04:02:44,640
started this research over three years

3786
04:02:44,640 --> 04:02:47,279
ago now and when I did I wasn't working

3787
04:02:47,279 --> 04:02:49,199
in the industry I wasn't at Hitachi yet

3788
04:02:49,199 --> 04:02:52,859
and I got hit with a brick when I

3789
04:02:52,859 --> 04:02:54,359
started working the industry because the

3790
04:02:54,359 --> 04:02:57,960
reality was so not the pink bubble that

3791
04:02:57,960 --> 04:03:00,960
Academia can be in research right I got

3792
04:03:00,960 --> 04:03:03,300
like thrown into a war zone of just like

3793
04:03:03,300 --> 04:03:05,220
there are attacks everywhere there's one

3794
04:03:05,220 --> 04:03:07,260
defense team this is not the rules

3795
04:03:07,260 --> 04:03:09,359
engagements are just not there

3796
04:03:09,359 --> 04:03:11,939
so this became very complicated when

3797
04:03:11,939 --> 04:03:13,380
you're trying to study this from a game

3798
04:03:13,380 --> 04:03:14,640
perspective

3799
04:03:14,640 --> 04:03:17,040
so one of the main conclusions that I

3800
04:03:17,040 --> 04:03:19,319
saw was it's not one game at once and

3801
04:03:19,319 --> 04:03:21,359
it's also not one team against the other

3802
04:03:21,359 --> 04:03:25,020
it's more a bunch of different attackers

3803
04:03:25,020 --> 04:03:27,840
team versus one team of Defenders so if

3804
04:03:27,840 --> 04:03:29,160
we're going to take a sports metaphor

3805
04:03:29,160 --> 04:03:31,620
it's kind of like if the ABS are playing

3806
04:03:31,620 --> 04:03:34,680
against Toronto Ottawa Vegas and

3807
04:03:34,680 --> 04:03:36,899
Washington all at once on the same ice

3808
04:03:36,899 --> 04:03:39,720
now none of these themes represent the

3809
04:03:39,720 --> 04:03:42,239
same level of threats but you still kind

3810
04:03:42,239 --> 04:03:44,399
of have to deal with them all and yes if

3811
04:03:44,399 --> 04:03:45,960
you know the Dig you know the Dig that's

3812
04:03:45,960 --> 04:03:48,420
all I'll say so

3813
04:03:48,420 --> 04:03:51,180
here's the problem with Game Theory with

3814
04:03:51,180 --> 04:03:53,580
this in research is that it's very

3815
04:03:53,580 --> 04:03:55,439
difficult to reconcile the fact that

3816
04:03:55,439 --> 04:03:56,880
you're supposed to be one player against

3817
04:03:56,880 --> 04:03:59,220
one player and one player can be a team

3818
04:03:59,220 --> 04:04:01,500
of players by the way just in case I was

3819
04:04:01,500 --> 04:04:03,600
I didn't mention it

3820
04:04:03,600 --> 04:04:06,420
and then the other problem is that the

3821
04:04:06,420 --> 04:04:08,279
weight of winning is no longer the same

3822
04:04:08,279 --> 04:04:11,460
because the teams aren't the same so for

3823
04:04:11,460 --> 04:04:13,800
threat actor for threat actor groups to

3824
04:04:13,800 --> 04:04:16,140
win they need to hit one place at the

3825
04:04:16,140 --> 04:04:17,640
right time with the right tool or the

3826
04:04:17,640 --> 04:04:20,699
right exploit or whatever to win

3827
04:04:20,699 --> 04:04:22,199
it's a little bit more complicated than

3828
04:04:22,199 --> 04:04:24,420
that but we'll simplify it for now the

3829
04:04:24,420 --> 04:04:27,120
problem is on the defender side they

3830
04:04:27,120 --> 04:04:30,120
must protect everything everywhere at

3831
04:04:30,120 --> 04:04:33,960
all times and that's just not the same

3832
04:04:33,960 --> 04:04:37,020
weight because for those who work in the

3833
04:04:37,020 --> 04:04:38,399
defense on the blue teams or Defender

3834
04:04:38,399 --> 04:04:40,800
sides you know that you always get

3835
04:04:40,800 --> 04:04:42,479
surprised of things that you didn't know

3836
04:04:42,479 --> 04:04:44,279
were connected on your attack surface

3837
04:04:44,279 --> 04:04:46,260
like that random printer that's still

3838
04:04:46,260 --> 04:04:48,899
admin admin from 10 years ago that they

3839
04:04:48,899 --> 04:04:50,040
didn't put it on the sheet and you

3840
04:04:50,040 --> 04:04:51,660
didn't know existed until it was too

3841
04:04:51,660 --> 04:04:53,040
late I see some of you laughing because

3842
04:04:53,040 --> 04:04:56,160
you know it happens right so now the

3843
04:04:56,160 --> 04:04:58,319
thing is we're in a situation where

3844
04:04:58,319 --> 04:05:00,359
Defenders are just set to lose at all

3845
04:05:00,359 --> 04:05:03,120
times and now I didn't really like that

3846
04:05:03,120 --> 04:05:04,739
and I decided to try to do something

3847
04:05:04,739 --> 04:05:06,600
about it

3848
04:05:06,600 --> 04:05:09,180
which was kind of my downfall but we'll

3849
04:05:09,180 --> 04:05:10,199
talk about that

3850
04:05:10,199 --> 04:05:13,439
so Story Time quick story so in my

3851
04:05:13,439 --> 04:05:15,420
family we play this game called pay me

3852
04:05:15,420 --> 04:05:18,300
okay we play every event for hours on

3853
04:05:18,300 --> 04:05:21,300
end and it's a dynamic setting card game

3854
04:05:21,300 --> 04:05:23,279
you either need to do series or or

3855
04:05:23,279 --> 04:05:25,800
identicals right but because I've played

3856
04:05:25,800 --> 04:05:27,420
with the same family members over and

3857
04:05:27,420 --> 04:05:29,460
over again I kind of know what they do

3858
04:05:29,460 --> 04:05:31,380
and their choices of strategies so for

3859
04:05:31,380 --> 04:05:32,699
example my grandma who's like the

3860
04:05:32,699 --> 04:05:35,100
sweetest person ever she counts cards

3861
04:05:35,100 --> 04:05:38,040
like I just know it she does it my

3862
04:05:38,040 --> 04:05:40,620
brother loves risks so he goes big at

3863
04:05:40,620 --> 04:05:42,840
all times he'll just he's going all in

3864
04:05:42,840 --> 04:05:45,000
he's never won a game in like 10 years

3865
04:05:45,000 --> 04:05:46,920
but you know he's still he still aims

3866
04:05:46,920 --> 04:05:49,199
for that strategies I do not like Risk

3867
04:05:49,199 --> 04:05:51,540
I'm not someone who likes risks so I you

3868
04:05:51,540 --> 04:05:53,640
know played easy and just cheat but you

3869
04:05:53,640 --> 04:05:55,979
know maybe I do maybe I don't I probably

3870
04:05:55,979 --> 04:05:58,920
do so my point is because I played with

3871
04:05:58,920 --> 04:06:01,020
them for years I know how they behave

3872
04:06:01,020 --> 04:06:03,600
and I know their strategies right so how

3873
04:06:03,600 --> 04:06:05,460
about applying this logic to cyber

3874
04:06:05,460 --> 04:06:07,080
security and learning The attacker's

3875
04:06:07,080 --> 04:06:09,359
Playbook if you want to block attackers

3876
04:06:09,359 --> 04:06:11,100
you need to know how they might behave

3877
04:06:11,100 --> 04:06:12,540
right

3878
04:06:12,540 --> 04:06:14,880
um but then in in cyber security

3879
04:06:14,880 --> 04:06:16,739
research that applies Game Theory one of

3880
04:06:16,739 --> 04:06:18,239
the main downfalls they're like there's

3881
04:06:18,239 --> 04:06:20,279
too many strategies the number of

3882
04:06:20,279 --> 04:06:22,920
strategies is infinite and we can't do

3883
04:06:22,920 --> 04:06:25,620
it well yeah okay technically speaking

3884
04:06:25,620 --> 04:06:28,500
theoretically speaking sure yeah but no

3885
04:06:28,500 --> 04:06:31,140
because we're all humans right you might

3886
04:06:31,140 --> 04:06:33,120
there might be an endlessly amount of

3887
04:06:33,120 --> 04:06:34,800
possibilities but humans don't know all

3888
04:06:34,800 --> 04:06:36,899
of them so you're already kind of

3889
04:06:36,899 --> 04:06:39,720
hinting at something right humans are

3890
04:06:39,720 --> 04:06:41,160
rational well some of them are rational

3891
04:06:41,160 --> 04:06:43,920
not all of them so I wanted to start

3892
04:06:43,920 --> 04:06:46,380
looking at that Playbook but then look

3893
04:06:46,380 --> 04:06:50,040
at at it from an evolutionary

3894
04:06:50,040 --> 04:06:52,800
perspective but instead of focusing on

3895
04:06:52,800 --> 04:06:55,380
everything that's changed I wanted to

3896
04:06:55,380 --> 04:06:58,319
look at what didn't and the reason I

3897
04:06:58,319 --> 04:07:00,239
wanted to do this was a few before I

3898
04:07:00,239 --> 04:07:02,279
started this research I was reading this

3899
04:07:02,279 --> 04:07:04,439
article that said that there are 20 000

3900
04:07:04,439 --> 04:07:07,020
new ransomware per quarter right and I'm

3901
04:07:07,020 --> 04:07:08,340
pretty sure it was actually monthly but

3902
04:07:08,340 --> 04:07:09,840
let's just be conservative and say it

3903
04:07:09,840 --> 04:07:11,100
was quarterly

3904
04:07:11,100 --> 04:07:13,680
and I remember thinking back then when I

3905
04:07:13,680 --> 04:07:14,580
didn't really know anything about

3906
04:07:14,580 --> 04:07:16,800
ransomware well compared to today and

3907
04:07:16,800 --> 04:07:18,540
knew nothing about it but I was like

3908
04:07:18,540 --> 04:07:21,239
there is no way in hell that there are

3909
04:07:21,239 --> 04:07:24,359
20 000 new strains that are created from

3910
04:07:24,359 --> 04:07:26,340
scratch right just didn't really make

3911
04:07:26,340 --> 04:07:29,160
sense and when I started uh doing the

3912
04:07:29,160 --> 04:07:30,720
data collection I realized I was on to

3913
04:07:30,720 --> 04:07:32,760
something but back then I didn't know so

3914
04:07:32,760 --> 04:07:35,220
what I wanted to do was look at what

3915
04:07:35,220 --> 04:07:36,899
hasn't changed and focused on this

3916
04:07:36,899 --> 04:07:39,300
because the idea was if it hasn't

3917
04:07:39,300 --> 04:07:41,640
changed in 15 well and got like the

3918
04:07:41,640 --> 04:07:42,840
number of years that I was going to

3919
04:07:42,840 --> 04:07:43,739
study

3920
04:07:43,739 --> 04:07:46,680
then why would it change now why would

3921
04:07:46,680 --> 04:07:48,660
it change next and this is not again not

3922
04:07:48,660 --> 04:07:50,220
in a prediction it's more in a common

3923
04:07:50,220 --> 04:07:53,040
sense situation right and then I wanted

3924
04:07:53,040 --> 04:07:55,380
to know well if we can figure out what

3925
04:07:55,380 --> 04:07:57,840
hasn't changed can we put prioritize

3926
04:07:57,840 --> 04:08:00,479
counter measures to these weak spots

3927
04:08:00,479 --> 04:08:01,979
because then it might give us a chance

3928
04:08:01,979 --> 04:08:04,439
to equal the the weights of winning and

3929
04:08:04,439 --> 04:08:08,160
losing this was the idea

3930
04:08:08,160 --> 04:08:11,520
uh so this is the presentation of my

3931
04:08:11,520 --> 04:08:14,100
doctoral studies so the question was how

3932
04:08:14,100 --> 04:08:15,720
can Game Theory be applied to study the

3933
04:08:15,720 --> 04:08:18,239
evolution of ransomware and again like I

3934
04:08:18,239 --> 04:08:20,279
said the research aim was to identify

3935
04:08:20,279 --> 04:08:22,979
what hasn't changed in the techniques

3936
04:08:22,979 --> 04:08:25,620
the end game of this project will end up

3937
04:08:25,620 --> 04:08:28,080
while aiming to create an interactive

3938
04:08:28,080 --> 04:08:30,540
kill chain using

3939
04:08:30,540 --> 04:08:32,100
um well not a kill chain I'm not allowed

3940
04:08:32,100 --> 04:08:33,800
to say that so an interactive kill tree

3941
04:08:33,800 --> 04:08:36,180
using commonly used defensive Asian

3942
04:08:36,180 --> 04:08:38,279
techniques which I'm not gonna have time

3943
04:08:38,279 --> 04:08:39,920
to talk about today

3944
04:08:39,920 --> 04:08:42,120
but today what I'm going to focus on

3945
04:08:42,120 --> 04:08:44,699
mostly is on Discovery and defensivation

3946
04:08:44,699 --> 04:08:46,620
because it's what honestly interests me

3947
04:08:46,620 --> 04:08:48,300
the most

3948
04:08:48,300 --> 04:08:52,260
so the methodology so I gathered over uh

3949
04:08:52,260 --> 04:08:54,600
400 white papers and the reason I use

3950
04:08:54,600 --> 04:08:56,760
white papers to create this database was

3951
04:08:56,760 --> 04:08:59,220
because I'm a criminologist and not so

3952
04:08:59,220 --> 04:09:01,220
my malware analysis technique skills are

3953
04:09:01,220 --> 04:09:04,319
non-existent so I had to rely on the

3954
04:09:04,319 --> 04:09:06,840
white papers so what I did was I took

3955
04:09:06,840 --> 04:09:08,279
those white papers and I applied the

3956
04:09:08,279 --> 04:09:11,939
Mitra framework to them and tried to see

3957
04:09:11,939 --> 04:09:14,160
if I could study Evolution this way now

3958
04:09:14,160 --> 04:09:15,840
between you and I this was the wrong

3959
04:09:15,840 --> 04:09:17,160
call and I probably shouldn't have used

3960
04:09:17,160 --> 04:09:19,260
a Mitra framework but it was a

3961
04:09:19,260 --> 04:09:20,819
well-established model that I knew was

3962
04:09:20,819 --> 04:09:23,460
going to be accepted for my thesis uh

3963
04:09:23,460 --> 04:09:25,380
but I'll explain to you later on in the

3964
04:09:25,380 --> 04:09:26,880
limits why that was probably not the

3965
04:09:26,880 --> 04:09:28,800
right call so what I did with those

3966
04:09:28,800 --> 04:09:30,420
white papers is I collected not only the

3967
04:09:30,420 --> 04:09:32,699
Mitra IDs I collected also type of

3968
04:09:32,699 --> 04:09:35,220
encryption they were using

3969
04:09:35,220 --> 04:09:38,160
um their akas all no no known as they're

3970
04:09:38,160 --> 04:09:40,380
known associates and particularies that

3971
04:09:40,380 --> 04:09:42,180
they had I'm not gonna have time to talk

3972
04:09:42,180 --> 04:09:45,120
about all of this today but I honestly I

3973
04:09:45,120 --> 04:09:46,680
kind of vacuumed it up and grabbed as

3974
04:09:46,680 --> 04:09:48,420
much as I could and then played around

3975
04:09:48,420 --> 04:09:49,739
with the data

3976
04:09:49,739 --> 04:09:52,439
so I ended up with a sample of 116

3977
04:09:52,439 --> 04:09:56,460
strings uh 51 were cryptoware 65 were

3978
04:09:56,460 --> 04:09:59,520
leak wear and then I also red divided

3979
04:09:59,520 --> 04:10:01,260
for future testing the difference

3980
04:10:01,260 --> 04:10:03,420
between ransomware ransomware as a

3981
04:10:03,420 --> 04:10:06,660
service versus owned the sample is from

3982
04:10:06,660 --> 04:10:10,140
2016 to 2020. well I'm gonna say 2022

3983
04:10:10,140 --> 04:10:13,620
because I only have one for 2023. I do

3984
04:10:13,620 --> 04:10:15,899
after nordsec want to go back and

3985
04:10:15,899 --> 04:10:19,260
actually add a little bit more but I

3986
04:10:19,260 --> 04:10:21,060
also need to graduate so we'll see how

3987
04:10:21,060 --> 04:10:23,100
that goes but the original idea was

3988
04:10:23,100 --> 04:10:27,120
actually a 15-year sample and I don't

3989
04:10:27,120 --> 04:10:28,380
think I would have ever survived 15

3990
04:10:28,380 --> 04:10:30,560
years I didn't have enough white papers

3991
04:10:30,560 --> 04:10:33,120
and then I realized here that there's I

3992
04:10:33,120 --> 04:10:35,160
took some of you guys's white papers so

3993
04:10:35,160 --> 04:10:36,720
thank you so much for everyone who wrote

3994
04:10:36,720 --> 04:10:39,960
one I really appreciated it

3995
04:10:39,960 --> 04:10:41,819
um so the fun part the reason we're all

3996
04:10:41,819 --> 04:10:43,680
here right

3997
04:10:43,680 --> 04:10:46,319
so let's talk about some results that I

3998
04:10:46,319 --> 04:10:47,160
did

3999
04:10:47,160 --> 04:10:49,620
so I want to talk briefly about initial

4000
04:10:49,620 --> 04:10:51,720
access right because it's the entry

4001
04:10:51,720 --> 04:10:54,120
point and this is something that's not

4002
04:10:54,120 --> 04:10:55,859
going to come as a surprise

4003
04:10:55,859 --> 04:10:57,899
but fishing remained the most used

4004
04:10:57,899 --> 04:11:00,540
tactic for technique for uh initial

4005
04:11:00,540 --> 04:11:03,300
access and that was very stable per the

4006
04:11:03,300 --> 04:11:05,520
six years that I was studying so this is

4007
04:11:05,520 --> 04:11:07,140
good news and a bad news because the

4008
04:11:07,140 --> 04:11:09,660
good news is is because it it requires

4009
04:11:09,660 --> 04:11:12,000
an interaction from a game theory

4010
04:11:12,000 --> 04:11:13,859
perspective it teases the idea that it

4011
04:11:13,859 --> 04:11:16,140
can be stopped and now before we

4012
04:11:16,140 --> 04:11:17,880
collectively roll our eyes because I

4013
04:11:17,880 --> 04:11:19,620
said fishing can be stopped and we all

4014
04:11:19,620 --> 04:11:21,600
know most of us know that this is not

4015
04:11:21,600 --> 04:11:25,920
that simple uh I know I really know

4016
04:11:25,920 --> 04:11:27,600
um the idea is that game theory teases

4017
04:11:27,600 --> 04:11:29,819
this I don't know how realistic it is

4018
04:11:29,819 --> 04:11:32,220
considering how stable this been but we

4019
04:11:32,220 --> 04:11:34,340
can still continue to work on this

4020
04:11:34,340 --> 04:11:37,380
when fishing was not an option or wasn't

4021
04:11:37,380 --> 04:11:38,520
used

4022
04:11:38,520 --> 04:11:39,720
um

4023
04:11:39,720 --> 04:11:41,580
vulnerability exploitation was the

4024
04:11:41,580 --> 04:11:44,160
second one that was used the most it's

4025
04:11:44,160 --> 04:11:45,899
harder to do sometimes but they're not

4026
04:11:45,899 --> 04:11:48,479
dependent on users Behavior so that made

4027
04:11:48,479 --> 04:11:51,060
it a little bit simpler sometimes I

4028
04:11:51,060 --> 04:11:52,319
don't want to dwell on this too much

4029
04:11:52,319 --> 04:11:53,640
because I only have half an hour and

4030
04:11:53,640 --> 04:11:54,840
honestly I kind of want to geek out

4031
04:11:54,840 --> 04:11:56,880
about other things than fishing not that

4032
04:11:56,880 --> 04:11:58,319
there's anything wrong with it it's just

4033
04:11:58,319 --> 04:12:01,080
it's fishing I like funny things better

4034
04:12:01,080 --> 04:12:03,720
so then I started focusing more on

4035
04:12:03,720 --> 04:12:05,520
internal Discovery so when I first

4036
04:12:05,520 --> 04:12:07,680
started Gathering the data I wasn't

4037
04:12:07,680 --> 04:12:10,199
really doing any sort of analysis right

4038
04:12:10,199 --> 04:12:12,060
I was just kind of gathering up and

4039
04:12:12,060 --> 04:12:15,359
looking at it and what did draw my

4040
04:12:15,359 --> 04:12:17,460
attention to was Discovery so it

4041
04:12:17,460 --> 04:12:18,660
probably shouldn't have surprised me as

4042
04:12:18,660 --> 04:12:21,359
a CTI analyst but back then

4043
04:12:21,359 --> 04:12:23,699
I didn't know as much as I do now but

4044
04:12:23,699 --> 04:12:25,439
there was a lot of accidents put on

4045
04:12:25,439 --> 04:12:28,199
Discover internal Discovery and it made

4046
04:12:28,199 --> 04:12:31,020
sense later on because even though we

4047
04:12:31,020 --> 04:12:32,399
all kind of know what's inside our

4048
04:12:32,399 --> 04:12:33,660
infrastructure we don't know where

4049
04:12:33,660 --> 04:12:35,760
things are exactly it's kind of like if

4050
04:12:35,760 --> 04:12:37,739
you go rob a house you kind of know that

4051
04:12:37,739 --> 04:12:39,180
there's going to be you know certain

4052
04:12:39,180 --> 04:12:40,739
money or Pharmaceuticals and bathroom

4053
04:12:40,739 --> 04:12:42,060
but you don't know which bathroom and

4054
04:12:42,060 --> 04:12:44,340
you don't know where the the safe is you

4055
04:12:44,340 --> 04:12:45,600
have good ideas it's probably going to

4056
04:12:45,600 --> 04:12:47,399
be in the office but do you really know

4057
04:12:47,399 --> 04:12:49,560
where the office is from the outside so

4058
04:12:49,560 --> 04:12:51,380
this was kind of the same logic right

4059
04:12:51,380 --> 04:12:54,720
and as a CTI analyst I got asked a lot

4060
04:12:54,720 --> 04:12:56,760
of times like by clients that were just

4061
04:12:56,760 --> 04:12:59,340
like do you know what they took right I

4062
04:12:59,340 --> 04:13:00,720
got ransomed that they took they

4063
04:13:00,720 --> 04:13:01,859
encrypted everything do you know what

4064
04:13:01,859 --> 04:13:04,319
they took and my answer was always the

4065
04:13:04,319 --> 04:13:06,660
same whatever you're afraid that they

4066
04:13:06,660 --> 04:13:08,520
took that's what they took the whole

4067
04:13:08,520 --> 04:13:09,720
point of a ransomware you have to make

4068
04:13:09,720 --> 04:13:12,660
it hurt right if they didn't take you

4069
04:13:12,660 --> 04:13:14,760
know what hurts the most or what you're

4070
04:13:14,760 --> 04:13:17,040
most sometimes ashamed of then it

4071
04:13:17,040 --> 04:13:18,600
wouldn't really work

4072
04:13:18,600 --> 04:13:21,239
my point in all of this is that you need

4073
04:13:21,239 --> 04:13:23,160
to know what's in your infrastructure

4074
04:13:23,160 --> 04:13:25,080
you need to know where things are and

4075
04:13:25,080 --> 04:13:27,300
what's valuable to you because they will

4076
04:13:27,300 --> 04:13:29,880
know it for you we've seen an increase

4077
04:13:29,880 --> 04:13:32,160
of ransomware groups that are tailoring

4078
04:13:32,160 --> 04:13:35,220
their Ransom demand to uh their

4079
04:13:35,220 --> 04:13:37,439
insurance policies because that

4080
04:13:37,439 --> 04:13:39,540
increased their odds of payment so they

4081
04:13:39,540 --> 04:13:41,580
are looking right

4082
04:13:41,580 --> 04:13:45,000
but what it also tells me was that from

4083
04:13:45,000 --> 04:13:47,100
a game theory perspective is if internal

4084
04:13:47,100 --> 04:13:50,040
Discovery is really important to them it

4085
04:13:50,040 --> 04:13:51,779
can also be leveraged for Defenders

4086
04:13:51,779 --> 04:13:55,680
right so if you prioritize what you need

4087
04:13:55,680 --> 04:13:58,020
to be to be protected at all costs right

4088
04:13:58,020 --> 04:13:59,880
and like I know we always say you need

4089
04:13:59,880 --> 04:14:01,620
protect everything but let's be

4090
04:14:01,620 --> 04:14:04,140
realistic no one does but you need to

4091
04:14:04,140 --> 04:14:06,120
know what the gold is like the the pure

4092
04:14:06,120 --> 04:14:07,380
Jewels you need to know what it is and

4093
04:14:07,380 --> 04:14:09,840
how to protect it and put extra layer

4094
04:14:09,840 --> 04:14:12,420
around those and as a by the way your

4095
04:14:12,420 --> 04:14:15,000
employees data falls under that category

4096
04:14:15,000 --> 04:14:18,180
please for all of the employees

4097
04:14:18,180 --> 04:14:20,340
um so this is what you're going to want

4098
04:14:20,340 --> 04:14:23,100
to do the idea is if they're taking

4099
04:14:23,100 --> 04:14:25,439
their sweet time with internal Discovery

4100
04:14:25,439 --> 04:14:28,319
it gives you a chance to put it like a

4101
04:14:28,319 --> 04:14:31,080
trip wire or some sort to be able to

4102
04:14:31,080 --> 04:14:32,939
protect yourself or at least throw one

4103
04:14:32,939 --> 04:14:35,279
Hail Mary to protect yourself but I'm

4104
04:14:35,279 --> 04:14:36,479
getting ahead of myself and I'll talk

4105
04:14:36,479 --> 04:14:38,399
about this a little later

4106
04:14:38,399 --> 04:14:42,000
so this is from the sample the discovery

4107
04:14:42,000 --> 04:14:44,040
techniques that were most used in that

4108
04:14:44,040 --> 04:14:47,279
in the sample that I had and as you can

4109
04:14:47,279 --> 04:14:49,319
see that it's a lot of looking around on

4110
04:14:49,319 --> 04:14:51,359
where things are how to move around the

4111
04:14:51,359 --> 04:14:53,939
infrastructure and looking for documents

4112
04:14:53,939 --> 04:14:58,080
so basically one of the main things that

4113
04:14:58,080 --> 04:15:00,239
I saw was

4114
04:15:00,239 --> 04:15:02,040
um that there were also looking for

4115
04:15:02,040 --> 04:15:04,859
certain files extension files right

4116
04:15:04,859 --> 04:15:07,800
they're looking for the Excel files in

4117
04:15:07,800 --> 04:15:10,380
some Word document and then the ones

4118
04:15:10,380 --> 04:15:12,899
that include things like Revenue 2022

4119
04:15:12,899 --> 04:15:14,399
that you know is going to be on the

4120
04:15:14,399 --> 04:15:15,779
OneDrive somewhere and it's going to be

4121
04:15:15,779 --> 04:15:18,660
shared across multiple people you want

4122
04:15:18,660 --> 04:15:19,979
that right they're going to be looking

4123
04:15:19,979 --> 04:15:21,300
for it they're going to be also looking

4124
04:15:21,300 --> 04:15:22,920
at ways to travel within your

4125
04:15:22,920 --> 04:15:25,580
infrastructure

4126
04:15:25,620 --> 04:15:28,500
so defensivations okay so defensivation

4127
04:15:28,500 --> 04:15:32,399
was a big thing because I always thought

4128
04:15:32,399 --> 04:15:33,960
it was the battleground of Game Theory

4129
04:15:33,960 --> 04:15:35,760
right this is where the main interaction

4130
04:15:35,760 --> 04:15:38,040
is where you're testing your defense

4131
04:15:38,040 --> 04:15:39,479
against your attack

4132
04:15:39,479 --> 04:15:41,640
and then turns out this is kind of where

4133
04:15:41,640 --> 04:15:44,279
things went downhill for me

4134
04:15:44,279 --> 04:15:45,840
this is the distribution of

4135
04:15:45,840 --> 04:15:48,420
defensivision techniques in my sample

4136
04:15:48,420 --> 04:15:52,260
uh this sucked because I had too many

4137
04:15:52,260 --> 04:15:54,600
strategies that weren't recurring so

4138
04:15:54,600 --> 04:15:56,100
when you're looking at something that

4139
04:15:56,100 --> 04:15:58,080
isn't changing

4140
04:15:58,080 --> 04:16:01,800
strategies that are once out of 116 is

4141
04:16:01,800 --> 04:16:03,479
not good because then you can't really

4142
04:16:03,479 --> 04:16:06,000
draw any conclusion from this so when

4143
04:16:06,000 --> 04:16:08,479
this came out the first time

4144
04:16:08,479 --> 04:16:12,000
I uh honestly I was like I think I'm

4145
04:16:12,000 --> 04:16:13,920
gonna have to change this project and

4146
04:16:13,920 --> 04:16:15,420
the pen testers in my life were right

4147
04:16:15,420 --> 04:16:18,000
and I can't do this but then I didn't I

4148
04:16:18,000 --> 04:16:19,260
kept going and then turns out I was

4149
04:16:19,260 --> 04:16:21,420
still right but my point is with

4150
04:16:21,420 --> 04:16:22,859
something like this you're kind of like

4151
04:16:22,859 --> 04:16:24,840
okay so there's a lot of possibility of

4152
04:16:24,840 --> 04:16:28,560
Defense defensive Asian but then why is

4153
04:16:28,560 --> 04:16:31,560
there not more so then I decided to do a

4154
04:16:31,560 --> 04:16:34,380
cluster analysis so cluster analysis is

4155
04:16:34,380 --> 04:16:37,500
grouping sets of object in a way that

4156
04:16:37,500 --> 04:16:39,479
they group the same people together that

4157
04:16:39,479 --> 04:16:41,460
are more similar and different in

4158
04:16:41,460 --> 04:16:43,020
different groups I guess

4159
04:16:43,020 --> 04:16:44,880
one of the main problems I had is I had

4160
04:16:44,880 --> 04:16:46,439
too many variables so the first few

4161
04:16:46,439 --> 04:16:48,600
times I ran that I tried running this

4162
04:16:48,600 --> 04:16:51,779
this test uh the software crashed twice

4163
04:16:51,779 --> 04:16:53,819
and then I realized the mistake was I

4164
04:16:53,819 --> 04:16:56,460
had too many so I had to cut down and

4165
04:16:56,460 --> 04:16:58,500
this is where things get tricky in in

4166
04:16:58,500 --> 04:17:00,840
research is that you can just randomly

4167
04:17:00,840 --> 04:17:02,819
select what data you want because then

4168
04:17:02,819 --> 04:17:04,380
that's just not fair and you're playing

4169
04:17:04,380 --> 04:17:05,760
with data right it's garbage isn't

4170
04:17:05,760 --> 04:17:06,779
garbage out

4171
04:17:06,779 --> 04:17:09,720
so what I had to do is think about it in

4172
04:17:09,720 --> 04:17:11,399
a way I'm like okay so if my goal is

4173
04:17:11,399 --> 04:17:13,920
finding out what hasn't changed then I

4174
04:17:13,920 --> 04:17:16,699
need to pick the top 15

4175
04:17:16,699 --> 04:17:19,080
strategies that were most used and as

4176
04:17:19,080 --> 04:17:20,880
you can see even when I did this the

4177
04:17:20,880 --> 04:17:23,220
model is still low or Fair it's still

4178
04:17:23,220 --> 04:17:24,720
not great because I had too many

4179
04:17:24,720 --> 04:17:27,720
variables now I could continue to play

4180
04:17:27,720 --> 04:17:29,160
with it but then that just wouldn't be

4181
04:17:29,160 --> 04:17:31,439
ethical and as much as I enjoy blurring

4182
04:17:31,439 --> 04:17:33,300
the lines of hacking this is not one of

4183
04:17:33,300 --> 04:17:34,319
those times

4184
04:17:34,319 --> 04:17:35,640
so

4185
04:17:35,640 --> 04:17:37,859
I got two clusters I got two groups my

4186
04:17:37,859 --> 04:17:41,520
sample was divided in two I have

4187
04:17:41,520 --> 04:17:44,580
um I got no time to evade at 56 and 44

4188
04:17:44,580 --> 04:17:47,399
was Catch Me If You Can I work full time

4189
04:17:47,399 --> 04:17:49,020
and I do a PhD full-time so I find the

4190
04:17:49,020 --> 04:17:51,000
fun where I can which is naming stuff

4191
04:17:51,000 --> 04:17:53,880
and names that I probably shouldn't

4192
04:17:53,880 --> 04:17:57,300
so let's look at them uh let's look at

4193
04:17:57,300 --> 04:17:59,880
how they're you know the main particular

4194
04:17:59,880 --> 04:18:02,699
use of each group and what I found was

4195
04:18:02,699 --> 04:18:05,640
it was pretty surprising because I had

4196
04:18:05,640 --> 04:18:08,000
really thought that I was gonna be

4197
04:18:08,000 --> 04:18:10,620
facing groups with a lot more strategy

4198
04:18:10,620 --> 04:18:12,359
especially for the I got no time to

4199
04:18:12,359 --> 04:18:16,020
evade and this is a group at 56 percent

4200
04:18:16,020 --> 04:18:18,359
right so it's most of my sample well

4201
04:18:18,359 --> 04:18:20,580
above average well above half

4202
04:18:20,580 --> 04:18:24,840
and I kept thinking why right why would

4203
04:18:24,840 --> 04:18:27,120
I have a group with so the majority

4204
04:18:27,120 --> 04:18:29,640
hasn't done much and then I got me into

4205
04:18:29,640 --> 04:18:31,080
thinking they're possible there are

4206
04:18:31,080 --> 04:18:33,180
multiple possibilities for it one of

4207
04:18:33,180 --> 04:18:36,660
them is that my framework is not working

4208
04:18:36,660 --> 04:18:39,540
that this the the techniques that

4209
04:18:39,540 --> 04:18:40,739
they're using are so new or

4210
04:18:40,739 --> 04:18:42,180
sophisticated that the Mitra didn't

4211
04:18:42,180 --> 04:18:44,939
include them which is a possibility the

4212
04:18:44,939 --> 04:18:48,120
second option was maybe they do such a

4213
04:18:48,120 --> 04:18:50,220
good job at internal discovery that they

4214
04:18:50,220 --> 04:18:52,319
know in advance what to avoid and don't

4215
04:18:52,319 --> 04:18:54,000
need to use defensive Asian techniques

4216
04:18:54,000 --> 04:18:55,859
or they'll focus on basically what they

4217
04:18:55,859 --> 04:18:57,779
really can but because they took their

4218
04:18:57,779 --> 04:18:59,580
time and mapping out and sniffing things

4219
04:18:59,580 --> 04:19:01,859
they didn't have to evade the third

4220
04:19:01,859 --> 04:19:03,120
option

4221
04:19:03,120 --> 04:19:06,180
and this is maybe more of the CTA

4222
04:19:06,180 --> 04:19:09,359
analyst speaking but this is the third

4223
04:19:09,359 --> 04:19:12,720
option was well in order to event evade

4224
04:19:12,720 --> 04:19:14,520
defenses you need defenses in the first

4225
04:19:14,520 --> 04:19:16,319
place so maybe the victims didn't have

4226
04:19:16,319 --> 04:19:18,180
any countermeasures in place and

4227
04:19:18,180 --> 04:19:19,800
therefore they didn't need to avoid

4228
04:19:19,800 --> 04:19:22,380
evade much defenses

4229
04:19:22,380 --> 04:19:24,840
the second group which is the smaller

4230
04:19:24,840 --> 04:19:26,880
one The Catch Me If You Can had their

4231
04:19:26,880 --> 04:19:28,920
hands in multiple types of strategies a

4232
04:19:28,920 --> 04:19:31,859
little bit everywhere right so I for

4233
04:19:31,859 --> 04:19:34,140
them I was I I kind of got the idea that

4234
04:19:34,140 --> 04:19:36,180
they were a little bit more teasing just

4235
04:19:36,180 --> 04:19:37,739
going doing a little bit of everything

4236
04:19:37,739 --> 04:19:40,560
at once whereas I got no time to evade

4237
04:19:40,560 --> 04:19:43,319
really focus on hiding their code and

4238
04:19:43,319 --> 04:19:45,540
their presence in their code so I got

4239
04:19:45,540 --> 04:19:48,000
more of a weasel kind of type for them

4240
04:19:48,000 --> 04:19:50,699
because the devil is in the details and

4241
04:19:50,699 --> 04:19:52,859
if you're not if the defense is not

4242
04:19:52,859 --> 04:19:55,100
looking in the logs for any small little

4243
04:19:55,100 --> 04:19:57,720
you know abnormalities they would

4244
04:19:57,720 --> 04:19:59,699
probably miss it

4245
04:19:59,699 --> 04:20:00,840
so

4246
04:20:00,840 --> 04:20:03,180
this is what I got from this the common

4247
04:20:03,180 --> 04:20:07,080
strategies so this was what both group

4248
04:20:07,080 --> 04:20:09,779
had in common and it was a lot like they

4249
04:20:09,779 --> 04:20:12,660
both had these strategies multiple times

4250
04:20:12,660 --> 04:20:14,580
at a higher rate I guess

4251
04:20:14,580 --> 04:20:16,680
and so that's why I wanted to talk about

4252
04:20:16,680 --> 04:20:19,739
them so what I saw from this is that the

4253
04:20:19,739 --> 04:20:22,439
core real defensive Asian laid a lot on

4254
04:20:22,439 --> 04:20:25,739
avoiding sandbox so sandbox evasion and

4255
04:20:25,739 --> 04:20:28,680
modifying uh well disable or modifying

4256
04:20:28,680 --> 04:20:30,359
the firewall so these were more

4257
04:20:30,359 --> 04:20:32,220
defensive Asians that were more like

4258
04:20:32,220 --> 04:20:35,520
direct to evading defenses whereas the

4259
04:20:35,520 --> 04:20:36,960
others even though they're considered

4260
04:20:36,960 --> 04:20:39,060
defensive Asian we're a little bit more

4261
04:20:39,060 --> 04:20:41,399
on like trying to set yourself up for

4262
04:20:41,399 --> 04:20:43,140
your next step right so they're looking

4263
04:20:43,140 --> 04:20:46,020
at ways to move around for lateral

4264
04:20:46,020 --> 04:20:49,199
movement persistence and uh elevation of

4265
04:20:49,199 --> 04:20:51,000
privileges which I thought was

4266
04:20:51,000 --> 04:20:53,580
interesting because when I thought of

4267
04:20:53,580 --> 04:20:55,080
defensivation I really thought it was

4268
04:20:55,080 --> 04:20:57,120
attacking the differences but then turns

4269
04:20:57,120 --> 04:20:59,100
out it was also just by kind of

4270
04:20:59,100 --> 04:21:01,439
weaseling out of them too

4271
04:21:01,439 --> 04:21:03,899
so time flies when we're having fun so

4272
04:21:03,899 --> 04:21:05,340
I'm gonna keep this short so this is

4273
04:21:05,340 --> 04:21:07,319
where I kind of am

4274
04:21:07,319 --> 04:21:10,199
um I forgot to mention two weeks ago my

4275
04:21:10,199 --> 04:21:11,760
partner dropped his coffee all over my

4276
04:21:11,760 --> 04:21:14,279
laptop and I lost four four months of

4277
04:21:14,279 --> 04:21:16,500
research and so I had to restart

4278
04:21:16,500 --> 04:21:18,239
everything in the last two weeks so this

4279
04:21:18,239 --> 04:21:20,279
is the result of this so this is why

4280
04:21:20,279 --> 04:21:23,340
some of the results are not as pushed as

4281
04:21:23,340 --> 04:21:25,199
I had intended it to be because I didn't

4282
04:21:25,199 --> 04:21:26,460
have time to finish

4283
04:21:26,460 --> 04:21:28,380
so

4284
04:21:28,380 --> 04:21:30,960
The attacker's Playbook so I know I've

4285
04:21:30,960 --> 04:21:32,460
been quick on the results but honestly I

4286
04:21:32,460 --> 04:21:34,020
can really geek out about this for hours

4287
04:21:34,020 --> 04:21:36,420
so I'll be around today and tomorrow so

4288
04:21:36,420 --> 04:21:37,800
if you have more thoughts or questions

4289
04:21:37,800 --> 04:21:40,080
or anything I'll be very happy to geek

4290
04:21:40,080 --> 04:21:41,520
out about this more

4291
04:21:41,520 --> 04:21:44,220
so let's go with the short conclusion on

4292
04:21:44,220 --> 04:21:46,439
this so in an Ideal World we'd focus on

4293
04:21:46,439 --> 04:21:49,680
thread actors just not getting initial

4294
04:21:49,680 --> 04:21:51,960
access right in the ideal world we would

4295
04:21:51,960 --> 04:21:54,060
all have such strong walls that nothing

4296
04:21:54,060 --> 04:21:56,939
could get in but honestly that's just

4297
04:21:56,939 --> 04:21:59,100
not the reality and like sure we could

4298
04:21:59,100 --> 04:22:00,800
you know increase the security around

4299
04:22:00,800 --> 04:22:03,840
emails teams slack LinkedIn and all of

4300
04:22:03,840 --> 04:22:06,060
this it would help but I don't think it

4301
04:22:06,060 --> 04:22:09,120
would stop anything so I rather focus on

4302
04:22:09,120 --> 04:22:12,120
limiting damages and making the job of

4303
04:22:12,120 --> 04:22:14,880
hacking harder than it has to be because

4304
04:22:14,880 --> 04:22:16,500
then a lot of threat actors are just

4305
04:22:16,500 --> 04:22:18,779
gonna be like ah whatever I'm not

4306
04:22:18,779 --> 04:22:21,060
wasting my time on this right so that

4307
04:22:21,060 --> 04:22:22,739
brings me back to discover and defensive

4308
04:22:22,739 --> 04:22:24,960
Asians so what I learned is that the

4309
04:22:24,960 --> 04:22:26,760
importance of Discovery even though it's

4310
04:22:26,760 --> 04:22:29,279
logical defense could use this to their

4311
04:22:29,279 --> 04:22:31,620
advantage because threat actors may know

4312
04:22:31,620 --> 04:22:33,720
what they want to find but they don't

4313
04:22:33,720 --> 04:22:35,819
know exactly where it is right and this

4314
04:22:35,819 --> 04:22:37,920
is where you can mess with them so you

4315
04:22:37,920 --> 04:22:40,680
can make that job a lot harder longer

4316
04:22:40,680 --> 04:22:42,779
and with more traps so in criminology we

4317
04:22:42,779 --> 04:22:44,880
suspect that the longer the crime takes

4318
04:22:44,880 --> 04:22:47,760
to be committed the more chances of

4319
04:22:47,760 --> 04:22:49,680
Naturals well not natural selection but

4320
04:22:49,680 --> 04:22:52,620
of natural ways to be stopped right you

4321
04:22:52,620 --> 04:22:54,300
have more chances of getting caught more

4322
04:22:54,300 --> 04:22:56,340
chances of something going wrong so why

4323
04:22:56,340 --> 04:22:58,319
not apply this to the Discovery stage

4324
04:22:58,319 --> 04:22:59,220
right

4325
04:22:59,220 --> 04:23:02,399
fooled them make troughs and traps that

4326
04:23:02,399 --> 04:23:04,439
can give you enough time to protect the

4327
04:23:04,439 --> 04:23:07,979
jewels so I was talking to one of my

4328
04:23:07,979 --> 04:23:10,140
favorite pen tester of all time Adrian

4329
04:23:10,140 --> 04:23:12,720
who's right here today and I was asking

4330
04:23:12,720 --> 04:23:14,760
him about honeypots because I know honey

4331
04:23:14,760 --> 04:23:16,979
pots are you can see them from miles

4332
04:23:16,979 --> 04:23:19,979
away so I wanted to what's the

4333
04:23:19,979 --> 04:23:21,660
alternative right modern day alternative

4334
04:23:21,660 --> 04:23:24,120
and he was talking to me about putting

4335
04:23:24,120 --> 04:23:26,640
vulnerable switch devices and

4336
04:23:26,640 --> 04:23:29,160
pre-selected spot in order to use them

4337
04:23:29,160 --> 04:23:30,960
to raise an alarm that would give you

4338
04:23:30,960 --> 04:23:34,800
enough time to protect the jewels I

4339
04:23:34,800 --> 04:23:36,359
watch an episode I listen to an episode

4340
04:23:36,359 --> 04:23:38,100
of darknet diaries two days after that

4341
04:23:38,100 --> 04:23:39,540
conversation and that product was

4342
04:23:39,540 --> 04:23:41,160
already out there so I guess I was on to

4343
04:23:41,160 --> 04:23:42,960
something

4344
04:23:42,960 --> 04:23:45,359
so the limits of this paper I'm limited

4345
04:23:45,359 --> 04:23:47,660
by what was in the white papers

4346
04:23:47,660 --> 04:23:50,939
so if I didn't have enough information I

4347
04:23:50,939 --> 04:23:53,760
kind of disregarded the strain because I

4348
04:23:53,760 --> 04:23:55,380
couldn't do much with it I am I was

4349
04:23:55,380 --> 04:23:57,000
limited on that side

4350
04:23:57,000 --> 04:23:59,040
ransomware customizable and they do

4351
04:23:59,040 --> 04:24:01,739
change depending on their target so I

4352
04:24:01,739 --> 04:24:04,739
need to be clear that it's 116 strains

4353
04:24:04,739 --> 04:24:07,800
that were seen at least once but it

4354
04:24:07,800 --> 04:24:11,160
doesn't mean that I got the full I don't

4355
04:24:11,160 --> 04:24:13,260
know like lock bit 3's full ammo right

4356
04:24:13,260 --> 04:24:15,000
because they change with their targets

4357
04:24:15,000 --> 04:24:16,800
so the result cannot be fully

4358
04:24:16,800 --> 04:24:18,779
generalized but it is telling us at

4359
04:24:18,779 --> 04:24:20,819
least some trends that should not you

4360
04:24:20,819 --> 04:24:23,100
know be ignored either the Mitra

4361
04:24:23,100 --> 04:24:25,739
framework is great but when you're

4362
04:24:25,739 --> 04:24:28,380
trying to analyze it for evolution the

4363
04:24:28,380 --> 04:24:30,420
newer papers included a lot of like

4364
04:24:30,420 --> 04:24:32,100
strategies that were not in the Mitra

4365
04:24:32,100 --> 04:24:34,439
framework that I had to add in myself

4366
04:24:34,439 --> 04:24:38,040
which then became kind of a problem

4367
04:24:38,040 --> 04:24:40,560
so the next step is to continue to

4368
04:24:40,560 --> 04:24:42,239
analyze the strategies against the years

4369
04:24:42,239 --> 04:24:43,739
but this time I'm going to do it from a

4370
04:24:43,739 --> 04:24:46,380
qualitative perspective because uh based

4371
04:24:46,380 --> 04:24:47,819
on stats I wasn't that much difference

4372
04:24:47,819 --> 04:24:49,920
and it was hard to handle so again

4373
04:24:49,920 --> 04:24:52,859
Devil's in the details right then I'm

4374
04:24:52,859 --> 04:24:54,540
going to be mapping out the strategies

4375
04:24:54,540 --> 04:24:56,939
in the kill tree and then but only focus

4376
04:24:56,939 --> 04:24:58,500
on defensivation and that might actually

4377
04:24:58,500 --> 04:24:59,939
include Discovery yet but I haven't

4378
04:24:59,939 --> 04:25:02,160
talked to my supervisor about it and

4379
04:25:02,160 --> 04:25:03,840
then the final step is yeah I gotta

4380
04:25:03,840 --> 04:25:05,040
write the paper I gotta write the

4381
04:25:05,040 --> 04:25:07,319
dissertation and defend it so hopefully

4382
04:25:07,319 --> 04:25:10,560
by uh next may I will have something uh

4383
04:25:10,560 --> 04:25:12,120
done but

4384
04:25:12,120 --> 04:25:13,920
life you know

4385
04:25:13,920 --> 04:25:15,720
so on this

4386
04:25:15,720 --> 04:25:18,180
I want to thank you all for coming to my

4387
04:25:18,180 --> 04:25:20,460
talk and this is well if you want to

4388
04:25:20,460 --> 04:25:22,260
reach me if you want to talk to me I'll

4389
04:25:22,260 --> 04:25:25,439
be around I'm volunteering tonight and

4390
04:25:25,439 --> 04:25:27,420
tomorrow and this is my best friend

4391
04:25:27,420 --> 04:25:29,220
Kevin for those who don't like cats so I

4392
04:25:29,220 --> 04:25:30,779
put a dog at the end to make sure that

4393
04:25:30,779 --> 04:25:32,640
you would have someone he's living his

4394
04:25:32,640 --> 04:25:35,520
best life in Scotland and he is thriving

4395
04:25:35,520 --> 04:25:37,199
so I thought you would enjoy a dog at

4396
04:25:37,199 --> 04:25:38,699
the end of this kind of grim

4397
04:25:38,699 --> 04:25:40,680
presentation even though there's a lot

4398
04:25:40,680 --> 04:25:43,080
of pink so thank you so much for your

4399
04:25:43,080 --> 04:25:45,319
time

4400
04:25:45,830 --> 04:25:49,989
[Applause]

all right thank you so much Vicky if you

4403
04:25:56,520 --> 04:25:59,399
have any questions uh to Vicky We'll be

4404
04:25:59,399 --> 04:26:02,399
asking them afterwards you can try to

4405
04:26:02,399 --> 04:26:04,500
scan this beautiful QR code and then

4406
04:26:04,500 --> 04:26:06,000
write your questions we'll review them

4407
04:26:06,000 --> 04:26:07,800
to make sure that they're acceptable I

4408
04:26:07,800 --> 04:26:09,479
have no doubt and then after that we'll

4409
04:26:09,479 --> 04:26:11,640
ask them during the

4410
04:26:11,640 --> 04:26:14,399
do you want to set up yeah

4411
04:26:14,399 --> 04:26:17,599

okay so we'll start with our second Talk

4421
04:32:57,899 --> 04:33:00,420
of the day with andrean please take a

4422

online has a PHD in criminology for

4424
04:33:04,080 --> 04:33:06,778
University of Montreal and works as a

4425
04:33:06,778 --> 04:33:08,400
cyber security researcher at gosecure

4426
04:33:08,400 --> 04:33:10,919
acting as the social scientist of the

4427
04:33:10,919 --> 04:33:12,359
team she's interested in online

4428
04:33:12,359 --> 04:33:14,879
attackers Behavior she's an experienced

4429
04:33:14,879 --> 04:33:17,099
presenter with over 38 academic

4430
04:33:17,099 --> 04:33:22,379
conference are we still at 38 42 42 with

4431
04:33:22,379 --> 04:33:24,419
today 45 I don't know I lost the con

4432
04:33:24,419 --> 04:33:27,539
with over 45 conferences and is now

4433
04:33:27,539 --> 04:33:30,240
focusing on the infosec field so if you

4434
04:33:30,240 --> 04:33:31,680
want to know what to do when you haven't

4435
04:33:31,680 --> 04:33:34,080
what you can infer from rdb honeypots

4436
04:33:34,080 --> 04:33:36,660
please stay and welcome Marianne thank

4437
04:33:36,660 --> 04:33:38,778
you

4438
04:33:40,859 --> 04:33:42,778
things

4439
04:33:42,778 --> 04:33:45,719
I wish to say thank you to Hugo to

4440
04:33:45,719 --> 04:33:47,820
schedule me in the afternoon because

4441
04:33:47,820 --> 04:33:49,740
this morning was hard after the party

4442
04:33:49,740 --> 04:33:51,778
yesterday were you there it was a good

4443
04:33:51,778 --> 04:33:53,580
party I loved it

4444
04:33:53,580 --> 04:33:56,699
um so yeah I'm here to talk about the

4445
04:33:56,699 --> 04:33:59,900
extent to which a human is implicated

4446
04:33:59,900 --> 04:34:03,480
behind automated attack and on RDP

4447
04:34:03,480 --> 04:34:04,980
systems

4448
04:34:04,980 --> 04:34:08,039
um so you know I see a human implication

4449
04:34:08,039 --> 04:34:10,919
on a Continuum so you can

4450
04:34:10,919 --> 04:34:14,160
launch an automatic attack a very basic

4451
04:34:14,160 --> 04:34:17,340
one and you can think more about your

4452
04:34:17,340 --> 04:34:19,919
your attack and make it a bit more

4453
04:34:19,919 --> 04:34:22,379
sophisticated so this is the type of

4454
04:34:22,379 --> 04:34:24,660
Continuum I'm I'm looking at or trying

4455
04:34:24,660 --> 04:34:27,958
to build to understand the attacker

4456
04:34:27,958 --> 04:34:29,278
strategies better

4457
04:34:29,278 --> 04:34:32,520
so masaka already introduced me so I

4458
04:34:32,520 --> 04:34:34,740
don't have to to do it all over again so

4459
04:34:34,740 --> 04:34:37,141
I'm a cyber security cyber security

4460
04:34:37,141 --> 04:34:40,039
researcher at go secure now

4461
04:34:40,039 --> 04:34:43,320
and I'm also involved in the north Tech

4462
04:34:43,320 --> 04:34:46,259
organization so I swap my red t-shirt

4463
04:34:46,259 --> 04:34:48,240
for just for this presentation and then

4464
04:34:48,240 --> 04:34:50,340
I'll put it back on

4465
04:34:50,340 --> 04:34:53,879
um and I'm also part of the of the

4466
04:34:53,879 --> 04:34:56,539
research group on open source

4467
04:34:56,539 --> 04:34:59,099
at the University of Montreal as a

4468
04:34:59,099 --> 04:35:00,680
scientific director so

4469
04:35:00,680 --> 04:35:04,080
a lot of Engagement a lot of fun

4470
04:35:04,080 --> 04:35:06,299
I like it so the objective of our

4471
04:35:06,299 --> 04:35:08,160
research program so not just the

4472
04:35:08,160 --> 04:35:10,259
research I'm presenting today but also

4473
04:35:10,259 --> 04:35:13,379
like all the other research I do with my

4474
04:35:13,379 --> 04:35:15,840
colleagues is to understand that

4475
04:35:15,840 --> 04:35:18,118
accurate strategies to share

4476
04:35:18,118 --> 04:35:21,080
hopefully to share a prevention advice

4477
04:35:21,080 --> 04:35:24,000
and also to fight again attackers

4478
04:35:24,000 --> 04:35:26,820
anonymization because it's hard to

4479
04:35:26,820 --> 04:35:28,859
really de-anonymize an attacker with a

4480
04:35:28,859 --> 04:35:30,599
name and an address and this like we're

4481
04:35:30,599 --> 04:35:33,000
not police right so you it's not in our

4482
04:35:33,000 --> 04:35:35,400
interest to do that to do that but we

4483
04:35:35,400 --> 04:35:37,859
want to fight against their kind of

4484
04:35:37,859 --> 04:35:42,359
anonymization just to we are to go as

4485
04:35:42,359 --> 04:35:45,958
far as we can to try to identify what

4486
04:35:45,958 --> 04:35:48,840
are their strategies and who are they we

4487
04:35:48,840 --> 04:35:50,278
want to

4488
04:35:50,278 --> 04:35:53,278
scare them so they have to change their

4489
04:35:53,278 --> 04:35:56,641
strategies and and do like find other

4490
04:35:56,641 --> 04:36:00,599
ways and work harder to try to uh to

4491
04:36:00,599 --> 04:36:03,660
attack in order to increase their cost

4492
04:36:03,660 --> 04:36:06,299
right in the attack

4493
04:36:06,299 --> 04:36:10,020
the calculation of benefits versus cost

4494
04:36:10,020 --> 04:36:14,580
so the agenda for today I'll just

4495
04:36:14,580 --> 04:36:16,618
explain very quickly what is a remote

4496
04:36:16,618 --> 04:36:18,480
desktop protocol just to make sure we

4497
04:36:18,480 --> 04:36:22,438
are on the same page and then I'll show

4498
04:36:22,438 --> 04:36:24,539
you well explain the the only part that

4499
04:36:24,539 --> 04:36:27,539
we used to collect the data

4500
04:36:27,539 --> 04:36:30,000
um and I'll show you the what the data

4501
04:36:30,000 --> 04:36:31,919
we have analyzed for this presentation

4502
04:36:31,919 --> 04:36:35,160
for This research project and I'll show

4503
04:36:35,160 --> 04:36:37,500
you the indicators

4504
04:36:37,500 --> 04:36:40,320
of human behavior versus machine-like

4505
04:36:40,320 --> 04:36:44,278
behavior and how can this aggregated

4506
04:36:44,278 --> 04:36:47,699
together can do can result into an

4507
04:36:47,699 --> 04:36:49,500
engagement score a human engagement

4508
04:36:49,500 --> 04:36:51,980
score

4509
04:36:52,039 --> 04:36:55,618
so first remote desktop protocol is a

4510
04:36:55,618 --> 04:36:57,480
Microsoft protocol allowing users to

4511
04:36:57,480 --> 04:37:00,719
access the graphical enter interface of

4512
04:37:00,719 --> 04:37:02,759
uh remote computers

4513
04:37:02,759 --> 04:37:04,379
so you know with the shift to remote

4514
04:37:04,379 --> 04:37:07,020
work after after the pandemic uh

4515
04:37:07,020 --> 04:37:08,759
companies have relied on remote access

4516
04:37:08,759 --> 04:37:11,099
tool to manage corporate devices and

4517
04:37:11,099 --> 04:37:13,680
keep operation running I'm sure there's

4518
04:37:13,680 --> 04:37:18,061
a lot of you that use some type of

4519
04:37:18,061 --> 04:37:21,599
remote remote protocol to access your

4520
04:37:21,599 --> 04:37:22,799
work files

4521
04:37:22,799 --> 04:37:26,160
and well there's less security aware

4522
04:37:26,160 --> 04:37:29,180
organization that even exposed their RDP

4523
04:37:29,180 --> 04:37:32,400
directly on the internet and the cyber

4524
04:37:32,400 --> 04:37:34,141
security and infrastructure Security

4525
04:37:34,141 --> 04:37:37,320
Agency reported an increase of 127

4526
04:37:37,320 --> 04:37:40,561
percent of the RDP endpoint exposed to

4527
04:37:40,561 --> 04:37:42,900
the internet following the pandemic so

4528
04:37:42,900 --> 04:37:46,020
it's a lot of tool and since oops sorry

4529
04:37:46,020 --> 04:37:49,259
for that and since RDP give user

4530
04:37:49,259 --> 04:37:52,820
complete control over the device uh well

4531
04:37:52,820 --> 04:37:56,520
it has to be shown it has been shown at

4532
04:37:56,520 --> 04:37:59,879
as a valuable entry point for chat actor

4533
04:37:59,879 --> 04:38:03,299
and particularly for ransomware gang so

4534
04:38:03,299 --> 04:38:05,820
you understand the urgency in of

4535
04:38:05,820 --> 04:38:07,618
understanding attackers behavior and

4536
04:38:07,618 --> 04:38:10,438
proposing solution to improve protection

4537
04:38:10,438 --> 04:38:14,239
or or attack prevention

4538
04:38:14,299 --> 04:38:15,900
so

4539
04:38:15,900 --> 04:38:18,539
to study credential attack on RDP we

4540
04:38:18,539 --> 04:38:20,699
operated a we operate we're still

4541
04:38:20,699 --> 04:38:23,759
operating a high interaction on a pot on

4542
04:38:23,759 --> 04:38:26,118
the internet

4543
04:38:26,219 --> 04:38:29,580
um so the objective of our on it but is

4544
04:38:29,580 --> 04:38:31,141
a research on it but so we're just

4545
04:38:31,141 --> 04:38:35,458
collecting data and and uh for research

4546
04:38:35,458 --> 04:38:36,900
purposes

4547
04:38:36,900 --> 04:38:40,020
and our specific unibod consists is an

4548
04:38:40,020 --> 04:38:42,240
open source RDP interception

4549
04:38:42,240 --> 04:38:46,520
interception tool called Pi RDP

4550
04:38:46,520 --> 04:38:49,799
so and it's in front of a real Windows

4551
04:38:49,799 --> 04:38:52,020
Server so they can actually connect and

4552
04:38:52,020 --> 04:38:55,379
do stuff on the on the other but

4553
04:38:55,379 --> 04:38:59,641
um so Pi RDP you might have seen one of

4554
04:38:59,641 --> 04:39:02,359
the presentation of Olivia bellado who

4555
04:39:02,359 --> 04:39:05,278
developed by RDP with a couple of other

4556
04:39:05,278 --> 04:39:07,740
intern I don't see any of them here but

4557
04:39:07,740 --> 04:39:10,020
a lot of people work hard on on the

4558
04:39:10,020 --> 04:39:12,778
development of this tool and maybe you

4559
04:39:12,778 --> 04:39:16,020
have seen the uh or listened to a purple

4560
04:39:16,020 --> 04:39:19,080
RDP the presentation of LED about this

4561
04:39:19,080 --> 04:39:22,199
one about about the tool but basically

4562
04:39:22,199 --> 04:39:26,099
like this is the list of all it can do

4563
04:39:26,099 --> 04:39:28,740
however I will not read all that the the

4564
04:39:28,740 --> 04:39:31,259
thing is like the important thing is

4565
04:39:31,259 --> 04:39:35,160
that uh it's basically a monster in the

4566
04:39:35,160 --> 04:39:37,740
middle which collects a lot of

4567
04:39:37,740 --> 04:39:40,020
information it saves basically

4568
04:39:40,020 --> 04:39:41,940
everything so we have access it's it's

4569
04:39:41,940 --> 04:39:44,878
also an RDP visualizer so we have access

4570
04:39:44,878 --> 04:39:47,580
to basically everything like that the

4571
04:39:47,580 --> 04:39:50,040
person who connects to uh to our server

4572
04:39:50,040 --> 04:39:53,160
will type on his uh on his keyboard we

4573
04:39:53,160 --> 04:39:55,140
see where he clicks it's really like a

4574
04:39:55,140 --> 04:39:57,600
video of of what he's doing once he

4575
04:39:57,600 --> 04:40:00,600
connects so it's highly interesting

4576
04:40:00,600 --> 04:40:03,360
um but today I just I I will not talk

4577
04:40:03,360 --> 04:40:05,640
about like the actual video footage I

4578
04:40:05,640 --> 04:40:09,900
will talk about the the before the

4579
04:40:09,900 --> 04:40:12,360
compremission so the attack the

4580
04:40:12,360 --> 04:40:14,640
credential attack uh before confirmation

4581
04:40:14,640 --> 04:40:16,940
right

4582
04:40:17,520 --> 04:40:20,400
so how do they compromise our RDP system

4583
04:40:20,400 --> 04:40:23,640
let's start with that and it's not with

4584
04:40:23,640 --> 04:40:25,740
fancy back doors and a lot of knowledge

4585
04:40:25,740 --> 04:40:26,700
it's

4586
04:40:26,700 --> 04:40:29,820
very simple a Brute Force attack

4587
04:40:29,820 --> 04:40:32,760
s which consists in just trying as much

4588
04:40:32,760 --> 04:40:35,878
username and password as possible and

4589
04:40:35,878 --> 04:40:39,798
and try to enter right

4590
04:40:39,920 --> 04:40:43,378
so with all that we collected the data

4591
04:40:43,378 --> 04:40:45,420
set we collected a lot of information

4592
04:40:45,420 --> 04:40:49,560
like a lot of uh attempt logins and it

4593
04:40:49,560 --> 04:40:52,020
was kind of too much to analyze so I

4594
04:40:52,020 --> 04:40:55,980
took a subset of three months uh for so

4595
04:40:55,980 --> 04:40:59,340
for today so uh it's from July 1 to

4596
04:40:59,340 --> 04:41:02,760
September 30. all the attacks on those

4597
04:41:02,760 --> 04:41:05,520
omnipots and the information that that

4598
04:41:05,520 --> 04:41:07,820
is collected before the confirmation is

4599
04:41:07,820 --> 04:41:11,280
a timestamp IP addresses uh the

4600
04:41:11,280 --> 04:41:13,140
credential the child so the username and

4601
04:41:13,140 --> 04:41:15,780
the password and I'm kind of excited to

4602
04:41:15,780 --> 04:41:18,900
show you how far can we analyze the

4603
04:41:18,900 --> 04:41:20,458
strategies with only those three

4604
04:41:20,458 --> 04:41:23,940
information so for in this data set that

4605
04:41:23,940 --> 04:41:26,298
I'm presenting today we have like over

4606
04:41:26,298 --> 04:41:32,820
3.4 million uh attempt login and if we

4607
04:41:32,820 --> 04:41:35,940
group them by IP because you know one IP

4608
04:41:35,940 --> 04:41:37,820
can attack us for like

4609
04:41:37,820 --> 04:41:41,878
hundreds thousands of of times uh

4610
04:41:41,878 --> 04:41:44,400
hundreds of thousands of time we end up

4611
04:41:44,400 --> 04:41:46,458
with uh

4612
04:41:46,458 --> 04:41:49,378
1529 different IP address in three

4613
04:41:49,378 --> 04:41:50,580
months

4614
04:41:50,580 --> 04:41:54,360
so a bit of this descriptive uh

4615
04:41:54,360 --> 04:41:57,120
information about this about the data

4616
04:41:57,120 --> 04:42:01,440
set so most attacks come from IPS that

4617
04:42:01,440 --> 04:42:04,378
are registered in Asia and then Europe

4618
04:42:04,378 --> 04:42:06,958
and then North America we all know that

4619
04:42:06,958 --> 04:42:09,180
it's not necessarily the origin of the

4620
04:42:09,180 --> 04:42:11,218
attacker since they can use compromised

4621
04:42:11,218 --> 04:42:14,160
computer or proxies or any but still it

4622
04:42:14,160 --> 04:42:16,080
gives us an idea of where they're from

4623
04:42:16,080 --> 04:42:20,000
and I classified Russia in Asia here

4624
04:42:20,000 --> 04:42:22,200
and this is an important information

4625
04:42:22,200 --> 04:42:25,920
because Russia is the main attacker

4626
04:42:25,920 --> 04:42:29,458
so Russia Panama and China and China is

4627
04:42:29,458 --> 04:42:31,020
a

4628
04:42:31,020 --> 04:42:33,958
Hong Kong mostly because like for those

4629
04:42:33,958 --> 04:42:36,660
who can see the red line it represents

4630
04:42:36,660 --> 04:42:38,760
the rest of China and the blue line is

4631
04:42:38,760 --> 04:42:41,160
like Hong Kong so come it come from

4632
04:42:41,160 --> 04:42:43,560
uncoin right

4633
04:42:43,560 --> 04:42:45,420
um

4634
04:42:45,420 --> 04:42:49,320
so yeah now if we look at the most

4635
04:42:49,320 --> 04:42:51,540
common username that are used in the

4636
04:42:51,540 --> 04:42:53,878
attempt logins like you know we

4637
04:42:53,878 --> 04:42:56,940
understand that there's a lot

4638
04:42:56,940 --> 04:42:59,280
um like there's 700 000 different

4639
04:42:59,280 --> 04:43:02,160
username in our data set but here is the

4640
04:43:02,160 --> 04:43:04,260
top 12 okay

4641
04:43:04,260 --> 04:43:06,480
um so we see a lot of administrator

4642
04:43:06,480 --> 04:43:08,820
right uh and and

4643
04:43:08,820 --> 04:43:11,700
on the Windows Server the the default

4644
04:43:11,700 --> 04:43:14,280
name is administrator so it's kind of a

4645
04:43:14,280 --> 04:43:17,638
good strategy to try this to connect

4646
04:43:17,638 --> 04:43:20,100
uh so if we look at this all the

4647
04:43:20,100 --> 04:43:21,840
variation of the word admin

4648
04:43:21,840 --> 04:43:24,420
administrator and ministrator

4649
04:43:24,420 --> 04:43:29,218
it represents 60 of the of of the 10

4650
04:43:29,218 --> 04:43:31,980
attempt logins

4651
04:43:31,980 --> 04:43:36,240
after that if we look at the most common

4652
04:43:36,240 --> 04:43:38,638
no it's still the most common username

4653
04:43:38,638 --> 04:43:41,340
okay so administrator a lot and then we

4654
04:43:41,340 --> 04:43:44,160
have those three weird one in the top

4655
04:43:44,160 --> 04:43:46,920
12. they're presents in the top 12 is is

4656
04:43:46,920 --> 04:43:49,620
important because this is information

4657
04:43:49,620 --> 04:43:55,260
about our computer it's our RDP name and

4658
04:43:55,260 --> 04:43:58,440
our hostname and certificate name plus

4659
04:43:58,440 --> 04:44:00,958
something that is related to the fact

4660
04:44:00,958 --> 04:44:03,958
that we are on the digital ocean so

4661
04:44:03,958 --> 04:44:07,020
those are information that they

4662
04:44:07,020 --> 04:44:10,920
found and then leverage them against us

4663
04:44:10,920 --> 04:44:15,660
to try to enter our our server

4664
04:44:16,080 --> 04:44:17,160
um

4665
04:44:17,160 --> 04:44:22,138
so there's many studies uh where that

4666
04:44:22,138 --> 04:44:23,940
that's saying that uh Brute Force attack

4667
04:44:23,940 --> 04:44:28,920
on RDP are kind of very basic and use uh

4668
04:44:28,920 --> 04:44:31,500
you know leaked lists on available on

4669
04:44:31,500 --> 04:44:34,320
the internet and uh yeah that are pretty

4670
04:44:34,320 --> 04:44:36,780
much basic but this is not what we see

4671
04:44:36,780 --> 04:44:38,878
here because they use our information

4672
04:44:38,878 --> 04:44:42,298
against us and it's not like random

4673
04:44:42,298 --> 04:44:46,039
usernames it's our names

4674
04:44:47,760 --> 04:44:50,040
okay now if we look at the most common

4675
04:44:50,040 --> 04:44:52,860
password in the attempt login we still

4676
04:44:52,860 --> 04:44:55,378
have the top top 12 here

4677
04:44:55,378 --> 04:44:57,420
um well there's three important

4678
04:44:57,420 --> 04:45:01,440
observation or Trend here is here or

4679
04:45:01,440 --> 04:45:03,480
it's represents Illustrated here so

4680
04:45:03,480 --> 04:45:05,160
first the variation of our RDP

4681
04:45:05,160 --> 04:45:07,200
certificate is the most common

4682
04:45:07,200 --> 04:45:09,660
strategies that we see and then

4683
04:45:09,660 --> 04:45:12,000
variation of the word password

4684
04:45:12,000 --> 04:45:14,940
obviously and then use of simple chain

4685
04:45:14,940 --> 04:45:18,180
of number like 10 or less numbers so

4686
04:45:18,180 --> 04:45:21,240
they are basically very bad passwords or

4687
04:45:21,240 --> 04:45:24,600
targeted passwords right

4688
04:45:24,600 --> 04:45:27,298
um and and so we can what we can

4689
04:45:27,298 --> 04:45:30,000
conclude from that is that uh they

4690
04:45:30,000 --> 04:45:32,100
basically assume that people have bad

4691
04:45:32,100 --> 04:45:36,840
password which is kind of true so uh so

4692
04:45:36,840 --> 04:45:39,060
yeah we have to keep saying uh to people

4693
04:45:39,060 --> 04:45:41,340
that uh that they have to to change

4694
04:45:41,340 --> 04:45:42,780
their password and have strong password

4695
04:45:42,780 --> 04:45:46,980
our job is not done on that uh so here's

4696
04:45:46,980 --> 04:45:49,080
our some observation related to the

4697
04:45:49,080 --> 04:45:50,700
credentials okay that I wanted to

4698
04:45:50,700 --> 04:45:55,560
highlight here uh first username uh we

4699
04:45:55,560 --> 04:45:58,798
can see a specialization of the username

4700
04:45:58,798 --> 04:46:02,160
according to the country uh the uh of

4701
04:46:02,160 --> 04:46:04,500
the attack of the origin of the attack

4702
04:46:04,500 --> 04:46:06,780
so here are two examples of those

4703
04:46:06,780 --> 04:46:09,360
specializations so the first one are RDP

4704
04:46:09,360 --> 04:46:13,080
certificate name is used by China and

4705
04:46:13,080 --> 04:46:15,958
Russia exclusively right

4706
04:46:15,958 --> 04:46:19,440
so the attack that are targeted against

4707
04:46:19,440 --> 04:46:23,160
our information uh come from China and

4708
04:46:23,160 --> 04:46:25,500
Russia this is their strategies

4709
04:46:25,500 --> 04:46:28,620
the username ADM is used exclusively by

4710
04:46:28,620 --> 04:46:30,900
attacker from Nicaragua and Panama I

4711
04:46:30,900 --> 04:46:32,878
cannot explain that if you have an idea

4712
04:46:32,878 --> 04:46:34,920
you come and see me and I I just thought

4713
04:46:34,920 --> 04:46:37,500
maybe it's uh it's more common in their

4714
04:46:37,500 --> 04:46:42,718
area to use ADM as a as default user

4715
04:46:42,718 --> 04:46:44,718
um

4716
04:46:46,200 --> 04:46:48,000
another observation related to

4717
04:46:48,000 --> 04:46:51,420
credential is that some the strategy of

4718
04:46:51,420 --> 04:46:53,420
some attacker is to use

4719
04:46:53,420 --> 04:46:55,560
thousands of different passwords but

4720
04:46:55,560 --> 04:46:58,680
with the five same username right

4721
04:46:58,680 --> 04:47:03,060
so 15 of attackers will try uh will have

4722
04:47:03,060 --> 04:47:04,560
these strategies

4723
04:47:04,560 --> 04:47:08,400
with this strategy sorry

4724
04:47:08,400 --> 04:47:11,700
um so it it might be a good strategy but

4725
04:47:11,700 --> 04:47:13,260
you have to be very confident about

4726
04:47:13,260 --> 04:47:15,600
those five username that you know that

4727
04:47:15,600 --> 04:47:17,040
you use

4728
04:47:17,040 --> 04:47:21,120
another observation is that some use the

4729
04:47:21,120 --> 04:47:23,040
same username as they use for the

4730
04:47:23,040 --> 04:47:25,980
password the same word right so it's

4731
04:47:25,980 --> 04:47:28,620
administrator administrator

4732
04:47:28,620 --> 04:47:31,560
we see that a lot and it's in 21 of the

4733
04:47:31,560 --> 04:47:33,718
time

4734
04:47:33,718 --> 04:47:36,480
other observation there are some that

4735
04:47:36,480 --> 04:47:39,660
use the same set of credentials so the

4736
04:47:39,660 --> 04:47:41,458
same

4737
04:47:41,458 --> 04:47:44,820
uh combination right more than one time

4738
04:47:44,820 --> 04:47:46,740
and this I cannot understand it because

4739
04:47:46,740 --> 04:47:49,200
like it didn't work the first time what

4740
04:47:49,200 --> 04:47:51,360
it would the second time I don't know so

4741
04:47:51,360 --> 04:47:53,940
uh there's 26 percent of attackers who

4742
04:47:53,940 --> 04:47:57,420
use a combination more than one time uh

4743
04:47:57,420 --> 04:48:01,378
this tells us that yes so maybe they are

4744
04:48:01,378 --> 04:48:03,298
a group and they don't communicate very

4745
04:48:03,298 --> 04:48:05,040
well with each other and they try the

4746
04:48:05,040 --> 04:48:07,620
same list which is not very efficient or

4747
04:48:07,620 --> 04:48:10,200
they are uh just like very mixed up and

4748
04:48:10,200 --> 04:48:11,458
I don't know they don't know what

4749
04:48:11,458 --> 04:48:13,620
they're doing basically so though this

4750
04:48:13,620 --> 04:48:15,360
represents like maybe more Basics

4751
04:48:15,360 --> 04:48:19,260
attacker than than those who Target us

4752
04:48:19,260 --> 04:48:21,060
so I am done with the descriptive

4753
04:48:21,060 --> 04:48:24,000
analysis let's dive into the research

4754
04:48:24,000 --> 04:48:24,840
question

4755
04:48:24,840 --> 04:48:28,138
as I said I perceive the attackers to be

4756
04:48:28,138 --> 04:48:30,060
like on a continuum

4757
04:48:30,060 --> 04:48:32,820
of human engagement so they are evidence

4758
04:48:32,820 --> 04:48:35,400
pointing toward the use of automation so

4759
04:48:35,400 --> 04:48:39,060
machine light behavior and other other

4760
04:48:39,060 --> 04:48:41,240
indication or other evidence

4761
04:48:41,240 --> 04:48:45,480
pointing toward human behavior okay

4762
04:48:45,480 --> 04:48:47,400
so uh

4763
04:48:47,400 --> 04:48:48,780
by

4764
04:48:48,780 --> 04:48:52,200
human like of course there's a human at

4765
04:48:52,200 --> 04:48:54,660
every step like in all those categories

4766
04:48:54,660 --> 04:48:57,180
but there's also a machine in all those

4767
04:48:57,180 --> 04:48:58,860
categories we understand that but we

4768
04:48:58,860 --> 04:49:01,080
just want to see like how how different

4769
04:49:01,080 --> 04:49:04,260
they they can be by human involvement I

4770
04:49:04,260 --> 04:49:07,920
mean that they are they are slightly

4771
04:49:07,920 --> 04:49:11,218
they have a slightly higher level of

4772
04:49:11,218 --> 04:49:13,260
sophistication this is what what it

4773
04:49:13,260 --> 04:49:15,320
means

4774
04:49:15,320 --> 04:49:19,080
so I'll show you

4775
04:49:19,080 --> 04:49:22,500
my maps Okay I love my maps it it looks

4776
04:49:22,500 --> 04:49:24,900
complicated but I'll explain so this is

4777
04:49:24,900 --> 04:49:27,120
an attack Challenger okay

4778
04:49:27,120 --> 04:49:30,060
this is a July for July so you have all

4779
04:49:30,060 --> 04:49:33,060
the days in July and all the hours of

4780
04:49:33,060 --> 04:49:35,400
the day okay so this is a Time pattern

4781
04:49:35,400 --> 04:49:38,340
attack for one IP

4782
04:49:38,340 --> 04:49:41,580
each little bars represent attacks and

4783
04:49:41,580 --> 04:49:44,458
like for in this case for this IP the

4784
04:49:44,458 --> 04:49:47,400
yellow one represent four attack at the

4785
04:49:47,400 --> 04:49:48,120
time

4786
04:49:48,120 --> 04:49:51,360
in this time frame okay so here we see a

4787
04:49:51,360 --> 04:49:53,940
lot of attack here we see a very good

4788
04:49:53,940 --> 04:49:57,840
example of an automated attack that is

4789
04:49:57,840 --> 04:50:01,260
launched and obviously like there's no

4790
04:50:01,260 --> 04:50:04,980
human pattern or human behavior here

4791
04:50:04,980 --> 04:50:07,260
it's purely computer Behavior right

4792
04:50:07,260 --> 04:50:11,100
because it attacks very rapidly and at

4793
04:50:11,100 --> 04:50:13,860
all times so there's you know

4794
04:50:13,860 --> 04:50:17,160
but this is like I can find this in my

4795
04:50:17,160 --> 04:50:18,718
data set but

4796
04:50:18,718 --> 04:50:20,878
um but it's not the majority of what I

4797
04:50:20,878 --> 04:50:23,878
see okay I see mostly those type of

4798
04:50:23,878 --> 04:50:27,000
patterns so it looks like well so to

4799
04:50:27,000 --> 04:50:29,458
understand it there's a start of the

4800
04:50:29,458 --> 04:50:33,000
attack there and then it stops

4801
04:50:33,000 --> 04:50:35,580
yes I was looking at that time it makes

4802
04:50:35,580 --> 04:50:39,780
sense it stops and then nothing happened

4803
04:50:39,780 --> 04:50:43,580
so I'm imagining that you know you start

4804
04:50:43,580 --> 04:50:47,878
you launch a list of credentials and

4805
04:50:47,878 --> 04:50:50,160
then it stops and then it didn't you

4806
04:50:50,160 --> 04:50:52,080
didn't uh

4807
04:50:52,080 --> 04:50:55,500
uh you were not able to get in right

4808
04:50:55,500 --> 04:50:57,900
and then you have to notice it and then

4809
04:50:57,900 --> 04:50:59,700
you have to launch another block of

4810
04:50:59,700 --> 04:51:01,740
attack with another list of credentials

4811
04:51:01,740 --> 04:51:04,320
and this would look like this right but

4812
04:51:04,320 --> 04:51:06,420
you might not be in front of your of

4813
04:51:06,420 --> 04:51:09,420
your computer when it ends so that's why

4814
04:51:09,420 --> 04:51:12,000
there's time that appears to be pretty

4815
04:51:12,000 --> 04:51:13,160
random

4816
04:51:13,160 --> 04:51:16,020
behind between in between the blocks of

4817
04:51:16,020 --> 04:51:18,958
attack blocks of attacks

4818
04:51:18,958 --> 04:51:22,620
because of course and this is uh

4819
04:51:22,620 --> 04:51:24,958
uh maybe like more of a human behavior

4820
04:51:24,958 --> 04:51:28,080
than our uh that the other example

4821
04:51:28,080 --> 04:51:30,120
because of course we're not in front of

4822
04:51:30,120 --> 04:51:32,280
the inter the end of the um of the

4823
04:51:32,280 --> 04:51:34,200
computer at all time and we have to

4824
04:51:34,200 --> 04:51:35,760
sleep right

4825
04:51:35,760 --> 04:51:38,760
but there's other example that are even

4826
04:51:38,760 --> 04:51:41,520
more interesting well for me maybe maybe

4827
04:51:41,520 --> 04:51:44,940
you might not be as excited as I am but

4828
04:51:44,940 --> 04:51:47,900
here we see two things we see first that

4829
04:51:47,900 --> 04:51:51,120
the impose a delay between each attack

4830
04:51:51,120 --> 04:51:54,240
right so this is a strategy that is more

4831
04:51:54,240 --> 04:51:56,400
thought out because they are trying to

4832
04:51:56,400 --> 04:51:58,440
imitate human behavior to avoid

4833
04:51:58,440 --> 04:52:00,958
detection by imposing a delay between

4834
04:52:00,958 --> 04:52:02,458
attacks

4835
04:52:02,458 --> 04:52:05,520
uh but the cool thing is so so we we

4836
04:52:05,520 --> 04:52:07,440
know that it this is automated right

4837
04:52:07,440 --> 04:52:10,440
because there's a delay include in the

4838
04:52:10,440 --> 04:52:12,420
script and everything but what is

4839
04:52:12,420 --> 04:52:15,620
interesting is that there's uh days here

4840
04:52:15,620 --> 04:52:19,218
there's a hole in the in the calendar

4841
04:52:19,218 --> 04:52:25,020
and This falls on the weekend of July

4842
04:52:25,020 --> 04:52:27,540
so we can imagine like it has a it has

4843
04:52:27,540 --> 04:52:30,240
been documented that that China employs

4844
04:52:30,240 --> 04:52:33,660
people like office office hour of people

4845
04:52:33,660 --> 04:52:36,780
trying to act other countries and this

4846
04:52:36,780 --> 04:52:39,180
might be an example of this because you

4847
04:52:39,180 --> 04:52:41,638
know they work full-time during the week

4848
04:52:41,638 --> 04:52:43,920
and then they close everything for the

4849
04:52:43,920 --> 04:52:46,378
weekend go home and come back on Monday

4850
04:52:46,378 --> 04:52:49,440
so this could be an example of this it

4851
04:52:49,440 --> 04:52:52,500
also can be someone who has a weekend

4852
04:52:52,500 --> 04:52:54,718
job and do something else we don't know

4853
04:52:54,718 --> 04:52:58,080
yet but it's it's hypothesis

4854
04:52:58,080 --> 04:53:00,780
and the final example that I wanted to

4855
04:53:00,780 --> 04:53:04,440
show you so he start attacking our uh

4856
04:53:04,440 --> 04:53:06,958
the person start attacking an airport on

4857
04:53:06,958 --> 04:53:09,840
the 18 this is not important but what I

4858
04:53:09,840 --> 04:53:12,360
want to show you is the block of eight

4859
04:53:12,360 --> 04:53:15,480
hour during which there's no no attack

4860
04:53:15,480 --> 04:53:18,298
started so attack can be running alone

4861
04:53:18,298 --> 04:53:21,080
without a human in front of the computer

4862
04:53:21,080 --> 04:53:24,000
but there is this

4863
04:53:24,000 --> 04:53:28,680
block of eight hours that that we we do

4864
04:53:28,680 --> 04:53:32,100
not see any attack that is started

4865
04:53:32,100 --> 04:53:34,020
so you know eight hour this is what you

4866
04:53:34,020 --> 04:53:36,420
need to sleep so it might be during the

4867
04:53:36,420 --> 04:53:39,718
night for this uh this country

4868
04:53:39,718 --> 04:53:42,298
it might also be like eight hour shift

4869
04:53:42,298 --> 04:53:44,820
of a of a day job too so there's a lot

4870
04:53:44,820 --> 04:53:47,280
of hypothesis here

4871
04:53:47,280 --> 04:53:48,718
so

4872
04:53:48,718 --> 04:53:50,638
I was looking at this and I was like

4873
04:53:50,638 --> 04:53:52,920
okay there's something human behind it

4874
04:53:52,920 --> 04:53:57,120
right there's pauses there's uh weekends

4875
04:53:57,120 --> 04:54:00,420
um there's vacation days so uh this is

4876
04:54:00,420 --> 04:54:02,400
why I wanted to

4877
04:54:02,400 --> 04:54:05,700
look at the the extent to which the

4878
04:54:05,700 --> 04:54:09,440
human is present behind the screen

4879
04:54:09,660 --> 04:54:13,440
so I identify indicators of machine like

4880
04:54:13,440 --> 04:54:15,540
Behavior an indicator of human-like

4881
04:54:15,540 --> 04:54:18,600
Behavior so we know that machine is

4882
04:54:18,600 --> 04:54:21,660
everywhere in in those indicators but I

4883
04:54:21,660 --> 04:54:24,240
would say maybe machine-like Behavior

4884
04:54:24,240 --> 04:54:26,878
would be associated with

4885
04:54:26,878 --> 04:54:30,420
a more basic attack okay so when we see

4886
04:54:30,420 --> 04:54:33,000
a high number of attack uh of course

4887
04:54:33,000 --> 04:54:36,000
it's not a human that is trying you know

4888
04:54:36,000 --> 04:54:39,298
by by himself or herself so I will

4889
04:54:39,298 --> 04:54:40,740
associate it with a machine like

4890
04:54:40,740 --> 04:54:43,620
behavior when the passwords are present

4891
04:54:43,620 --> 04:54:46,560
in the popular list of list credential

4892
04:54:46,560 --> 04:54:50,940
and to know that I took the Raku 2021

4893
04:54:50,940 --> 04:54:55,378
with like 8 billion passwords in it if

4894
04:54:55,378 --> 04:54:57,298
the password used by the attacker will

4895
04:54:57,298 --> 04:55:00,900
will mostly like most of the passwords

4896
04:55:00,900 --> 04:55:04,620
used was in this list I consider that

4897
04:55:04,620 --> 04:55:07,500
the the passwords were like basic and

4898
04:55:07,500 --> 04:55:09,180
part of a leaked list that is available

4899
04:55:09,180 --> 04:55:12,600
easily on on the internet so I consider

4900
04:55:12,600 --> 04:55:15,298
this as a machine live Behavior or like

4901
04:55:15,298 --> 04:55:18,600
less less sophisticated attack

4902
04:55:18,600 --> 04:55:20,878
then the constant presence of the

4903
04:55:20,878 --> 04:55:22,798
attacker over the observation period of

4904
04:55:22,798 --> 04:55:25,378
three months of course would be

4905
04:55:25,378 --> 04:55:27,240
associated with machine-like behavior

4906
04:55:27,240 --> 04:55:29,400
and finally when there's several attack

4907
04:55:29,400 --> 04:55:31,980
per second it's an automation of course

4908
04:55:31,980 --> 04:55:34,860
so I Associated it with a machine-like

4909
04:55:34,860 --> 04:55:35,878
behavior

4910
04:55:35,878 --> 04:55:38,280
now here we have the indicators of

4911
04:55:38,280 --> 04:55:40,760
human-like Behavior or sophistication

4912
04:55:40,760 --> 04:55:44,760
more sophisticated so there's a start of

4913
04:55:44,760 --> 04:55:47,100
at the start of attack blocks after long

4914
04:55:47,100 --> 04:55:51,180
pause as I show with the calendar this

4915
04:55:51,180 --> 04:55:54,480
would be associated with with the human

4916
04:55:54,480 --> 04:55:57,840
those screens are very hot by the way

4917
04:55:57,840 --> 04:56:01,440
I'm like burning attack is customized

4918
04:56:01,440 --> 04:56:04,138
for its Target as I show you they took

4919
04:56:04,138 --> 04:56:06,000
our information they leverage it against

4920
04:56:06,000 --> 04:56:09,298
us so I said well this is more of a tout

4921
04:56:09,298 --> 04:56:11,520
out uh than a basic attack so I

4922
04:56:11,520 --> 04:56:13,440
Associated it with human-like behavior

4923
04:56:13,440 --> 04:56:16,200
and finally the delay between each

4924
04:56:16,200 --> 04:56:19,378
logins of course this is automated but

4925
04:56:19,378 --> 04:56:21,660
they are trying to imitate human

4926
04:56:21,660 --> 04:56:23,940
behavior so I classified it as a bit

4927
04:56:23,940 --> 04:56:25,440
more sophisticated because they thought

4928
04:56:25,440 --> 04:56:26,940
about it

4929
04:56:26,940 --> 04:56:31,260
so if I give a point uh I made a plus

4930
04:56:31,260 --> 04:56:33,540
one to each of this Crater of those

4931
04:56:33,540 --> 04:56:35,940
criterias when I see it and then I

4932
04:56:35,940 --> 04:56:37,680
remove a point for each of those

4933
04:56:37,680 --> 04:56:40,260
criteria we end up with an engagement

4934
04:56:40,260 --> 04:56:41,400
score

4935
04:56:41,400 --> 04:56:44,218
okay from Human to machine on the

4936
04:56:44,218 --> 04:56:47,218
Continuum so we see that there's more

4937
04:56:47,218 --> 04:56:49,740
people on on The Human Side

4938
04:56:49,740 --> 04:56:53,040
or on the sophisticated side

4939
04:56:53,040 --> 04:56:56,638
always with with quotation mark

4940
04:56:56,638 --> 04:56:59,580
um because it's like we can talk a long

4941
04:56:59,580 --> 04:57:01,920
time about sophistication and what it

4942
04:57:01,920 --> 04:57:04,020
means and everything but you understand

4943
04:57:04,020 --> 04:57:05,700
where I'm coming from with all this

4944
04:57:05,700 --> 04:57:07,860
presentation so a bit more on The Human

4945
04:57:07,860 --> 04:57:09,660
Side

4946
04:57:09,660 --> 04:57:13,860
uh so the conclusion of this is that we

4947
04:57:13,860 --> 04:57:15,780
were expecting

4948
04:57:15,780 --> 04:57:18,240
a lot of Automation and basic Automation

4949
04:57:18,240 --> 04:57:20,218
and this is what other research has

4950
04:57:20,218 --> 04:57:22,500
found before so this is what we were

4951
04:57:22,500 --> 04:57:24,360
expecting but this is not exactly what

4952
04:57:24,360 --> 04:57:27,480
we saw we saw a lot of human patterns in

4953
04:57:27,480 --> 04:57:30,920
the attack pattern calendar uh we saw

4954
04:57:30,920 --> 04:57:34,260
information leverage against us so we we

4955
04:57:34,260 --> 04:57:36,900
saw attacks with characteristics that

4956
04:57:36,900 --> 04:57:38,520
are more thought out than what we

4957
04:57:38,520 --> 04:57:41,820
expected so

4958
04:57:41,820 --> 04:57:44,700
it's a bit

4959
04:57:44,700 --> 04:57:47,458
you know worrying because if it was only

4960
04:57:47,458 --> 04:57:49,980
Basics it would be uh it would be

4961
04:57:49,980 --> 04:57:54,000
encouraging uh but still now we know so

4962
04:57:54,000 --> 04:57:56,780
we can defend against this

4963
04:57:56,780 --> 04:57:59,940
so the mitigation uh

4964
04:57:59,940 --> 04:58:03,600
first you know our arnipot is exposed to

4965
04:58:03,600 --> 04:58:06,360
internet and you can of course use a VPN

4966
04:58:06,360 --> 04:58:08,400
and not be exposed so this is the first

4967
04:58:08,400 --> 04:58:10,378
thing we should say we should tell

4968
04:58:10,378 --> 04:58:11,480
everybody

4969
04:58:11,480 --> 04:58:15,420
please hide behind a VPN that will we

4970
04:58:15,420 --> 04:58:20,040
will avoid a lot of problems this way

4971
04:58:20,040 --> 04:58:23,280
um after that you saw that the attack

4972
04:58:23,280 --> 04:58:26,878
very fast all the time on the new

4973
04:58:26,878 --> 04:58:30,120
windows 11 they in store the lockout

4974
04:58:30,120 --> 04:58:32,218
policy automatic lead and this is I

4975
04:58:32,218 --> 04:58:35,520
think a good idea every time you try if

4976
04:58:35,520 --> 04:58:37,500
I'm not mistaken like 10 passwords they

4977
04:58:37,500 --> 04:58:39,900
will block you for 10 minutes this is

4978
04:58:39,900 --> 04:58:42,780
very uh not efficient for an attacker

4979
04:58:42,780 --> 04:58:46,440
who Who attack a lot you know over the

4980
04:58:46,440 --> 04:58:48,540
month it will take them like a lot more

4981
04:58:48,540 --> 04:58:51,240
time to do so to do as much attacks as

4982
04:58:51,240 --> 04:58:55,560
they do so this might be imposed on our

4983
04:58:55,560 --> 04:58:57,660
system maybe a bit more this is a good

4984
04:58:57,660 --> 04:59:01,560
idea for now and also we keep saying I

4985
04:59:01,560 --> 04:59:03,900
like I give talks about the passwords

4986
04:59:03,900 --> 04:59:06,540
and everything and and we keep repeating

4987
04:59:06,540 --> 04:59:09,000
the same thing the password hygiene is

4988
04:59:09,000 --> 04:59:10,860
the best way to protect against those

4989
04:59:10,860 --> 04:59:13,740
attacks because you saw they use pretty

4990
04:59:13,740 --> 04:59:16,080
much like simple information simple

4991
04:59:16,080 --> 04:59:19,080
passwords uh variation of the word

4992
04:59:19,080 --> 04:59:21,660
passwords and also the use our

4993
04:59:21,660 --> 04:59:24,620
information so we can consider this as a

4994
04:59:24,620 --> 04:59:28,440
as a personal information and we always

4995
04:59:28,440 --> 04:59:30,480
say like don't use personal information

4996
04:59:30,480 --> 04:59:34,500
on on your in your passwords so we have

4997
04:59:34,500 --> 04:59:36,660
to keep saying that because it's true

4998
04:59:36,660 --> 04:59:40,260
it's still true but also keeping the

4999
04:59:40,260 --> 04:59:42,718
default username is not a good idea

5000
04:59:42,718 --> 04:59:45,000
maybe we have to like repeat it too

5001
04:59:45,000 --> 04:59:47,700
because you you need two information to

5002
04:59:47,700 --> 04:59:50,160
get in right why waste one

5003
04:59:50,160 --> 04:59:52,740
so username is as important as the

5004
04:59:52,740 --> 04:59:54,920
password

5005
04:59:55,100 --> 04:59:57,840
so the next

5006
04:59:57,840 --> 04:59:59,940
step

5007
04:59:59,940 --> 05:00:03,120
do I have one minute yes okay the next

5008
05:00:03,120 --> 05:00:06,240
step of our research we will look at the

5009
05:00:06,240 --> 05:00:09,958
tool that customize attacks because like

5010
05:00:09,958 --> 05:00:12,000
you know we we suspect that this is

5011
05:00:12,000 --> 05:00:13,920
automated they collect our information

5012
05:00:13,920 --> 05:00:15,958
and they create their list like

5013
05:00:15,958 --> 05:00:18,120
automatically it might be so we will be

5014
05:00:18,120 --> 05:00:21,298
looking at the at this tool that my that

5015
05:00:21,298 --> 05:00:23,360
they might use to customize their attack

5016
05:00:23,360 --> 05:00:26,458
after that we want to investigate what

5017
05:00:26,458 --> 05:00:29,760
lists of credentials they use

5018
05:00:29,760 --> 05:00:32,638
um and it will be even better when when

5019
05:00:32,638 --> 05:00:34,798
we analyze the compromy compromise

5020
05:00:34,798 --> 05:00:37,440
session because we see like all their

5021
05:00:37,440 --> 05:00:39,900
tools and what they use so we might be

5022
05:00:39,900 --> 05:00:43,620
able to uh to identify those credentials

5023
05:00:43,620 --> 05:00:44,638
they use

5024
05:00:44,638 --> 05:00:47,000
since most are not

5025
05:00:47,000 --> 05:00:48,958
data leaks

5026
05:00:48,958 --> 05:00:51,180
and then we want to investigate the

5027
05:00:51,180 --> 05:00:53,820
shared and origin of proxies because for

5028
05:00:53,820 --> 05:00:56,638
this presentation I only took like uh I

5029
05:00:56,638 --> 05:00:59,040
separated the IPS but some IPS are

5030
05:00:59,040 --> 05:01:01,500
highly related they might use more than

5031
05:01:01,500 --> 05:01:04,798
one IP to uh to attack us so we want to

5032
05:01:04,798 --> 05:01:07,320
do this this aggregation and finally

5033
05:01:07,320 --> 05:01:09,600
analyze the successful gang activities

5034
05:01:09,600 --> 05:01:13,399
with the video footage

5035
05:01:13,920 --> 05:01:15,600
um so more research should be performed

5036
05:01:15,600 --> 05:01:17,458
to reveal a precise tooling and

5037
05:01:17,458 --> 05:01:19,620
Strategies employed by opportunistic

5038
05:01:19,620 --> 05:01:22,378

05:01:26,520 --> 05:01:29,160

start this q a session and don't forget

the Q R which I said earlier

5152
06:04:31,820 --> 06:04:34,200
I cut QR if ever you want to ask

5153

questions or Abode questions too

5154
06:04:37,020 --> 06:04:40,260
um so yeah I guess before asking the

5155
06:04:40,260 --> 06:04:43,080
audience's questions I had prepared a

5156
06:04:43,080 --> 06:04:45,120
few questions for our our speakers so

5157
06:04:45,120 --> 06:04:47,100
I'll start with that just to kick off

5158
06:04:47,100 --> 06:04:48,718
and we'll start with Wiki because you're

5159
06:04:48,718 --> 06:04:50,280
the first one to present thank you very

5160
06:04:50,280 --> 06:04:51,840
much for you for the time and for the

5161
06:04:51,840 --> 06:04:54,480
presentation thank you for having me

5162
06:04:54,480 --> 06:04:56,160
so I know you have a background in

5163
06:04:56,160 --> 06:04:58,320
criminology and you know that in our

5164
06:04:58,320 --> 06:05:00,420
field we often talk about the different

5165
06:05:00,420 --> 06:05:02,100
theories and

5166
06:05:02,100 --> 06:05:05,100
we know that often when we have

5167
06:05:05,100 --> 06:05:07,980
opportunities delinquents will often try

5168
06:05:07,980 --> 06:05:10,798
to like reach these opportunities and

5169
06:05:10,798 --> 06:05:12,958
then after that we'll kind of see a lot

5170
06:05:12,958 --> 06:05:14,878
of um them being exploited and will

5171
06:05:14,878 --> 06:05:17,340
Plateau so this was applied this kind of

5172
06:05:17,340 --> 06:05:18,958
theory was applied to cyber crime where

5173
06:05:18,958 --> 06:05:20,218
we saw that different types of cyber

5174
06:05:20,218 --> 06:05:21,780
crime were highly exploited for a really

5175
06:05:21,780 --> 06:05:24,360
long time and then slowly less and less

5176
06:05:24,360 --> 06:05:25,740
people exploited it just because the

5177
06:05:25,740 --> 06:05:28,020
marginal revenue was less do you think

5178
06:05:28,020 --> 06:05:29,520
that for ransomware we're kind of

5179
06:05:29,520 --> 06:05:32,100
reaching this Plateau or are we still in

5180
06:05:32,100 --> 06:05:33,780
the higher ups of the curve if you see

5181
06:05:33,780 --> 06:05:35,100
what I mean

5182
06:05:35,100 --> 06:05:38,040
so all right I've never had a mic before

5183
06:05:38,040 --> 06:05:40,680
so let me know if you can hear me

5184
06:05:40,680 --> 06:05:43,798
um yeah great so I think the answer is

5185
06:05:43,798 --> 06:05:46,260
not that simple because as things

5186
06:05:46,260 --> 06:05:48,180
progress and we have new software coming

5187
06:05:48,180 --> 06:05:49,620
out there's always new opportunities

5188
06:05:49,620 --> 06:05:51,840
that are born well not born but are

5189
06:05:51,840 --> 06:05:55,138
created so until like software being

5190
06:05:55,138 --> 06:05:57,900
sold with zero vulnerabilities to them

5191
06:05:57,900 --> 06:06:01,558
and like defense is in the creation of

5192
06:06:01,558 --> 06:06:04,740
those those projects those software I

5193
06:06:04,740 --> 06:06:06,660
don't think we're going to be in a

5194
06:06:06,660 --> 06:06:08,160
position to say that the opportunities

5195
06:06:08,160 --> 06:06:10,860
for ransomware are lacking and I also

5196
06:06:10,860 --> 06:06:12,240
think that opportunities are sought

5197
06:06:12,240 --> 06:06:14,638
after and they're gonna find one when

5198
06:06:14,638 --> 06:06:17,878
they are looking for them I also think

5199
06:06:17,878 --> 06:06:20,040
that they're still money to be made so

5200
06:06:20,040 --> 06:06:22,020
if monies is still at play they're still

5201
06:06:22,020 --> 06:06:24,240
going to find a way so that would be my

5202
06:06:24,240 --> 06:06:25,620
answer

5203
06:06:25,620 --> 06:06:28,440
I used to think that ransomware was so

5204
06:06:28,440 --> 06:06:32,700
2018 to be honest and then just rest has

5205
06:06:32,700 --> 06:06:34,558
happened and it just never stops and I'm

5206
06:06:34,558 --> 06:06:36,120
just wondering well will we when we'll

5207
06:06:36,120 --> 06:06:37,920
reach that Plateau where ransomware will

5208
06:06:37,920 --> 06:06:39,958
be out and we'll have like another kind

5209
06:06:39,958 --> 06:06:41,520
of threat that we'll be I'll be talking

5210
06:06:41,520 --> 06:06:43,378
about but it just doesn't seem to happen

5211
06:06:43,378 --> 06:06:46,620
so I totally agree with you maybe not

5212
06:06:46,620 --> 06:06:48,360
um maybe I can ask Ariane another

5213
06:06:48,360 --> 06:06:49,558
question

5214
06:06:49,558 --> 06:06:51,480
um one thing that I would want to say is

5215
06:06:51,480 --> 06:06:52,920
if you know anian you know she works

5216
06:06:52,920 --> 06:06:54,360
with Olivier at gosecure and they're

5217
06:06:54,360 --> 06:06:56,400
doing amazing research and maybe now

5218
06:06:56,400 --> 06:06:58,020
you'll know because I'll tell you that

5219
06:06:58,020 --> 06:06:59,700
they've been accepted at black hat USA

5220
06:06:59,700 --> 06:07:01,440
this year so they'll go and present

5221
06:07:01,440 --> 06:07:02,820
there this summer

5222
06:07:02,820 --> 06:07:04,440
and I know that the research that

5223
06:07:04,440 --> 06:07:05,820
they'll be presenting is kind of a

5224
06:07:05,820 --> 06:07:07,680
follow-up of what she's presented here

5225
06:07:07,680 --> 06:07:09,540
so maybe if you would want to talk like

5226
06:07:09,540 --> 06:07:10,680
tell us a bit what you're going to

5227
06:07:10,680 --> 06:07:12,120
present at black hat and what's the plan

5228
06:07:12,120 --> 06:07:14,458
it'd be nice of course so one of the

5229
06:07:14,458 --> 06:07:17,040
next step of our research was uh to

5230
06:07:17,040 --> 06:07:20,940
analyze all the compromise sessions so

5231
06:07:20,940 --> 06:07:23,878
that when the attacker succeed in

5232
06:07:23,878 --> 06:07:27,058
entering our our system so we will

5233
06:07:27,058 --> 06:07:29,218
analyze all the video footage we have

5234
06:07:29,218 --> 06:07:31,920
over 100 hours to uh to look at so

5235
06:07:31,920 --> 06:07:34,620
there's a lot of work before black cat

5236
06:07:34,620 --> 06:07:36,958
uh but we already started looking at

5237
06:07:36,958 --> 06:07:39,540
them and we saw kind of uh different

5238
06:07:39,540 --> 06:07:43,860
profiles and for our black cat uh

5239
06:07:43,860 --> 06:07:47,218
proposal we suggest that those profiles

5240
06:07:47,218 --> 06:07:51,000
should be analyzed under the DND team

5241
06:07:51,000 --> 06:07:53,760
dungeon and dragon team so you know you

5242
06:07:53,760 --> 06:07:56,100
have those those people

5243
06:07:56,100 --> 06:07:58,138
um oh I can't remember the the name of

5244
06:07:58,138 --> 06:07:59,958
the categories now but

5245
06:07:59,958 --> 06:08:02,458
there's a sorcerer for sure no there's a

5246
06:08:02,458 --> 06:08:05,218
wizard for sure there's The Bard who

5247
06:08:05,218 --> 06:08:08,160
doesn't look to know what it's what he's

5248
06:08:08,160 --> 06:08:11,820
doing there's uh I can't remember

5249
06:08:11,820 --> 06:08:14,280
there's always a goblin the what a

5250
06:08:14,280 --> 06:08:16,798
goblin no there's not no Goblin there

5251
06:08:16,798 --> 06:08:18,780
but you know so there there's people

5252
06:08:18,780 --> 06:08:20,940
entering not knowing what they're doing

5253
06:08:20,940 --> 06:08:25,320
it looks like they maybe have by uh they

5254
06:08:25,320 --> 06:08:28,080
maybe bought the RDP access from someone

5255
06:08:28,080 --> 06:08:31,260
else other that they know exactly where

5256
06:08:31,260 --> 06:08:32,940
they're doing they already have their

5257
06:08:32,940 --> 06:08:35,700
tools they install it very fast and they

5258
06:08:35,700 --> 06:08:38,040
do their thing there's other who

5259
06:08:38,040 --> 06:08:41,340
compromise other computer to to this RDP

5260
06:08:41,340 --> 06:08:43,080
session so there's a lot of different

5261
06:08:43,080 --> 06:08:46,020
behavior that are very interesting and

5262
06:08:46,020 --> 06:08:48,298
we will be presenting the video footage

5263
06:08:48,298 --> 06:08:50,940
with like example of the of the video of

5264
06:08:50,940 --> 06:08:53,638
what we see and all the analysis of the

5265
06:08:53,638 --> 06:08:56,280
different profiles that that we see nice

5266
06:08:56,280 --> 06:08:57,840
and you're really actually seeing what

5267
06:08:57,840 --> 06:08:59,700
attackers are doing in your Honeypot so

5268
06:08:59,700 --> 06:09:01,500
this is rare data that we don't usually

5269
06:09:01,500 --> 06:09:04,920
have which probably explains why and

5270
06:09:04,920 --> 06:09:06,840
that and your amazing work that you've

5271
06:09:06,840 --> 06:09:08,458
been accepted at black hat exactly yeah

5272
06:09:08,458 --> 06:09:10,798
it will be interesting so I have a

5273
06:09:10,798 --> 06:09:12,958
question for you too as well when is

5274
06:09:12,958 --> 06:09:15,740
b-sides and uh where

5275
06:09:15,740 --> 06:09:18,180
so these sides is going to be in

5276
06:09:18,180 --> 06:09:21,420
September uh I want to say 16th of

5277
06:09:21,420 --> 06:09:23,820
September it's going to be at the bank

5278
06:09:23,820 --> 06:09:26,100
so same venue as last year we're going

5279
06:09:26,100 --> 06:09:28,378
to have free workshops and trainings

5280
06:09:28,378 --> 06:09:31,378
tons of free food and amazing talks like

5281
06:09:31,378 --> 06:09:34,920
last year we did besides the first year

5282
06:09:34,920 --> 06:09:37,798
and we kind of had to

5283
06:09:37,798 --> 06:09:40,500
get the talks that we could and last

5284
06:09:40,500 --> 06:09:42,540
year we were really just submerged with

5285
06:09:42,540 --> 06:09:44,340
so many great talks and so hopefully

5286
06:09:44,340 --> 06:09:45,900
this year we have the same quality

5287
06:09:45,900 --> 06:09:48,058
speakers as we had last year and it's

5288
06:09:48,058 --> 06:09:49,798
forty dollars and you even get a free

5289
06:09:49,798 --> 06:09:53,458
t-shirts so what more can I say

5290
06:09:53,458 --> 06:09:55,740
to gather all together the community and

5291
06:09:55,740 --> 06:09:57,058
see each other which is kind of nice

5292
06:09:57,058 --> 06:09:59,160
half of the year in North SEC the other

5293
06:09:59,160 --> 06:10:02,100
half at besides Vancouver but no truly

5294
06:10:02,100 --> 06:10:05,579
one year sorry

5295
06:10:05,820 --> 06:10:08,400
um a question on your representation

5296
06:10:08,400 --> 06:10:12,680
um since you've interviewed lawyers

5297
06:10:27,900 --> 06:10:30,900
foreign

5298
06:10:47,100 --> 06:10:50,100
foreign

5299
06:10:59,060 --> 06:11:02,129
[Music]

5300
06:11:26,580 --> 06:11:29,580
foreign

5301
06:11:48,390 --> 06:11:51,430
[Music]

5302
06:11:53,400 --> 06:11:56,400
vacuum

5303
06:12:18,180 --> 06:12:21,180
messenger

5304
06:12:50,458 --> 06:12:51,718
okay

5305
06:12:51,718 --> 06:12:52,630
okay

5306
06:12:52,630 --> 06:12:55,779
[Music]

5307
06:13:01,080 --> 06:13:02,520
um just a question for the whole panel

5308
06:13:02,520 --> 06:13:04,440
I'm just I think there's one thing that

5309
06:13:04,440 --> 06:13:06,298
comes out of all your presentation is

5310
06:13:06,298 --> 06:13:07,620
whether or not attackers are

5311
06:13:07,620 --> 06:13:10,260
sophisticated like either through using

5312
06:13:10,260 --> 06:13:13,200
Shadow phones or ransomware or attacking

5313
06:13:13,200 --> 06:13:15,958
RDP honeypots like are they

5314
06:13:15,958 --> 06:13:17,638
sophisticated from your perspective are

5315
06:13:17,638 --> 06:13:19,680
we really facing individuals who are yes

5316
06:13:19,680 --> 06:13:22,620
evil like kind of innovating all the

5317
06:13:22,620 --> 06:13:24,240
time but being sophisticated and we're

5318
06:13:24,240 --> 06:13:25,920
having a hard time or are we mainly

5319
06:13:25,920 --> 06:13:27,180
facing

5320
06:13:27,180 --> 06:13:29,040
um dumb people trying to just hack for

5321
06:13:29,040 --> 06:13:31,260
hacking just really it's a really broad

5322
06:13:31,260 --> 06:13:32,458
question but I think it's a question

5323
06:13:32,458 --> 06:13:33,900
that needs to be asked because we live

5324
06:13:33,900 --> 06:13:35,400
in an industry where we always talk

5325
06:13:35,400 --> 06:13:37,440
about attackers as the guys with the

5326
06:13:37,440 --> 06:13:38,820
hoodies or the girls with the hoodies

5327
06:13:38,820 --> 06:13:41,040
who are highly you know motivated and

5328
06:13:41,040 --> 06:13:42,780
I'm just wondering from your experience

5329
06:13:42,780 --> 06:13:45,440
what is it

5330
06:13:45,780 --> 06:13:48,540
so I don't think uh well okay it's

5331
06:13:48,540 --> 06:13:50,878
important to have the same definition of

5332
06:13:50,878 --> 06:13:52,980
sophistication this is where the

5333
06:13:52,980 --> 06:13:55,260
argument is

5334
06:13:55,260 --> 06:13:57,240
is

5335
06:13:57,240 --> 06:14:01,740
um in our in my case in in my research I

5336
06:14:01,740 --> 06:14:05,420
think of sophistication as

5337
06:14:05,700 --> 06:14:09,260
anything else than the pure basic easy

5338
06:14:09,260 --> 06:14:13,920
well easy again like my mother cannot do

5339
06:14:13,920 --> 06:14:16,080
this attack right so it's not like you

5340
06:14:16,080 --> 06:14:19,740
need some some knowledge and how to do

5341
06:14:19,740 --> 06:14:22,080
it but you know there's the plain basic

5342
06:14:22,080 --> 06:14:24,840
very opportunistic I think we can like

5343
06:14:24,840 --> 06:14:27,600
use this uh this term so opportunistic

5344
06:14:27,600 --> 06:14:30,120
and then I considered a bit more

5345
06:14:30,120 --> 06:14:33,540
sophisticated those who think about what

5346
06:14:33,540 --> 06:14:35,458
they are doing and try to do better

5347
06:14:35,458 --> 06:14:38,700
right by by leveraging information and

5348
06:14:38,700 --> 06:14:41,700
by you know trying to imitate Behavior

5349
06:14:41,700 --> 06:14:44,280
so this is my definition but people

5350
06:14:44,280 --> 06:14:46,620
don't have the the same definition I

5351
06:14:46,620 --> 06:14:48,600
think that most electrons are the

5352
06:14:48,600 --> 06:14:51,240
question I think that most are not the

5353
06:14:51,240 --> 06:14:54,660
highly motivated very good hacker most

5354
06:14:54,660 --> 06:14:58,920
at least for RDP attacks are kind of

5355
06:14:58,920 --> 06:15:00,860
basic opportunistics

5356
06:15:00,860 --> 06:15:03,660
attackers and and that's all so reaching

5357
06:15:03,660 --> 06:15:05,638
for the low hanging fruit yes if I can

5358
06:15:05,638 --> 06:15:07,260
just revert the question for you just

5359
06:15:07,260 --> 06:15:09,058
before we go to the other speakers is

5360
06:15:09,058 --> 06:15:11,700
how many attacks on your RDP were

5361
06:15:11,700 --> 06:15:13,558
actually really sophisticated you could

5362
06:15:13,558 --> 06:15:15,058
see a human who's behind the attack

5363
06:15:15,058 --> 06:15:17,280
really trying to get in it's hard I

5364
06:15:17,280 --> 06:15:21,058
cannot tell for sure uh like who is

5365
06:15:21,058 --> 06:15:23,638
human and who is not uh well every

5366
06:15:23,638 --> 06:15:25,440
there's a human behind the screen but I

5367
06:15:25,440 --> 06:15:28,320
mean you know and

5368
06:15:28,320 --> 06:15:31,620
I because I don't

5369
06:15:31,620 --> 06:15:35,160
I I like no I cannot tell I don't have

5370
06:15:35,160 --> 06:15:37,138
an answer for you because I can't tell I

5371
06:15:37,138 --> 06:15:38,340
guess it would be the ones who actually

5372
06:15:38,340 --> 06:15:40,378
compromise the systems and then started

5373
06:15:40,378 --> 06:15:42,000
to do things like watching yeah of

5374
06:15:42,000 --> 06:15:43,860
course they are human right because like

5375
06:15:43,860 --> 06:15:45,900
they were able to uh to compromise it

5376
06:15:45,900 --> 06:15:48,480
and and I see them I see their their

5377
06:15:48,480 --> 06:15:50,700
clicks their their keyboard and it's

5378
06:15:50,700 --> 06:15:53,160
obviously not a computer doing that uh

5379
06:15:53,160 --> 06:15:55,378
so of course there's well for those

5380
06:15:55,378 --> 06:15:57,660
people we have like 3

5381
06:15:57,660 --> 06:16:00,958
000 uh session like video uh different

5382
06:16:00,958 --> 06:16:04,558
video footage so there's at least 3 000

5383
06:16:04,558 --> 06:16:07,378
human and then from these three thousand

5384
06:16:07,378 --> 06:16:09,000
at your next presentation you'll be able

5385
06:16:09,000 --> 06:16:10,920
to let us know how many were

5386
06:16:10,920 --> 06:16:13,920
yes

5387
06:16:14,160 --> 06:16:16,378
what about you other

5388
06:16:16,378 --> 06:16:19,860
uh so I think for my research like I

5389
06:16:19,860 --> 06:16:22,138
would say like your top one percent of

5390
06:16:22,138 --> 06:16:24,540
ransomware creators would be very

5391
06:16:24,540 --> 06:16:26,280
sophisticated we can think of like the

5392
06:16:26,280 --> 06:16:29,340
writers of lockbid for one

5393
06:16:29,340 --> 06:16:31,260
um and like the top dogs well not dogs

5394
06:16:31,260 --> 06:16:33,480
but like top ones would be yes

5395
06:16:33,480 --> 06:16:36,240
sophisticated I don't think that the

5396
06:16:36,240 --> 06:16:38,040
affiliate and going down or as

5397
06:16:38,040 --> 06:16:39,660
sophisticated because they rely on other

5398
06:16:39,660 --> 06:16:42,000
people's product but I also think the

5399
06:16:42,000 --> 06:16:44,400
question should also be do they really

5400
06:16:44,400 --> 06:16:46,138
need to be sophisticated when their

5401
06:16:46,138 --> 06:16:49,740
target or not like if small hits are

5402
06:16:49,740 --> 06:16:51,840
still working like if you're basic

5403
06:16:51,840 --> 06:16:54,180
phishing attack still still works why

5404
06:16:54,180 --> 06:16:56,160
would you waste your time into something

5405
06:16:56,160 --> 06:16:58,200
that is going to cost you more money is

5406
06:16:58,200 --> 06:17:00,240
going to be harder to pull off and take

5407
06:17:00,240 --> 06:17:02,520
more time it would be probably smarter

5408
06:17:02,520 --> 06:17:04,680
if you want to if your intention is to

5409
06:17:04,680 --> 06:17:07,440
get money to hit in the path of least

5410
06:17:07,440 --> 06:17:09,718
resistance and sometimes sophistication

5411
06:17:09,718 --> 06:17:11,760
is not needed for for that kind of

5412
06:17:11,760 --> 06:17:14,340
attack so that would be my answer that's

5413
06:17:14,340 --> 06:17:16,820
a good point

5414
06:17:23,700 --> 06:17:25,700
um

5415
06:17:31,020 --> 06:17:34,020
subscribe

5416
06:17:37,720 --> 06:17:42,069
[Music]

5417
06:17:44,638 --> 06:17:47,458
and and maybe one last point is we've

5418
06:17:47,458 --> 06:17:49,138
seen a change and I think andrean's work

5419
06:17:49,138 --> 06:17:51,058
really showed it is we have this

5420
06:17:51,058 --> 06:17:53,400
professionalization of the attackers

5421
06:17:53,400 --> 06:17:55,378
where they're going to be attacking from

5422
06:17:55,378 --> 06:17:57,260
eight till four Monday through Friday

5423
06:17:57,260 --> 06:17:59,100
and there's this question of

5424
06:17:59,100 --> 06:18:01,680
relentlessness also so it's not someone

5425
06:18:01,680 --> 06:18:04,378
who's casually poking targets trying to

5426
06:18:04,378 --> 06:18:06,540
get in uh if you remember the movie

5427
06:18:06,540 --> 06:18:08,700
hackers great movie but they're just

5428
06:18:08,700 --> 06:18:10,378
poking around they stumble into

5429
06:18:10,378 --> 06:18:12,240
something but right now it's a bit more

5430
06:18:12,240 --> 06:18:14,280
coordinated we have state actors that

5431
06:18:14,280 --> 06:18:16,020
are attacking companies that are

5432
06:18:16,020 --> 06:18:17,820
attacking each other as well so I think

5433
06:18:17,820 --> 06:18:19,558
this professional aspect in this

5434
06:18:19,558 --> 06:18:21,660
organization doesn't mean they're more

5435
06:18:21,660 --> 06:18:23,458
sophisticated it's just they're more

5436
06:18:23,458 --> 06:18:26,160
organized and even if they're not better

5437
06:18:26,160 --> 06:18:27,540
than they used to be because they're

5438
06:18:27,540 --> 06:18:30,718
organized they can achieve more

5439
06:18:30,718 --> 06:18:32,878
true thank you

5440
06:18:32,878 --> 06:18:34,740
um I'll go with the questions from the

5441
06:18:34,740 --> 06:18:37,980
public and maybe jump in after that

5442
06:18:37,980 --> 06:18:38,700
um

5443
06:18:38,700 --> 06:18:41,218
David in Milani there is a question that

5444
06:18:41,218 --> 06:18:43,458
says

5445
06:18:51,480 --> 06:18:54,260
tough questions

5446
06:18:54,260 --> 06:18:56,820
the problem process the the pump

5447
06:18:56,820 --> 06:18:59,820
positions

5448
06:20:04,820 --> 06:20:07,378
you know

5449
06:20:07,378 --> 06:20:10,378
security

5450
06:20:20,100 --> 06:20:22,160
um

5451
06:21:16,500 --> 06:21:19,500
illegal

5452
06:21:47,340 --> 06:21:50,340
services

5453
06:22:08,540 --> 06:22:12,900
Wiki so um from somebody in the audience

5454
06:22:12,900 --> 06:22:14,280
do you think Game Theory could be

5455
06:22:14,280 --> 06:22:16,320
applied to analyze the tax and identify

5456
06:22:16,320 --> 06:22:20,180
potential false flag operations

5457
06:22:23,040 --> 06:22:25,980
I think you can but then it would also

5458
06:22:25,980 --> 06:22:29,280
be difficult because it's diff like what

5459
06:22:29,280 --> 06:22:31,860
we found with ransomware groups is that

5460
06:22:31,860 --> 06:22:34,020
they share a lot of similarities and how

5461
06:22:34,020 --> 06:22:37,320
they behave so then attributing who does

5462
06:22:37,320 --> 06:22:39,360
what becomes very difficult and you

5463
06:22:39,360 --> 06:22:42,000
can't know for a fact there's also a lot

5464
06:22:42,000 --> 06:22:45,180
of I'm gonna make this look like

5465
06:22:45,180 --> 06:22:47,340
somebody else did it so I can put the

5466
06:22:47,340 --> 06:22:48,958
blame on it this is often done for

5467
06:22:48,958 --> 06:22:51,000
political reason so when you're playing

5468
06:22:51,000 --> 06:22:52,798
with that and then trying to compare to

5469
06:22:52,798 --> 06:22:55,138
like with false positive

5470
06:22:55,138 --> 06:22:58,080
it could all you could do it but I don't

5471
06:22:58,080 --> 06:22:59,580
know if it would be the most efficient

5472
06:22:59,580 --> 06:23:02,458
way to use Game Theory what would be the

5473
06:23:02,458 --> 06:23:05,540
most efficient way to use Game Theory

5474
06:23:05,540 --> 06:23:08,340
in cyber security in cyber security okay

5475
06:23:08,340 --> 06:23:11,520
uh I do think that it's a good way to

5476
06:23:11,520 --> 06:23:14,218
use it when you're studying

5477
06:23:14,218 --> 06:23:16,378
um extortion

5478
06:23:16,378 --> 06:23:18,718
when you're looking at a conflict

5479
06:23:18,718 --> 06:23:21,540
head-on like I don't think fishing as a

5480
06:23:21,540 --> 06:23:22,798
whole could be like that would be a good

5481
06:23:22,798 --> 06:23:25,020
use of game theory ransomware is

5482
06:23:25,020 --> 06:23:26,580
interesting because there's that back

5483
06:23:26,580 --> 06:23:27,900
and forth in that I don't want to say

5484
06:23:27,900 --> 06:23:30,298
collaboration but you do need to

5485
06:23:30,298 --> 06:23:31,920
collaborate with the victim to get a

5486
06:23:31,920 --> 06:23:33,480
payment you there is that interaction

5487
06:23:33,480 --> 06:23:36,120
that can be studied so I think in crimes

5488
06:23:36,120 --> 06:23:39,780
where you need both parties to interact

5489
06:23:39,780 --> 06:23:41,878
with each other would be a good

5490
06:23:41,878 --> 06:23:45,480
um a good you know usage of Game Theory

5491
06:23:45,480 --> 06:23:48,320
yeah true thank you

5492
06:23:48,320 --> 06:23:49,920
Ariane

5493
06:23:49,920 --> 06:23:52,558
in your IPS you had Monaco do you know

5494
06:23:52,558 --> 06:23:55,638
why Monaco I don't know why

5495
06:23:55,638 --> 06:23:59,458
no I don't uh but you know this is also

5496
06:23:59,458 --> 06:24:02,520
a part of the next steps is to look at

5497
06:24:02,520 --> 06:24:06,780
uh shared IPS or very close IP from one

5498
06:24:06,780 --> 06:24:09,360
another and we want to investigate where

5499
06:24:09,360 --> 06:24:11,520
are from where our

5500
06:24:11,520 --> 06:24:14,280
yeah where are those IP and are they

5501
06:24:14,280 --> 06:24:18,600
from uh you know I the words is missing

5502
06:24:18,600 --> 06:24:21,900
uh but the the companies that are

5503
06:24:21,900 --> 06:24:25,080
specialized in like making the traffic

5504
06:24:25,080 --> 06:24:29,218
go through them so

5505
06:24:36,120 --> 06:24:39,240
like when you when there's company that

5506
06:24:39,240 --> 06:24:43,160
you can go to scream it yeah

5507
06:24:46,580 --> 06:24:50,580
a company that only is there to forward

5508
06:24:50,580 --> 06:24:54,080
traffic forward traffic yes

5509
06:24:55,218 --> 06:24:57,900
so it's not like from one computer but

5510
06:24:57,900 --> 06:25:02,100
from like a seller of practice so this

5511
06:25:02,100 --> 06:25:04,260
will be uh like this

5512
06:25:04,260 --> 06:25:07,440
we might be answering this question by

5513
06:25:07,440 --> 06:25:09,000
this because if it's a company of

5514
06:25:09,000 --> 06:25:10,798
proxies okay to determine whether or not

5515
06:25:10,798 --> 06:25:13,340
the tax that

5516
06:25:13,340 --> 06:25:15,600
proxies are not okay I see so

5517
06:25:15,600 --> 06:25:17,820
determining whether the where the IP

5518
06:25:17,820 --> 06:25:20,280
where the attack comes from whether it's

5519
06:25:20,280 --> 06:25:22,740
owned by a proxy server yes makes sense

5520
06:25:22,740 --> 06:25:24,780
yeah yeah sorry difficult to answer but

5521
06:25:24,780 --> 06:25:27,000
yes this is alignment

5522
06:25:27,000 --> 06:25:28,260
tell me

5523
06:25:28,260 --> 06:25:30,718
um somebody asked where were the

5524
06:25:30,718 --> 06:25:32,700
honeypots located did you like deploy

5525
06:25:32,700 --> 06:25:35,280
them all over the world or no they are

5526
06:25:35,280 --> 06:25:37,980
all located on

5527
06:25:37,980 --> 06:25:43,500
um on an awws uh

5528
06:25:43,980 --> 06:25:47,700
computer side in the United States

5529
06:25:47,700 --> 06:25:50,340
so this might change we want to well it

5530
06:25:50,340 --> 06:25:52,200
had been I know that Olivier already

5531
06:25:52,200 --> 06:25:54,900
tested like putting on airports a bit

5532
06:25:54,900 --> 06:25:58,020
everywhere in the world but he didn't

5533
06:25:58,020 --> 06:26:01,160
get like so much

5534
06:26:01,700 --> 06:26:04,680
conclusion from from it but I I would

5535
06:26:04,680 --> 06:26:07,260
like to do it again and look at the data

5536
06:26:07,260 --> 06:26:10,798
for myself to compare like uh if the if

5537
06:26:10,798 --> 06:26:12,840
the United States were targeted in this

5538
06:26:12,840 --> 06:26:15,600
uh in this case or if there's a

5539
06:26:15,600 --> 06:26:17,760
difference between the Olympus but they

5540
06:26:17,760 --> 06:26:19,440
were all in the same place for this

5541
06:26:19,440 --> 06:26:21,780
project interesting and it's true he did

5542
06:26:21,780 --> 06:26:24,600
try we did it for yeah we hosted

5543
06:26:24,600 --> 06:26:26,040
honeypots all over the world for another

5544
06:26:26,040 --> 06:26:27,840
research project and we thought that it

5545
06:26:27,840 --> 06:26:29,340
would be different but it was not at the

5546
06:26:29,340 --> 06:26:31,378
end it was just the same thing so I'd be

5547
06:26:31,378 --> 06:26:33,000
wondering whether RDP honeypots would

5548
06:26:33,000 --> 06:26:35,580
have different findings

5549
06:26:35,580 --> 06:26:37,138
um maybe one last question that I would

5550
06:26:37,138 --> 06:26:39,540
ask you all is if I gave you the

5551
06:26:39,540 --> 06:26:42,298
opportunity to do research with the

5552
06:26:42,298 --> 06:26:44,218
millions of dollars I have and

5553
06:26:44,218 --> 06:26:46,798
absolutely no let's say absolutely no

5554
06:26:46,798 --> 06:26:48,958
headaches in the sense that

5555
06:26:48,958 --> 06:26:50,940
um you can do the research you want and

5556
06:26:50,940 --> 06:26:52,620
so the research questions that you you

5557
06:26:52,620 --> 06:26:55,080
can and reach the study population that

5558
06:26:55,080 --> 06:26:58,798
you want whom would you uh reach what

5559
06:26:58,798 --> 06:27:00,480
would you study to answer the research

5560
06:27:00,480 --> 06:27:02,160
questions that you have answered today

5561
06:27:02,160 --> 06:27:04,798
and why because what I'm seeing is in

5562
06:27:04,798 --> 06:27:06,540
criminology and another research that we

5563
06:27:06,540 --> 06:27:09,420
do we're stuck doing secondary like data

5564
06:27:09,420 --> 06:27:11,940
analysis on secondary data from white

5565
06:27:11,940 --> 06:27:13,138
papers

5566
06:27:13,138 --> 06:27:14,940
um from for example interviewing people

5567
06:27:14,940 --> 06:27:17,160
who have like heard about it or seen it

5568
06:27:17,160 --> 06:27:18,840
but haven't used it for the purpose that

5569
06:27:18,840 --> 06:27:21,420
we want uh to study so I'm just

5570
06:27:21,420 --> 06:27:23,340
wondering if I ever you could do a

5571
06:27:23,340 --> 06:27:24,660
research to answer your research

5572
06:27:24,660 --> 06:27:25,980
questions reaching a certain population

5573
06:27:25,980 --> 06:27:28,798
what would it be

5574
06:27:28,798 --> 06:27:30,840
and I gave you my funding like my

5575
06:27:30,840 --> 06:27:33,058
million Foundation dollar

5576
06:27:33,058 --> 06:27:35,100
and we have no problems with ethics no

5577
06:27:35,100 --> 06:27:36,480
problem

5578
06:27:36,480 --> 06:27:38,638
and that's the hard part honestly this

5579
06:27:38,638 --> 06:27:41,120
never happens

5580
06:27:44,480 --> 06:27:46,980
for sure

5581
06:27:46,980 --> 06:27:49,740
so so to me the it's this whole class of

5582
06:27:49,740 --> 06:27:52,558
enablers basically you know people who

5583
06:27:52,558 --> 06:27:55,440
enable others to do crime I think these

5584
06:27:55,440 --> 06:27:58,020
are the most interesting people we

5585
06:27:58,020 --> 06:28:01,378
barely managed to talk to interview and

5586
06:28:01,378 --> 06:28:03,120
trying to understand who they are where

5587
06:28:03,120 --> 06:28:05,280
they're coming from what their goals are

5588
06:28:05,280 --> 06:28:07,558
are they happy we don't know

5589
06:28:07,558 --> 06:28:10,558
um one of my students she spent months

5590
06:28:10,558 --> 06:28:13,740
hanging out on different forums exploit

5591
06:28:13,740 --> 06:28:17,520
xss and alligator and other forums and

5592
06:28:17,520 --> 06:28:20,100
she managed to interview 18 Russian

5593
06:28:20,100 --> 06:28:21,958
hackers which was really quite

5594
06:28:21,958 --> 06:28:24,120
interesting but that was months and

5595
06:28:24,120 --> 06:28:26,160
months of efforts and trying to

5596
06:28:26,160 --> 06:28:28,500
understand kind of you know what so we

5597
06:28:28,500 --> 06:28:30,120
asked them you know what are the three

5598
06:28:30,120 --> 06:28:31,860
skills that you need to be a good hacker

5599
06:28:31,860 --> 06:28:34,020
and where did you learn them and that's

5600
06:28:34,020 --> 06:28:35,940
the kind of stuff that I really like it

5601
06:28:35,940 --> 06:28:38,580
takes forever to earn their trust and to

5602
06:28:38,580 --> 06:28:39,840
just be there and that would be

5603
06:28:39,840 --> 06:28:42,120
something if I could not I don't I

5604
06:28:42,120 --> 06:28:43,920
wouldn't want millions of dollars I

5605
06:28:43,920 --> 06:28:45,958
would want a time machine so I can fast

5606
06:28:45,958 --> 06:28:47,760
forward through all that part and get to

5607
06:28:47,760 --> 06:28:49,860
the juicy stuff at the end

5608
06:28:49,860 --> 06:28:53,160
interesting who else

5609
06:28:53,160 --> 06:28:56,280
okay so I have so many ideas and since

5610
06:28:56,280 --> 06:28:58,440
ethics is not a problem I'm gonna go

5611
06:28:58,440 --> 06:29:00,780
with the real one so what I would really

5612
06:29:00,780 --> 06:29:03,360
want to do if I if ethics and or none of

5613
06:29:03,360 --> 06:29:05,940
that was that a problem I would want to

5614
06:29:05,940 --> 06:29:09,718
do group interviews in one room and you

5615
06:29:09,718 --> 06:29:12,480
put all of like sandworm all the apts

5616
06:29:12,480 --> 06:29:15,660
like from Russia from Iran from China

5617
06:29:15,660 --> 06:29:18,298
from you know North Korea put them all

5618
06:29:18,298 --> 06:29:21,500
in the room and then no agent anywhere

5619
06:29:21,500 --> 06:29:23,760
obviously and then I would just ask all

5620
06:29:23,760 --> 06:29:25,138
the questions about the Rules of

5621
06:29:25,138 --> 06:29:27,180
Engagement and the tools for Espionage

5622
06:29:27,180 --> 06:29:28,740
because I think that would be so

5623
06:29:28,740 --> 06:29:32,878
interesting uh to study from inside of

5624
06:29:32,878 --> 06:29:34,320
how things are happening because apt

5625
06:29:34,320 --> 06:29:36,000
groups so far have been one of those

5626
06:29:36,000 --> 06:29:39,420
things that are really hard to study

5627
06:29:39,420 --> 06:29:41,760
um because you can't get it close so

5628
06:29:41,760 --> 06:29:44,280
that's what I would do

5629
06:29:44,280 --> 06:29:46,558
that would cost a lot well you said

5630
06:29:46,558 --> 06:29:49,260
millions I mean like

5631
06:29:49,260 --> 06:29:51,360
Marianne what's your dream research so

5632
06:29:51,360 --> 06:29:55,080
call me not creative but I cannot think

5633
06:29:55,080 --> 06:29:58,020
of any other project that what we are

5634
06:29:58,020 --> 06:30:00,958
doing right now with like kind of

5635
06:30:00,958 --> 06:30:03,020
looking like

5636
06:30:03,020 --> 06:30:05,878
with the video footage of what they do

5637
06:30:05,878 --> 06:30:07,620
of what the hacker do once they

5638
06:30:07,620 --> 06:30:09,860
compromise the computer I would just

5639
06:30:09,860 --> 06:30:13,860
expand this a thousand times and and and

5640
06:30:13,860 --> 06:30:16,138
look at the footage for like hours I

5641
06:30:16,138 --> 06:30:18,360
love I love video footage are you doing

5642
06:30:18,360 --> 06:30:20,780
your dream research I think so

5643
06:30:20,780 --> 06:30:24,360
yeah for my PhD I I looked at the

5644
06:30:24,360 --> 06:30:26,878
footage of like the police interviews

5645
06:30:26,878 --> 06:30:29,100
and things like that and I loved it and

5646
06:30:29,100 --> 06:30:31,320
you know I know how to uh to study that

5647
06:30:31,320 --> 06:30:35,100
so I really liked it's a bit voir to

5648
06:30:35,100 --> 06:30:37,080
like look at like they don't know we're

5649
06:30:37,080 --> 06:30:38,520
looking at them and they're like

5650
06:30:38,520 --> 06:30:40,558
compromising computers and I kind of

5651
06:30:40,558 --> 06:30:43,920
like it and so nice interesting so yeah

5652
06:30:43,920 --> 06:30:48,440
Melanie do you want to add something uh

5653
06:31:01,160 --> 06:31:04,280
this is

5654
06:31:07,860 --> 06:31:09,920
um

5655
06:31:20,520 --> 06:31:24,298
it is um on my side I'll share just

5656
06:31:24,298 --> 06:31:27,480
because I can I think I I'd wanna I

5657
06:31:27,480 --> 06:31:28,980
think I'd want to chill with hackers

5658
06:31:28,980 --> 06:31:30,958
yeah but real ones like in the sense of

5659
06:31:30,958 --> 06:31:33,058
in Eastern Europe or in Russia and see

5660
06:31:33,058 --> 06:31:34,798
what's their reality and understand how

5661
06:31:34,798 --> 06:31:36,298
and why they participate in such

5662
06:31:36,298 --> 06:31:38,878
activity and with no judgment and when I

5663
06:31:38,878 --> 06:31:40,378
say chill with them is basically just

5664
06:31:40,378 --> 06:31:42,058
talk and that's why it's hard with

5665
06:31:42,058 --> 06:31:44,458
ethics because then you gotta explain

5666
06:31:44,458 --> 06:31:46,378
that you're not looking at them but you

5667
06:31:46,378 --> 06:31:47,940
also are interacting with them so you're

5668
06:31:47,940 --> 06:31:50,878
having an impact on them I mean we could

5669
06:31:50,878 --> 06:31:52,680
share the project and then we pick a

5670
06:31:52,680 --> 06:31:54,780
nice destination with a beach somewhere

5671
06:31:54,780 --> 06:31:56,580
yeah combine all of them together we

5672
06:31:56,580 --> 06:31:58,500
study them we hang out and then have a

5673
06:31:58,500 --> 06:32:00,058
nice vacation because like Hey we're not

5674
06:32:00,058 --> 06:32:02,218

speaker for numerous security

5699
06:48:46,020 --> 06:48:48,420
conferences around the globe so please

5700
06:48:48,420 --> 06:48:51,540
welcome Magno and there you go hello

5701
06:48:51,540 --> 06:48:53,340
hello thank you

5702
06:48:53,340 --> 06:48:55,740
thanks everyone

5703
06:48:55,740 --> 06:48:58,080
so yeah uh today we're gonna talk about

5704
06:48:58,080 --> 06:49:01,378
GitHub uh just abusing GitHub for Fun

5705
06:49:01,378 --> 06:49:04,020
and Profit actions and code space

5706
06:49:04,020 --> 06:49:06,958
security I'll focus more on the actions

5707
06:49:06,958 --> 06:49:09,298
part the code spaces is a research that

5708
06:49:09,298 --> 06:49:11,400
I did together with my teammate nitesh

5709
06:49:11,400 --> 06:49:13,740
I'll present a few things at the end and

5710
06:49:13,740 --> 06:49:15,958
there is more stuff coming up in the

5711
06:49:15,958 --> 06:49:17,638
next few conferences as well we have

5712
06:49:17,638 --> 06:49:21,840
another talk in NDC Oslo in Norway next

5713
06:49:21,840 --> 06:49:26,120
week so just stay tuned for that

5714
06:49:26,160 --> 06:49:27,360
um so yeah just a little bit about

5715
06:49:27,360 --> 06:49:30,600
myself uh originally from Brazil been in

5716
06:49:30,600 --> 06:49:33,360
Canada for five years now and I'm part

5717
06:49:33,360 --> 06:49:35,520
of the nebula cloud and container

5718
06:49:35,520 --> 06:49:38,218
research team uh I have a Blog there

5719
06:49:38,218 --> 06:49:40,920
called Katana security it's currently

5720
06:49:40,920 --> 06:49:43,138
offline now but yeah I should probably

5721
06:49:43,138 --> 06:49:45,958
restart it and I'm also an instructor at

5722
06:49:45,958 --> 06:49:48,000
go hacking it's a cyber security company

5723
06:49:48,000 --> 06:49:50,638
back in Brazil we provide intermediate

5724
06:49:50,638 --> 06:49:53,580
to Advanced trainings in cyber security

5725
06:49:53,580 --> 06:49:55,378
and we're trying to bring that those

5726
06:49:55,378 --> 06:49:58,020
trainings uh to Canada and in English as

5727
06:49:58,020 --> 06:49:59,760
well so there's a like live and online

5728
06:49:59,760 --> 06:50:02,878
trainings but yeah the best way to reach

5729
06:50:02,878 --> 06:50:04,798
out to me is through the LinkedIn this

5730
06:50:04,798 --> 06:50:06,600
is the QR code if you want to scan it

5731
06:50:06,600 --> 06:50:08,458
feel free I I guarantee there's no

5732
06:50:08,458 --> 06:50:10,978
malware there so yeah on this one at

5733
06:50:10,978 --> 06:50:13,579
least but yeah

5734
06:50:14,400 --> 06:50:16,260
so yeah these are the topics for today

5735
06:50:16,260 --> 06:50:18,718
I'll try to go over them really quickly

5736
06:50:18,718 --> 06:50:21,718
since the the time is short but if you

5737
06:50:21,718 --> 06:50:24,240
want to learn more uh This research that

5738
06:50:24,240 --> 06:50:27,120
I've did around GitHub actions I took

5739
06:50:27,120 --> 06:50:30,000
about at least uh three to four months

5740
06:50:30,000 --> 06:50:31,798
doing the research and then writing this

5741
06:50:31,798 --> 06:50:33,780
blog posts there's a lot of content

5742
06:50:33,780 --> 06:50:35,160
there that I won't be able to cover

5743
06:50:35,160 --> 06:50:37,680
everything here in this talk but yeah

5744
06:50:37,680 --> 06:50:40,320
Special thanks to uh Felipe proteos a

5745
06:50:40,320 --> 06:50:42,000
friend of mine who helped me with this

5746
06:50:42,000 --> 06:50:44,580
research as well

5747
06:50:44,580 --> 06:50:49,138
okay so who here has used GitHub actions

5748
06:50:49,138 --> 06:50:51,120
okay a few hands

5749
06:50:51,120 --> 06:50:54,298
who here uses it in production

5750
06:50:54,298 --> 06:50:56,760
last okay who here has played with

5751
06:50:56,760 --> 06:50:58,138
GitHub

5752
06:50:58,138 --> 06:51:00,298
yeah okay that's so respecting that's

5753
06:51:00,298 --> 06:51:03,660
fine uh but yeah if you if you work with

5754
06:51:03,660 --> 06:51:07,740
CI CD tools things like Jenkins GitHub

5755
06:51:07,740 --> 06:51:10,080
actions is that has a similar approach

5756
06:51:10,080 --> 06:51:12,718
but in a way that you don't need a

5757
06:51:12,718 --> 06:51:14,520
separate server or separate environment

5758
06:51:14,520 --> 06:51:15,558
to

5759
06:51:15,558 --> 06:51:18,660
do some automation your CI CD you know

5760
06:51:18,660 --> 06:51:20,160
continuous integration continuous

5761
06:51:20,160 --> 06:51:21,540
deployment

5762
06:51:21,540 --> 06:51:22,280
um

5763
06:51:22,280 --> 06:51:25,740
and basically the idea is that you have

5764
06:51:25,740 --> 06:51:29,100
a file inside your repo and whenever

5765
06:51:29,100 --> 06:51:31,320
there is an event something that happens

5766
06:51:31,320 --> 06:51:33,360
inside your repo it can be like a push

5767
06:51:33,360 --> 06:51:35,940
or a pull request or something changes

5768
06:51:35,940 --> 06:51:39,058
there that triggers this event and this

5769
06:51:39,058 --> 06:51:43,320
event spins up or actually assigns uh VM

5770
06:51:43,320 --> 06:51:45,540
that's running inside Azure right since

5771
06:51:45,540 --> 06:51:48,600
GitHub is now owned by Microsoft and

5772
06:51:48,600 --> 06:51:50,580
these VMS there is no there are no

5773
06:51:50,580 --> 06:51:51,900
content they're not containers they're

5774
06:51:51,900 --> 06:51:54,200
virtual machines they're called Runners

5775
06:51:54,200 --> 06:51:57,900
so each a job or automation that you

5776
06:51:57,900 --> 06:52:00,058
have which are a series of steps or

5777
06:52:00,058 --> 06:52:03,080
scripts they spin up their own Runners

5778
06:52:03,080 --> 06:52:06,000
and inside those Runners inside those

5779
06:52:06,000 --> 06:52:09,000
jobs you can run scripts you can run

5780
06:52:09,000 --> 06:52:11,820
commands and you can also run other

5781
06:52:11,820 --> 06:52:14,160
actions so inside your action you can

5782
06:52:14,160 --> 06:52:16,820
call other actions

5783
06:52:16,820 --> 06:52:20,400
so there is some dependency there and

5784
06:52:20,400 --> 06:52:22,740
there's three kinds of runners that you

5785
06:52:22,740 --> 06:52:24,660
can have you can have like a Windows

5786
06:52:24,660 --> 06:52:27,540
Linux which is based on Ubuntu or Mac OS

5787
06:52:27,540 --> 06:52:30,058
so you can do that and these are

5788
06:52:30,058 --> 06:52:32,700
provided by GitHub so these are any

5789
06:52:32,700 --> 06:52:35,458
account any free account today you can

5790
06:52:35,458 --> 06:52:38,218
leverage actions of course there is a

5791
06:52:38,218 --> 06:52:40,620
limit I believe there are 30 hours per

5792
06:52:40,620 --> 06:52:44,298
month but you can use those today

5793
06:52:45,900 --> 06:52:48,240
of the

5794
06:52:48,240 --> 06:52:51,540
I guess the high high adoption rate for

5795
06:52:51,540 --> 06:52:53,878
GitHub actions one of the reasons is

5796
06:52:53,878 --> 06:52:55,620
because it's free of course people like

5797
06:52:55,620 --> 06:52:57,840
free stuff but also because of the

5798
06:52:57,840 --> 06:53:00,180
marketplace uh the marketplace is

5799
06:53:00,180 --> 06:53:02,820
basically uh anyone can develop their

5800
06:53:02,820 --> 06:53:04,680
own actions and provide it make it

5801
06:53:04,680 --> 06:53:06,718
available on the marketplace so people

5802
06:53:06,718 --> 06:53:09,000
can use it you know avoid Reinventing

5803
06:53:09,000 --> 06:53:11,700
the wheel and so companies are

5804
06:53:11,700 --> 06:53:13,978
developing their own like plugins and

5805
06:53:13,978 --> 06:53:16,020
providing that on the marketplace and I

5806
06:53:16,020 --> 06:53:17,458
think this number is already higher

5807
06:53:17,458 --> 06:53:19,260
today and

5808
06:53:19,260 --> 06:53:22,740
um so yeah it's rapidly increasing so

5809
06:53:22,740 --> 06:53:24,540
people are making available automation

5810
06:53:24,540 --> 06:53:26,940
where you don't need to write your own

5811
06:53:26,940 --> 06:53:28,978
action basically you just need to call

5812
06:53:28,978 --> 06:53:31,920
other people's other tools and and

5813
06:53:31,920 --> 06:53:33,780
integrate on your pipeline on your

5814
06:53:33,780 --> 06:53:36,440
Repository

5815
06:53:36,958 --> 06:53:41,400
okay but if anyone can upload actions

5816
06:53:41,400 --> 06:53:43,620
what happens if attackers also do that

5817
06:53:43,620 --> 06:53:46,320
what if I'm a malicious user and I

5818
06:53:46,320 --> 06:53:49,798
upload something to uh to GitHub there

5819
06:53:49,798 --> 06:53:52,500
is no today as far as I know there's no

5820
06:53:52,500 --> 06:53:55,080
security process uh being done around

5821
06:53:55,080 --> 06:53:57,240
GitHub actions there is no verification

5822
06:53:57,240 --> 06:54:00,620
so if I upload a malicious actions there

5823
06:54:00,620 --> 06:54:04,080
there is no checks or anything being

5824
06:54:04,080 --> 06:54:07,218
done in that front

5825
06:54:09,360 --> 06:54:12,298
so what our attackers are doing in that

5826
06:54:12,298 --> 06:54:15,058
uh sense basically they're abusing

5827
06:54:15,058 --> 06:54:17,878
GitHub actions to mine cryptocurrency

5828
06:54:17,878 --> 06:54:20,700
right it's free money so if I have 30

5829
06:54:20,700 --> 06:54:23,280
hours uh this is basically one of the

5830
06:54:23,280 --> 06:54:26,280
yemo scripts that uh of one of the

5831
06:54:26,280 --> 06:54:27,718
actions that I've analyzed there's

5832
06:54:27,718 --> 06:54:30,058
hundreds of those still today available

5833
06:54:30,058 --> 06:54:32,400
on GitHub and basically what they're

5834
06:54:32,400 --> 06:54:34,440
doing at the end here you can see that

5835
06:54:34,440 --> 06:54:38,400
they're running a node.exe accent rig so

5836
06:54:38,400 --> 06:54:41,218
usually Monero crypto Miner uh and and

5837
06:54:41,218 --> 06:54:43,200
then the username and stuff so I'm not

5838
06:54:43,200 --> 06:54:46,020
not big on crypto but yeah this is what

5839
06:54:46,020 --> 06:54:48,840
you're doing uh some of the attackers

5840
06:54:48,840 --> 06:54:54,020
they're even uh limiting the CPU

5841
06:54:54,020 --> 06:54:56,700
percentage to avoid detection so some

5842
06:54:56,700 --> 06:54:58,558
attackers they in this command they have

5843
06:54:58,558 --> 06:55:01,798
like a limited 70 to avoid being

5844
06:55:01,798 --> 06:55:03,360
detected

5845
06:55:03,360 --> 06:55:06,120
uh this top thing here the strategy is

5846
06:55:06,120 --> 06:55:09,058
basically to parallel to scale your

5847
06:55:09,058 --> 06:55:12,120
actions and maybe deploy uh different

5848
06:55:12,120 --> 06:55:14,340
Runners at the same time to you know

5849
06:55:14,340 --> 06:55:17,940
make more money more faster and this

5850
06:55:17,940 --> 06:55:21,600
part here is that I'm using third-party

5851
06:55:21,600 --> 06:55:24,718
actions so this uses parameter it's like

5852
06:55:24,718 --> 06:55:26,458
I'm calling a third party action and

5853
06:55:26,458 --> 06:55:29,160
this one is actually provided by GitHub

5854
06:55:29,160 --> 06:55:31,320
basically to download the code of your

5855
06:55:31,320 --> 06:55:33,958
repo inside that VM inside that Runner

5856
06:55:33,958 --> 06:55:36,298
but this one here it's not it's not

5857
06:55:36,298 --> 06:55:37,798
provided by GitHub it's a third party

5858
06:55:37,798 --> 06:55:40,378
action by someone else someone made an

5859
06:55:40,378 --> 06:55:44,040
action to retry your action in case it

5860
06:55:44,040 --> 06:55:47,280
fails but attackers already are using

5861
06:55:47,280 --> 06:55:49,020
that they're leveraging this third party

5862
06:55:49,020 --> 06:55:52,020
action which is a legitimate action to

5863
06:55:52,020 --> 06:55:53,820
their own gains to their own profit

5864
06:55:53,820 --> 06:55:56,520
right so this is really interesting and

5865
06:55:56,520 --> 06:55:58,558
in here of course they're abusing like a

5866
06:55:58,558 --> 06:56:00,900
Windows Runner but I have more examples

5867
06:56:00,900 --> 06:56:06,558
of uh Linux and Mac OS as well

5868
06:56:07,020 --> 06:56:09,420
so yeah I've analyzed this third-party

5869
06:56:09,420 --> 06:56:11,160
GitHub action and it's actually a

5870
06:56:11,160 --> 06:56:13,440
legitimate one and attackers are using

5871
06:56:13,440 --> 06:56:15,840
that for their own gains so it which is

5872
06:56:15,840 --> 06:56:19,080
interesting because it's like they know

5873
06:56:19,080 --> 06:56:21,840
better than us who are trying to build

5874
06:56:21,840 --> 06:56:24,360
pipelines and use actions they're

5875
06:56:24,360 --> 06:56:26,700
they're doing it better than us here

5876
06:56:26,700 --> 06:56:29,520
and of course the node.exe there was a

5877
06:56:29,520 --> 06:56:32,160
malicious file uh it was flagged by by

5878
06:56:32,160 --> 06:56:34,260
various Toto and and things like that so

5879
06:56:34,260 --> 06:56:37,440
yeah bad bad thing

5880
06:56:37,440 --> 06:56:39,420
another example here

5881
06:56:39,420 --> 06:56:41,820
Now using Powershell it's still with

5882
06:56:41,820 --> 06:56:44,100
Windows Runners and this script is

5883
06:56:44,100 --> 06:56:46,378
really interesting because I found

5884
06:56:46,378 --> 06:56:49,978
hundreds of examples on off scripts of

5885
06:56:49,978 --> 06:56:54,600
repositories uh with the exact same code

5886
06:56:54,600 --> 06:56:56,878
um so basically yeah downloading the

5887
06:56:56,878 --> 06:56:59,218
crypto Miner and then extracting the

5888
06:56:59,218 --> 06:57:01,798
file and running there so

5889
06:57:01,798 --> 06:57:05,638
um pretty like basic stuff but they're

5890
06:57:05,638 --> 06:57:07,320
they're making free money right whatever

5891
06:57:07,320 --> 06:57:10,798
until the GitHub security team can flag

5892
06:57:10,798 --> 06:57:13,260
and can monitor that for any suspicious

5893
06:57:13,260 --> 06:57:17,280
activity they're making free money

5894
06:57:17,280 --> 06:57:19,200
um so these are some of the examples of

5895
06:57:19,200 --> 06:57:21,000
the repos with the same code there is

5896
06:57:21,000 --> 06:57:23,160
probably a hundred more we reported

5897
06:57:23,160 --> 06:57:25,798
those to GitHub uh I think they took it

5898
06:57:25,798 --> 06:57:28,080
down pretty much most of these but if

5899
06:57:28,080 --> 06:57:32,400
not uh the attackers were able to uh

5900
06:57:32,400 --> 06:57:34,620
uh just create a new user create the

5901
06:57:34,620 --> 06:57:37,680
same repo or new repo and then start you

5902
06:57:37,680 --> 06:57:39,718
know mining things again so it's just

5903
06:57:39,718 --> 06:57:41,940
like a cat and mouse Chase in this

5904
06:57:41,940 --> 06:57:44,280
scenario because it's like yeah it's

5905
06:57:44,280 --> 06:57:47,100
it's hard to block and

5906
06:57:47,100 --> 06:57:49,260
um especially when they block the

5907
06:57:49,260 --> 06:57:51,180
actions they block that specific rep

5908
06:57:51,180 --> 06:57:53,878
repo so they don't block the user itself

5909
06:57:53,878 --> 06:57:56,218
so if the user creates another repo they

5910
06:57:56,218 --> 06:57:59,218
can still leverage GitHub actions to

5911
06:57:59,218 --> 06:58:01,940
continue mining

5912
06:58:02,820 --> 06:58:05,280
some other examples here now using Linux

5913
06:58:05,280 --> 06:58:07,860
same thing uh just downloading

5914
06:58:07,860 --> 06:58:11,160
extracting the the crypto Miner and then

5915
06:58:11,160 --> 06:58:14,458
and running there XM rig again so you

5916
06:58:14,458 --> 06:58:17,040
can find that even just doing basic

5917
06:58:17,040 --> 06:58:20,458
search on GitHub if you look for XM rig

5918
06:58:20,458 --> 06:58:24,660
where it's inside the dot GitHub slash

5919
06:58:24,660 --> 06:58:27,298
workflows directory the Slash the the

5920
06:58:27,298 --> 06:58:29,760
folder where you're supposed to store

5921
06:58:29,760 --> 06:58:32,340
your your actions your automations just

5922
06:58:32,340 --> 06:58:33,840
search for XM rig and you're probably

5923
06:58:33,840 --> 06:58:36,478
gonna find some examples there and and

5924
06:58:36,478 --> 06:58:40,080
yeah similar way to just mining uh

5925
06:58:40,080 --> 06:58:42,600
cryptocurrencies

5926
06:58:42,600 --> 06:58:45,020
and the latest example that I have here

5927
06:58:45,020 --> 06:58:48,660
and uh it's from abusing Mac OS as I

5928
06:58:48,660 --> 06:58:51,718
said you can also run a Mac OS run or

5929
06:58:51,718 --> 06:58:54,718
Macos VM inside uh through the GitHub

5930
06:58:54,718 --> 06:58:57,420
actions which runs on Azure but this one

5931
06:58:57,420 --> 06:58:59,638
is like okay yeah this seems like a

5932
06:58:59,638 --> 06:59:01,680
legitimate thing I don't know core book

5933
06:59:01,680 --> 06:59:05,878
whatever it's uh Chinese I guess but

5934
06:59:05,878 --> 06:59:06,540
um

5935
06:59:06,540 --> 06:59:08,458
oh yeah you can run there is some

5936
06:59:08,458 --> 06:59:11,100
instructions there but when you go to

5937
06:59:11,100 --> 06:59:14,218
check the yaml file that's where it

5938
06:59:14,218 --> 06:59:16,558
shows exactly what it's happening right

5939
06:59:16,558 --> 06:59:19,620
you can see that there is XM rig no fee

5940
06:59:19,620 --> 06:59:21,780
and there is a file there as well I

5941
06:59:21,780 --> 06:59:24,180
think yeah XM read no feed down here

5942
06:59:24,180 --> 06:59:26,340
right so that's the one the file that

5943
06:59:26,340 --> 06:59:28,978
it's using uh but basically yeah it's a

5944
06:59:28,978 --> 06:59:32,340
crypto Miner I I'm not a Mac OS expert

5945
06:59:32,340 --> 06:59:34,740
but I asked my uh Help From My Team

5946
06:59:34,740 --> 06:59:37,740
there to analyze the the binary and it's

5947
06:59:37,740 --> 06:59:40,558
definitely a crypto Miner as well so not

5948
06:59:40,558 --> 06:59:42,360
a good idea not not a good not a

5949
06:59:42,360 --> 06:59:44,160
legitimate file so I'm not sure why

5950
06:59:44,160 --> 06:59:46,920
they're doing this core book Hackintosh

5951
06:59:46,920 --> 06:59:49,080
right they name it like this but they

5952
06:59:49,080 --> 06:59:51,298
always try as you can see in the

5953
06:59:51,298 --> 06:59:53,040
previous examples they're always trying

5954
06:59:53,040 --> 06:59:55,620
to you know make it

5955
06:59:55,620 --> 06:59:58,740
sound legitimate I don't know why but

5956
06:59:58,740 --> 07:00:01,920
yeah the name CI CD there run tests

5957
07:00:01,920 --> 07:00:04,440
things like that to try to mask it but

5958
07:00:04,440 --> 07:00:06,718
it's not it's not that uh it's not that

5959
07:00:06,718 --> 07:00:09,320
great right

5960
07:00:10,320 --> 07:00:12,558
okay

5961
07:00:12,958 --> 07:00:14,878
so

5962
07:00:14,878 --> 07:00:18,540
if you ever see this on a GitHub action

5963
07:00:18,540 --> 07:00:21,600
if you go to the to the tab there and

5964
07:00:21,600 --> 07:00:23,458
you see GitHub action discolorantly

5965
07:00:23,458 --> 07:00:26,100
disabled for this repository it probably

5966
07:00:26,100 --> 07:00:28,440
means that they did something bad with

5967
07:00:28,440 --> 07:00:30,900
that repo and and that's blocked because

5968
07:00:30,900 --> 07:00:33,000
okay now you're not allowed to deploy

5969
07:00:33,000 --> 07:00:36,840
the VMS the runners inside uh Azure to

5970
07:00:36,840 --> 07:00:39,620
run your automation right but as I said

5971
07:00:39,620 --> 07:00:43,740
if you create a new repo and then that

5972
07:00:43,740 --> 07:00:46,638
repo is allowed to deploy actions again

5973
07:00:46,638 --> 07:00:50,700
so it's not it's not really effective in

5974
07:00:50,700 --> 07:00:52,558
a way that okay the attackers can just

5975
07:00:52,558 --> 07:00:55,080
create new repositories and then start

5976
07:00:55,080 --> 07:00:59,180
mining cryptocurrency again

5977
07:01:02,100 --> 07:01:05,280
just another example here

5978
07:01:05,280 --> 07:01:06,540
okay

5979
07:01:06,540 --> 07:01:10,620
so after this introduction basically my

5980
07:01:10,620 --> 07:01:13,138
research the focus of my research was

5981
07:01:13,138 --> 07:01:16,558
the main focus was on malicious GitHub

5982
07:01:16,558 --> 07:01:19,260
actions right third party as I said you

5983
07:01:19,260 --> 07:01:21,900
can Leverage The Marketplace to use

5984
07:01:21,900 --> 07:01:23,940
GitHub action developed by other people

5985
07:01:23,940 --> 07:01:27,240
but what happens if this other people is

5986
07:01:27,240 --> 07:01:29,340
a malicious user

5987
07:01:29,340 --> 07:01:32,400
so what I did was I created a separate

5988
07:01:32,400 --> 07:01:35,760
action in another repo and I try to call

5989
07:01:35,760 --> 07:01:38,160
it from my own repo that that was the

5990
07:01:38,160 --> 07:01:40,320
goal of my research of course I didn't

5991
07:01:40,320 --> 07:01:42,840
upload to the marketplace otherwise I

5992
07:01:42,840 --> 07:01:45,840
would get fired but but yeah

5993
07:01:45,840 --> 07:01:49,620
um so the idea is you have to treat your

5994
07:01:49,620 --> 07:01:51,180
GitHub actions as a third-party

5995
07:01:51,180 --> 07:01:53,820
dependency right just like you have with

5996
07:01:53,820 --> 07:01:57,120
your libraries in your code that you

5997
07:01:57,120 --> 07:01:58,978
import a lot of libraries and you don't

5998
07:01:58,978 --> 07:02:01,138
know where they're from basically you

5999
07:02:01,138 --> 07:02:03,840
need to treat your actions like this uh

6000
07:02:03,840 --> 07:02:06,900
a few things here to highlight is there

6001
07:02:06,900 --> 07:02:11,160
is uh one validation from GitHub that

6002
07:02:11,160 --> 07:02:13,558
checks uh the creator of the GitHub

6003
07:02:13,558 --> 07:02:15,958
action so you can see here this blue

6004
07:02:15,958 --> 07:02:17,878
check mark it's not like the Twitter

6005
07:02:17,878 --> 07:02:20,580
check mark if you pay you get it no uh

6006
07:02:20,580 --> 07:02:22,260
basically it's just a domain validation

6007
07:02:22,260 --> 07:02:25,500
from the the company or the user so most

6008
07:02:25,500 --> 07:02:27,180
of the companies will try to get this

6009
07:02:27,180 --> 07:02:30,000
one but again this is not security

6010
07:02:30,000 --> 07:02:31,978
verification it doesn't mean that the

6011
07:02:31,978 --> 07:02:34,378
action was checked for you know any

6012
07:02:34,378 --> 07:02:37,920
malware backdoors crypto miners

6013
07:02:37,920 --> 07:02:40,260
and the other example there is that

6014
07:02:40,260 --> 07:02:42,000
every action

6015
07:02:42,000 --> 07:02:45,120
is a public repository so when you're

6016
07:02:45,120 --> 07:02:47,638
calling actions over there with uses

6017
07:02:47,638 --> 07:02:50,760
actions checkout you can actually go to

6018
07:02:50,760 --> 07:02:52,920
that repo and see the code that it's

6019
07:02:52,920 --> 07:02:55,200
being downloaded and and run inside your

6020
07:02:55,200 --> 07:02:57,718
Runner inside your VMS so if you go to

6021
07:02:57,718 --> 07:03:01,620
github.com action checkout you can read

6022
07:03:01,620 --> 07:03:03,660
that code and if you have like proper

6023
07:03:03,660 --> 07:03:06,600
and a lot uh tool to like static

6024
07:03:06,600 --> 07:03:08,580
analysis for example you can analyze

6025
07:03:08,580 --> 07:03:11,040
that code and see what it's doing right

6026
07:03:11,040 --> 07:03:14,160
but these ones from actions the user or

6027
07:03:14,160 --> 07:03:16,020
organization actions these ones are

6028
07:03:16,020 --> 07:03:19,080
provided by GitHub so technically they

6029
07:03:19,080 --> 07:03:21,718
should be legitimate unless someone has

6030
07:03:21,718 --> 07:03:23,458
compromised their the username or

6031
07:03:23,458 --> 07:03:25,638
something

6032
07:03:26,878 --> 07:03:28,920
okay so this is what I was able to do

6033
07:03:28,920 --> 07:03:31,260
during my research

6034
07:03:31,260 --> 07:03:33,420
um not just explaining the third party

6035
07:03:33,420 --> 07:03:36,298
action but basically uh running inside

6036
07:03:36,298 --> 07:03:39,058
technically you can't run interactive

6037
07:03:39,058 --> 07:03:41,280
commands inside your your VMS your

6038
07:03:41,280 --> 07:03:43,860
Runners I was able to do that and

6039
07:03:43,860 --> 07:03:46,820
running an nmap inside the Azure network

6040
07:03:46,820 --> 07:03:49,620
doing a reverse shell from the runner to

6041
07:03:49,620 --> 07:03:51,900
external server and you can also

6042
07:03:51,900 --> 07:03:54,540
leverage your actions since their VMS

6043
07:03:54,540 --> 07:03:56,940
their servers to Pivot that and attack

6044
07:03:56,940 --> 07:03:59,638
other targets either inside Azure or

6045
07:03:59,638 --> 07:04:02,100
even outside because they have outside

6046
07:04:02,100 --> 07:04:04,978
connection as well

6047
07:04:04,978 --> 07:04:07,500
so this is just an example from the nmap

6048
07:04:07,500 --> 07:04:10,320
scan uh this the first one is my actual

6049
07:04:10,320 --> 07:04:14,400
uh runner my VM there you see uh this is

6050
07:04:14,400 --> 07:04:16,920
a node screenshot but basically you see

6051
07:04:16,920 --> 07:04:19,740
some ports there that are known but

6052
07:04:19,740 --> 07:04:23,580
there is one port there 8084 with a

6053
07:04:23,580 --> 07:04:27,900
server called Mono XSP server this one

6054
07:04:27,900 --> 07:04:30,718
uh it was interesting because it's a

6055
07:04:30,718 --> 07:04:33,860
very old asp.net server that was there

6056
07:04:33,860 --> 07:04:36,900
and I couldn't figure out the the reason

6057
07:04:36,900 --> 07:04:38,638
why I was there I think it was more for

6058
07:04:38,638 --> 07:04:40,740
like health or or monitoring purposes

6059
07:04:40,740 --> 07:04:44,638
for internal uh from azure but what's

6060
07:04:44,638 --> 07:04:48,180
interesting is that this web server was

6061
07:04:48,180 --> 07:04:50,040
the only one that was enabled by default

6062
07:04:50,040 --> 07:04:52,978
so you also had Apache and nginx

6063
07:04:52,978 --> 07:04:55,798
installed but it wasn't enabled

6064
07:04:55,798 --> 07:04:59,280
so on the latest versions of the action

6065
07:04:59,280 --> 07:05:02,940
VM the Ubuntu One this has been removed

6066
07:05:02,940 --> 07:05:05,700
So This Server I'm not sure why exactly

6067
07:05:05,700 --> 07:05:08,280
but this one has been removed so you

6068
07:05:08,280 --> 07:05:10,440
don't see it it's not even like inactive

6069
07:05:10,440 --> 07:05:13,820
it's not there anymore

6070
07:05:17,040 --> 07:05:22,620
Okay so here is where I did the reverse

6071
07:05:22,620 --> 07:05:25,680
shell from the runner so basically the

6072
07:05:25,680 --> 07:05:29,458
Ubuntu VM has a lot of tools that come

6073
07:05:29,458 --> 07:05:32,420
pre-installed one of these tools is

6074
07:05:32,420 --> 07:05:36,420
netcat but the netcat version on the

6075
07:05:36,420 --> 07:05:38,340
Ubuntu is like capped because you can't

6076
07:05:38,340 --> 07:05:41,100
use the dash e version so this wasn't

6077
07:05:41,100 --> 07:05:43,320
one way of course there are other ways

6078
07:05:43,320 --> 07:05:45,600
that I used to okay download and build

6079
07:05:45,600 --> 07:05:49,320
it from scratch to create like a reverse

6080
07:05:49,320 --> 07:05:51,420
shell to my instance

6081
07:05:51,420 --> 07:05:53,638
so you can see this is the yaml script

6082
07:05:53,638 --> 07:05:58,500
and this is my ec2 instance on AWS and

6083
07:05:58,500 --> 07:06:02,040
basically uh I'm just opening the you

6084
07:06:02,040 --> 07:06:03,600
know the back door and listening there

6085
07:06:03,600 --> 07:06:05,520
and waiting for my connection from my

6086
07:06:05,520 --> 07:06:07,020
actions so we can see the information

6087
07:06:07,020 --> 07:06:11,400
here that the username Runner which we

6088
07:06:11,400 --> 07:06:13,978
call the VMS Runners right and you can

6089
07:06:13,978 --> 07:06:16,620
see here as well this is from Azure from

6090
07:06:16,620 --> 07:06:20,638
the VM provided by GitHub for this uh

6091
07:06:20,638 --> 07:06:23,420
for this scenario

6092
07:06:24,180 --> 07:06:26,638
so yeah now I can have interactive

6093
07:06:26,638 --> 07:06:29,100
commands right I don't need to build

6094
07:06:29,100 --> 07:06:31,978
this yaml file and submit and make a

6095
07:06:31,978 --> 07:06:34,680
pull request all the time to wait for

6096
07:06:34,680 --> 07:06:36,780
the changes wait for a VM to get

6097
07:06:36,780 --> 07:06:40,620
assigned for my uh my actions now I can

6098
07:06:40,620 --> 07:06:43,378
with this reverse shell I can basically

6099
07:06:43,378 --> 07:06:45,058
you know type the commands anytime

6100
07:06:45,058 --> 07:06:47,360
anything that I need there is a limit

6101
07:06:47,360 --> 07:06:52,378
here uh I believe that every job has uh

6102
07:06:52,378 --> 07:06:56,160
six hours limit so every set of actions

6103
07:06:56,160 --> 07:06:58,740
you can only have six hours to interact

6104
07:06:58,740 --> 07:07:00,478
with that VM but that should be enough

6105
07:07:00,478 --> 07:07:04,620
for research purposes and each Runner

6106
07:07:04,620 --> 07:07:07,500
runs until 72 hours so you have like

6107
07:07:07,500 --> 07:07:10,200
three days until your Runner gets uh

6108
07:07:10,200 --> 07:07:12,540
disconnected then and once the runner is

6109
07:07:12,540 --> 07:07:14,700
disconnected it's shut down you don't

6110
07:07:14,700 --> 07:07:16,558
have access to that Runner anymore so

6111
07:07:16,558 --> 07:07:18,840
anything that you're doing inside that

6112
07:07:18,840 --> 07:07:22,138
VM you need to either upload or copy or

6113
07:07:22,138 --> 07:07:24,180
collect those artifacts otherwise you

6114
07:07:24,180 --> 07:07:26,100
lose access you lose everything that

6115
07:07:26,100 --> 07:07:28,519
it's there

6116
07:07:30,478 --> 07:07:32,638
so yeah since I can do reverse shells

6117
07:07:32,638 --> 07:07:34,558
from the runners to my server I can also

6118
07:07:34,558 --> 07:07:36,478
issue malicious commands to the servers

6119
07:07:36,478 --> 07:07:39,000
to my Runners such as scanning or

6120
07:07:39,000 --> 07:07:41,760
attacking other Target even outside of

6121
07:07:41,760 --> 07:07:45,058
azure so this of course this pivot part

6122
07:07:45,058 --> 07:07:47,280
I I didn't actually execute it but

6123
07:07:47,280 --> 07:07:50,958
that's that's a possibility as well

6124
07:07:51,120 --> 07:07:55,200
okay now what happens if someone uploads

6125
07:07:55,200 --> 07:07:57,120
a malicious actions to the marketplace

6126
07:07:57,120 --> 07:07:59,340
so similar to what I did in this

6127
07:07:59,340 --> 07:08:02,340
previous slide this code here I

6128
07:08:02,340 --> 07:08:04,200
basically created that in a separate

6129
07:08:04,200 --> 07:08:06,600
repo and then on the first repo I call

6130
07:08:06,600 --> 07:08:08,520
this code so it's similar to in a way

6131
07:08:08,520 --> 07:08:11,280
that that Marketplace works just calling

6132
07:08:11,280 --> 07:08:13,620
a a public repository from another

6133
07:08:13,620 --> 07:08:18,000
location another user that's what I did

6134
07:08:18,000 --> 07:08:21,000
so yeah hello word the the example from

6135
07:08:21,000 --> 07:08:22,920
the GitHub actions documentation there

6136
07:08:22,920 --> 07:08:25,320
but then he calls this

6137
07:08:25,320 --> 07:08:27,660
um this shell script there which

6138
07:08:27,660 --> 07:08:30,240
basically is the same one that I uh

6139
07:08:30,240 --> 07:08:33,120
showed earlier which does the back door

6140
07:08:33,120 --> 07:08:35,280
for me right the reverse shell

6141
07:08:35,280 --> 07:08:38,400
so what happens is if I provided this

6142
07:08:38,400 --> 07:08:41,718
into the marketplace anyone

6143
07:08:41,718 --> 07:08:44,520
that would use of course I wouldn't

6144
07:08:44,520 --> 07:08:46,500
label it like that I would try to make

6145
07:08:46,500 --> 07:08:48,298
it you know less suspicious and things

6146
07:08:48,298 --> 07:08:50,760
like that but anyone that used this

6147
07:08:50,760 --> 07:08:53,520
action they would create a reverse shell

6148
07:08:53,520 --> 07:08:55,978
to my C2 server my connection there the

6149
07:08:55,978 --> 07:08:58,920
ec2 whatever I had it that would work as

6150
07:08:58,920 --> 07:09:03,180
well so same way okay now this is the

6151
07:09:03,180 --> 07:09:05,280
ammo file calling this third party

6152
07:09:05,280 --> 07:09:07,798
action so this is another repo it's the

6153
07:09:07,798 --> 07:09:10,978
GHA test they're all public repos if you

6154
07:09:10,978 --> 07:09:12,600
want to take a look there is not a lot

6155
07:09:12,600 --> 07:09:14,458
there but this is what I'm doing right

6156
07:09:14,458 --> 07:09:17,160
they use this calling this third-party

6157
07:09:17,160 --> 07:09:20,458
action fake GHA which runs that code

6158
07:09:20,458 --> 07:09:24,298
here which basically in turn get gives

6159
07:09:24,298 --> 07:09:26,580
me the same reverse shell that I showed

6160
07:09:26,580 --> 07:09:28,218
you earlier but now from a third party

6161
07:09:28,218 --> 07:09:32,638
so be careful with actions that you're

6162
07:09:32,638 --> 07:09:34,798
downloading that you're leveraging from

6163
07:09:34,798 --> 07:09:37,740
the marketplace because since there is

6164
07:09:37,740 --> 07:09:41,100
no verification as far as I know uh then

6165
07:09:41,100 --> 07:09:43,378
you can yeah if you're not validating

6166
07:09:43,378 --> 07:09:46,138
those there these can happen to your

6167
07:09:46,138 --> 07:09:48,058
environment as well and once they're

6168
07:09:48,058 --> 07:09:49,798
inside that environment once they have

6169
07:09:49,798 --> 07:09:52,080
the control of those VMS there are a lot

6170
07:09:52,080 --> 07:09:54,420
of credentials there is a lot of tokens

6171
07:09:54,420 --> 07:09:56,700
including the GitHub token which allows

6172
07:09:56,700 --> 07:10:00,718
you to maybe change read your repo

6173
07:10:00,718 --> 07:10:02,820
information there or even write

6174
07:10:02,820 --> 07:10:04,620
depending on the permissions write

6175
07:10:04,620 --> 07:10:06,478
information to back to your repository

6176
07:10:06,478 --> 07:10:10,020
and you know things like Ci CD or supply

6177
07:10:10,020 --> 07:10:14,478
chain attack can happen here as well

6178
07:10:14,760 --> 07:10:18,378
okay and now I'm almost out of time

6179
07:10:18,378 --> 07:10:21,600
uh so some countermeasures here related

6180
07:10:21,600 --> 07:10:23,580
to GitHub actions

6181
07:10:23,580 --> 07:10:26,100
um it's not great uh as far as I know

6182
07:10:26,100 --> 07:10:29,580
there are no uh tools today to actually

6183
07:10:29,580 --> 07:10:31,920
check your actions for you know

6184
07:10:31,920 --> 07:10:34,138
malicious intentious malicious purposes

6185
07:10:34,138 --> 07:10:36,660
I've been working on writing some rules

6186
07:10:36,660 --> 07:10:39,780
for uh uh other like static analysis

6187
07:10:39,780 --> 07:10:41,700
tools to be able to provide that and

6188
07:10:41,700 --> 07:10:44,280
I'll probably uh make that public very

6189
07:10:44,280 --> 07:10:46,500
soon but as far as I know I don't know

6190
07:10:46,500 --> 07:10:48,958
maybe on the next talk Logan Logan can

6191
07:10:48,958 --> 07:10:51,540
save GitHub is working on uh something

6192
07:10:51,540 --> 07:10:54,000
like that that would be beneficial but

6193
07:10:54,000 --> 07:10:57,000
yeah basically uh make sure that you

6194
07:10:57,000 --> 07:10:59,700
have the least privileged permissions to

6195
07:10:59,700 --> 07:11:02,040
your actions right you you don't allow

6196
07:11:02,040 --> 07:11:04,260
uh you don't give right permissions if

6197
07:11:04,260 --> 07:11:06,420
you don't have to because otherwise

6198
07:11:06,420 --> 07:11:09,600
while that Runner while that VM is is

6199
07:11:09,600 --> 07:11:12,120
valid if someone compromises that token

6200
07:11:12,120 --> 07:11:15,420
then they can compromise your repo

6201
07:11:15,420 --> 07:11:17,878
uh this is something as well they that

6202
07:11:17,878 --> 07:11:19,680
used to happen in the beginning

6203
07:11:19,680 --> 07:11:22,978
especially because uh um people were

6204
07:11:22,978 --> 07:11:26,878
able to Fork the original repo and then

6205
07:11:26,878 --> 07:11:28,920
send the pull request back to the to the

6206
07:11:28,920 --> 07:11:31,378
original one uh and that would trigger

6207
07:11:31,378 --> 07:11:33,360
the actions so people were working

6208
07:11:33,360 --> 07:11:37,620
GitHub repos back and forth and and that

6209
07:11:37,620 --> 07:11:39,540
would trigger the action that would like

6210
07:11:39,540 --> 07:11:43,138
basically uh spin up the the runner and

6211
07:11:43,138 --> 07:11:45,718
mine cryptocurrency but not on the

6212
07:11:45,718 --> 07:11:48,660
malicious username on the legitimate one

6213
07:11:48,660 --> 07:11:52,080
uh that also happened so GitHub added

6214
07:11:52,080 --> 07:11:53,940
this feature or this protection there

6215
07:11:53,940 --> 07:11:57,120
which is enabled by default to avoid uh

6216
07:11:57,120 --> 07:11:59,280
when someone sends a pull request from a

6217
07:11:59,280 --> 07:12:01,920
forked repo it it doesn't trigger any

6218
07:12:01,920 --> 07:12:04,138
actions unless you allow unless you

6219
07:12:04,138 --> 07:12:06,600
recognize that person that user as a

6220
07:12:06,600 --> 07:12:08,580
contributor to your project

6221
07:12:08,580 --> 07:12:11,700
and of course not just the GitHub token

6222
07:12:11,700 --> 07:12:13,500
but any token that you can leverage that

6223
07:12:13,500 --> 07:12:16,740
you uh first first thing basic stuff is

6224
07:12:16,740 --> 07:12:18,420
you shouldn't hard code your tokens

6225
07:12:18,420 --> 07:12:21,120
inside the yaml file right this is basic

6226
07:12:21,120 --> 07:12:24,958
uh security uh approach you shouldn't do

6227
07:12:24,958 --> 07:12:27,718
that there is something called Secrets

6228
07:12:27,718 --> 07:12:30,478
inside the inside GitHub where you can

6229
07:12:30,478 --> 07:12:32,218
add all the tokens and then you just

6230
07:12:32,218 --> 07:12:34,620
call them by the username I'm not sure

6231
07:12:34,620 --> 07:12:37,920
if I have an example here but basically

6232
07:12:37,920 --> 07:12:40,798
that way this the token is protected

6233
07:12:40,798 --> 07:12:42,958
even from your own developers they can't

6234
07:12:42,958 --> 07:12:45,600
see it anymore after you add them uh

6235
07:12:45,600 --> 07:12:48,120
there so protect those Secrets as well

6236
07:12:48,120 --> 07:12:49,378
because they can give you information

6237
07:12:49,378 --> 07:12:53,478
access to even other tools

6238
07:12:54,360 --> 07:12:57,058
so just some examples here uh you know

6239
07:12:57,058 --> 07:12:59,340
if you're not using actions just disable

6240
07:12:59,340 --> 07:13:01,440
I think that's the basic approach as

6241
07:13:01,440 --> 07:13:03,780
well if you're not using a service or to

6242
07:13:03,780 --> 07:13:06,240
just remove it so you can disable all

6243
07:13:06,240 --> 07:13:10,080
the actions there and and this one is

6244
07:13:10,080 --> 07:13:12,478
the one about the 4kid repos if you

6245
07:13:12,478 --> 07:13:14,700
don't if you're not using or if you need

6246
07:13:14,700 --> 07:13:17,280
approval for someone forking your repo

6247
07:13:17,280 --> 07:13:19,740
then okay require approval for

6248
07:13:19,740 --> 07:13:21,540
first-time contributors to avoid

6249
07:13:21,540 --> 07:13:24,058
triggering your action and you know

6250
07:13:24,058 --> 07:13:26,700
compromise your environment as well

6251
07:13:26,700 --> 07:13:29,878
okay I'll try to be really fast here the

6252
07:13:29,878 --> 07:13:32,540
next slides are more about code spaces

6253
07:13:32,540 --> 07:13:35,280
and related to the research as I said

6254
07:13:35,280 --> 07:13:37,200
that my friend did but I'll just present

6255
07:13:37,200 --> 07:13:40,020
here a few things

6256
07:13:40,020 --> 07:13:43,440
the same way that actions GitHub actions

6257
07:13:43,440 --> 07:13:46,620
is based on Azure pipelines as far as I

6258
07:13:46,620 --> 07:13:49,378
know even the same people worked on both

6259
07:13:49,378 --> 07:13:52,260
projects code spaces or GitHub code

6260
07:13:52,260 --> 07:13:55,020
spaces is based on vs code online which

6261
07:13:55,020 --> 07:13:57,958
basically an idea of having an IDE from

6262
07:13:57,958 --> 07:14:00,660
your browser that you can quickly spin

6263
07:14:00,660 --> 07:14:02,520
up your your projects you can start

6264
07:14:02,520 --> 07:14:04,320
coding directly from the browser you

6265
07:14:04,320 --> 07:14:05,638
don't need to set up you know

6266
07:14:05,638 --> 07:14:07,740
dependencies and libraries you know

6267
07:14:07,740 --> 07:14:09,958
sometimes when a developer joins a

6268
07:14:09,958 --> 07:14:12,000
company takes them at least a few days

6269
07:14:12,000 --> 07:14:14,940
to get that environment set up so code

6270
07:14:14,940 --> 07:14:18,600
spaces tries to uh you know avoid that

6271
07:14:18,600 --> 07:14:20,878
issue with creating the virtual

6272
07:14:20,878 --> 07:14:23,840
environment for you

6273
07:14:24,000 --> 07:14:26,638
when you create a code space environment

6274
07:14:26,638 --> 07:14:29,820
basically you get this long URL which

6275
07:14:29,820 --> 07:14:32,878
specifies your username code space and

6276
07:14:32,878 --> 07:14:35,100
random ID and the port so you can

6277
07:14:35,100 --> 07:14:38,820
forward that code space to expose a port

6278
07:14:38,820 --> 07:14:43,558
as well and we described I think a few

6279
07:14:43,558 --> 07:14:45,780
months ago it was I think in January

6280
07:14:45,780 --> 07:14:48,958
where we published an article where okay

6281
07:14:48,958 --> 07:14:51,478
if I can leverage that and and I think

6282
07:14:51,478 --> 07:14:54,298
the total amount of space that each code

6283
07:14:54,298 --> 07:14:57,780
space gives you it's 512 gigabytes

6284
07:14:57,780 --> 07:15:03,000
so I can use code space as my C2 server

6285
07:15:03,000 --> 07:15:05,580
to deliver malicious files to other

6286
07:15:05,580 --> 07:15:08,218
people and if I provide that URL oh it's

6287
07:15:08,218 --> 07:15:10,138
coming from GitHub so it must be

6288
07:15:10,138 --> 07:15:13,080
legitimate right so just like it's not

6289
07:15:13,080 --> 07:15:15,180
nothing new here but just like what

6290
07:15:15,180 --> 07:15:17,160
attackers do with Google Drive and

6291
07:15:17,160 --> 07:15:19,920
things like that that would be a way of

6292
07:15:19,920 --> 07:15:21,958
exploiting it and tricking even

6293
07:15:21,958 --> 07:15:25,320
developers that are not aware of that

6294
07:15:25,320 --> 07:15:27,660
so we did that we showed the directly

6295
07:15:27,660 --> 07:15:31,440
listing we provide that uh from the our

6296
07:15:31,440 --> 07:15:34,138
code space and we can provide malicious

6297
07:15:34,138 --> 07:15:36,840
files there so there is open directories

6298
07:15:36,840 --> 07:15:39,120
and all that stuff

6299
07:15:39,120 --> 07:15:41,878
and we we published an article I think

6300
07:15:41,878 --> 07:15:45,740
was engineering talking about this

6301
07:15:46,080 --> 07:15:48,900
basically

6302
07:15:48,900 --> 07:15:51,420
we saw that in February but we only

6303
07:15:51,420 --> 07:15:54,360
found out a few weeks ago that attackers

6304
07:15:54,360 --> 07:15:56,820
are already leveraging that they're

6305
07:15:56,820 --> 07:15:59,760
already abusing code spaces right to

6306
07:15:59,760 --> 07:16:03,120
deliver malware to deliver uh uh you

6307
07:16:03,120 --> 07:16:04,920
know malicious fires there as well so we

6308
07:16:04,920 --> 07:16:07,440
saw this tweet uh two weeks ago I guess

6309
07:16:07,440 --> 07:16:10,558
and and yeah so this these probably

6310
07:16:10,558 --> 07:16:13,680
going to increase this source of attack

6311
07:16:13,680 --> 07:16:16,620
this leveraging code spaces to you know

6312
07:16:16,620 --> 07:16:20,160
deliver malicious information as well so

6313
07:16:20,160 --> 07:16:22,620
um yeah just be aware of that from your

6314
07:16:22,620 --> 07:16:24,240
uh environment especially if you're

6315
07:16:24,240 --> 07:16:26,580
using for developers are leveraging code

6316
07:16:26,580 --> 07:16:29,040
spaces you should be yeah you should be

6317
07:16:29,040 --> 07:16:31,638
very careful

6318
07:16:31,978 --> 07:16:32,940
okay

6319
07:16:32,940 --> 07:16:36,180
that's all I had for today so uh if I

6320
07:16:36,180 --> 07:16:37,500
still have time I'm open for questions

6321
07:16:37,500 --> 07:16:39,798
if not I'll be here for the next talk

6322
07:16:39,798 --> 07:16:44,120
and that's all thank you

6323
07:16:47,320 --> 07:16:50,520
[Applause]

6324
07:16:50,760 --> 07:16:52,680
any questions do you have time for

6325
07:16:52,680 --> 07:16:56,120
questions good okay

6326
07:16:57,360 --> 07:16:59,878
no questions

6327
07:16:59,878 --> 07:17:03,378
okay go ahead

6328
07:17:06,360 --> 07:17:08,340
it's not a question specifically but

6329
07:17:08,340 --> 07:17:10,200
it's a kind of a feedback on something

6330
07:17:10,200 --> 07:17:11,638
you mentioned

6331
07:17:11,638 --> 07:17:13,260
so there is a thing I don't know if

6332
07:17:13,260 --> 07:17:15,298
you're familiar uh step security

6333
07:17:15,298 --> 07:17:18,478
hardened Runner so it is a GitHub action

6334
07:17:18,478 --> 07:17:21,058
you can put at the top you put it the

6335
07:17:21,058 --> 07:17:24,420
very first one in your job and it will

6336
07:17:24,420 --> 07:17:26,580
basically enter a step it will modify

6337
07:17:26,580 --> 07:17:28,920
like in the kernel in the VM and

6338
07:17:28,920 --> 07:17:30,660
basically you can set

6339
07:17:30,660 --> 07:17:33,298
uh firewall rules and it will Snoop

6340
07:17:33,298 --> 07:17:34,680
things and it will basically block

6341
07:17:34,680 --> 07:17:37,320
execution of untrusted so basically it's

6342
07:17:37,320 --> 07:17:40,260
kind of a way to harden the rest of your

6343
07:17:40,260 --> 07:17:43,558
execution okay so it's like is it like a

6344
07:17:43,558 --> 07:17:46,440
container inside the action it's uh it's

6345
07:17:46,440 --> 07:17:49,138
effectively uh a Daemon little Daemon

6346
07:17:49,138 --> 07:17:51,180
that runs at the very top like of your

6347
07:17:51,180 --> 07:17:53,340
job and then everything that runs after

6348
07:17:53,340 --> 07:17:56,040
is subject to like it can have firewall

6349
07:17:56,040 --> 07:17:57,718
rules and things like that can basically

6350
07:17:57,718 --> 07:17:59,760
prevent those things you were mentioned

6351
07:17:59,760 --> 07:18:01,680
oh nice yeah I didn't know sounds good

6352
07:18:01,680 --> 07:18:04,378
so yeah I'm working with uh oppa open

6353
07:18:04,378 --> 07:18:07,558
policy agent to basically develop some

6354
07:18:07,558 --> 07:18:11,100
rules uh based on Rigo to analyze let's

6355
07:18:11,100 --> 07:18:13,080
say I want to analyze this emo file

6356
07:18:13,080 --> 07:18:15,600
focus on GitHub action and let's say is

6357
07:18:15,600 --> 07:18:18,180
this yaml file Rania malicious like

6358
07:18:18,180 --> 07:18:20,280
Linux command or is it running a crypto

6359
07:18:20,280 --> 07:18:22,440
Miner that's what I'm working on and I

6360
07:18:22,440 --> 07:18:25,620
should have that available very soon

6361
07:18:25,620 --> 07:18:27,718
so yeah uh thanks again for sticking

6362

6378
07:32:24,718 --> 07:32:27,298
pound GitHub and now we're gonna talk

6379
07:32:27,298 --> 07:32:30,420
about uh how to make money out of doing

6380

McLaren he's been a security Enthusiast

6382
07:32:37,260 --> 07:32:39,360
since getting online in the 90s and

6383

currently focuses on helping grow get up

6384
07:32:42,058 --> 07:32:44,340
bug Bounty program during his free time

6385
07:32:44,340 --> 07:32:47,520
login dabbles in powerlifting ctfs and

6386

Retro Gaming so please give it up for

6387
07:32:49,920 --> 07:32:52,370

6388
07:32:52,370 --> 07:32:56,280
[Applause]

6389
07:32:56,280 --> 07:32:58,260
all right well good afternoon everyone

6390
07:32:58,260 --> 07:33:00,298
I'm glad I have a captive audience here

6391
07:33:00,298 --> 07:33:01,740
with the raffle coming after this as

6392
07:33:01,740 --> 07:33:04,378
well so thanks for hanging out uh goal

6393
07:33:04,378 --> 07:33:05,458
here today is just chat a little bit

6394
07:33:05,458 --> 07:33:07,558
about github's Bounty program being one

6395
07:33:07,558 --> 07:33:09,660
of the the bigger ones out there but

6396
07:33:09,660 --> 07:33:11,580
more so focusing on lessons we've

6397
07:33:11,580 --> 07:33:13,138
learned over the past nine or so years

6398
07:33:13,138 --> 07:33:15,478
of running the program uh ways we've

6399
07:33:15,478 --> 07:33:16,978
learned not to do things ways we have

6400
07:33:16,978 --> 07:33:19,260
learned to do things and and really the

6401
07:33:19,260 --> 07:33:21,120
key stuff will will come at the end is

6402
07:33:21,120 --> 07:33:22,978
sort of the picture slides as it were

6403
07:33:22,978 --> 07:33:24,478
for takeaways for folks who are either

6404
07:33:24,478 --> 07:33:25,798
looking to submit stuff to Bounty

6405
07:33:25,798 --> 07:33:28,440
programs ours or otherwise or anyone

6406
07:33:28,440 --> 07:33:29,940
who's looking to set up a bounty program

6407
07:33:29,940 --> 07:33:32,840
or work on one as as an engineer

6408
07:33:32,840 --> 07:33:35,820
uh so hopefully my slides cooperate we

6409
07:33:35,820 --> 07:33:37,740
had some technical difficulties here we

6410
07:33:37,740 --> 07:33:39,478
are uh so I'm a senior product security

6411
07:33:39,478 --> 07:33:41,100
engineer at GitHub I've been there since

6412
07:33:41,100 --> 07:33:44,760
about 2019 uh a long time ago I used to

6413
07:33:44,760 --> 07:33:46,138
run a whole bunch of like hackerzines

6414
07:33:46,138 --> 07:33:47,340
and stuff that nobody's ever heard of

6415
07:33:47,340 --> 07:33:50,340
but that was always always good fun uh I

6416
07:33:50,340 --> 07:33:51,900
am a kilt Enthusiast as you can probably

6417
07:33:51,900 --> 07:33:53,638
guess from this I am actually Scottish I

6418
07:33:53,638 --> 07:33:56,040
haven't just appropriated Kilts but

6419
07:33:56,040 --> 07:33:57,660
professionally I've worn many hats

6420
07:33:57,660 --> 07:33:59,280
everything from support to Professional

6421
07:33:59,280 --> 07:34:02,160
Services engineering uh so never stay in

6422
07:34:02,160 --> 07:34:03,840
one place for too too long but github's

6423
07:34:03,840 --> 07:34:05,940
kept me hooked for a little bit so

6424
07:34:05,940 --> 07:34:07,558
before we dive into things just to get a

6425
07:34:07,558 --> 07:34:09,840
feel for for the audience here who here

6426
07:34:09,840 --> 07:34:11,940
has submitted bugs to a bounty program

6427
07:34:11,940 --> 07:34:14,760
before is at least familiar with it

6428
07:34:14,760 --> 07:34:18,000
raise your hand Magnum yeah perfect and

6429
07:34:18,000 --> 07:34:20,520
uh perhaps a more Niche audience here

6430
07:34:20,520 --> 07:34:23,458
who here works on a bounty program

6431
07:34:23,458 --> 07:34:25,620
okay more more than I was expecting

6432
07:34:25,620 --> 07:34:27,478
which is pretty cool so good uh it's

6433
07:34:27,478 --> 07:34:30,840
going to be well well-rounded uh so

6434
07:34:30,840 --> 07:34:32,700
talking about the GitHub program a

6435
07:34:32,700 --> 07:34:34,200
little bit just to set the stage for for

6436
07:34:34,200 --> 07:34:37,200
all this we started back in 2014 uh

6437
07:34:37,200 --> 07:34:38,820
we've been working with hacker one since

6438
07:34:38,820 --> 07:34:40,558
2016 so a lot of these numbers are

6439
07:34:40,558 --> 07:34:42,540
looking at 2016 onwards because that's

6440
07:34:42,540 --> 07:34:44,878
when we have metrics for uh but during

6441
07:34:44,878 --> 07:34:46,500
that time we've paid out a little over 4

6442
07:34:46,500 --> 07:34:49,340
million U.S for bounties across about

6443
07:34:49,340 --> 07:34:53,180
1350 reports as of this morning so

6444
07:34:53,180 --> 07:34:56,040
reasonably large payouts compared to a

6445
07:34:56,040 --> 07:34:58,680
lot of other ones and the overall range

6446
07:34:58,680 --> 07:35:02,340
for that is bottom end 617 dollars up to

6447
07:35:02,340 --> 07:35:05,160
30 000 plus plus depending on severity

6448
07:35:05,160 --> 07:35:06,660
so if you can find something that's

6449
07:35:06,660 --> 07:35:08,280
pretty gnarly you can walk away with a

6450
07:35:08,280 --> 07:35:10,680
with a pretty good payday there uh but

6451
07:35:10,680 --> 07:35:11,940
obviously a lot of that's changed over

6452
07:35:11,940 --> 07:35:14,280
time I like to say it's aged like a fine

6453
07:35:14,280 --> 07:35:17,040
wine uh hasn't gone gotten corked yet so

6454
07:35:17,040 --> 07:35:19,500
things are are pretty good uh we started

6455
07:35:19,500 --> 07:35:21,120
out originally being sort of a side gig

6456
07:35:21,120 --> 07:35:23,878
for our appsec team and it's changed

6457
07:35:23,878 --> 07:35:25,558
pretty significantly since then so we're

6458
07:35:25,558 --> 07:35:27,180
now a team of four full-time Engineers

6459
07:35:27,180 --> 07:35:29,040
that are just doing bug Bounty stuff to

6460
07:35:29,040 --> 07:35:31,440
deal with various projects we have on it

6461
07:35:31,440 --> 07:35:32,820
but also you know looking at our our

6462
07:35:32,820 --> 07:35:34,740
overall life cycle for for vulnerability

6463
07:35:34,740 --> 07:35:36,360
work

6464
07:35:36,360 --> 07:35:38,218
um as our scope has changed a lot our

6465
07:35:38,218 --> 07:35:40,200
payouts have changed a lot we originally

6466
07:35:40,200 --> 07:35:41,760
started out doing one thousand to five

6467
07:35:41,760 --> 07:35:43,440
thousand as I just mentioned it's about

6468
07:35:43,440 --> 07:35:45,780
six times that much right now and the

6469
07:35:45,780 --> 07:35:47,280
big part of that as I said is is the

6470
07:35:47,280 --> 07:35:48,958
change in scope so thinking back a

6471
07:35:48,958 --> 07:35:50,760
couple years GitHub is primarily source

6472
07:35:50,760 --> 07:35:52,378
code management and not a lot else now

6473
07:35:52,378 --> 07:35:54,058
we have actions and code spaces and

6474
07:35:54,058 --> 07:35:55,138
everything else that we just heard about

6475
07:35:55,138 --> 07:35:57,780
uh and many many other bits and pieces

6476
07:35:57,780 --> 07:36:01,500
so a lot more surface area to look at

6477
07:36:01,500 --> 07:36:03,660
we've also been looking at other ways to

6478
07:36:03,660 --> 07:36:05,520
expand bug Bounty out and this is sort

6479
07:36:05,520 --> 07:36:07,020
of going into the the takeaways a little

6480
07:36:07,020 --> 07:36:09,360
early but looking at ways to bring this

6481
07:36:09,360 --> 07:36:11,280
into our release cycles and look at

6482
07:36:11,280 --> 07:36:12,900
other opportunities to collaborate both

6483
07:36:12,900 --> 07:36:14,340
internally and externally for this kind

6484
07:36:14,340 --> 07:36:15,900
of stuff

6485
07:36:15,900 --> 07:36:18,120
so the process we have is about what you

6486
07:36:18,120 --> 07:36:21,420
would expect from a bounty process or or

6487
07:36:21,420 --> 07:36:24,540
really a lot of bug triage work first

6488
07:36:24,540 --> 07:36:25,978
off we'll review any reports that come

6489
07:36:25,978 --> 07:36:27,298
in just to make sure you know they pass

6490
07:36:27,298 --> 07:36:28,558
a sanity check they look like they're

6491
07:36:28,558 --> 07:36:30,900
relevant sort of what you'd expect go

6492
07:36:30,900 --> 07:36:32,280
through reproduce those make sure

6493
07:36:32,280 --> 07:36:34,620
they're actually reproducible so that we

6494
07:36:34,620 --> 07:36:36,620
can continue an investigation off them

6495
07:36:36,620 --> 07:36:38,820
validate that there's something we care

6496
07:36:38,820 --> 07:36:40,520
about that we want to pursue further

6497
07:36:40,520 --> 07:36:42,900
sometimes if there's any ambiguity in

6498
07:36:42,900 --> 07:36:44,580
that we'll pull in the engineering teams

6499
07:36:44,580 --> 07:36:46,020
or product teams just to make sure that

6500
07:36:46,020 --> 07:36:48,420
everyone's got a good picture of it from

6501
07:36:48,420 --> 07:36:51,240
there we'll fix it simple Point uh and

6502
07:36:51,240 --> 07:36:53,820
then pay things out so we'll talk a

6503
07:36:53,820 --> 07:36:55,680
little bit about the payouts uh later on

6504
07:36:55,680 --> 07:36:56,700
in this because there's a few different

6505
07:36:56,700 --> 07:36:58,620
ways the programs do it our current

6506
07:36:58,620 --> 07:37:00,058
setup is we'll pay out whenever things

6507
07:37:00,058 --> 07:37:01,860
get fixed which could be a couple days

6508
07:37:01,860 --> 07:37:02,940
could be a couple weeks could be a

6509
07:37:02,940 --> 07:37:04,978
couple months but that way you know

6510
07:37:04,978 --> 07:37:06,780
we're we're ensuring that our customers

6511
07:37:06,780 --> 07:37:08,520
are actually protected by the time any

6512
07:37:08,520 --> 07:37:10,620
information gets out there in the in the

6513
07:37:10,620 --> 07:37:12,180
world

6514
07:37:12,180 --> 07:37:13,978
so when we get reports the key thing we

6515
07:37:13,978 --> 07:37:15,180
want to do is figure out what's actually

6516
07:37:15,180 --> 07:37:16,680
going on

6517
07:37:16,680 --> 07:37:18,298
so we want to understand what the actual

6518
07:37:18,298 --> 07:37:20,520
vulnerability for these things are so

6519
07:37:20,520 --> 07:37:22,558
not not just whether or not it is

6520
07:37:22,558 --> 07:37:23,878
something we care about from a security

6521
07:37:23,878 --> 07:37:25,440
standpoint but do we actually understand

6522
07:37:25,440 --> 07:37:28,020
the overall scope for it quite often

6523
07:37:28,020 --> 07:37:29,218
when I've looked at stuff in Bounty

6524
07:37:29,218 --> 07:37:31,200
programs you'll see reports come in it's

6525
07:37:31,200 --> 07:37:33,240
a little bit unclear you may have wildly

6526
07:37:33,240 --> 07:37:35,760
varying severity wildly varying the

6527
07:37:35,760 --> 07:37:37,860
severities that's a tongue twister as

6528
07:37:37,860 --> 07:37:39,600
they evolve over time so we want to try

6529
07:37:39,600 --> 07:37:41,580
to get that in in advance that when we

6530
07:37:41,580 --> 07:37:43,138
push this off to our engineering teams

6531
07:37:43,138 --> 07:37:45,000
to actually formally fix it and continue

6532
07:37:45,000 --> 07:37:47,040
our investigations with our our cert

6533
07:37:47,040 --> 07:37:49,260
teams and whatnot that we can prioritize

6534
07:37:49,260 --> 07:37:51,000
that properly

6535
07:37:51,000 --> 07:37:52,558
next thing is can we take this and

6536
07:37:52,558 --> 07:37:55,080
actually increase the impact for it does

6537
07:37:55,080 --> 07:37:56,820
this Advance other attacks are there

6538
07:37:56,820 --> 07:37:58,620
other things we need to focus on for

6539
07:37:58,620 --> 07:38:00,660
this rather than just whatever has been

6540
07:38:00,660 --> 07:38:02,700
reported to us and I think the key

6541
07:38:02,700 --> 07:38:04,620
takeaway for this with with our program

6542
07:38:04,620 --> 07:38:06,360
and I think many others is it's not

6543
07:38:06,360 --> 07:38:07,920
necessarily the job of us on the Bounty

6544
07:38:07,920 --> 07:38:09,660
side to increase that impact we just

6545
07:38:09,660 --> 07:38:11,218
want to understand it but if you

6546
07:38:11,218 --> 07:38:13,080
submitted reports and it looks like it's

6547
07:38:13,080 --> 07:38:15,958
reasonably minimal that's sort of on on

6548
07:38:15,958 --> 07:38:18,240
you as the reporter to demonstrate what

6549
07:38:18,240 --> 07:38:19,920
that impact is to make sure the severity

6550
07:38:19,920 --> 07:38:21,540
is clearly represented in terms of a

6551
07:38:21,540 --> 07:38:24,180
payout that said we do our due diligence

6552
07:38:24,180 --> 07:38:25,860
on that nonetheless

6553
07:38:25,860 --> 07:38:27,478
next thing is understanding the trends

6554
07:38:27,478 --> 07:38:28,860
we're seeing overall and this is both

6555
07:38:28,860 --> 07:38:30,718
for our program other programs security

6556
07:38:30,718 --> 07:38:34,138
World in general we want to understand

6557
07:38:34,138 --> 07:38:37,378
both what uh what we're seeing across

6558
07:38:37,378 --> 07:38:39,240
overall ecosystems so if there's you

6559
07:38:39,240 --> 07:38:40,500
know new vulnerabilities are popping up

6560
07:38:40,500 --> 07:38:42,360
with rails or git we want to understand

6561
07:38:42,360 --> 07:38:44,160
that pretty well to begin with so we can

6562
07:38:44,160 --> 07:38:45,660
be prepared for it and sort of get out

6563
07:38:45,660 --> 07:38:49,160
ahead of that and the other part of that

6564
07:38:49,160 --> 07:38:52,798
is to Retro retrospectively look at

6565
07:38:52,798 --> 07:38:54,660
reports we're getting so take that data

6566
07:38:54,660 --> 07:38:57,478
feed it back into our overall sdlc and

6567
07:38:57,478 --> 07:38:59,520
make sure that we can say hey we've got

6568
07:38:59,520 --> 07:39:01,080
a lot of problems in this particular

6569
07:39:01,080 --> 07:39:02,940
product area or we're seeing this type

6570
07:39:02,940 --> 07:39:05,280
of problem persist across many different

6571
07:39:05,280 --> 07:39:08,520
product areas so let's actually focus on

6572
07:39:08,520 --> 07:39:10,978
that moving forward as we go through our

6573
07:39:10,978 --> 07:39:13,798
our overall life cycle for it uh and the

6574
07:39:13,798 --> 07:39:15,298
last part of this I mentioned earlier we

6575
07:39:15,298 --> 07:39:16,920
we collaborate with our cert teams a lot

6576
07:39:16,920 --> 07:39:18,120
we want to understand what the blast

6577
07:39:18,120 --> 07:39:19,740
radius for these things are uh you know

6578
07:39:19,740 --> 07:39:22,200
is there a user or customer impact to it

6579
07:39:22,200 --> 07:39:23,520
or is it just you know sort of a

6580
07:39:23,520 --> 07:39:25,320
security software bug that hasn't been

6581
07:39:25,320 --> 07:39:27,478
exploited uh so as part of understanding

6582
07:39:27,478 --> 07:39:29,100
that overall impact we will go through

6583
07:39:29,100 --> 07:39:31,020
work with our cert teams both internal

6584
07:39:31,020 --> 07:39:33,780
and and customer facing for that uh to

6585
07:39:33,780 --> 07:39:35,340
either send out notifications if we need

6586
07:39:35,340 --> 07:39:36,958
to or at least make sure we understand

6587
07:39:36,958 --> 07:39:39,840
the depth of of what's happened there

6588
07:39:39,840 --> 07:39:41,458
and I've been talking about affecting

6589
07:39:41,458 --> 07:39:43,440
users and customers and a big part of

6590
07:39:43,440 --> 07:39:45,000
that is that we have sort of two

6591
07:39:45,000 --> 07:39:46,440
different product streams for this we

6592
07:39:46,440 --> 07:39:48,298
run a SAS offering as well as an on-prem

6593
07:39:48,298 --> 07:39:50,638
product so with GitHub Enterprise server

6594
07:39:50,638 --> 07:39:52,860
uh we are doing releases every couple

6595
07:39:52,860 --> 07:39:55,100
weeks for IT Major release every quarter

6596
07:39:55,100 --> 07:39:58,320
but there are different concepts that

6597
07:39:58,320 --> 07:40:00,240
come with this uh so we're effectively

6598
07:40:00,240 --> 07:40:02,400
shipping the same code for both uh it's

6599
07:40:02,400 --> 07:40:03,780
if you ever download GitHub Enterprise

6600
07:40:03,780 --> 07:40:06,058
server you can if you're crafty enough

6601
07:40:06,058 --> 07:40:07,860
uh basically get a lot of the source

6602
07:40:07,860 --> 07:40:10,320
code out of that but the fun part of

6603
07:40:10,320 --> 07:40:11,878
that is that we can ship fixes really

6604
07:40:11,878 --> 07:40:13,798
quickly on github.com you know it could

6605
07:40:13,798 --> 07:40:15,058
be it could be hours could be a couple

6606
07:40:15,058 --> 07:40:16,798
days whatever but for shipping something

6607
07:40:16,798 --> 07:40:18,240
on-prem we have to go through a full

6608
07:40:18,240 --> 07:40:19,920
release cycle for that could be a few

6609
07:40:19,920 --> 07:40:21,958
weeks if we miss backboard deadlines you

6610
07:40:21,958 --> 07:40:23,280
know that can get extended out a little

6611
07:40:23,280 --> 07:40:24,420
bit further

6612
07:40:24,420 --> 07:40:26,580
uh but the key takeaway here is if

6613
07:40:26,580 --> 07:40:27,718
something affects one it probably

6614
07:40:27,718 --> 07:40:29,638
affects both so when we go through and

6615
07:40:29,638 --> 07:40:31,740
look at fixes and look at payouts and

6616
07:40:31,740 --> 07:40:33,000
disclosures and everything we want to

6617
07:40:33,000 --> 07:40:34,620
make sure we've got full coverage with

6618
07:40:34,620 --> 07:40:36,860
that

6619
07:40:37,218 --> 07:40:40,378
one too many things here uh so again all

6620
07:40:40,378 --> 07:40:42,780
this needs to get done in addition to

6621
07:40:42,780 --> 07:40:44,520
all the investigations we've been

6622
07:40:44,520 --> 07:40:46,440
talking about if we need to cut cves we

6623
07:40:46,440 --> 07:40:47,700
want to make sure that researchers are

6624
07:40:47,700 --> 07:40:50,760
properly credited for that and if we are

6625
07:40:50,760 --> 07:40:52,200
going to go forward with disclosure

6626
07:40:52,200 --> 07:40:54,058
which we're currently doing in a limited

6627
07:40:54,058 --> 07:40:55,500
standpoint for anything that does lead

6628
07:40:55,500 --> 07:40:58,080
to a cve we want to make sure again that

6629
07:40:58,080 --> 07:40:59,940
there is full coverage for that fixes

6630
07:40:59,940 --> 07:41:01,440
are available for customers both for

6631
07:41:01,440 --> 07:41:05,600
github.com and GitHub Enterprise server

6632
07:41:05,700 --> 07:41:07,860
so from there figuring out payouts and

6633
07:41:07,860 --> 07:41:09,298
touching on this a little bit more and

6634
07:41:09,298 --> 07:41:11,100
figuring out severity rankings uh

6635
07:41:11,100 --> 07:41:12,180
there's always this question of whether

6636
07:41:12,180 --> 07:41:13,798
or not you want to use CVSs or some

6637
07:41:13,798 --> 07:41:15,900
other framework for it or if you want to

6638
07:41:15,900 --> 07:41:18,120
do things yourself so we have opted to

6639
07:41:18,120 --> 07:41:20,940
use our own threat model for this uh you

6640
07:41:20,940 --> 07:41:22,080
know we think we have a pretty good

6641
07:41:22,080 --> 07:41:24,298
understanding of how things affect us

6642
07:41:24,298 --> 07:41:25,920
and our customers rather than a

6643
07:41:25,920 --> 07:41:29,218
genericized approach like CVSs and the

6644
07:41:29,218 --> 07:41:31,080
key part of that is that as we figure

6645
07:41:31,080 --> 07:41:33,120
out these things in our ecosystem we

6646
07:41:33,120 --> 07:41:36,240
want to understand uh pardon me we want

6647
07:41:36,240 --> 07:41:37,798
to understand the actual risk for it so

6648
07:41:37,798 --> 07:41:39,298
we've we've certainly seen some cases

6649
07:41:39,298 --> 07:41:40,620
where you could get a vulnerability that

6650
07:41:40,620 --> 07:41:42,478
you plug into cbss and it's you know a

6651
07:41:42,478 --> 07:41:44,700
9.5 or something but when you actually

6652
07:41:44,700 --> 07:41:46,558
apply it to exploitability and impact

6653
07:41:46,558 --> 07:41:48,298
for something like a SAS offering

6654
07:41:48,298 --> 07:41:50,218
specifically for github.com it may be

6655
07:41:50,218 --> 07:41:52,080
significantly reduced

6656
07:41:52,080 --> 07:41:54,600
so we'll use this as a sanity check

6657
07:41:54,600 --> 07:41:56,700
certainly if there's tiebreaker stuff as

6658
07:41:56,700 --> 07:41:58,500
we go through and deliberate things as a

6659
07:41:58,500 --> 07:42:01,620
team we can use this as as a sort of a

6660
07:42:01,620 --> 07:42:03,660
sanity check or or a reference point for

6661
07:42:03,660 --> 07:42:05,520
it

6662
07:42:05,520 --> 07:42:07,860
once we've got through all that we want

6663
07:42:07,860 --> 07:42:09,120
to figure out how to not screw up

6664
07:42:09,120 --> 07:42:12,120
disclosure this is much trickier than it

6665
07:42:12,120 --> 07:42:13,440
may sound if you haven't had to do this

6666
07:42:13,440 --> 07:42:14,878
before or been on the receiving end of

6667
07:42:14,878 --> 07:42:17,218
it from a bug I can't overstate how

6668
07:42:17,218 --> 07:42:20,100
tricky this actually is to line up one

6669
07:42:20,100 --> 07:42:21,958
of the first things I'll note if there

6670
07:42:21,958 --> 07:42:23,280
have been some really good examples of

6671
07:42:23,280 --> 07:42:25,860
this in the twitterverse lately is that

6672
07:42:25,860 --> 07:42:28,500
the more you work in public for a bug

6673
07:42:28,500 --> 07:42:30,718
Bounty program or or really anything I

6674
07:42:30,718 --> 07:42:33,478
suppose the more open your staff and

6675
07:42:33,478 --> 07:42:35,700
Company are to harassment and scrutiny

6676
07:42:35,700 --> 07:42:37,860
and whatnot it's a great example with

6677
07:42:37,860 --> 07:42:39,780
bug crowd a couple days ago you can poke

6678
07:42:39,780 --> 07:42:41,458
through Twitter and I'm sure you'll find

6679
07:42:41,458 --> 07:42:43,740
it but overall cracks will begin to show

6680
07:42:43,740 --> 07:42:45,660
quite quickly for it so you want to make

6681
07:42:45,660 --> 07:42:47,458
sure that you are putting on your best

6682
07:42:47,458 --> 07:42:48,958
face for it you understand what the

6683
07:42:48,958 --> 07:42:51,360
implications of all this stuff are and

6684
07:42:51,360 --> 07:42:52,620
and how it's going to affect the rest of

6685
07:42:52,620 --> 07:42:54,360
the ecosystem as well certainly if there

6686
07:42:54,360 --> 07:42:55,558
are other products out there that have

6687
07:42:55,558 --> 07:42:58,440
similar Technologies underlying them you

6688
07:42:58,440 --> 07:43:00,058
know make sure you have opportunities to

6689
07:43:00,058 --> 07:43:01,500
collaborate before things get fully

6690
07:43:01,500 --> 07:43:03,780
disclosed so right now we are doing

6691
07:43:03,780 --> 07:43:05,280
limited disclosure which is sort of a

6692
07:43:05,280 --> 07:43:07,378
summary free for reports and then a

6693
07:43:07,378 --> 07:43:09,240
researcher provided summary for it as

6694
07:43:09,240 --> 07:43:10,978
well along with severity payout and

6695
07:43:10,978 --> 07:43:13,378
timelines but not necessarily all of the

6696
07:43:13,378 --> 07:43:14,458
back and forth and not the original

6697
07:43:14,458 --> 07:43:16,558
report that has the exploitation details

6698
07:43:16,558 --> 07:43:19,200
some programs opt for what we call full

6699
07:43:19,200 --> 07:43:20,878
disclosure with hacker one which is

6700
07:43:20,878 --> 07:43:24,120
absolutely everything that goes into it

6701
07:43:24,120 --> 07:43:25,860
so that's a we do want to find a way to

6702
07:43:25,860 --> 07:43:28,260
share as much as is feasible for this I

6703
07:43:28,260 --> 07:43:29,760
talked about some of that talked about

6704
07:43:29,760 --> 07:43:32,040
limited disclosure with hacker one

6705
07:43:32,040 --> 07:43:34,080
um I every platform has has some sort of

6706
07:43:34,080 --> 07:43:35,820
tool for this it's not not specific to

6707
07:43:35,820 --> 07:43:37,798
them uh but the key thing is everyone of

6708
07:43:37,798 --> 07:43:39,120
course always wants more right the more

6709
07:43:39,120 --> 07:43:40,620
details you have out there for this

6710
07:43:40,620 --> 07:43:42,420
stuff the easier it is to hunt on

6711
07:43:42,420 --> 07:43:44,580
equivalent programs or basically

6712
07:43:44,580 --> 07:43:46,320
contribute back to the overall bug

6713
07:43:46,320 --> 07:43:49,440
Bounty world uh so they're uh we are

6714
07:43:49,440 --> 07:43:51,420
trying to move more towards more

6715
07:43:51,420 --> 07:43:53,100
disclosure whether it be through full

6716
07:43:53,100 --> 07:43:55,020
disclosure or just more reports in

6717
07:43:55,020 --> 07:43:57,360
general rather than just cves so we're

6718
07:43:57,360 --> 07:43:58,798
going to see how that plays out over

6719
07:43:58,798 --> 07:44:01,138
over the coming time but certainly if

6720
07:44:01,138 --> 07:44:02,218
you've got experience working with us

6721
07:44:02,218 --> 07:44:03,540
I'd love to hear from you sort of chat

6722
07:44:03,540 --> 07:44:05,100
about the pros and cons so feel free to

6723
07:44:05,100 --> 07:44:06,600
come up and chase me down after we're

6724
07:44:06,600 --> 07:44:09,240
done here uh but shifting gears a little

6725
07:44:09,240 --> 07:44:11,340
bit into some of the other areas that

6726
07:44:11,340 --> 07:44:13,798
are a little fishy for uh for bug Bounty

6727
07:44:13,798 --> 07:44:16,378
programs is of course fishing this is

6728
07:44:16,378 --> 07:44:17,340
something that's out of scope for

6729
07:44:17,340 --> 07:44:19,080
virtually every program out there uh

6730
07:44:19,080 --> 07:44:21,240
we're we're no different for that uh but

6731
07:44:21,240 --> 07:44:22,440
it doesn't mean it should be just flat

6732
07:44:22,440 --> 07:44:24,420
out ignored whenever you're looking at

6733
07:44:24,420 --> 07:44:25,978
fishing stuff the key thing is to

6734
07:44:25,978 --> 07:44:27,660
understand the difference between a

6735
07:44:27,660 --> 07:44:29,400
mechanism that might enable fishing and

6736
07:44:29,400 --> 07:44:31,260
one that requires fishing so if you look

6737
07:44:31,260 --> 07:44:34,978
like a CLI tool or really anything if

6738
07:44:34,978 --> 07:44:36,420
you run a command and you expect it to

6739
07:44:36,420 --> 07:44:38,218
do something it should do that thing if

6740
07:44:38,218 --> 07:44:39,958
you run a command and it does something

6741
07:44:39,958 --> 07:44:42,660
else because some very very plausible

6742
07:44:42,660 --> 07:44:44,760
legitimate scenario has taken place like

6743
07:44:44,760 --> 07:44:46,920
another file and the right path location

6744
07:44:46,920 --> 07:44:48,958
and it now does something malicious

6745
07:44:48,958 --> 07:44:50,520
that's something you can defend against

6746
07:44:50,520 --> 07:44:52,020
right and that's that's where we look at

6747
07:44:52,020 --> 07:44:53,580
this as a defense in-depth opportunity

6748
07:44:53,580 --> 07:44:55,500
we want to find a way to improve that

6749
07:44:55,500 --> 07:44:58,080
and add safeguards flip side is if

6750
07:44:58,080 --> 07:45:00,000
somebody says hey yeah just run rmrf

6751
07:45:00,000 --> 07:45:01,798
slash you know preserve root like that's

6752
07:45:01,798 --> 07:45:03,360
that's a you problem right that's not

6753
07:45:03,360 --> 07:45:05,100
not something necessarily protect

6754
07:45:05,100 --> 07:45:07,138
against technically so the way we've

6755
07:45:07,138 --> 07:45:08,458
approached this and we've seen a few

6756
07:45:08,458 --> 07:45:09,900
other programs do it as well is this

6757
07:45:09,900 --> 07:45:11,940
idea of thank you payouts so it's

6758
07:45:11,940 --> 07:45:13,020
something that doesn't necessarily

6759
07:45:13,020 --> 07:45:15,240
register on what we would consider low

6760
07:45:15,240 --> 07:45:17,100
severity but it's still something we

6761
07:45:17,100 --> 07:45:18,660
want to acknowledge it you know this is

6762
07:45:18,660 --> 07:45:20,878
a good finding but not necessarily a

6763
07:45:20,878 --> 07:45:22,500
security threat we are going to take

6764
07:45:22,500 --> 07:45:24,420
some sort of action on this so here's a

6765
07:45:24,420 --> 07:45:26,700
small award whether it be swag or you

6766
07:45:26,700 --> 07:45:28,260
know a smaller cash award than our our

6767
07:45:28,260 --> 07:45:30,780
minimums would normally be

6768
07:45:30,780 --> 07:45:32,700
uh and really the takeaway from this is

6769
07:45:32,700 --> 07:45:34,440
is Murphy's Law right if there is a way

6770
07:45:34,440 --> 07:45:35,700
for somebody to do something wrong

6771
07:45:35,700 --> 07:45:38,340
they're going to do it wrong so if you

6772
07:45:38,340 --> 07:45:39,900
can have secure defaults it's always

6773
07:45:39,900 --> 07:45:41,760
always preferable and that's certainly

6774
07:45:41,760 --> 07:45:43,260
not to suggest that we're perfect nobody

6775
07:45:43,260 --> 07:45:44,878
in the world is for this stuff but

6776
07:45:44,878 --> 07:45:46,260
something to strive towards and really

6777
07:45:46,260 --> 07:45:50,100
why why we've adopted this type of setup

6778
07:45:50,100 --> 07:45:51,900
another question that comes up quite a

6779
07:45:51,900 --> 07:45:54,058
bit uh usually from from sponsors for

6780
07:45:54,058 --> 07:45:56,458
this is why would you implement a bounty

6781
07:45:56,458 --> 07:45:57,900
program instead of spending that money

6782
07:45:57,900 --> 07:46:01,020
on red teaming or external pen testing

6783
07:46:01,020 --> 07:46:03,718
or more lawyers right and the biggest

6784
07:46:03,718 --> 07:46:06,120
thing is it's it's not an instead of

6785
07:46:06,120 --> 07:46:08,340
this is an in addition to you when we

6786
07:46:08,340 --> 07:46:10,680
talk about defense in depth this is one

6787
07:46:10,680 --> 07:46:12,718
part of a much bigger picture for all of

6788
07:46:12,718 --> 07:46:14,760
it and the way I like to describe it

6789
07:46:14,760 --> 07:46:16,200
despite this having been thoroughly

6790
07:46:16,200 --> 07:46:17,940
disproven I think by science at this

6791
07:46:17,940 --> 07:46:19,378
point is if you could have a thousand

6792
07:46:19,378 --> 07:46:21,058
monkeys writing Shakespeare you can have

6793
07:46:21,058 --> 07:46:22,680
a thousand security researchers finding

6794
07:46:22,680 --> 07:46:24,840
some gnarly bugs you're opening things

6795
07:46:24,840 --> 07:46:27,058
up to a world of eyes that otherwise

6796
07:46:27,058 --> 07:46:28,440
might not be there and if you can

6797
07:46:28,440 --> 07:46:30,900
incentivize that through ideally having

6798
07:46:30,900 --> 07:46:33,000
a very good responsive transparent

6799
07:46:33,000 --> 07:46:34,920
program or having a lot of money or both

6800
07:46:34,920 --> 07:46:38,458
it makes that a lot easier

6801
07:46:38,458 --> 07:46:40,920
so one of the other parts of this uh in

6802
07:46:40,920 --> 07:46:42,540
in terms of having eyes on it and

6803
07:46:42,540 --> 07:46:45,240
fitting The Best of Both Worlds here is

6804
07:46:45,240 --> 07:46:46,978
looking at opportunities like

6805
07:46:46,978 --> 07:46:49,978
invite-only programs VIP programs live

6806
07:46:49,978 --> 07:46:52,020
hacking events uh you know a lot of this

6807
07:46:52,020 --> 07:46:53,638
does come with budget but there are ways

6808
07:46:53,638 --> 07:46:55,798
to to get around that in in many cases

6809
07:46:55,798 --> 07:46:57,780
but what this lets you do is attract

6810
07:46:57,780 --> 07:46:59,820
very specific groups of folks to look at

6811
07:46:59,820 --> 07:47:02,400
very specific things so where it may be

6812
07:47:02,400 --> 07:47:04,138
a lot of back and forth to engage with

6813
07:47:04,138 --> 07:47:06,298
another company to do a deep dive on you

6814
07:47:06,298 --> 07:47:07,798
know code spaces for example from the

6815
07:47:07,798 --> 07:47:10,200
last presentation if we can say hey we

6816
07:47:10,200 --> 07:47:12,180
want to get 30 people in a room as part

6817
07:47:12,180 --> 07:47:14,820
of a live hacking event and here's some

6818
07:47:14,820 --> 07:47:16,378
extra cash bonuses if you're able to

6819
07:47:16,378 --> 07:47:18,780
find you know idors or or crits or

6820
07:47:18,780 --> 07:47:21,000
something on on code spaces we now have

6821
07:47:21,000 --> 07:47:22,558
an opportunity to do that and people are

6822
07:47:22,558 --> 07:47:24,718
flocking to to come into those events

6823
07:47:24,718 --> 07:47:27,000
and even if they don't normally work on

6824
07:47:27,000 --> 07:47:29,100
our program or or maybe even on the

6825
07:47:29,100 --> 07:47:31,138
platform there's still possibilities to

6826
07:47:31,138 --> 07:47:33,478
pull them in so that is one place where

6827
07:47:33,478 --> 07:47:35,160
where working with somebody like hacker

6828
07:47:35,160 --> 07:47:36,540
one or bug crowd or any of these other

6829
07:47:36,540 --> 07:47:38,520
platforms can be super helpful for it

6830
07:47:38,520 --> 07:47:41,120
but for for us specifically between

6831
07:47:41,120 --> 07:47:43,500
invite-only programs where we've found

6832
07:47:43,500 --> 07:47:45,240
folks who contribute frequently high

6833
07:47:45,240 --> 07:47:47,580
quality stuff to our program or live

6834
07:47:47,580 --> 07:47:49,138
hacking events we've had great success

6835
07:47:49,138 --> 07:47:51,120
for this

6836
07:47:51,120 --> 07:47:54,780
shifting gears to internal uh and I say

6837
07:47:54,780 --> 07:47:57,360
internal internal to me uh Bounty as a

6838
07:47:57,360 --> 07:47:59,218
way to learn I think this is some

6839
07:47:59,218 --> 07:48:00,360
something that's a little bit underrated

6840
07:48:00,360 --> 07:48:01,740
as an entry point into the security

6841
07:48:01,740 --> 07:48:03,120
World

6842
07:48:03,120 --> 07:48:05,100
um similar to my you know I mentioned I

6843
07:48:05,100 --> 07:48:06,900
have a background in support this is a

6844
07:48:06,900 --> 07:48:08,280
great way to get New Perspectives on

6845
07:48:08,280 --> 07:48:10,020
things uh if you have a background in

6846
07:48:10,020 --> 07:48:11,580
engineering you're going to be using all

6847
07:48:11,580 --> 07:48:12,958
of those skills but you're now putting a

6848
07:48:12,958 --> 07:48:15,840
security focus on it if you have a human

6849
07:48:15,840 --> 07:48:18,120
facing background you're now taking that

6850
07:48:18,120 --> 07:48:19,558
because you're still doing that and

6851
07:48:19,558 --> 07:48:21,478
building that security expertise on top

6852
07:48:21,478 --> 07:48:23,400
of it and if you're already in security

6853
07:48:23,400 --> 07:48:25,680
you're now building external facing

6854
07:48:25,680 --> 07:48:27,000
expertise where you have to be able to

6855
07:48:27,000 --> 07:48:28,440
communicate these things back and forth

6856
07:48:28,440 --> 07:48:29,760
and really negotiate do a lot of

6857
07:48:29,760 --> 07:48:33,000
negotiations with internal groups

6858
07:48:33,000 --> 07:48:34,440
um another part of it if you're coming

6859
07:48:34,440 --> 07:48:37,320
in uh reasonably new to the the overall

6860
07:48:37,320 --> 07:48:39,420
security or engineering world is you're

6861
07:48:39,420 --> 07:48:40,558
getting access to a lot of stuff that

6862
07:48:40,558 --> 07:48:42,600
you otherwise wouldn't have access to

6863
07:48:42,600 --> 07:48:44,638
um I've worked at and with companies

6864
07:48:44,638 --> 07:48:46,680
where it's unheard of for support folks

6865
07:48:46,680 --> 07:48:48,898
or really any customer facing folks to

6866
07:48:48,898 --> 07:48:50,840
have access to source code for a product

6867
07:48:50,840 --> 07:48:54,298
certainly not the case for us but uh you

6868
07:48:54,298 --> 07:48:55,920
know when when you're working with these

6869
07:48:55,920 --> 07:48:57,660
problems having to debug them having to

6870
07:48:57,660 --> 07:48:59,340
understand severity due investigations

6871
07:48:59,340 --> 07:49:01,378
you're getting your hands pretty deep

6872
07:49:01,378 --> 07:49:03,180
into these things and working working

6873
07:49:03,180 --> 07:49:04,978
with the experts in in these different

6874
07:49:04,978 --> 07:49:05,958
areas

6875
07:49:05,958 --> 07:49:08,280
similarly for understanding systems

6876
07:49:08,280 --> 07:49:10,200
architecture you know I I think there

6877
07:49:10,200 --> 07:49:11,940
were some some great talks earlier when

6878
07:49:11,940 --> 07:49:14,040
you're going through and taking a look

6879
07:49:14,040 --> 07:49:15,840
at a vulnerability it's it's almost

6880
07:49:15,840 --> 07:49:18,898
never hey I this API is vulnerable it's

6881
07:49:18,898 --> 07:49:20,940
this API is vulnerable because the

6882
07:49:20,940 --> 07:49:22,620
message that's going to that is going

6883
07:49:22,620 --> 07:49:24,240
through three or four other places and

6884
07:49:24,240 --> 07:49:26,520
we don't have full lineage on it whether

6885
07:49:26,520 --> 07:49:29,100
it be privacy stuff or deserialization

6886
07:49:29,100 --> 07:49:31,260
vulnerabilities whatever uh there are

6887
07:49:31,260 --> 07:49:34,138
many many ways to to get into this and

6888
07:49:34,138 --> 07:49:36,000
lastly looking at engaging with other

6889
07:49:36,000 --> 07:49:37,558
teams and companies you know I've

6890
07:49:37,558 --> 07:49:39,000
certainly had no shortage of working

6891
07:49:39,000 --> 07:49:40,500
with different engineering teams to dig

6892
07:49:40,500 --> 07:49:42,240
into this stuff external vendors and

6893
07:49:42,240 --> 07:49:44,280
whatnot and I think that's true for for

6894
07:49:44,280 --> 07:49:46,320
most stuff in in this world and I think

6895
07:49:46,320 --> 07:49:47,638
I look at that as a big plus though

6896
07:49:47,638 --> 07:49:49,138
certainly comes with some some fun

6897
07:49:49,138 --> 07:49:51,298
sometimes

6898
07:49:51,298 --> 07:49:53,100
so moving into the what I'd call the

6899
07:49:53,100 --> 07:49:54,840
picture slides for this the takeaways

6900
07:49:54,840 --> 07:49:57,000
for folks uh this one is is for anyone

6901
07:49:57,000 --> 07:49:58,558
who's looking to submit Bounty reports

6902
07:49:58,558 --> 07:50:01,798
again this is to us or or anyone else uh

6903
07:50:01,798 --> 07:50:03,718
there are a few key things I'd recommend

6904
07:50:03,718 --> 07:50:05,878
the first is treat your Bounty reports

6905
07:50:05,878 --> 07:50:09,000
as as UDP traffic fire and forget send

6906
07:50:09,000 --> 07:50:11,160
them off if it gets looked at that's

6907
07:50:11,160 --> 07:50:13,500
fantastic uh if you're going through and

6908
07:50:13,500 --> 07:50:16,620
doing constant bumping on reports uh if

6909
07:50:16,620 --> 07:50:17,820
you've been on the receiving end of that

6910
07:50:17,820 --> 07:50:19,080
where somebody's following up by email

6911
07:50:19,080 --> 07:50:21,600
every six hours you know it's not a

6912
07:50:21,600 --> 07:50:23,638
great way to really get attention uh if

6913
07:50:23,638 --> 07:50:24,898
you're looking to bump stuff once a week

6914
07:50:24,898 --> 07:50:26,458
or so that's that's usually pretty good

6915
07:50:26,458 --> 07:50:28,138
but in general what I've seen especially

6916
07:50:28,138 --> 07:50:29,398
from the folks who are pulling in a lot

6917
07:50:29,398 --> 07:50:31,440
of money they will put in very high

6918
07:50:31,440 --> 07:50:34,020
quality reports send them off and let

6919
07:50:34,020 --> 07:50:35,580
them be if they need to follow up they

6920
07:50:35,580 --> 07:50:37,500
will and if they don't they will

6921
07:50:37,500 --> 07:50:39,058
next is to have a pretty good

6922
07:50:39,058 --> 07:50:40,320
understanding of what you're reporting

6923
07:50:40,320 --> 07:50:43,020
uh there's a whole lot of cases where

6924
07:50:43,020 --> 07:50:44,520
you know if there's smoke there's fire

6925
07:50:44,520 --> 07:50:46,218
so if you see something say something

6926
07:50:46,218 --> 07:50:49,260
absolutely nothing wrong with that uh if

6927
07:50:49,260 --> 07:50:51,000
you are looking at submitting stuff and

6928
07:50:51,000 --> 07:50:52,860
you think there's going to be a bit of

6929
07:50:52,860 --> 07:50:54,780
back and forth around it it's really

6930
07:50:54,780 --> 07:50:56,340
helpful to be prepared for that to have

6931
07:50:56,340 --> 07:50:57,540
an understanding of what you're looking

6932
07:50:57,540 --> 07:51:00,420
at a key example I'll give here with

6933
07:51:00,420 --> 07:51:02,340
GitHub is we have an import function

6934
07:51:02,340 --> 07:51:04,558
that can pull stuff in from other source

6935
07:51:04,558 --> 07:51:06,780
code repository providers or or even

6936
07:51:06,780 --> 07:51:08,820
on-prem stuff and we get reports

6937
07:51:08,820 --> 07:51:10,260
probably about once a week talking about

6938
07:51:10,260 --> 07:51:12,540
ssrf vulnerabilities with it because you

6939
07:51:12,540 --> 07:51:14,040
can provide a URL and then GitHub

6940
07:51:14,040 --> 07:51:16,320
reaches out to that that's exactly what

6941
07:51:16,320 --> 07:51:18,180
it's designed to do so understanding

6942
07:51:18,180 --> 07:51:20,280
that context can be can be quite helpful

6943
07:51:20,280 --> 07:51:22,378
both for you making sure you're not

6944
07:51:22,378 --> 07:51:24,718
wasting your time but once a report goes

6945
07:51:24,718 --> 07:51:26,100
in uh you know if you really need to

6946
07:51:26,100 --> 07:51:27,660
push something through you you can do

6947
07:51:27,660 --> 07:51:28,378
that

6948
07:51:28,378 --> 07:51:29,878
next up is when you're looking at

6949
07:51:29,878 --> 07:51:31,200
submitting with any program you know

6950
07:51:31,200 --> 07:51:32,520
understand the scope that they have

6951
07:51:32,520 --> 07:51:34,440
understand the rules they have around

6952
07:51:34,440 --> 07:51:36,620
disclosure where information needs to go

6953
07:51:36,620 --> 07:51:39,298
nothing is worse than having a report

6954
07:51:39,298 --> 07:51:41,520
come in with some pretty gross stuff and

6955
07:51:41,520 --> 07:51:43,620
somebody then realizes that it's in you

6956
07:51:43,620 --> 07:51:45,058
know paste bin somewhere else that

6957
07:51:45,058 --> 07:51:47,940
they've tried to include stuff so not

6958
07:51:47,940 --> 07:51:49,440
not a great look for anybody at that

6959
07:51:49,440 --> 07:51:50,458
point because now you have a security

6960
07:51:50,458 --> 07:51:53,760
incident in addition to a bug

6961
07:51:53,760 --> 07:51:55,978
other part of this is you know if you're

6962
07:51:55,978 --> 07:51:57,840
looking to work with programs long term

6963
07:51:57,840 --> 07:51:59,878
we have a lot of folks who come back I

6964
07:51:59,878 --> 07:52:01,740
think for a lot of boundary programs out

6965
07:52:01,740 --> 07:52:03,478
there there's a lot of repeat uh I say

6966
07:52:03,478 --> 07:52:06,298
repeat customers repeat submitters uh

6967
07:52:06,298 --> 07:52:07,740
it's it's really helpful to understand

6968
07:52:07,740 --> 07:52:09,180
that you know of course there are humans

6969
07:52:09,180 --> 07:52:11,398
on both sides of this relationship so if

6970
07:52:11,398 --> 07:52:13,260
there are ways to uh you know sort of

6971
07:52:13,260 --> 07:52:15,360
understand how how people tend to

6972
07:52:15,360 --> 07:52:16,978
approach reports on both sides if

6973
07:52:16,978 --> 07:52:18,478
there's stuff that is generally asked

6974
07:52:18,478 --> 07:52:19,860
for that maybe not part of the program

6975
07:52:19,860 --> 07:52:22,320
whether it be video pocs or scripts

6976
07:52:22,320 --> 07:52:24,120
whatever if you can come armed with that

6977
07:52:24,120 --> 07:52:25,440
it's going to save everyone a lot of

6978
07:52:25,440 --> 07:52:28,260
time and generally builds things up from

6979
07:52:28,260 --> 07:52:30,478
from there and the last one which I

6980
07:52:30,478 --> 07:52:32,340
think everybody will appreciate avoid

6981
07:52:32,340 --> 07:52:34,440
 uh you know we talked earlier

6982
07:52:34,440 --> 07:52:36,898
about understanding or at least having a

6983
07:52:36,898 --> 07:52:37,920
decent understanding of what you're

6984
07:52:37,920 --> 07:52:39,718
submitting if you're sending stuff in

6985
07:52:39,718 --> 07:52:41,160
just to say you've submitted Bounty

6986
07:52:41,160 --> 07:52:44,580
reports it's not particularly helpful a

6987
07:52:44,580 --> 07:52:46,260
lot of programs will actively punish

6988
07:52:46,260 --> 07:52:48,840
this uh not and whether or not that's up

6989
07:52:48,840 --> 07:52:50,520
to the program owners is a different

6990
07:52:50,520 --> 07:52:53,040
story I would generally encourage folks

6991
07:52:53,040 --> 07:52:55,920
to be lenient with closure States for

6992
07:52:55,920 --> 07:52:58,620
reports but looking at hacker one for

6993
07:52:58,620 --> 07:52:59,700
example they have a thing called a

6994
07:52:59,700 --> 07:53:01,320
signal ratio you have to have to be able

6995
07:53:01,320 --> 07:53:03,120
to submit reports so if you wind up

6996
07:53:03,120 --> 07:53:04,680
getting dinged for sending stuff in

6997
07:53:04,680 --> 07:53:06,120
through a program that's maybe a bit

6998
07:53:06,120 --> 07:53:07,500
less generous around those closure

6999
07:53:07,500 --> 07:53:10,558
States you can wind up just nuking your

7000
07:53:10,558 --> 07:53:13,680
career before it starts on that

7001
07:53:13,680 --> 07:53:15,478
shifting over to folks working on a

7002
07:53:15,478 --> 07:53:16,920
bounty programs I know there were a few

7003
07:53:16,920 --> 07:53:19,978
here which is nice the key thing here is

7004
07:53:19,978 --> 07:53:21,600
to remember that when researchers doing

7005
07:53:21,600 --> 07:53:23,218
well on your program you know when they

7006
07:53:23,218 --> 07:53:24,680
win you win

7007
07:53:24,680 --> 07:53:27,478
if you can continue to incentivize folks

7008
07:53:27,478 --> 07:53:29,160
to come back and make it worth their

7009
07:53:29,160 --> 07:53:31,798
time and worth your own time to deal

7010
07:53:31,798 --> 07:53:34,378
with that it's it's good for everybody

7011
07:53:34,378 --> 07:53:36,740
at that point and next up talking about

7012
07:53:36,740 --> 07:53:39,780
uh closure States and whatnot is the

7013
07:53:39,780 --> 07:53:41,638
more you can help folks to grow

7014
07:53:41,638 --> 07:53:44,040
especially if you're working with a

7015
07:53:44,040 --> 07:53:46,620
program that gets a lot of let's say

7016
07:53:46,620 --> 07:53:48,780
less experienced folks submitting

7017
07:53:48,780 --> 07:53:50,520
reports if there are opportunities to

7018
07:53:50,520 --> 07:53:52,558
contribute back through those reports

7019
07:53:52,558 --> 07:53:55,580
that's a great way to do it I mentioned

7020
07:53:55,580 --> 07:53:57,898
punitive closure states with some of

7021
07:53:57,898 --> 07:54:00,540
these platforms we use something called

7022
07:54:00,540 --> 07:54:02,398
the informative status on hacker one

7023
07:54:02,398 --> 07:54:04,260
which basically is no reputation hit if

7024
07:54:04,260 --> 07:54:06,120
you submit a report and we say hey it's

7025
07:54:06,120 --> 07:54:09,120
invalid whatever a default might be to

7026
07:54:09,120 --> 07:54:10,558
put that as not applicable which will be

7027
07:54:10,558 --> 07:54:12,478
a reputation hit we will tend to opt for

7028
07:54:12,478 --> 07:54:13,680
informative for it which is no

7029
07:54:13,680 --> 07:54:16,440
reputation hit and we always try to give

7030
07:54:16,440 --> 07:54:18,478
a sort of a quick explanation as to why

7031
07:54:18,478 --> 07:54:20,340
that's the case so if you send something

7032
07:54:20,340 --> 07:54:22,558
in with that ssrf scenario I talked

7033
07:54:22,558 --> 07:54:23,940
about earlier we're actually going to

7034
07:54:23,940 --> 07:54:25,440
provide an explanation of why we don't

7035
07:54:25,440 --> 07:54:27,360
consider it to be a vulnerability or or

7036
07:54:27,360 --> 07:54:30,600
a problem in general so again if if you

7037
07:54:30,600 --> 07:54:32,160
can keep folks coming back through that

7038
07:54:32,160 --> 07:54:34,680
way keep educating them everyone sort of

7039
07:54:34,680 --> 07:54:36,958
comes out better there

7040
07:54:36,958 --> 07:54:39,898
uh as a person working on the program as

7041
07:54:39,898 --> 07:54:41,398
well you know do your own research

7042
07:54:41,398 --> 07:54:42,540
around this right understand the

7043
07:54:42,540 --> 07:54:43,680
vulnerable surface that you have

7044
07:54:43,680 --> 07:54:45,180
understand the trends that are out there

7045
07:54:45,180 --> 07:54:47,160
understand the attack vectors uh it's

7046
07:54:47,160 --> 07:54:48,660
going to speed things up for everyone if

7047
07:54:48,660 --> 07:54:50,218
you can get reports coming in and you

7048
07:54:50,218 --> 07:54:52,500
already know what to look for as soon as

7049
07:54:52,500 --> 07:54:54,180
those land that can be incredibly

7050
07:54:54,180 --> 07:54:56,580
helpful and the last point on here and I

7051
07:54:56,580 --> 07:54:57,898
can't stress this enough is be

7052
07:54:57,898 --> 07:55:00,840
professional similar to on being on the

7053
07:55:00,840 --> 07:55:02,458
submitting side and not wanting to try

7054
07:55:02,458 --> 07:55:04,680
to baffle people with that goes

7055
07:55:04,680 --> 07:55:06,000
two ways

7056
07:55:06,000 --> 07:55:08,340
um you are I say this being on stage

7057
07:55:08,340 --> 07:55:10,020
talking about it you know you are the

7058
07:55:10,020 --> 07:55:11,760
face of your company uh just like

7059
07:55:11,760 --> 07:55:13,798
working in support or working in sales

7060
07:55:13,798 --> 07:55:15,958
or work you know working at the the desk

7061
07:55:15,958 --> 07:55:18,660
at a store uh if you say something or do

7062
07:55:18,660 --> 07:55:20,040
something that represents the company

7063
07:55:20,040 --> 07:55:23,100
almost more than it represents you so if

7064
07:55:23,100 --> 07:55:25,138
you are uh you know if I come up here

7065
07:55:25,138 --> 07:55:26,878
and say something that's just wildly off

7066
07:55:26,878 --> 07:55:29,760
color it's not necessarily Logan said

7067
07:55:29,760 --> 07:55:32,218
this it's GitHub said this so keep keep

7068
07:55:32,218 --> 07:55:34,500
that in mind

7069
07:55:34,500 --> 07:55:36,420
and last up this is for folks who are

7070
07:55:36,420 --> 07:55:37,558
actually running programs because I know

7071
07:55:37,558 --> 07:55:39,360
there are a couple here uh thank you for

7072
07:55:39,360 --> 07:55:40,798
what you do you make this possible for

7073
07:55:40,798 --> 07:55:43,798
all of us uh but biggest thing here is

7074
07:55:43,798 --> 07:55:45,840
you know you utilize your program as a

7075
07:55:45,840 --> 07:55:47,700
way to refine your program and to work

7076
07:55:47,700 --> 07:55:49,320
with your broader security teams for

7077
07:55:49,320 --> 07:55:51,780
this stuff uh take a look at where your

7078
07:55:51,780 --> 07:55:53,160
reports are coming in what types of

7079
07:55:53,160 --> 07:55:55,200
reports you're getting and use those to

7080
07:55:55,200 --> 07:55:57,540
refine your operations your secure sdlc

7081
07:55:57,540 --> 07:56:00,420
all of that and and certainly and this

7082
07:56:00,420 --> 07:56:01,680
goes for everyone you know try to be as

7083
07:56:01,680 --> 07:56:03,840
honest and fair as you can for things if

7084
07:56:03,840 --> 07:56:05,218
there are scenarios where your program

7085
07:56:05,218 --> 07:56:06,958
has had a screw up or you know maybe

7086
07:56:06,958 --> 07:56:08,638
you've closed a report only to find out

7087
07:56:08,638 --> 07:56:10,138
six months later that it was actually

7088
07:56:10,138 --> 07:56:12,240
valid do the right thing look for

7089
07:56:12,240 --> 07:56:13,500
opportunities to reopen those

7090
07:56:13,500 --> 07:56:15,298
communicate with the original researcher

7091
07:56:15,298 --> 07:56:17,940
make things right as much as you can it

7092
07:56:17,940 --> 07:56:20,100
doesn't take long to go on to bug Bounty

7093
07:56:20,100 --> 07:56:21,660
forums or something and find some horror

7094
07:56:21,660 --> 07:56:22,978
stories about programs that have

7095
07:56:22,978 --> 07:56:25,378
absolutely botched this I don't don't

7096
07:56:25,378 --> 07:56:26,940
know and I don't think our our track

7097
07:56:26,940 --> 07:56:28,440
record is absolutely perfect I don't

7098
07:56:28,440 --> 07:56:30,420
think anybody's is but the more you can

7099
07:56:30,420 --> 07:56:31,920
strive to go in this direction the

7100
07:56:31,920 --> 07:56:33,478
better

7101
07:56:33,478 --> 07:56:35,700
uh similarly looking for opportunities

7102
07:56:35,700 --> 07:56:38,580
to collaborate internally the more you

7103
07:56:38,580 --> 07:56:40,558
can reduce the friction for engineering

7104
07:56:40,558 --> 07:56:42,478
teams wanting to be in scope for your

7105
07:56:42,478 --> 07:56:44,520
program the easier it's going to be to

7106
07:56:44,520 --> 07:56:45,780
run because you'll have a very clear

7107
07:56:45,780 --> 07:56:47,940
definition of your scope as well it's

7108
07:56:47,940 --> 07:56:49,378
not going to be a case where you have to

7109
07:56:49,378 --> 07:56:51,478
constantly go back and forth to

7110
07:56:51,478 --> 07:56:52,978
understand if something's in scope if

7111
07:56:52,978 --> 07:56:55,320
your default is that it is in scope and

7112
07:56:55,320 --> 07:56:56,878
that you have ways to then reach out to

7113
07:56:56,878 --> 07:56:59,340
those teams another part of this as well

7114
07:56:59,340 --> 07:57:00,898
is to look at opportunities to bring

7115
07:57:00,898 --> 07:57:04,440
things in looking back at uh you know

7116
07:57:04,440 --> 07:57:07,500
invite-only programs VIP events if there

7117
07:57:07,500 --> 07:57:09,298
are ways you can build that into a beta

7118
07:57:09,298 --> 07:57:11,280
for uh for software right as something

7119
07:57:11,280 --> 07:57:13,200
rolls out if it's right before release

7120
07:57:13,200 --> 07:57:15,958
if you can feature flag folks into that

7121
07:57:15,958 --> 07:57:17,580
so they can start hacking on it before

7122
07:57:17,580 --> 07:57:18,898
it's necessarily going to be out there

7123
07:57:18,898 --> 07:57:20,878
in the wild affecting customers one

7124
07:57:20,878 --> 07:57:22,440
that's a great perk for VIPs because

7125
07:57:22,440 --> 07:57:23,638
they know they have limited competition

7126
07:57:23,638 --> 07:57:26,040
for it but two it also lets you ship a

7127
07:57:26,040 --> 07:57:27,540
more secure product when you get to that

7128
07:57:27,540 --> 07:57:29,040
point

7129
07:57:29,040 --> 07:57:30,478
we already talked about this you know

7130
07:57:30,478 --> 07:57:31,860
understand Trends Technical and

7131
07:57:31,860 --> 07:57:33,240
non-technical if there's stuff that's

7132
07:57:33,240 --> 07:57:35,760
going on out there whether it be you

7133
07:57:35,760 --> 07:57:37,978
know log4j or the next one if you can

7134
07:57:37,978 --> 07:57:40,080
help prepare your your company and your

7135
07:57:40,080 --> 07:57:41,878
teams for responses to that making sure

7136
07:57:41,878 --> 07:57:43,500
you've got things in place to be able to

7137
07:57:43,500 --> 07:57:46,620
follow up quickly it's super helpful and

7138
07:57:46,620 --> 07:57:49,440
uh yeah on the on the non-technical side

7139
07:57:49,440 --> 07:57:51,360
as well you know understand if there are

7140
07:57:51,360 --> 07:57:52,740
you know big spam issues or something

7141
07:57:52,740 --> 07:57:54,420
that are coming in for for your platform

7142
07:57:54,420 --> 07:57:56,520
or your program again if there's ways to

7143
07:57:56,520 --> 07:57:58,138
streamline that just reduce stress for

7144
07:57:58,138 --> 07:57:59,638
everyone

7145
07:57:59,638 --> 07:58:01,080
and lastly you know look for

7146
07:58:01,080 --> 07:58:03,120
opportunities to to grow your program

7147
07:58:03,120 --> 07:58:05,760
and attract researchers uh if you are

7148
07:58:05,760 --> 07:58:07,558
brand new into this space building a new

7149
07:58:07,558 --> 07:58:10,020
program start out small look to build up

7150
07:58:10,020 --> 07:58:11,580
from there but again be very clear on

7151
07:58:11,580 --> 07:58:12,840
your scope so there's not a lot of

7152
07:58:12,840 --> 07:58:14,760
confusion for folks uh and certainly

7153
07:58:14,760 --> 07:58:16,558
once you have folks coming in try to

7154
07:58:16,558 --> 07:58:17,878
treat them as well as you can so they

7155
07:58:17,878 --> 07:58:19,378
keep coming back and keep finding cool

7156
07:58:19,378 --> 07:58:21,958
stuff for you if there are opportunities

7157
07:58:21,958 --> 07:58:24,540
to do live hacking events or promotions

7158
07:58:24,540 --> 07:58:27,180
whatever through bonuses for new

7159
07:58:27,180 --> 07:58:29,040
features things like that certainly

7160
07:58:29,040 --> 07:58:30,898
encouraged the feedback we've gotten

7161
07:58:30,898 --> 07:58:32,340
from folks working on our program and

7162
07:58:32,340 --> 07:58:33,898
other people we've spoken to with other

7163
07:58:33,898 --> 07:58:36,718
programs uh is really the more you can

7164
07:58:36,718 --> 07:58:39,000
sort of Target things hype things up and

7165
07:58:39,000 --> 07:58:40,680
deliver on them the better off

7166
