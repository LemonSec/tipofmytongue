speak French

83
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,680
so I come from France and we are going to talk

84
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,900
we are going to be even more between us because

85
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,520
we are going to talk about the network so there in

86
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,960
general French more  network plus

87
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,980
hour everyone is leaving

88
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:27,300
thank you for staying so as it was

89
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,820
introduced my name is Marc dorero you

90
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,579
can find me on Twitter at Marc

91
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:37,140
dove or by my first and last name I am an

92
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,119
architect in charge of cyber  I have

93
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,339
cyber otitis and I had the chance to

94
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:42,359
work in telecommunications

95
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:43,920
that's why I'm going to talk to you about the

96
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,520
network and I work in an entity

97
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:51,619
a structure that creates this kind of

98
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:55,800
little babies of 70,000  tons there are only

99
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,180
a few companies in the world that do

100
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,520
this and you imagine that there is a lot

101
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,920
of digital in a

102
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,359
nuclear submarine in an aircraft carrier or in

103
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:04,500
a frigate

104
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,859
and that therefore we are interested in everything that

105
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:10,380
goes  be from the overlay network or

106
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,099
switches so I'm going to give you

107
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:12,480
some definitions because I asked the

108
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,520
girl the question for her a switch

109
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,060
looks pretty much like that an overlay

110
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,619
my builder was very interesting and

111
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:21,540
the network was very  Facebook and

112
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,660
tip-top for her so we're going to give a

113
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,220
few terms the two terms that

114
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:29,280
come up it's overlender if you've

115
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,020
looked at cubergative this kind of thing

116
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,880
we're talking about overlay but in fact

117
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,040
it's it's very  simple it is a network

118
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,720
which is said to be superimposed as its name

119
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,660
suggests and the idea is to have a

120
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,700
network which will be interconnected with

121
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,540
underlying links

122
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,560
you will have physical links on

123
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,060
a physical infrastructure so

124
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,560
the enderley is the

125
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,140
physical infrastructure the overlay that's the phrase

126
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,180
logical structure there's something

127
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,579
called VPNs where we ended up with

128
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:58,859
more or less the same concepts in short

129
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:01,500
it's a virtual network  who will who will

130
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,200
hide the infrastructure of an atlas

131
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,880
Center since here we will be interested in

132
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,640
data centers

133
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,240
well draw me a data center I am talking

134
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,500
here about data centers that you can

135
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,480
always in business that you can

136
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,160
find in a ship  why not

137
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,020
since I showed them to you and that you

138
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,960
will find with our friends

139
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,520
Gafa with much less

140
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,339
public documentation or with

141
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:27,780


142
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:30,960
national or even international telecommunications operators as a

143
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,700
general rule national or

144
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,260
international operations will be based on

145
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,960
entire network equipment and  they will

146
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,720
use technologies that are

147
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,420
given by our friends at Kartner so there

148
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:46,020
I took the 2020 from you and you have

149
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,780
more or less names that you know from

150
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,400
major manufacturers I didn't know

151
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,859
too much about the Canadian operators in

152
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:54,960
the on the route of the  'plane I looked

153
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,839
I was typing beautiful you see that beautiful they

154
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,460
communicated with Cisco on their

155
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:02,400
adaptation their adoption of VX line they

156
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,920
have so they are here is the what I say

157
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,180
on the European market on the

158
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,980
North American market it is  also true of

159
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,160
course

160
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,200
I'm going to be interested in

161
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,640
a particular technology which is

162
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,079
vxline you have seen there are plenty of

163
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,599
protocols that allow

164
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:20,640
encapsulation because in the end we are

165
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,740
talking about that

166
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,760
and making the open network the

167
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,220
why I  talks about vxlan because the

168
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,800
standard well there is an RFC that talks about

169
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,980
it

170
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,140
is used the standard was designed by

171
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,300
big players here Arista brodcom

172
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,339
Cisco VM Intel Red Hot hours so

173
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:40,800
everyone does X-Type most of

174
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,220
the time  manufacturers have used this

175
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,560
technology it's based on the Internet and

176
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,660
why I'm developing it's a really

177
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,880
good client you'll see it's a good

178
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,920
client one because you're bound to

179
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,640
encounter this technology there if you

180
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,839
have switches and routers you

181
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,000
have you seen you have Cisco etc there is

182
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,060
vxlam in it so as soon as your

183
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,160
network administrators are interested in a

184
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,420
limitation which is quite stupid is that

185
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,640
the velines are 400096 Velan no more

186
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,560
so when you are in a  Center state

187
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,839
if you have more than if you hope to

188
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:15,079
have more than 400096

189
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:18,540
unique networks well that's not

190
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,859
for so we have to switch

191
00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:22,200
to pitty vxlan technologies so

192
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,640
in switch routers you have some

193
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,560
in hypervisors you don't  have

194
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,839
you therefore made VMware as soon as you

195
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:32,119
put NSX in its version t

196
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:34,320
transport information by default

197
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,300
these vehicles which are used you have

198
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,240
seen it is the author of the RFC so

199
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,000
in the containers that is interesting

200
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,140
as soon as you are going to do cubarnative

201
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:46,200
you have CNNs we use networks

202
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,480
like flynel or other what are we

203
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,480
using as an overlay of the vxlade if you are

204
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,240
doing software define network if

205
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,560
what is a great solution for

206
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,760
operators  you have a

207
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:00,180
central console okay and I can I can

208
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:04,020
manage 80 without 200 router 600 switch

209
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:07,260
2000 switch with a console it's

210
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,540
vix-line that's behind it and there are

211
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,920
nice publications on it if you

212
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,560
want to see the first pangs  from

213
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,099
Cisco you are going to see

214
00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:19,319
this presentation there on the

215
00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:22,619
Cisco 4 CVU SDN solution a presentation there I

216
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:25,740
will present three small interesting points to you

217
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,839
today the architecture

218
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,359
it is quite easy to understand

219
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:31,740
finally

220
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:32,960
you have

221
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,880


222
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,099
two levels so already it is a bit

223
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:40,020
inverted i.e. the enderley is what

224
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,099
you have roughly is what is

225
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:43,319
below and the overlay is what

226
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:45,540
I put down on my diagram is  in

227
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,859
fact where you are going to have your customers

228
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:49,020
it was the calves of the time so there

229
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,060
I have my green customer there

230
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:54,000
I have my customer wants blue there I have

231
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,400
what I call vtep so it's the

232
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,300
vtep virtual endings

233
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,280
and it's over in virtual they will

234
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,780
do their capsulation and in fact the

235
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,700
principle is very simple very simple is that

236
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,880
here I have eternal traffic

237
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:12,540
on that side the infrastructures the

238
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,520
same no need to  know the CPIPs and

239
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,560
in fact the etherned frames your weapon

240
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,260
capsule on the network says underley in

241
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,380
what when the TCPIP just stupidly ok so

242
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:23,940
there you have the format the frame this is

243
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:24,619
one

244
00:44:24,619 --> 00:44:27,780
of what a small capture where

245
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,280
sharp you maybe see  not very well

246
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,079
there by far but what is interesting

247
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:33,540
to see is QDP traffic you have a

248
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:34,819
year one in the header

249
00:44:34,819 --> 00:44:39,839
which actually corresponds to a

250
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,640
UDP header in which you will have a port

251
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,579
which corresponds with Islam and then you

252
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:47,400
have  what do you have the Ethernet frame

253
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,560
that corresponds to what is there in the

254
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,060


255
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:53,579
open network okay

256
00:44:53,579 --> 00:44:55,319
what is interesting is that we will

257
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:56,060
be able to

258
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:59,220
draw in fact it is these Vtech which

259
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:01,440
can be switches the  routers a

260
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,819
bit of both since on the one hand it makes

261
00:45:02,819 --> 00:45:04,579
you know that PIP must from the Internet to

262
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:07,740
containers okay

263
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,300
that is to say when you do the

264
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,180
containerization the network part is

265
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,940
really down to the container

266
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,819
so that's it's that's

267
00:45:16,819 --> 00:45:18,780
limits of responsibility

268
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,579
that change between your

269
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:22,280
network administrators and the administrators

270
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:26,520
of your VX of your VMware and I see

271
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,900
people who say yes yes yes in the room

272
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,819
because in general the VMware people

273
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:31,319
but they activate that  and the people of the

274
00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:32,640
network they are not aware and

275
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,660
suddenly we find ourselves with two teams

276
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,900
who and laugh who start to manage

277
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,660
the network and to

278
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:40,619
make trades on which it is necessary that he

279
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:43,140
communicates so I am going to set up a

280
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,339
small laboratory to  show you all

281
00:45:44,339 --> 00:45:45,780
that you can really do it in

282
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:48,000
your garden in your garage I

283
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,680
do them on vacation my wife was

284
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,000
delighted we were in the mountains I

285
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,700
even took my pc

286
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:56,520
a few VMs okay which actually represents

287
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,960
the components that I  I

288
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,300
showed you on the previous diagram know

289
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,280
that there are free software versions

290
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,400
of all the major

291
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,660
publishers that I have shown you

292
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,460
previously and there the Lab is very

293
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:09,839
simple

294
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,420
I simulated

295
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:15,839
two and friends so a green blue and

296
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,540
j  I have virtual machines which

297
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:21,079
represent the vtep and

298
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:23,640
at the top it can be centralized

299
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,260
but it is not forced to use them

300
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:29,760
so here are the machines which are here which

301
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,680
represent the different customers the

302
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,300
virtual machines which are here which

303
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,520
represent the different  Vtech and we

304
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,060
're going to have fun with that

305
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,260
camoisoning so we have a we

306
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,520
always have tables in the

307
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,740
physical switches with an entry number that

308
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,960
allows the ports of each

309
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,319
machine to be associated with the

310
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:51,119
MAC address of each machine.  there's

311
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,579
a table in your switches all that

312
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,560
still works on a technology that

313
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:58,680
's current okay so all the

314
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,560
good recipes still work, but on the

315
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,000
switches there was plenty of techno that

316
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,280
helps prevent that okay on a

317
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,180
switch  currently configured correctly

318
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:10,280
the RP

319
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,599
poisoning no longer works because there is

320
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:14,280
RP inspection which allows you to avoid

321
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,839
this when you go to buy a solution

322
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,880
from the major publishers that I have

323
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,619
shown you I have done my my tests l

324
00:48:19,619 --> 00:48:21,420
last year it's not yet implemented

325
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,760
okay so all the good old

326
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,099
recipes but that's all for you

327
00:48:25,099 --> 00:48:27,300
resume your lessons 20 years ago it

328
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,040
still works

329
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,300
so there is a particular concept

330
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:34,980
in what I presented to you  it's

331
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:37,619
that the Vtech remember its

332
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:40,260
principle it's here I do I have

333
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:41,579
eternal frames and then I'm going to

334
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:44,339
send it back with a TCPIP fellatio survey

335
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:47,220
to another Vtech the question

336
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:49,020
is to which one I send when  I have

337
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,000
several when there are two you can see

338
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,440
the other and if it's not mine it's

339
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,200
yours if you have one like Google or

340
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,700
a national operator 1000

341
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:03,000
when you have a frame and you

342
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,099
want  send it to a correspondent there

343
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:06,180
are several ways to do first

344
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:08,420
solution a static you can

345
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:10,740
imagine that if I have 2000 it does

346
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,319
n't work second multicast solution

347
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:16,079
remember for those who

348
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:16,980
still remember their multicast network course

349
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:20,700
I have one  TCPIP address had

350
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,160
P in this case it is an

351
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,839
IP address and I send and it sends several

352
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:27,060
machines at the same time it works on

353
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:29,220
networks of modest size and the

354
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:31,140
third solution is the one who was able to

355
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,260
use it  why because the

356
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:36,900
operators love VGP here you

357
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:39,720
have done it in the CTFs I believe from

358
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,180
noirsec they love BGP so they

359
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:44,180
used BGP to solve this problem there

360
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,440
BGP I will present it to you later and

361
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,520
I will also present something to you

362
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:51,680
here  is that you who knows

363
00:49:52,819 --> 00:49:55,020
it's great I advise you it's a

364
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,579
Frenchman that he did you have it in

365
00:49:56,579 --> 00:49:58,859
all the good distributions it

366
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:00,420
allows you to forge frames it's very

367
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:02,339
stupid the language is easy to understand

368
00:50:02,339 --> 00:50:04,920
there I  I send a frame it's an

369
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,079
eternal frame I can forge a source I

370
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:09,839
can also forge a destination so

371
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:12,839
this is the Ethernet header part in

372
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:14,819
which I'm going to encapsulate IP in

373
00:50:14,819 --> 00:50:17,339
which I encapsulate UDP  the slash is

374
00:50:17,339 --> 00:50:18,599
in the capsulation in which I

375
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:19,980
encapsulate aging in

376
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,839
which I will encapsulate from the Eternal

377
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:24,060
an IP frame and a UDP frame that's

378
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,800
the great classic of a vxline hatch

379
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,380
okay with this little toy you

380
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,300
can you see that wherever you

381
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,680
are on the backbone you can

382
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,319
send messages on the Vtech if

383
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,180
you are on the right port which is the

384
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:38,819
destination 47.89 which corresponds to the port

385
00:50:38,819 --> 00:50:41,819
of the Vicks Line and well in fact your Vtech

386
00:50:41,819 --> 00:50:43,380
we accept it  that is to say that there is

387
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,119
no security that has been implemented on the

388
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,800
underway underland part

389
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:52,440
you send yourself to forge a single

390
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,960
source and then you can go and forge

391
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,300
frames like that without problem you

392
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,160
will very well have an article here which

393
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,720
explains all these  technologies there which

394
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,200
are also a little known there what you

395
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,460
have to remember is that when you are

396
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:08,540
in the enderley there is no security

397
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:10,500
BGP it is a protocol which is

398
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,420
ultimately not that complicated it is

399
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:15,240
c  it's TCP between

400
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,220
the Vtechs and they'll pass the

401
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:19,740
messages from me I know such and such a

402
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:21,300
address you know such and such a macadrée there

403
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,440
's some who can live to put it

404
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,359
simply it works like that all the

405
00:51:24,359 --> 00:51:26,180
operators base their their their

406
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:29,760
life x nature they call

407
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,800
it EPN

408
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,300
so we're going to try to go a little

409
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:34,760
further than what you already know what do we

410
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,839


411
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:39,380
usually start by doing but doses

412
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:42,480
it's so easy that you put

413
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,780
here I am a customer so I buy

414
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:48,540
from an operator X or Y a collection

415
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,579
I connect and in fact I generate

416
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:53,220
source and destination macaddresses and

417
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:55,579
I see that on my network so if

418
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:57,960
I am a good operator everything is  goes

419
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,059
well if I am with a small operator

420
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:02,520
who has done things less correctly

421
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,680
or just who has completely read the

422
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,420
documentation which says I have respected the

423
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,579
doc works well but in fact you will

424
00:52:08,579 --> 00:52:13,079
saturate the BGP process and the BGP will

425
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:15,119
fall  and when the BGP falls everything

426
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:17,400
agrees so we can say to ourselves

427
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,359
it was I who made the wrong

428
00:52:18,359 --> 00:52:19,940
manipulations so I

429
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,960
contacted the manufacturer I say sir

430
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,880
I have a little problem she did oh

431
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,380
yes he  there is a problem

432
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,119
there is a problem because BGP must

433
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:30,180
not drop when I forge frame if

434
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:33,059
you have BGP on an

435
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:34,740
operator router there are functions which

436
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,599
allow you to avoid that well if you

437
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:37,940
look for example at the  doc from Cisco

438
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:40,200
but in fact it explains to you that provpn

439
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,059
is not yet implemented, for example the

440
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:44,119
learning limit for the number of Macs has

441
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:47,339
always existed on VGP on

442
00:52:47,339 --> 00:52:48,119


443
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:50,099
IP addresses but there on MAC addresses for

444
00:52:50,099 --> 00:52:52,160
ovpn it does not exist therefore

445
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,140
not  solution on that then the

446
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:57,180
solution what is it among the adults who

447
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:58,859
have understood the problem is to

448
00:52:58,859 --> 00:53:00,839
manage everything statically okay that is to say

449
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:03,240
that when you give a Mac you

450
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,920
can no longer move it that allows me

451
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,020
when you do clusters

452
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,420
then I'm going to show you a little bit what

453
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,880
I liked the most is that the Grail of

454
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,559
the time when I was doing networking and

455
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:14,400
I didn't have white hair

456
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,559
it had to be  velanoping i.e.

457
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,420
saying I'm in a Velaine and I

458
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:21,359
manage I do

459
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,819
spoofing to jump into another VLAN okay

460
00:53:23,819 --> 00:53:27,359
we say no but it's recent

461
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:30,920
it can it can't work

462
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,800
it would be  too serious to be able to say I

463
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,460
'm in VNI 10 okay

464
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:40,740
and I forge a plot and I find myself

465
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,780
in my wine Yvain it's

466
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:44,760
science fiction

467
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,339
it's not science fiction finally we're going to

468
00:53:47,339 --> 00:53:49,640
do a little magic

469
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,740
so there I built my frame I it's

470
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:54,540
forge as I showed you

471
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:57,240
with scapi or in fact what we are going

472
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:00,480
to do is that we are going to force a vehicle

473
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,859
a Velan network ID to 20 which corresponds

474
00:54:04,859 --> 00:54:09,079
to the other VNI and the logic would like

475
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:12,000
the switch to transport it to the other

476
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,240
members and then that's all that's all,

477
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:18,960
but we have a particular case where this

478
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,460
live frame because finding it on

479
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:22,200
the other side

480
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:25,040
I show you the  magic

481
00:54:25,319 --> 00:54:26,640
then magic it's not that magical it

482
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,520
's scapit which says what which

483
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,319
says what I told you orally that is

484
00:54:31,319 --> 00:54:33,059
to say that I will send to a

485
00:54:33,059 --> 00:54:35,760
destination of an IP address

486
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,380
in which  normally I don't have access

487
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:38,520
well it must be underley's IP addresses

488
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,640
but in the overlay if I have

489
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,020
an IP address of a sweetrupteur

490
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:44,460
available I'll send the packet there

491
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:47,640
by telling him well you're kidding I'll

492
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,619
send you  vxlan

493
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:52,500
or I'm in the overlay I'm not

494
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,559
in the right to do that okay you

495
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:57,720
'll laugh in the constructor that I

496
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,119
tested in fact it was not verified

497
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:02,640
and I followed the 800 the 800 pages of

498
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,260
documentation I promise you so

499
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,900
I took back my phone finally myself

500
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:08,640
Mr. CERTT I have a second thing

501
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,559
to explain to you there I manage to do that

502
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:13,880
they analyzed there there is a problem

503
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:17,359
so yes there is a  problem

504
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,800
well

505
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,380
there we can say to ourselves

506
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:25,559
it's good we are it is enough why there

507
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:27,000
was an IP address visible here

508
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,800
it was an error it is enough to filter

509
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,780
the IP address I was going to put an

510
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:32,540
access list we will filter all  the IPs

511
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:35,280
to prevent the port from being opened and

512
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,380
then it's over

513
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:38,520
but in fact there is something that is

514
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,740
great it does IPS, that is to say that everything

515
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:42,480
that works more in IPv4 you switch

516
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,059
to IPv6 and that  works okay

517
00:55:45,059 --> 00:55:46,500
it's extraordinary so we have

518
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,900
years ahead of us thanks to IPv6 and what

519
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:49,920
's great is that in this

520
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,859
documentation in this constructor but

521
00:55:52,859 --> 00:55:54,740
in fact it PVC it's activated by default

522
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:57,420
without you having it  configured by

523
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,579
addresses that are generated

524
00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:01,740
from macadres it's a standard

525
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:03,300
in IPv6 so it's easy we can

526
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,220
find them it's very good and why

527
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:06,660
because BGP needs that to

528
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:07,740
work because there is a  great

529
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:09,180
functionality in BGP to make

530
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:11,160
BJP a red number so it uses

531
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:14,160
pv6 in short what you must not forget

532
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,480
here is that

533
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,640
IPv6 was

534
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,520
already open by default without

535
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,099
configuring them and in fact there I  I had a

536
00:56:23,099 --> 00:56:25,440
problem validated x 3 which I won

537
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,380
three times I won on watching there

538
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:29,819
is a problem it makes 4 the manufacturer

539
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:31,319
told me oh yes there is a problem we will

540
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:34,079
correct that's good that we  hold the right

541
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:35,280
end to correct but look

542
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,660
now there is IPv6 and in addition

543
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,700
I have not activated ah thin second

544
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,859
problem and the third problem is

545
00:56:40,859 --> 00:56:43,880
that in fact by doing this

546
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:46,079
I do something which is funny who

547
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,920
knows  a little IPv6

548
00:56:50,599 --> 00:56:54,300
there is no Arpa 6 there are not there are

549
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:55,920
Discovery protocols but there is

550
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,420
no RP and here I am doing a nice thing

551
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:59,339
is that I am doing IP6 in which

552
00:56:59,339 --> 00:57:01,440
I  'encapsulates an IP4 frame that makes

553
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,420
RP and the developers of the

554
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,040
manufacturer what have they done

555
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,020
for them when there is RP is that

556
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:09,180
it's pv4 and so in fact I spit

557
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,440
a process so I confess I did

558
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,300
n't do it on purpose but I spit out a

559
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,859
process and you look at the docs and if it's

560
00:57:13,859 --> 00:57:14,819
a process that manages all the

561
00:57:14,819 --> 00:57:16,079
routing so

562
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:18,960
here I have a pretty man's body from the

563
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,480
process and there  he said x 3 there is there is

564
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,640
a problem

565
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,079
so the developers had not planned

566
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:26,579
this encapulation on the other hand what is

567
00:57:26,579 --> 00:57:28,380
annoying you as an offensive you

568
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:29,760
say yeah but it's stupid we are

569
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,099
blind what it is  is already the frame

570
00:57:32,099 --> 00:57:34,440
I manage to pass I have the frame which is

571
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:35,940
well regenerated on the other side ok everything

572
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:37,800
is fine but I am blind it

573
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,119
would be good to find the return of the

574
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:40,619
answer you who are in  the offensive

575
00:57:40,619 --> 00:57:42,240
you like that in general I'm

576
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,440
more of a victim myself that's why I

577
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,460
say excuse me so it's it's

578
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:49,859
blind but in fact no not quite

579
00:57:49,859 --> 00:57:52,079
it would be very good if  we could

580
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:53,640
recover the frames but in fact we

581
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,680
can, that is to say that what must

582
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,619
always be done with IPv6 what I'm going

583
00:57:58,619 --> 00:58:00,119
to do is that I'm going to change my

584
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:04,040
source my pv6 source

585
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:07,319
in fact let me explain  I told him that

586
00:58:07,319 --> 00:58:10,920
the Ethernet packet was sent by a

587
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,180
certain

588
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:14,400
IPv6 and in fact what will happen

589
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,079
is that like the router switches and

590
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:17,400
the vtechs who are nice and they

591
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,780
want to answer the machine who

592
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:19,980
answered him that  he asked the question there

593
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:23,640
and so if by chance I have in the Ender

594
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,440
ley the IP address that I used here

595
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,420
which exists and which is rooted on the Internet

596
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,859
there I am in the worst case of the

597
00:58:28,859 --> 00:58:30,420
bad configuration but  I will

598
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:33,119
be able to recover the trams ok so the

599
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:36,079
answers are

600
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,680
good so 15 days of vacation not wasted

601
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,319
because I had a good time

602
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:46,799
result of the gbgp doses ok we spit

603
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:47,720
everything

604
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,680
jumps vxlan

605
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,380
ipvcast because of a bad

606
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:54,599
landerley mapping of the IPv6s which are  activated without

607
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:56,960
the jam without configuration ok

608
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,480
spits the remote process

609
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:02,460
everything is being fixed so as soon as

610
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,319
it's published i will tell you all the

611
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,940
details you are missing in the

612
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:07,859
presentation including the name of the

613
00:59:07,859 --> 00:59:10,040
manufacturer but

614
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,000
when you see all the  strawberries who

615
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,339
had before everyone wins right now

616
00:59:14,339 --> 00:59:15,839
on vxlam what is so

617
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:17,099
new that in all manufacturers

618
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:18,960
there are everywhere so you can

619
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:19,940
go there is a lot

620
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:22,619
of work

621
00:59:22,619 --> 00:59:25,440
conclusion so beware of your

622
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:26,819
host but that  I think you

623
00:59:26,819 --> 00:59:29,420
already do it

624
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:33,660
so obviously the very big ones they

625
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:35,700
have no problem they have redeveloped the

626
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,920
majority of the protocols etc but if you

627
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,200
have for example an intermediary between

628
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:43,140
a very large host and the

629
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:44,520
applications that you host who said to himself

630
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,319
oh well I'm going to use vxline

631
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:48,180
or so I don't know I'm using vxline

632
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:49,680
but I just put it towards me and activate

633
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,140
the dynamic functionality Velaine in

634
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:53,760
fact it's Vicks down there or so

635
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,440
I just do cuernative and I  I

636
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,380
used the default config it's

637
00:59:58,380 --> 00:59:59,760
also vicksline

638
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,619
so everything that is bent I had in

639
01:00:01,619 --> 01:00:02,940
semi

640
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:05,900
the manufacturer docks 0

641
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,980
it's not specified everything I told you

642
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:10,079
with very little hardening on these

643
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:11,940
technologies there  so we need experts, we need

644
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:14,400
people who, on the bloutim side, will

645
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,440
look at all that, well, I didn't

646
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,119
talk to you about the c.e. when I did my tests,

647
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:20,940
there are some who have come back to BGP, well,

648
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:23,040
it's old programs that are

649
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,099
written  in old techno

650
01:00:25,099 --> 01:00:28,140
which was a process which is called frouting

651
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:29,400
which came from something

652
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,140
called zibra which is very old and

653
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:33,000
on which there are quite a few

654
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,339
memories that this kind of thing and

655
01:00:35,339 --> 01:00:36,780
now the  the goal is to look

656
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:38,040
for other builders and

657
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,420
go back down to the company to see what's

658
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:40,859
going on

659
01:00:40,859 --> 01:00:43,500
here, thank you

660
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,599
and I'll listen to you if you have any

661
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:47,720
questions

662
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:54,729
[Applause]

663
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:06,000
about this Lido sometimes it takes a little

664
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,760
time, but  if anyone in the room

665
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:12,680
wants to ask a question don't hesitate

666
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,740
well no in fact they stayed on a

667
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:27,440
sword because

668
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,400
because we didn't wait for the answer

669
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,619
because it goes faster and because

670
01:01:31,619 --> 01:01:33,900
in fact it was  honest and finally not

671
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,460
connected what is to say that we can

672
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:37,200
broadcast and we do not need an

673
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:40,079
answer so for me it would not be

674
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:42,799
part of the solutions

675
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:45,540
the only the only interest that I see there and

676
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:46,980
I have seen  RFC that they will have in this

677
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:50,160
sense is to say that VX Line

678
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,780
is a security hole on its own

679
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:54,240
but I do not blame it because when

680
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,640
you read the RFCs of vxline there is a

681
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,440
security chapter which  say

682
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,900
not a protocol that is secure in

683
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,940
essence you have to secure it like

684
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:04,859
any network protocol so they were

685
01:02:04,859 --> 01:02:07,079
very clear on that there are people

686
01:02:07,079 --> 01:02:08,760
who are saying that we

687
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,440
could encapsulate it in

688
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,000
protocols that manage  security and

689
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,640
therefore there we would fall back on TLS on IPC

690
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,920
and on this kind of thing on the other hand the

691
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:20,520
operators on this kind of infras he

692
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:23,460
seeks perf and therefore all that

693
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:25,319
is encryption is everything is deactivated

694
01:02:25,319 --> 01:02:27,839
to reach several gigabits

695
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:30,740
bandwidth what

696
01:02:32,579 --> 01:02:35,540
other questions

697
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:39,270
thank you very much thank you very much

698
01:02:39,270 --> 01:02:45,259


699
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:41,210


700
01:07:34,410 --> 01:07:37,489


701
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:01,250


702
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:21,290


703
01:18:14,510 --> 01:18:17,589


704
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:41,359


705
01:21:40,219 --> 01:21:42,659


706
01:21:42,659 --> 01:21:44,699


707
01:21:44,699 --> 01:21:46,679
'dress in English then I'm going to

708
01:21:46,679 --> 01:21:49,340
improvise with that

709
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:52,640
Charlie bombers

710
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:15,000
hi everyone so I'm going to do

711
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,219
this conference in French it's going to be

712
01:22:17,219 --> 01:22:18,960
25 minutes so it's going to be sport so I

713
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,179
'm going to start the conference without further delay

714
01:22:21,179 --> 01:22:22,620
the title of the conference

715
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:25,519
c  is pink

716
01:22:26,179 --> 01:22:28,080
and for those who know Active

717
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,340
Directory I think it

718
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:31,320
also gives you a show of hands that

719
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:32,820
connects directly who works with

720
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:34,380
almost every day yeah that's

721
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:36,480
a good part of the room so we're going to

722
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,040
talk about membership  we are going to talk about a concept that is a

723
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:39,120
little more advanced than what we are

724
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:40,739
used to doing and in particular

725
01:22:40,739 --> 01:22:42,000
some attacks that came out over

726
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,040
the years

727
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:45,900
2019-2021 and 2022

728
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:47,940
you have at the bottom right of the

729
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:49,620
next two slides and this one-  here is the link

730
01:22:49,620 --> 01:22:51,239
of the slides so don't hesitate to

731
01:22:51,239 --> 01:22:52,920
take them it will make your job easier

732
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:54,000
rather than taking pictures in

733
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,860
all directions especially since there are

734
01:22:55,860 --> 01:22:58,260
a lot of slides so the

735
01:22:58,260 --> 01:22:59,880
fountain table is the next one in a

736
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:01,080
first we will recall some

737
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:02,640
concepts of Directory assets and

738
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:04,500
Kerberos then we will talk about

739
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:06,300
Kerberos delegation the same took me away

740
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:07,920
who has already been able to deal with Kerberos delegation

741
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:09,659


742
01:23:09,659 --> 01:23:11,159
who is disgusted at having dealt with

743
01:23:11,159 --> 01:23:12,679
carbo delegation that did not understand anything

744
01:23:12,679 --> 01:23:15,179
welcome  at the club,

745
01:23:15,179 --> 01:23:16,679
the carburos delegations rely on

746
01:23:16,679 --> 01:23:17,640
some extensions and some

747
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:18,980
internal mechanisms called

748
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:21,659
essoriou service for user so we're going to

749
01:23:21,659 --> 01:23:23,280
talk about it and then we have another

750
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:24,840
mechanism which is a little less known

751
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:26,460
which is called yo to you un  little less

752
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:28,800
known and much less understood and therefore

753
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,659
behind we are going to assemble combine

754
01:23:30,659 --> 01:23:33,360
some of these mechanisms to

755
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:34,500
make some attacks so we are going to

756
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:37,380
talk about 5

757
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:39,480
Kerberos constrained delegation bypass attacks without

758
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:41,040
protocol transition yes it's a

759
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:43,800
long name you will thank Microsoft then

760
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:45,600
escalopes escalations escalations

761
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:46,860
I will arrive by privilege

762
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:49,980
with all self a pack of

763
01:23:49,980 --> 01:23:52,199
RBC 100 SPN ax for those who did

764
01:23:52,199 --> 01:23:54,060
not know it was possible and

765
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:55,679
sapphire ticket which is an evolution of the

766
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:58,340
Golden ticket

767
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:00,780
ok it left last  last slide

768
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:02,219
with the link to the slides so it's

769
01:24:02,219 --> 01:24:03,480
now or never to write it down in a

770
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:06,600
corner I've already introduced myself so I'm

771
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:07,739
not going to redo redo this task there

772
01:24:07,739 --> 01:24:09,540
overall I live in the south of

773
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:11,219
France so I'm a bit  sick

774
01:24:11,219 --> 01:24:14,040
because jet lag but otherwise don't hesitate I

775
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:15,719
'm no longer contagious don't hesitate to

776
01:24:15,719 --> 01:24:17,520
come and ask questions for those who

777
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:18,600
would like to join me on

778
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:19,560
social networks you have the different

779
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:22,159
links here

780
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:24,780
ok so first of all activate

781
01:24:24,780 --> 01:24:26,300
directly

782
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:28,320
Active  Directory is a set of

783
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:29,760
services so when we talk about

784
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:30,900
Directory assets in general we are misusing

785
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:32,640
language we are generally talking about DDS

786
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,580
so Active Directory domain services

787
01:24:34,580 --> 01:24:37,380
adds is also a set of

788
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:39,239
domain services in which  we are going to

789
01:24:39,239 --> 01:24:40,679
find a lot of protocols, a whole

790
01:24:40,679 --> 01:24:42,060
lot of services and which will allow

791
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:43,560
users of groups of

792
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:45,900
Workstations to work together with

793
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:48,199
the GPO of the rights of the fine permissions

794
01:24:48,199 --> 01:24:51,719
of the device configuration etc etc and

795
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:53,640
therefore it is a set of services that  'we are

796
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:56,280
going to find a very very present way

797
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:58,500
in all the companies of the world or

798
01:24:58,500 --> 01:24:59,940
almost and those which do not use it

799
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:01,080
in general are companies which are

800
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:02,280
so small that they do not

801
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:03,840
need or other companies which  have made

802
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:05,400
the choice to turn to free and

803
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:07,140
who bitterly regret this choice

804
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:08,820
today

805
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:09,960
we will then find other

806
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:11,520
services which print rather well

807
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:14,520
with adds in particular to CS for

808
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,020
service certificates which is

809
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:18,780
the implementation of  Beijing Microsoft the

810
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:23,280
facts services of thieves azur ad etc

811
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:25,320
so globally active directly as a

812
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:28,080
whole it's a whole of service

813
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,159
which is

814
01:25:29,159 --> 01:25:31,980
ultra present and really lastly it's the

815
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:34,679
leader in terms of enterprise network management

816
01:25:34,679 --> 01:25:36,540


817
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:38,100
at the level of the  authentication within

818
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:39,780
a DDS we will find two

819
01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:42,260
major protocols namely NTM and caberos

820
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:44,040
overall what should be remembered is

821
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:45,840
that NTM is [ __ ] it's

822
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,659
direct garbage Kerberos it's better

823
01:25:48,659 --> 01:25:51,060
but out of the  box it's not perfect

824
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:52,199
so we have to be careful

825
01:25:52,199 --> 01:25:53,520
about that

826
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,020
then there are lots of people who think

827
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:57,060
that Kerberos is better out of the box

828
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:59,580
it's perfect it's not there are lots

829
01:25:59,580 --> 01:26:01,440
of attacks on  caberos also much

830
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:03,420
more than on a theme in this case in

831
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:05,400
quantitative terms so it is not

832
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:07,020
necessarily more dangerous but it is

833
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:08,400
so much less understood than a TLM than

834
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,080
caberos and it too is a

835
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,699
dangerous protocol like any

836
01:26:11,699 --> 01:26:14,000
authentication protocol that  manages

837
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,139
a major pillar in fact within its

838
01:26:16,139 --> 01:26:18,120
active Directory

839
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:19,620
globally the major differences

840
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:21,659
between NTM and Kerberos is that NTM

841
01:26:21,659 --> 01:26:23,460
works with challenge respons

842
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:25,739
with keys with password hashes

843
01:26:25,739 --> 01:26:27,480
and carberos works with

844
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:29,040
tickets so for those who  know

845
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:30,060
carburos a little more in

846
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:32,280
this case the very beginning of carburos

847
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:33,480
and a step called

848
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:34,980
pre-authentication well it is

849
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:37,199
also based on H2 password here I

850
01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:39,620
say that I say nothing

851
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:41,219
when I was talking about attacks

852
01:26:41,219 --> 01:26:43,080
quantitatively more important on

853
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:45,260
caberoscane on NTM here is a

854
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:48,719
rather exhaustive list I think on NTM we will

855
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:51,780
see attacks of capture of hntm if

856
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:52,800
we can say if we can say that like that

857
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:55,920
of relay NTM and pass of h and on

858
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:58,920
carbueros we go into  have a

859
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:01,920
team here and therefore these attacks there I

860
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,179
made a small diagram on the right that

861
01:27:03,179 --> 01:27:05,040
you will probably not be able to read

862
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:06,540
if I myself cannot read it

863
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:07,679
it means that you will not be able to do it

864
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:08,659


865
01:27:08,659 --> 01:27:11,400
however, it's available on the Peas so do

866
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:12,719
n't hesitate, it's a little my map

867
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:15,540
that will allow you to understand where

868
01:27:15,540 --> 01:27:17,219
these different NTM and Carbos attacks are located

869
01:27:17,219 --> 01:27:19,380


870
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:20,340
and so we're going to talk about

871
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:22,699
some of these attacks in particular

872
01:27:22,699 --> 01:27:25,139
delegation is on nozzle which is on the

873
01:27:25,139 --> 01:27:27,960
end of caberos an ax pack which is

874
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:29,639
a bit which is third from the

875
01:27:29,639 --> 01:27:32,460
top of carburos and others

876
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:34,320
now let's talk about delegation of

877
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:36,659
carburos so delegation of carberos the

878
01:27:36,659 --> 01:27:37,860
day i wanted to me  diving into that

879
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:40,199
I bitterly regretted because it's

880
01:27:40,199 --> 01:27:42,420
a bit complicated very honestly there are

881
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:44,400
things that come out of the

882
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:46,199
basic Amity carbueros and things that

883
01:27:46,199 --> 01:27:48,080
Microsoft has added

884
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:50,280
to make it even more

885
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:53,219
interesting and exciting so I'm going to tell

886
01:27:53,219 --> 01:27:54,659
you  talking about it today not that

887
01:27:54,659 --> 01:27:56,040
I particularly like

888
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:58,679
cabero delegations it is above all that I have done a lot

889
01:27:58,679 --> 01:28:00,719
on them so I think I know a

890
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:02,460
little bit nevertheless I think it is

891
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:04,080
important that you can save

892
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:05,340
the tens or twenty of  hours that

893
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:06,719
I spent reading blocks that I

894
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:08,820
never understood and remembering some

895
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:10,139
major information from

896
01:28:10,139 --> 01:28:12,600
fuel delegations delegation there are

897
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:14,100
several there are several tastes

898
01:28:14,100 --> 01:28:15,600
there are all the drops all the

899
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:18,480
colors three main  type an account

900
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:21,360
strude countryd and resource base then

901
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:22,800
we could translate that in French into

902
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,380
without constraint constraint and constraint

903
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:27,300
based on the resource and in the

904
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:29,400
constraint there are two types

905
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:32,219
because 3 was not enough there is

906
01:28:32,219 --> 01:28:34,020
one c  'is with protocol transition and

907
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:35,880
in the tools and activate Directory

908
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:39,000
it's called use Andy gagation and the

909
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,699
second is without so it's in

910
01:28:41,699 --> 01:28:43,320
protocol transition which in the

911
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:45,060
active Directory tools is called curbirous

912
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:48,000
only so globally we have to  about 5

913
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,040
types of delegation 5 delegations that

914
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:51,120
work in different ways that

915
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:52,739
have different prerequisites and that

916
01:28:52,739 --> 01:28:53,760
have different behaviors so

917
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,560
our interest is to

918
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:57,420
understand them to be able to

919
01:28:57,420 --> 01:28:59,760
attack them and in fact abuse their

920
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,199
property  when we're going to go do some

921
01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:03,719
Active Directory slopes so tomorrow if we

922
01:29:03,719 --> 01:29:05,280
have a little Active Directory test and

923
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:08,100
we face unconstrained delegation

924
01:29:08,100 --> 01:29:10,139
so you see it's the

925
01:29:10,139 --> 01:29:11,880
first third do you see my

926
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:14,820
mouse my other half  the unconstrained it

927
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:16,800
allows a service that is configured

928
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:19,440
for Kud of the curber's friend

929
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,000
delegation to impersonate

930
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,739
any account or almost on

931
01:29:22,739 --> 01:29:24,659
any machine

932
01:29:24,659 --> 01:29:26,780
globally it's

933
01:29:26,780 --> 01:29:30,300
basic it's a figure

934
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:32,639
then we have  the constraint therefore

935
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:34,860
constrained delegation which here is its

936
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:36,000
constrained delegation it is about

937
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,739
the same thing a service configured for

938
01:29:37,739 --> 01:29:39,300
this type of delegation can

939
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:40,980
impersonate whoever wants or almost on a

940
01:29:40,980 --> 01:29:42,540
set of services but not all the

941
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:44,460
services therefore for example  if tomorrow we

942
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:45,900
do an Active Directory test that we

943
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:48,000
compromise a service called app01

944
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,739
and which can do delegation without

945
01:29:49,739 --> 01:29:51,239
constraint we will be able for example to

946
01:29:51,239 --> 01:29:52,380
pretend to be a

947
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:54,360
domain administrator on a domain controller and

948
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:56,639
there we have  won if it's

949
01:29:56,639 --> 01:29:57,840
constrained delegation well we will be able to

950
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:00,120
pretend to be an admin of the domain on

951
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:01,260
any machine which is in the

952
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:03,719
list of machines for which the

953
01:30:03,719 --> 01:30:05,760
service is a little delegated and then we have

954
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:07,800
the 8 base sauce the rbcd  which

955
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:09,239
works in the other direction which is

956
01:30:09,239 --> 01:30:11,820
also constrained but this time we do

957
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:13,080
not configure the delegation on the

958
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:15,300
source machine of the delegation but on

959
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:16,739
the target machine so you see

960
01:30:16,739 --> 01:30:18,960
slightly on the right finally I imagine

961
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:21,300
that you  see basically we have a

962
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:23,280
set of services there web SQL where I do

963
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:24,780
n't know which will be able or not to

964
01:30:24,780 --> 01:30:27,060
delegate to a target service which

965
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:28,139
is configured to it

966
01:30:28,139 --> 01:30:29,580
what to remember is that

967
01:30:29,580 --> 01:30:30,780
unconstrained delegation and

968
01:30:30,780 --> 01:30:32,100
constrained delegation  who has had KCDs

969
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:33,480
you need overall

970
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:34,800
domain administrator rights to

971
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:36,239
configure them it's not quite that but

972
01:30:36,239 --> 01:30:38,699
almost and then for the rbcd you

973
01:30:38,699 --> 01:30:40,320
just need rights on the target machine

974
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:42,659
of the delegation here are the

975
01:30:42,659 --> 01:30:44,639
three types overall  carburos delegation majors

976
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:47,719
that we will be able to find

977
01:30:48,659 --> 01:30:50,760
with regard to delegation without

978
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:52,320
constraint globally it works

979
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:53,400
more or less like that I will not

980
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:54,780
go into too much detail if you have

981
01:30:54,780 --> 01:30:55,679
questions later we can come back

982
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:57,300
to it but overall I have you  made

983
01:30:57,300 --> 01:30:58,380
a small diagram of the families which

984
01:30:58,380 --> 01:31:01,380
explains how it works overall what you

985
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:02,940
have to remember is that you

986
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:04,020
can pretend to be anyone

987
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:06,600
or almost on any service

988
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:08,219
so when I say or almost it  is

989
01:31:08,219 --> 01:31:09,239
because there is basically a protection

990
01:31:09,239 --> 01:31:10,739
which is called protective user which is

991
01:31:10,739 --> 01:31:12,540
a group or an attribute which

992
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:14,460
is called sensitive Ford delegation if

993
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:16,320
you put this stuff there the user

994
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:17,400
who is placed in this group or who

995
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:18,719
has this flag cannot be

996
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:20,040
delegated here it is a small

997
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:20,960
protection

998
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:23,880
and if you put administrator you

999
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:26,460
know the native biltin domain admin account

1000
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:28,860
in protein users it can

1001
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:31,460
still be delegated

1002
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,120
for constrained delegation

1003
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:34,739
globally it works like that I  I

1004
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:36,360
have made two slides for you, a slide with

1005
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:38,040
the protocol transition and a slide

1006
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,719
without the protocol transition. You have to

1007
01:31:39,719 --> 01:31:41,219
understand this difference well because we

1008
01:31:41,219 --> 01:31:42,540
are going to abuse the

1009
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:45,719
properties of one and the other

1010
01:31:45,719 --> 01:31:47,520
in order for the delegation to be constrained

1011
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:48,600
works it relies on two

1012
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:51,000
mechanisms S4

1013
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,100
user there is one it's silky all self

1014
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:55,679
and the other is for you to proxy soyou

1015
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:57,480
to self overall it allows you to get

1016
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:59,699
a service ticket from

1017
01:31:59,699 --> 01:32:00,900
someone  another from any

1018
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:03,540
user to self so for

1019
01:32:03,540 --> 01:32:06,480
example I am service app01 I can

1020
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:09,840
make a surf request to KCD at KDC which

1021
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:12,060
distribution center and I will get

1022
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:14,460
a service ticket from I  do

1023
01:32:14,460 --> 01:32:16,620
n't know anything about Malamine towards myself so

1024
01:32:16,620 --> 01:32:18,719
there like that it's not much use

1025
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:20,639
but in fact this ticket it serves as

1026
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:22,560
proof to make s for you

1027
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:25,139
to proxy work and soyou any proxy it's

1028
01:32:25,139 --> 01:32:26,880
globally the same thing we take this

1029
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:29,040
ticket obtained by hoping for any self

1030
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:30,420
to us as a man

1031
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:32,219
at damine we use it as proof

1032
01:32:32,219 --> 01:32:34,080
and we will ask them for a

1033
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:35,460
somewhat similar ticket but this time

1034
01:32:35,460 --> 01:32:37,199
instead of drawing it to us we  will

1035
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:38,820
assign it to another service a service

1036
01:32:38,820 --> 01:32:40,320
to which we can delegate

1037
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:41,280
and that's how we do the

1038
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,199
delegation we get a

1039
01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:45,120
carberos ticket as another

1040
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:47,340
typical user from Man admin to another service

1041
01:32:47,340 --> 01:32:50,340
and that's  is a feature

1042
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:52,520
so with protocol transition

1043
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:54,420
overall what you should remember the

1044
01:32:54,420 --> 01:32:56,219
major property of with

1045
01:32:56,219 --> 01:32:58,380
protocol transition is that the S for you to self

1046
01:32:58,380 --> 01:32:59,880
here allows you to impersonate a

1047
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:03,060
given user without anything there is no

1048
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:05,400
need  to know his password his password

1049
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:08,100
age nothing at all it is

1050
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:10,320
simply necessary that the app01 service be

1051
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,540
configured for

1052
01:33:12,540 --> 01:33:14,520
constrained delegation with protocol transition and

1053
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:16,139
that there is only one admin domain or almost

1054
01:33:16,139 --> 01:33:19,260
who can configure this property

1055
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:20,880
without transition from  protocol overall

1056
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:22,500
it's the same thing simply we ca

1057
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:24,420
n't make s on Youtube self so we

1058
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:26,159
can but it will give a ticket which is

1059
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:28,860
not very lucky and without this Ford

1060
01:33:28,860 --> 01:33:31,080
ball flag the S8 proxy will not work and therefore to

1061
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:32,820
do  constrained delegation

1062
01:33:32,820 --> 01:33:34,380
without protocol transition you must

1063
01:33:34,380 --> 01:33:36,600
first receive a ticket from

1064
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:38,060
the user you want impulsnight

1065
01:33:38,060 --> 01:33:40,860
globally it works like this

1066
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:42,620
and the space stream

1067
01:33:42,620 --> 01:33:44,639
globally the mechanisms are about

1068
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:45,540
the same as

1069
01:33:45,540 --> 01:33:47,940
constrained delegation  there is S8 there is S8

1070
01:33:47,940 --> 01:33:49,860
proxy simply it is the

1071
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:52,139
destination service which will in fact receive

1072
01:33:52,139 --> 01:33:54,600
the delegation in fact so it is not

1073
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:56,400
app01 that we will configure them for

1074
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:58,739
delegation this time it is  app02 which

1075
01:33:58,739 --> 01:34:01,879
is the target of the delegation

1076
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:03,840
so I'm going to speed it up because I

1077
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,400
'm a little silly basically the

1078
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:10,080
S4 extensions S4 proxy works in the

1079
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:12,060
following way I'll let you

1080
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:13,920
look at the slide in more detail

1081
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:15,600
later but overall I remember

1082
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,460
what  you have to remember is that S8 or self

1083
01:34:17,460 --> 01:34:19,440
we get a service ticket from

1084
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:20,580
another user to

1085
01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:24,239
ourselves S8 or proxy we present this

1086
01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:26,460
ticket we got which is for world

1087
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:28,380
for it to work and we  obtains a

1088
01:34:28,380 --> 01:34:29,580
service ticket always from

1089
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:30,780
someone else but this time

1090
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:32,100
towards the service to which one can

1091
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:34,020
delegate

1092
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:36,179
a little aside the delegation without

1093
01:34:36,179 --> 01:34:37,260
constraint does not work like that at all

1094
01:34:37,260 --> 01:34:38,639
so for those who will be in the process of

1095
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:39,600
say to yourself ah but there may be something

1096
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:41,760
to do I'll cut you off it's not S8

1097
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:44,280
it's not S8 proxy that's

1098
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:45,420
extensions that are specific to

1099
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:48,540
constrained delegations and ABCD if you

1100
01:34:48,540 --> 01:34:50,040
want to know more  that this slide of

1101
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:52,139
the weapon you have 6 but if you

1102
01:34:52,139 --> 01:34:53,760
really want to torture yourself you have

1103
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:55,739
the Waring dog article of the hinge which

1104
01:34:55,739 --> 01:34:57,420
is really great which is very long which

1105
01:34:57,420 --> 01:34:59,159
explains a lot a lot of things on

1106
01:34:59,159 --> 01:35:01,380
the carburos delegations so I

1107
01:35:01,380 --> 01:35:02,699
invite you very  strongly to read for those

1108
01:35:02,699 --> 01:35:05,120
who are interested

1109
01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:07,199
then

1110
01:35:07,199 --> 01:35:10,020
uto authentication so here we are going to do an exercise the

1111
01:35:10,020 --> 01:35:13,040
garment that knows YouTube

1112
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:16,260
it's normal it's something that is very

1113
01:35:16,260 --> 01:35:18,179
little documented which is little used I

1114
01:35:18,179 --> 01:35:19,980
think but we are going there  'use to death

1115
01:35:19,980 --> 01:35:22,020
because YouTube is behind a

1116
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:23,219
few attacks anyway

1117
01:35:23,219 --> 01:35:24,000
sometimes in combination with other

1118
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,739
mechanisms and so you have to first

1119
01:35:25,739 --> 01:35:28,080
understand it to be able to exploit it

1120
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:29,460
so understanding this stuff it

1121
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:31,280
's not very  complicated in itself

1122
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:33,300
we all agree that to

1123
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:35,460
obtain a fuel ticket,

1124
01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:37,320
the target service of our ticket must

1125
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:40,920
have respect we agree no we do

1126
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:42,840
n't agree there is no need  we

1127
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:44,699
can obtain a service ticket for

1128
01:35:44,699 --> 01:35:47,340
a yippee in for example a user

1129
01:35:47,340 --> 01:35:48,960
principal name rather than a more

1130
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,520
shoulder service name globally that means

1131
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:51,600
that we can obtain a service ticket

1132
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:53,880
for a user and not for a

1133
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:55,940
service

1134
01:35:56,580 --> 01:35:58,739
yes it is  possible then it requires

1135
01:35:58,739 --> 01:36:00,780
some basic recoerman it requires

1136
01:36:00,780 --> 01:36:02,400
for example to include the user's TGT

1137
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:04,020
in the request it

1138
01:36:04,020 --> 01:36:05,820
still proves my knowledge in fact of

1139
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:07,320
these peaks

1140
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:08,880
it also requires in the S name of the

1141
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:10,800
request to put the

1142
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:12,960
UPN of the  target user

1143
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:14,639
and then infinity what do we receive we

1144
01:36:14,639 --> 01:36:15,900
receive a slightly special ticket

1145
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:18,840
since this ticket indicated carbueros you

1146
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:19,920
know contains information which is

1147
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:21,239
encrypted is protected by a key

1148
01:36:21,239 --> 01:36:24,060
usually this key is the H  of the

1149
01:36:24,060 --> 01:36:25,739
password or the long term which as we

1150
01:36:25,739 --> 01:36:27,360
call in fuel of the

1151
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:30,000
given user no sorry not on a TGT it is the

1152
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,500
length kiki of the KBT something that

1153
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:32,639
normally the standard Setter does not

1154
01:36:32,639 --> 01:36:35,100
know not on Youtube returns a

1155
01:36:35,100 --> 01:36:36,960
ticket which him  is protected by the

1156
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:39,060
session which from the TGT obtained for the

1157
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:42,060
user TGT which was provided in

1158
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:43,860
the in the racket this is

1159
01:36:43,860 --> 01:36:45,540
how YouTube works globally if there are

1160
01:36:45,540 --> 01:36:46,620
things that you miss don't worry

1161
01:36:46,620 --> 01:36:49,260
we'll come back to it after

1162
01:36:49,260 --> 01:36:51,420
now we'll combine the  stuff

1163
01:36:51,420 --> 01:36:53,340
it's scary hang on it's going to be fine let's

1164
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:56,520
breathe here we go and on

1165
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:58,320
Youtube self and you to you so there we're going to

1166
01:36:58,320 --> 01:36:59,580
mix the properties of these things

1167
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:01,800
it's combinatorial it's compatible we

1168
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:03,480
can mix the two so I  reminds

1169
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:06,659
S4 we get a ticket from

1170
01:37:06,659 --> 01:37:09,239
someone else to ourselves but what

1171
01:37:09,239 --> 01:37:11,280
happens if we ourselves don't have

1172
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:13,139
an SPN and we ourselves are in

1173
01:37:13,139 --> 01:37:15,480
user and well  we use YouTube and we

1174
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:17,159
communicate the two and we get a

1175
01:37:17,159 --> 01:37:18,480
service ticket from another

1176
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:20,639
user to ourselves ourselves

1177
01:37:20,639 --> 01:37:22,980
being a user that's how it works

1178
01:37:22,980 --> 01:37:26,400
and it allows a whole series

1179
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:28,679
of very interesting attacks some

1180
01:37:28,679 --> 01:37:29,940
that you have been able to see on Twitter

1181
01:37:29,940 --> 01:37:30,960
in the last few years that you have

1182
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:32,340
not been able to understand and so we will go and

1183
01:37:32,340 --> 01:37:33,600
see now

1184
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:35,520
and if you have understood I congratulate you me

1185
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:37,920
it took me a while

1186
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:38,940
so overall I put you a

1187
01:37:38,940 --> 01:37:40,560
diagram on  the right which explains

1188
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:42,239
roughly how it works one we take

1189
01:37:42,239 --> 01:37:44,460
the TGT from ourselves since we make an

1190
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:46,380
SOS on our own so to ourselves we

1191
01:37:46,380 --> 01:37:47,580
take our CGT we include it in the

1192
01:37:47,580 --> 01:37:50,340
SEO request plus YouTube and we get back

1193
01:37:50,340 --> 01:37:52,080
infinity  a service ticket which is

1194
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:55,860
encrypted with the session which of the TGT which

1195
01:37:55,860 --> 01:37:57,900
is in yellow

1196
01:37:57,900 --> 01:38:00,719
this is how it works overall

1197
01:38:00,719 --> 01:38:01,800
and now we are going to talk about the

1198
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:03,480
different attacks which abuse the

1199
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:04,620
different mechanisms we have just

1200
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:07,020
talked about and on everything alone YouTube proxy SEO

1201
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:08,820


1202
01:38:08,820 --> 01:38:11,460
so we are going  see 5 of the bypass of

1203
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:13,560
constrained delegation without transition 2

1204
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:15,239
protocol

1205
01:38:15,239 --> 01:38:18,139
of the S8 to self escalation privilege

1206
01:38:18,139 --> 01:38:22,560
of the rbcd 100 SPN and its pride

1207
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:24,120
is that in these 5 attacks there are some

1208
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:26,880
who have already seen at least one or two of them

1209
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:28,620
?  a lot and well I hope

1210
01:38:28,620 --> 01:38:30,480
you will leave less stupid it's not an

1211
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:32,639
insult

1212
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:34,139
always a little late so I'm going to

1213
01:38:34,139 --> 01:38:35,280
speed up the pace at the same time it's

1214
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:37,219
25 minutes 30 it's hot

1215
01:38:37,219 --> 01:38:39,300
otherwise I'll be available afterwards for

1216
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:41,760
questions if  there is one first attack

1217
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:43,679
out of 5 constrained delegation bypass

1218
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:45,659
without protocol transition so I

1219
01:38:45,659 --> 01:38:47,340
recall without protocol transition the

1220
01:38:47,340 --> 01:38:49,320
first s on Youtube which allows us to

1221
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:51,739
pass ourselves off as a user

1222
01:38:51,739 --> 01:38:54,179
will not work we are obliged to

1223
01:38:54,179 --> 01:38:55,260
receive a ticket from the  part of another

1224
01:38:55,260 --> 01:38:59,040
user states sorry or not

1225
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:01,800
here to bypass this

1226
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:03,960
restriction we thank and Chamia

1227
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:06,600
in his 2019 dog article which

1228
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:08,340
explains a technique that allows to

1229
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:10,920
bypass this limitation the technique

1230
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:14,219
is based on the fact that S4  proxy so

1231
01:39:14,219 --> 01:39:15,600
you know the second the second

1232
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:16,739
extension that is used in the

1233
01:39:16,739 --> 01:39:19,020
cabero delegations produces a ticket

1234
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:21,300
that is always very lucky all

1235
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:23,880
the time and Ford is the requirement

1236
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:25,679
to restore any proxy so

1237
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:27,420
overall what we do is  is that if

1238
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:29,639
we manage to make an S4 proxy that

1239
01:39:29,639 --> 01:39:31,139
produces a ticket that looks like a

1240
01:39:31,139 --> 01:39:32,760
sorry on its own

1241
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:35,460
we can make the SEO proxy work

1242
01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:36,900
so it may seem a bit weird

1243
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:38,580
like that but we'll move on it doesn't

1244
01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:39,420
matter you'll see that  going to be fine

1245
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:41,159
what he calls technical

1246
01:39:41,159 --> 01:39:42,900
it's the rbcd trick so I don't know

1247
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:43,920
if he calls it that or if it's me

1248
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:45,239
who calls it that but overall

1249
01:39:45,239 --> 01:39:46,679
you can come back like that ah bah

1250
01:39:46,679 --> 01:39:48,320
it  are tricks basically

1251
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:50,639
app02 is configured for

1252
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:53,100
constrained delegation without protocol transition we

1253
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:56,760
have compromised app02 and app02 with the

1254
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:59,219
possibility of delegating to app03 we

1255
01:39:59,219 --> 01:40:02,040
therefore want to compromise to pp03 nevertheless

1256
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:03,360
we cannot pretend to give

1257
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:04,820
admin without receiving a ticket from his  share

1258
01:40:04,820 --> 01:40:07,139
because that's how

1259
01:40:07,139 --> 01:40:08,219
fuel delegation without

1260
01:40:08,219 --> 01:40:09,360
protocol transition is done like that so what

1261
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:12,000
can we do we can create

1262
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,340
or fart another service which is called

1263
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:16,260
app 01

1264
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:18,420
make app02  be configured

1265
01:40:18,420 --> 01:40:20,400
for the rbcd

1266
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:22,440
for app 01 that is to say that app01 can

1267
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:24,960
delegate to app02 app02 can delegate

1268
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:28,199
to app03 and we compromise 01 app02

1269
01:40:28,199 --> 01:40:31,020
we want to be able to set to 0.3 and well

1270
01:40:31,020 --> 01:40:34,020
in fact the rbcd globally will end  by

1271
01:40:34,020 --> 01:40:38,040
a proxy which will give a ticket

1272
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:40,920
as an admin domain to ab02 this ticket

1273
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:42,960
will be very lucky and in fact it is

1274
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:44,639
exactly the same as what is

1275
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:47,040
produced in a sorry all alone from

1276
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:49,500
pp02 a ticket from

1277
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:51,120
someone else's share towards himself towards

1278
01:40:51,120 --> 01:40:53,880
ab02 and therefore by doing an rbcd before

1279
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:56,100
which produces a ticket almost

1280
01:40:56,100 --> 01:40:57,659
identical to what brake is on him

1281
01:40:57,659 --> 01:40:58,440
alone but which is not possible

1282
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:00,420
in this case there and well  in fact we validate

1283
01:41:00,420 --> 01:41:02,040
the resort note of s must be a proxy

1284
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:04,080
from A02

1285
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:05,219
there are many things but

1286
01:41:05,219 --> 01:41:06,360
overall I invite you to go

1287
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:07,980
over it later normally you

1288
01:41:07,980 --> 01:41:09,120
have all the information in these

1289
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:10,920
slides from there we can put in

1290
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:12,360
place  an rbcd and we have the rights to

1291
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:15,600
do it upstream we do the rbcd and this

1292
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:16,920
rbcd allows us to unlock the

1293
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:18,120
requirement which is generally limited

1294
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:21,120
by the KCD without protocol transition and

1295
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:22,139
therefore it allows us to

1296
01:41:22,139 --> 01:41:24,360
delegate and infine foreman to

1297
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:25,739
03

1298
01:41:25,739 --> 01:41:26,699
I put you some

1299
01:41:26,699 --> 01:41:27,900
operating slides for those who will be

1300
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:29,820
curious to do it nevertheless for me

1301
01:41:29,820 --> 01:41:31,620
Windows it is not used it breaks

1302
01:41:31,620 --> 01:41:33,179
so all that you see here is

1303
01:41:33,179 --> 01:41:34,679
Linux if you want to know how to do it in

1304
01:41:34,679 --> 01:41:35,840
windows

1305
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:40,340
I'm leaving on Sunday don't talk to me

1306
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:42,179
you have all the information here I

1307
01:41:42,179 --> 01:41:43,440
'm sure you'll see in

1308
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:44,639
detail everything written from

1309
01:41:44,639 --> 01:41:46,980
your place in the audience I

1310
01:41:46,980 --> 01:41:48,780
invite you to watch more

1311
01:41:48,780 --> 01:41:50,100
information from the link  that I

1312
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:51,719
gave you

1313
01:41:51,719 --> 01:41:53,940
attack number 2 earlier

1314
01:41:53,940 --> 01:41:55,500
I'm clearly not in timing and

1315
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:57,360
on Youtube self LPE so we're going to do

1316
01:41:57,360 --> 01:41:59,820
privilege escalation with all alone well

1317
01:41:59,820 --> 01:42:00,900
in fact do you all alone

1318
01:42:00,900 --> 01:42:02,520
imagine you have compromised a  service

1319
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:04,020
called ab03 but you didn't

1320
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:05,699
understand it as an NT Authority

1321
01:42:05,699 --> 01:42:07,880
System you compromised it as a

1322
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:10,020
Microsoft virtualcard so for example

1323
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:13,199
it could be the apppull of s MSSQL

1324
01:42:13,199 --> 01:42:14,760
service it's services that are a

1325
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:16,920
bit  apart or else NT authority

1326
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:19,380
networks it's against there can and I wo

1327
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:20,460
n't go into detail do what is

1328
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:22,020
called the TGT delegation switch

1329
01:42:22,020 --> 01:42:24,900
we can get a TGT from finally

1330
01:42:24,900 --> 01:42:26,100
how to say by in fact abusing the

1331
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:28,260
rights of these accounts there  we still

1332
01:42:28,260 --> 01:42:30,360
don't have the complete compromise of

1333
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:31,860
the machine, however, we can use this

1334
01:42:31,860 --> 01:42:35,300
TGT to make an S8 on our own, which

1335
01:42:35,300 --> 01:42:37,139
will actually allow us to

1336
01:42:37,139 --> 01:42:39,540
pretend to be whoever we want with ab03

1337
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:40,920
from there you have compromised at 0,  3

1338
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:42,600
nevertheless you are going to say well yes but

1339
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:44,460
no because if we put an admin domain

1340
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:46,679
in protective users this account

1341
01:42:46,679 --> 01:42:48,239
cannot be delegated

1342
01:42:48,239 --> 01:42:50,880
because any self in fact is not

1343
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:53,040
limited by this kind of thing so even if

1344
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:55,139
tomorrow admin is in  proximity users or

1345
01:42:55,139 --> 01:42:57,060
sensitive Ford delegation it would be

1346
01:42:57,060 --> 01:42:58,920
done alone he doesn't care the ticket

1347
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:00,119
will not be very lucky but it will

1348
01:43:00,119 --> 01:43:01,260
still be valid so you can

1349
01:43:01,260 --> 01:43:02,820
authenticate yourself as this

1350
01:43:02,820 --> 01:43:05,460
normally protected user on abs03 and you

1351
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:06,480
have an escalation there  of

1352
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:08,159
systematic privilege not deble since it is

1353
01:43:08,159 --> 01:43:11,400
a feature on services of which you

1354
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:12,900
have compromised a Microsoft Virtual

1355
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:15,600
account or network service

1356
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:17,880
like this I have put slides here for you from the

1357
01:43:17,880 --> 01:43:19,520
past so if you want to test

1358
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:21,239
you are free to do so

1359
01:43:21,239 --> 01:43:23,659
especially with impacted scripts

1360
01:43:23,659 --> 01:43:27,980
here don't hesitate

1361
01:43:29,340 --> 01:43:32,219
third attack an ax pack which

1362
01:43:32,219 --> 01:43:35,280
saw an ax pack pass in 2020 and one

1363
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:37,739
I believe on social networks ok

1364
01:43:37,739 --> 01:43:39,780
keep your hands up for those who have

1365
01:43:39,780 --> 01:43:41,639
seen this technique there and who don't  didn't

1366
01:43:41,639 --> 01:43:42,900
understand I wanted I invite you to

1367
01:43:42,900 --> 01:43:44,540
lower your hand

1368
01:43:44,540 --> 01:43:47,460
so in the end it's little and it's normal

1369
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:49,139
because this technique well in fact

1370
01:43:49,139 --> 01:43:50,880
it is based on a lot of mechanisms and

1371
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:52,619
therefore I invite you to review it together

1372
01:43:52,619 --> 01:43:53,900
now

1373
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:56,100
in a  atmosphere without stress without

1374
01:43:56,100 --> 01:43:58,739
pressure and we will understand an

1375
01:43:58,739 --> 01:44:00,540
ax pack globally it allows to recover

1376
01:44:00,540 --> 01:44:04,440
an HNT or LM for a given user from

1377
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:06,179
authentication of fuel mechanisms

1378
01:44:06,179 --> 01:44:07,920


1379
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:09,840
it is a feature

1380
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:12,239
so globally for it to work you

1381
01:44:12,239 --> 01:44:14,639
must first  do pekinite pekinite

1382
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:16,260
it's carburos

1383
01:44:16,260 --> 01:44:17,760
asymmetric pre-authentication mechanism

1384
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:19,560
which actually allows you to

1385
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:21,179
validate pri authentication not

1386
01:44:21,179 --> 01:44:23,159
with long turkey so

1387
01:44:23,159 --> 01:44:25,139
password age but with user certificate

1388
01:44:25,139 --> 01:44:26,699


1389
01:44:26,699 --> 01:44:27,780
once  you validated this

1390
01:44:27,780 --> 01:44:29,820
retentification with difficulty it in fact the

1391
01:44:29,820 --> 01:44:31,679
domain controller behind it will

1392
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:33,020
generally include a blog called

1393
01:44:33,020 --> 01:44:35,940
packudenshow in faux in the pack and

1394
01:44:35,940 --> 01:44:38,340
in this package you will find the

1395
01:44:38,340 --> 01:44:41,159
NT and LM keys the Intel keys the mission

1396
01:44:41,159 --> 01:44:43,440
if  we can call it that however

1397
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:44,699
when you will receive this in your

1398
01:44:44,699 --> 01:44:46,440
TGT will you be

1399
01:44:46,440 --> 01:44:48,420
able to decipher this content not

1400
01:44:48,420 --> 01:44:50,219
because the TGT is protected by the

1401
01:44:50,219 --> 01:44:52,139
kbtt GT and apart from if you are an

1402
01:44:52,139 --> 01:44:53,699
admin domain you do not  you don't know the

1403
01:44:53,699 --> 01:44:54,900
kabb TGT you won't be able to see it

1404
01:44:54,900 --> 01:44:56,820
so what do we do we want to

1405
01:44:56,820 --> 01:44:57,960
retrieve the information that is in this

1406
01:44:57,960 --> 01:45:00,000
pack but this pack is protected by the

1407
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,440
carbtgt key that we don't know  no so we

1408
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,880
can't decipher it so what do

1409
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:06,300
we do sorry to self plus we

1410
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:08,400
get a ticket as someone

1411
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:09,540
else we're going to do as us

1412
01:45:09,540 --> 01:45:14,400
towards us we being a user no

1413
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:15,600
need for SPN

1414
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:17,400
and a fine and no need to

1415
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:19,199
know the H of the password from

1416
01:45:19,199 --> 01:45:21,840
us since we do yutu and when we

1417
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:23,460
do you to you the service ticket

1418
01:45:23,460 --> 01:45:24,659
that we receive is protected by a

1419
01:45:24,659 --> 01:45:26,400
session key transfer key of the  TGT that we

1420
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:27,900
obtained just before so how do we do

1421
01:45:27,900 --> 01:45:29,880
1 we obtain a TGT with an

1422
01:45:29,880 --> 01:45:32,699
asymmetric pre-authentication pk2 the

1423
01:45:32,699 --> 01:45:34,440
TGT that we receive we will include it in

1424
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:36,080
a request on Youtube

1425
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:38,639
and we will receive a service ticket

1426
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:41,520
which contains  a pack this pack is encrypted

1427
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:43,020
by a session key that we know

1428
01:45:43,020 --> 01:45:44,760
since we obtained the TGT just before

1429
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:45,900
which is accompanied by this

1430
01:45:45,900 --> 01:45:47,699
session key and in this pack we will find

1431
01:45:47,699 --> 01:45:49,920
this blob pack condensal info which will

1432
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:52,619
retain our NTM keys  so you have a

1433
01:45:52,619 --> 01:45:53,880
mechanism that allows you to actually switch

1434
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:56,840
from a actually asymmetric certificate

1435
01:45:56,840 --> 01:46:00,900
to and Oakley NTM of the user and so

1436
01:46:00,900 --> 01:46:02,159
in fact we will be able to see this as

1437
01:46:02,159 --> 01:46:05,280
pekkanit backpoort for NTM

1438
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:07,139
the same I have put you in slides with  a

1439
01:46:07,139 --> 01:46:09,659
context of DSL buz so you have the

1440
01:46:09,659 --> 01:46:11,340
possibility of modifying the

1441
01:46:11,340 --> 01:46:12,239
permissions that you have on a

1442
01:46:12,239 --> 01:46:13,139
user you add a

1443
01:46:13,139 --> 01:46:14,340
certificate to him and you do the mechanism

1444
01:46:14,340 --> 01:46:16,940
that I described

1445
01:46:17,639 --> 01:46:20,940
fourth attack spenless Hervé CD the

1446
01:46:20,940 --> 01:46:22,980
rbcd so that it works in general for

1447
01:46:22,980 --> 01:46:24,659
those who have already done it you have to have

1448
01:46:24,659 --> 01:46:27,179
an SPN well not necessarily because one

1449
01:46:27,179 --> 01:46:28,860
day James for show he looked at Twitter he

1450
01:46:28,860 --> 01:46:30,960
said but wait no no there is

1451
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:32,699
not necessarily a need for asn same

1452
01:46:32,699 --> 01:46:35,040
mechanism be on your own more Youtube

1453
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:38,699
I call back  no need for one since we

1454
01:46:38,699 --> 01:46:39,960
can obtain a service ticket

1455
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:41,820
for a given user so

1456
01:46:41,820 --> 01:46:42,900
overall I have put all the

1457
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:45,300
information for you here in this detailed I

1458
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:47,159
tried to popularize or change the form

1459
01:46:47,159 --> 01:46:48,119
in fact of what was present in

1460
01:46:48,119 --> 01:46:49,679
the article which is great by James work

1461
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:51,600
show tyrannido which I invite you to read

1462
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:53,580
necessarily but here you have a little

1463
01:46:53,580 --> 01:46:57,239
translation for us mortal I

1464
01:46:57,239 --> 01:46:58,199
put you some

1465
01:46:58,199 --> 01:47:00,119
screenshots but overall the mechanism

1466
01:47:00,119 --> 01:47:03,139
is the following 1 we recover  one TGT

1467
01:47:03,139 --> 01:47:06,060
two this TGT we will extract the session

1468
01:47:06,060 --> 01:47:09,119
which three we will make a request SEO

1469
01:47:09,119 --> 01:47:11,520
self plus YouTube and the small

1470
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:13,080
particularity is that before doing the

1471
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:15,360
spao proxy we will change the H of

1472
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:18,060
the user by the session which  from the TGT

1473
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:20,280
obtained just before why because

1474
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:22,260
behind the KDC when he will do the

1475
01:47:22,260 --> 01:47:24,420
proxy return he will want to decrypt the

1476
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:27,360
result of the seof plus YouTube

1477
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:29,040
result which is encrypted by the

1478
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:30,659
transfer key but he does not know it he

1479
01:47:30,659 --> 01:47:31,920
will think that it is  is encrypted with the

1480
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:33,300
user key so the two

1481
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:35,460
matches

1482
01:47:35,460 --> 01:47:37,080
and finally the last attack must be done, his

1483
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:39,000
pride raised hand who knows the

1484
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,040
Golden ticket

1485
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:42,480
that's a lot so look at the

1486
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:43,800
hands removed we're going to do something so

1487
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:45,179
raised hand who knows the Golden ticket

1488
01:47:45,179 --> 01:47:47,360
or already seen passing the already used

1489
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:49,020
lower the hand those who don't know

1490
01:47:49,020 --> 01:47:51,119
silver ticket

1491
01:47:51,119 --> 01:47:52,260
but it's the hand those who don't know

1492
01:47:52,260 --> 01:47:55,199
Diamond ticket that's a

1493
01:47:55,199 --> 01:47:56,460
new thing that was done a

1494
01:47:56,460 --> 01:47:58,739
few years ago and  lower the hand

1495
01:47:58,739 --> 01:47:59,699
for those who don't know saphir

1496
01:47:59,699 --> 01:48:03,559
ticket so stay a few

1497
01:48:03,659 --> 01:48:05,639
its pride overall the idea is

1498
01:48:05,639 --> 01:48:07,560
to race against the bloutine and

1499
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:09,179
get ahead and therefore to make

1500
01:48:09,179 --> 01:48:10,380
a ticket that is almost detectable

1501
01:48:10,380 --> 01:48:12,239
the  problem of the Golden ticket in general

1502
01:48:12,239 --> 01:48:13,920
is that the pack is badly formed that

1503
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:16,260
it is a ticket which in fact comes from the non-

1504
01:48:16,260 --> 01:48:17,940
Dede so overall there are plenty

1505
01:48:17,940 --> 01:48:19,020
of indicators that normally make

1506
01:48:19,020 --> 01:48:21,780
it possible to detect a golden Street it  is

1507
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:23,520
that can generate false positives but

1508
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:25,440
in general we can detect them saphir

1509
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:27,480
ticket globally we use in fact

1510
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:28,980
the same mechanisms always of soy

1511
01:48:28,980 --> 01:48:31,380
any self uto to recover the pack

1512
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:33,719
all the detailed information of a

1513
01:48:33,719 --> 01:48:35,639
privileged user this pack will be

1514
01:48:35,639 --> 01:48:37,860
perfect since  it will be legitimate we will

1515
01:48:37,860 --> 01:48:39,659
take this pack and we will insert it in

1516
01:48:39,659 --> 01:48:41,159
a ticket which is also basically

1517
01:48:41,159 --> 01:48:42,900
legitimate and therefore we will craft a

1518
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:45,119
ticket which is generally legitimate in

1519
01:48:45,119 --> 01:48:48,540
fact and therefore we will greatly reduce

1520
01:48:48,540 --> 01:48:50,159
the possibilities of detecting the  saphir

1521
01:48:50,159 --> 01:48:52,080
ticket so it's a new thing that

1522
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:54,719
is done in 2022 that I implemented

1523
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:55,920
in a brochure but not on Windows

1524
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:57,360
so here for once I force you to

1525
01:48:57,360 --> 01:48:58,500
use Nuxe

1526
01:48:58,500 --> 01:49:00,239
I believe it was implemented in

1527
01:49:00,239 --> 01:49:02,159
Rubus but I am  not sure so I

1528
01:49:02,159 --> 01:49:04,679
've put the details here for you I

1529
01:49:04,679 --> 01:49:06,420
invite you to watch but overall what you

1530
01:49:06,420 --> 01:49:07,800
need to remember from all this is

1531
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:10,560
that with S8 alone S8 or

1532
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:13,500
YouTube proxy mechanisms and

1533
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:14,580
authentication protocols that  are generally

1534
01:49:14,580 --> 01:49:16,320
little known well in fact we can produce

1535
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:18,300
5 attacks 5 attacks that were

1536
01:49:18,300 --> 01:49:20,400
discovered and published in 2019-2021

1537
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:23,580
2022 2022 I remember it was 5-6

1538
01:49:23,580 --> 01:49:25,619
months ago so if it is in 2023 it will be

1539
01:49:25,619 --> 01:49:26,820
there  have others so I invite you

1540
01:49:26,820 --> 01:49:28,380
to know these protocols these

1541
01:49:28,380 --> 01:49:30,060
extensions know roughly the

1542
01:49:30,060 --> 01:49:31,020
ins and outs of these

1543
01:49:31,020 --> 01:49:33,179
and maybe you will suddenly be

1544
01:49:33,179 --> 01:49:34,260
able to understand the new

1545
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:35,880
things that will come out on Twitter this

1546
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:37,020
year the year  next or in the

1547
01:49:37,020 --> 01:49:39,360
next five years without necessarily having to

1548
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:41,520
re-read and re-read blocks that

1549
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:43,080
take 10 hours to read and that you

1550
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:44,219
never understand because the guys who

1551
01:49:44,219 --> 01:49:45,780
wrote them are too intelligent

1552
01:49:45,780 --> 01:49:47,820
for us

1553
01:49:47,820 --> 01:49:49,980
in general I have a habit that  is at the

1554
01:49:49,980 --> 01:49:51,119
end of my lectures to actually anticipate

1555
01:49:51,119 --> 01:49:51,900
the questions that you are going to

1556
01:49:51,900 --> 01:49:53,639
ask me that allows me to always spend

1557
01:49:53,639 --> 01:49:55,380
time and never be surprised but

1558
01:49:55,380 --> 01:49:56,940
there anyway we have more time

1559
01:49:56,940 --> 01:49:58,619
so if you want to surprise me at  a

1560
01:49:58,619 --> 01:50:00,360
stuck in a corner with

1561
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:01,380
questions that I will not be able to

1562
01:50:01,380 --> 01:50:05,159
answer I will try to catch up with him

1563
01:50:05,159 --> 01:50:07,800
thanks to James forcho Snoop crush

1564
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:11,100
pixis and another 6 Charlie Clark

1565
01:50:11,100 --> 01:50:13,679
undochwartz Alberto Solino and the exceptional tchami

1566
01:50:13,679 --> 01:50:16,820
shoder and derkane

1567
01:50:17,300 --> 01:50:19,199
for really looking

1568
01:50:19,199 --> 01:50:21,060
for  high level and on which in fact

1569
01:50:21,060 --> 01:50:22,800
the works that I presented to you are

1570
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:24,780
based so I generally

1571
01:50:24,780 --> 01:50:28,260
invented almost nothing so go and worship these people

1572
01:50:28,260 --> 01:50:29,940


1573
01:50:29,940 --> 01:50:31,500
the resources I put you some

1574
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:32,760
links I had not necessarily put you all of them of

1575
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:34,440
course I  invite you to

1576
01:50:34,440 --> 01:50:36,679
consult the Holy Grail

1577
01:50:36,679 --> 01:50:39,540
or else exégold which is the

1578
01:50:39,540 --> 01:50:42,119
slightly more professional and secure alternative to Kali Linux

1579
01:50:42,119 --> 01:50:44,639
I didn't say anything about the glossary you have it

1580
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:45,960
there pay attention to the glossary when

1581
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:47,460
we talk about technical fields and

1582
01:50:47,460 --> 01:50:49,080
technical terms  you have to be a little

1583
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:50,280
careful or maybe it's my

1584
01:50:50,280 --> 01:50:52,020
mania for using the right

1585
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:53,840
terms like

1586
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:56,219
hntm when you talk in HNT it's not

1587
01:50:56,219 --> 01:50:58,199
quite true the same you have to try

1588
01:50:58,199 --> 01:51:00,960
to say responsible or net challenge  NTM

1589
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:04,260
V1 no so here I invite you to

1590
01:51:04,260 --> 01:51:05,580
watch it try to build up a

1591
01:51:05,580 --> 01:51:07,619
slightly more technical culture a

1592
01:51:07,619 --> 01:51:09,119
little more advanced it will avoid, for

1593
01:51:09,119 --> 01:51:10,619
example, the problems of

1594
01:51:10,619 --> 01:51:12,179
encrypting decrypting which make your teeth cringe

1595
01:51:12,179 --> 01:51:14,340
regularly well there it is almost  the

1596
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:16,739
same thing but on activity

1597
01:51:16,739 --> 01:51:18,480
here I thank you and if you have

1598
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:19,860
any questions do not hesitate we have a

1599
01:51:19,860 --> 01:51:21,070
minute

1600
01:51:21,070 --> 01:51:28,440
[Applause]

1601
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:30,420
so we can take a few questions

1602
01:51:30,420 --> 01:51:35,100
either on slido I have it we put it on or

1603
01:51:35,100 --> 01:51:37,940
live

1604
01:51:39,719 --> 01:51:40,880
so we wake up

1605
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:44,420
sorry  I put you to sleep

1606
01:51:49,080 --> 01:51:52,080
after

1607
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:00,640
thank you very much thank you

1608
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:06,989
[Applause]

1609
01:55:16,710 --> 01:55:19,779
[Music]

1610
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:36,540
ok we'll start in a minute

1611
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:08,540
except

1612
02:04:18,420 --> 02:04:22,400
ok we're off we'll see

1613
02:04:22,699 --> 02:04:25,619
so once again the conference is

1614
02:04:25,619 --> 02:04:27,000
in French but the bio is in English

1615
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:30,719
because it's barely been so  Matthieu

1616
02:04:30,719 --> 02:04:34,560
Sonnier and what is a max rating

1617
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:38,520
they are thirsty villagement

1618
02:04:58,680 --> 02:05:04,199
[Applause]

1619
02:05:04,199 --> 02:05:06,500
today

1620
02:05:26,639 --> 02:05:29,239
I think it's

1621
02:05:36,719 --> 02:05:39,560
moving

1622
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:45,139
no there's no one who can come

1623
02:08:21,300 --> 02:08:22,920
I think it's over it was the

1624
02:08:22,920 --> 02:08:25,520
English version

1625
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:29,179
so today  today

1626
02:08:32,040 --> 02:08:34,440
we start again today I will tell you

1627
02:08:34,440 --> 02:08:36,560
about three groups

1628
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:39,199
first there is Yolo corp a

1629
02:08:39,199 --> 02:08:41,760
company which follows the rules of

1630
02:08:41,760 --> 02:08:44,099
security and campaign but which has

1631
02:08:44,099 --> 02:08:47,340
no security team ansight cool

1632
02:08:47,340 --> 02:08:49,199
sec a company with pros of the

1633
02:08:49,199 --> 02:08:51,119
security who have understood that yes the

1634
02:08:51,119 --> 02:08:53,760
campaign is important but that

1635
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:56,219
sometimes it takes a little judgment and

1636
02:08:56,219 --> 02:08:58,860
in the end it is worth 4 a group of

1637
02:08:58,860 --> 02:09:01,020
actors who do not need to be

1638
02:09:01,020 --> 02:09:03,420
like planning nothing at all

1639
02:09:03,420 --> 02:09:05,540
my name it  is Mathieu Fournier director

1640
02:09:05,540 --> 02:09:08,520
at sumo logic

1641
02:09:08,520 --> 02:09:09,719
I've been in computer security for more than 20 years

1642
02:09:09,719 --> 02:09:12,239
so sometimes I feel a little

1643
02:09:12,239 --> 02:09:14,880
like that

1644
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:16,800
while I was preparing the presentation

1645
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:19,679
there was a Black Keys

1646
02:09:19,679 --> 02:09:22,860
infotec webinar which was to give the  10 ways

1647
02:09:22,860 --> 02:09:24,659
they used most often that

1648
02:09:24,659 --> 02:09:26,940
had the most success to make their

1649
02:09:26,940 --> 02:09:29,940
slopes with their clients if we zoom in a

1650
02:09:29,940 --> 02:09:32,280
little bit we can see that creeden shows

1651
02:09:32,280 --> 02:09:34,920
is the number 1 reason

1652
02:09:34,920 --> 02:09:37,080
why they have with the  what they

1653
02:09:37,080 --> 02:09:38,659
used most often to

1654
02:09:38,659 --> 02:09:42,360
enter the companies the solution

1655
02:09:42,360 --> 02:09:46,380
he gives for that is hop it was the

1656
02:09:46,380 --> 02:09:49,080
longer passwords when we

1657
02:09:49,080 --> 02:09:51,179
ask Google the causes of

1658
02:09:51,179 --> 02:09:53,880
the most frequent breaches once again the

1659
02:09:53,880 --> 02:09:56,159
passwords the weak password the

1660
02:09:56,159 --> 02:09:59,219
reuse of passwords

1661
02:09:59,219 --> 02:10:01,260
now that we have set the table we are going to

1662
02:10:01,260 --> 02:10:03,540
meet the protagonists of our

1663
02:10:03,540 --> 02:10:08,099
story so here we have our friends from Yolo

1664
02:10:08,099 --> 02:10:10,080
Korp so we can see that they look like

1665
02:10:10,080 --> 02:10:12,840
pretty careless we wonder

1666
02:10:12,840 --> 02:10:15,000
what could go wrong

1667
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:20,960
like mentioning Yolo Korp and PC earlier

1668
02:10:20,960 --> 02:10:22,800
we'll see a little later what

1669
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:25,320
impact that has on passwords

1670
02:10:25,320 --> 02:10:27,060


1671
02:10:27,060 --> 02:10:30,420
here we have people of course sec  so we

1672
02:10:30,420 --> 02:10:32,400
see that courtec are already a little more

1673
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:34,820
serious

1674
02:10:34,820 --> 02:10:38,639
they are also like stone planning

1675
02:10:38,639 --> 02:10:40,320
but they also follow the

1676
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:43,440
recommendations of a list

1677
02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:49,440
finally our friends Yves who them

1678
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:50,719
how to say

1679
02:10:50,719 --> 02:10:52,860
he does not care at all about your account

1680
02:10:52,860 --> 02:10:55,199
line it is you may have  having already seen

1681
02:10:55,199 --> 02:10:56,000
the

1682
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:59,840
poster of kiwi all the same which says

1683
02:10:59,840 --> 02:11:03,960
like 200 things which evoke each other

1684
02:11:03,960 --> 02:11:06,119
it is exactly that but in addition with

1685
02:11:06,119 --> 02:11:09,799
the unpleasant attitude of the cats

1686
02:11:11,099 --> 02:11:13,560
so our story begins with

1687
02:11:13,560 --> 02:11:16,679
Ivo 4 one which will make a very

1688
02:11:16,679 --> 02:11:19,679
famous attack which is  'call passwordspree this

1689
02:11:19,679 --> 02:11:21,960
attack affects almost everything that

1690
02:11:21,960 --> 02:11:24,239
has a login on the internet in less than 24

1691
02:11:24,239 --> 02:11:26,280
hours I even personally saw a

1692
02:11:26,280 --> 02:11:28,080
machine being attacked by a

1693
02:11:28,080 --> 02:11:31,020
password attack 7 minutes after being

1694
02:11:31,020 --> 02:11:32,940
put online

1695
02:11:32,940 --> 02:11:35,178
so

1696
02:11:35,639 --> 02:11:39,860
when  we do a password attack

1697
02:11:40,440 --> 02:11:42,239
we generally do research on

1698
02:11:42,239 --> 02:11:44,820
the companies we want to attack so

1699
02:11:44,820 --> 02:11:47,400
we're going to go in this case it's worth 4 one

1700
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:49,920
to use a LinkedIn scraper I'm

1701
02:11:49,920 --> 02:11:51,420
sorry the presentation is in French

1702
02:11:51,420 --> 02:11:52,679
but it's going to have  a lot of people in

1703
02:11:52,679 --> 02:11:53,990
English

1704
02:11:53,990 --> 02:11:55,440
[Music]

1705
02:11:55,440 --> 02:11:57,119
and then after that we build a list of

1706
02:11:57,119 --> 02:11:58,560
passwords that are likely to

1707
02:11:58,560 --> 02:12:01,260
work with the company we want to

1708
02:12:01,260 --> 02:12:03,300
attack so generally we will take

1709
02:12:03,300 --> 02:12:05,580
the name of the company we will add a

1710
02:12:05,580 --> 02:12:07,320
two  three exclamations things like

1711
02:12:07,320 --> 02:12:08,699
that

1712
02:12:08,699 --> 02:12:10,739
so level 4 1 here is done his

1713
02:12:10,739 --> 02:12:13,440
research and he launches his attack so

1714
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:18,080
the first attack is Kurt with

1715
02:12:20,420 --> 02:12:23,580
1 2 3 exclamation he found a

1716
02:12:23,580 --> 02:12:26,040
combination that works so then

1717
02:12:26,040 --> 02:12:27,719
once his attack is over he  will

1718
02:12:27,719 --> 02:12:30,000
go to cool sec same type

1719
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,360
of attack so first he will have

1720
02:12:32,360 --> 02:12:36,480
two Barker with cool sec exclamation and

1721
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:39,599
finally Boba fetch with Welcome 2023

1722
02:12:39,599 --> 02:12:43,020
exclamation and he will have a match

1723
02:12:43,020 --> 02:12:44,880
so there now he goes to the

1724
02:12:44,880 --> 02:12:47,040
second stage of the  attack we found

1725
02:12:47,040 --> 02:12:48,239
some crude things that work

1726
02:12:48,239 --> 02:12:52,020
it's time to try them so when he

1727
02:12:52,020 --> 02:12:54,920
gets to Courcelles

1728
02:12:56,239 --> 02:12:59,460
he finds an RDP exposing the internet and

1729
02:12:59,460 --> 02:13:02,280
uses it and he has this screen there that you

1730
02:13:02,280 --> 02:13:03,780
're probably all very familiar with

1731
02:13:03,780 --> 02:13:06,360
then for a while  you have

1732
02:13:06,360 --> 02:13:07,739
very good ideas of what happens

1733
02:13:07,739 --> 02:13:10,159
after

1734
02:13:10,219 --> 02:13:12,659
our level 4 tries to do the same

1735
02:13:12,659 --> 02:13:16,020
attack on

1736
02:13:16,020 --> 02:13:19,139
Coursac here is the screen he receives so

1737
02:13:19,139 --> 02:13:22,380
here yes there was the password which

1738
02:13:22,380 --> 02:13:24,360
was weak which has become but we have

1739
02:13:24,360 --> 02:13:27,239
of MFP multifactor athensification or

1740
02:13:27,239 --> 02:13:29,579
multiple authentication so much

1741
02:13:29,579 --> 02:13:32,820
less success with the same the same

1742
02:13:32,820 --> 02:13:35,059
attack

1743
02:13:35,099 --> 02:13:37,980
according to Microsoft using MFP

1744
02:13:37,980 --> 02:13:40,099
can reduce

1745
02:13:40,099 --> 02:13:42,719
99.9% the chance of an attack

1746
02:13:42,719 --> 02:13:44,940
compared to a password alone I will

1747
02:13:44,940 --> 02:13:47,179
repeat it

1748
02:13:47,179 --> 02:13:50,099
99.9  % less chance that the tax will be

1749
02:13:50,099 --> 02:13:53,460
successful by putting on MFA so if you do

1750
02:13:53,460 --> 02:13:55,199
n't have MFC especially what is

1751
02:13:55,199 --> 02:13:57,420
internet facing it's probably the

1752
02:13:57,420 --> 02:13:58,820
first thing you should do on

1753
02:13:58,820 --> 02:14:02,900
Tuesday when you get back to the office

1754
02:14:03,239 --> 02:14:05,840
as for also a very good one

1755
02:14:05,840 --> 02:14:07,980
well they obviously received alerts from

1756
02:14:07,980 --> 02:14:09,619


1757
02:14:09,619 --> 02:14:13,440
passwordspray bloodforce husky it's

1758
02:14:13,440 --> 02:14:16,500
in all good his then if they have to

1759
02:14:16,500 --> 02:14:19,380
user intitty so they will also have

1760
02:14:19,380 --> 02:14:22,079
things like first connection first

1761
02:14:22,079 --> 02:14:23,940
successful connection

1762
02:14:23,940 --> 02:14:27,840
IP or first my mit for a country if

1763
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:28,699
ever

1764
02:14:28,699 --> 02:14:31,679
the attacker was not

1765
02:14:31,679 --> 02:14:33,480
a prophet these searches let's say that in

1766
02:14:33,480 --> 02:14:35,840
full at the level of the funeral finally

1767
02:14:35,840 --> 02:14:38,940
obviously level 4 One

1768
02:14:38,940 --> 02:14:41,280
also tried to Blood force the Malti Fighters

1769
02:14:41,280 --> 02:14:45,139
we will have an alert for that too

1770
02:14:45,480 --> 02:14:48,300
so what does it say  at the level of

1771
02:14:48,300 --> 02:14:50,340
passwords because someone who

1772
02:14:50,340 --> 02:14:52,500
wants to try what length of a

1773
02:14:52,500 --> 02:14:56,960
special password for passwords

1774
02:14:56,960 --> 02:15:00,260
we see over there

1775
02:15:01,150 --> 02:15:02,820
[Music]

1776
02:15:02,820 --> 02:15:04,380
when I made the presentation it was

1777
02:15:04,380 --> 02:15:06,960
this character  and the password must

1778
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:09,199
be changed every 90 days

1779
02:15:09,199 --> 02:15:11,040
I imagine there is no Key westien

1780
02:15:11,040 --> 02:15:12,679
in the room

1781
02:15:12,679 --> 02:15:16,699
me when I hear that I said to myself

1782
02:15:16,940 --> 02:15:20,159
7 characters I don't know if you think

1783
02:15:20,159 --> 02:15:21,780
the same thing as  me but I

1784
02:15:21,780 --> 02:15:23,699
said to myself how long it takes to

1785
02:15:23,699 --> 02:15:25,619
crack a password of this

1786
02:15:25,619 --> 02:15:26,940
character again which is

1787
02:15:26,940 --> 02:15:28,020
someone who wants to try with an

1788
02:15:28,020 --> 02:15:29,639
answer

1789
02:15:29,639 --> 02:15:32,360
Eric

1790
02:15:32,940 --> 02:15:35,099
so

1791
02:15:35,099 --> 02:15:37,800
hi Google 7 minutes then we'll see

1792
02:15:37,800 --> 02:15:39,960
after we go  based on a table that

1793
02:15:39,960 --> 02:15:41,960
tells him a lot less

1794
02:15:41,960 --> 02:15:44,579
so we agree whether it's

1795
02:15:44,579 --> 02:15:46,800
a few seconds or a few minutes it

1796
02:15:46,800 --> 02:15:49,380
changes absolutely nothing there for an

1797
02:15:49,380 --> 02:15:52,860
attacker if we come back here yesterday we were

1798
02:15:52,860 --> 02:15:55,460
talking about this character 90 days but

1799
02:15:55,460 --> 02:15:59,360
let's be honest it has changed  at the end of

1800
02:15:59,360 --> 02:16:02,639
2022 now we are talking about 12

1801
02:16:02,639 --> 02:16:05,219
characters to be changed every 90 days

1802
02:16:05,219 --> 02:16:07,619
so what is the difference between 7 and

1803
02:16:07,619 --> 02:16:10,980
12 characters well we will go to one of

1804
02:16:10,980 --> 02:16:12,719
these images there this is the one we will

1805
02:16:12,719 --> 02:16:14,040
use the panaire  the whole

1806
02:16:14,040 --> 02:16:15,900
presentation there are different

1807
02:16:15,900 --> 02:16:17,340
versions but I had to

1808
02:16:17,340 --> 02:16:18,599
choose this

1809
02:16:18,599 --> 02:16:21,540
so if we zoom in a little bit we will see

1810
02:16:21,540 --> 02:16:24,000
that 12 characters we are told that it

1811
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:27,900
takes 3000 years whereas at 7 but we are

1812
02:16:27,900 --> 02:16:31,139
talking about 30 seconds 31  seconds

1813
02:16:31,139 --> 02:16:33,240
but in fact that's without counting on

1814
02:16:33,240 --> 02:16:36,359
the predictability of human beings

1815
02:16:36,359 --> 02:16:40,200
because spring 23 or welcome 20 23

1816
02:16:40,200 --> 02:16:43,799
exclamation it's the other happens there in

1817
02:16:43,799 --> 02:16:45,299
12 characters but they will take

1818
02:16:45,299 --> 02:16:46,760
a few seconds to crack because

1819
02:16:46,760 --> 02:16:49,500
it  it's dictionary words it's

1820
02:16:49,500 --> 02:16:52,080
stuff that's predictable so it gets

1821
02:16:52,080 --> 02:16:53,939
tried very quickly it's a built

1822
02:16:53,939 --> 02:16:57,559
in password cracking tool

1823
02:16:58,879 --> 02:17:00,898


1824
02:17:00,898 --> 02:17:02,218
anyone wanna try it out while I

1825
02:17:02,218 --> 02:17:05,178
take a sip of water subtly

1826
02:17:17,280 --> 02:17:20,160
we speak of 8 characters and we say

1827
02:17:20,160 --> 02:17:23,398
to avoid the words of the dictionary and

1828
02:17:23,398 --> 02:17:25,620
rather to favor a passwords instead

1829
02:17:25,620 --> 02:17:29,040
of a password passwords being several

1830
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:31,099
words

1831
02:17:31,099 --> 02:17:34,679
I put avoided here 1000 accents on

1832
02:17:34,679 --> 02:17:36,959
avoid I would like  you think

1833
02:17:36,959 --> 02:17:38,280
about what is that why they

1834
02:17:38,280 --> 02:17:41,359
used the term avoid

1835
02:17:41,580 --> 02:17:44,939
good there is no way for a listener

1836
02:17:44,939 --> 02:17:46,679
to know what password you

1837
02:17:46,679 --> 02:17:48,359
put in or what password all your

1838
02:17:48,359 --> 02:17:50,160
users put in so they  have

1839
02:17:50,160 --> 02:17:52,200
used this term we must avoid the

1840
02:17:52,200 --> 02:17:53,580
only way we could know

1841
02:17:53,580 --> 02:17:55,859
it is to crack the passwords I

1842
02:17:55,859 --> 02:17:57,599
don't know about you but I don't

1843
02:17:57,599 --> 02:17:59,040
really want to give my

1844
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:01,500
password and even less the word  password of

1845
02:18:01,500 --> 02:18:03,799
all my users to a listener

1846
02:18:03,799 --> 02:18:06,000
as I often say to my friend Eric

1847
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,519
was sitting there I trust you with

1848
02:18:08,519 --> 02:18:10,799
my life but not with my passport finally

1849
02:18:10,799 --> 02:18:12,540
that if I don't trust Eric I

1850
02:18:12,540 --> 02:18:14,340
trust even less

1851
02:18:14,340 --> 02:18:16,320
bigfort sorry  if it is one of your

1852
02:18:16,320 --> 02:18:18,679
employers

1853
02:18:18,780 --> 02:18:19,879
so

1854
02:18:19,879 --> 02:18:22,978
if we go back to our table but we

1855
02:18:22,978 --> 02:18:25,879
see there that eight characters

1856
02:18:25,879 --> 02:18:30,718
we are talking about 39 minutes so really not

1857
02:18:30,718 --> 02:18:33,058
enough to protect a real

1858
02:18:33,058 --> 02:18:35,939
password we agree there that an

1859
02:18:35,939 --> 02:18:37,019
opponent will spend a lot more  only

1860
02:18:37,019 --> 02:18:38,160
a few minutes we already talked about it

1861
02:18:38,160 --> 02:18:41,340
earlier Nice what does it say about

1862
02:18:41,340 --> 02:18:43,799
passwords I won't ask you the

1863
02:18:43,799 --> 02:18:44,939
question no one has answered the other two

1864
02:18:44,939 --> 02:18:45,679


1865
02:18:45,679 --> 02:18:50,099
15 characters and never expires so

1866
02:18:50,099 --> 02:18:51,299
we already have a word  password much

1867
02:18:51,299 --> 02:18:53,879
longer with the nistes but in addition it

1868
02:18:53,879 --> 02:18:55,679
expires not

1869
02:18:55,679 --> 02:18:56,879
me when I saw that this is the reaction

1870
02:18:56,879 --> 02:18:59,280
I had never again to change my

1871
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:03,260
corporate password which player

1872
02:19:03,898 --> 02:19:05,340
if we return our table for just

1873
02:19:05,340 --> 02:19:07,200
for  see what it looks like here we're

1874
02:19:07,200 --> 02:19:10,558
talking about a billion years

1875
02:19:10,558 --> 02:19:12,540
it seems interesting to me it seems

1876
02:19:12,540 --> 02:19:16,320
pretty robust to me so that brings us to our

1877
02:19:16,320 --> 02:19:19,740
second attack by our friend ivo4 2

1878
02:19:19,740 --> 02:19:21,898
him just by looking at him we see that he  is

1879
02:19:21,898 --> 02:19:23,250
sleazy

1880
02:19:23,250 --> 02:19:24,718
[Music]

1881
02:19:24,718 --> 02:19:26,700
they only go together she's the

1882
02:19:26,700 --> 02:19:28,978
fast and furgent specialist he managed to

1883
02:19:28,978 --> 02:19:30,359
get his hands on a copy of your

1884
02:19:30,359 --> 02:19:31,459


1885
02:19:31,459 --> 02:19:34,260
ntds.dit file for those who didn't know

1886
02:19:34,260 --> 02:19:35,820
this file here this is the file

1887
02:19:35,820 --> 02:19:38,160
passwords in Windows which is on the

1888
02:19:38,160 --> 02:19:40,040
active side of

1889
02:19:40,040 --> 02:19:42,780
generally very well protected in the

1890
02:19:42,780 --> 02:19:44,700
case here there is this in a

1891
02:19:44,700 --> 02:19:46,080
backup copy which is generally much

1892
02:19:46,080 --> 02:19:50,760
less protected than the domain control

1893
02:19:50,760 --> 02:19:54,000
so to make a cracking attack

1894
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,340
we have our file  NTS password

1895
02:19:56,340 --> 02:19:59,460
and we need a dictionary almost

1896
02:19:59,460 --> 02:20:00,720
everyone agrees that the

1897
02:20:00,720 --> 02:20:02,280
best dictionary for cracking

1898
02:20:02,280 --> 02:20:04,280
passwords is

1899
02:20:04,280 --> 02:20:07,080
rocky.txt one of the places for in our

1900
02:20:07,080 --> 02:20:08,899
deracus point texts

1901
02:20:08,899 --> 02:20:11,700
Securitytest work which  belongs to Ron who

1902
02:20:11,700 --> 02:20:13,200
is currently giving a

1903
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:15,300
panel in room number 1 so if

1904
02:20:15,300 --> 02:20:17,280
you see him afterwards say thank you

1905
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:19,260
because several resources for

1906
02:20:19,260 --> 02:20:22,140
password tracking on his site in

1907
02:20:22,140 --> 02:20:24,240
addition he is super nice

1908
02:20:24,240 --> 02:20:26,300
so how do we crack a  password

1909
02:20:26,300 --> 02:20:29,220
we will use tools like H4 John

1910
02:20:29,220 --> 02:20:31,920
from Reaper in the presentation here we will

1911
02:20:31,920 --> 02:20:34,740
focus on H4 so here we have the mode

1912
02:20:34,740 --> 02:20:37,380
- M 1000 which says that we want to crack

1913
02:20:37,380 --> 02:20:42,180
NTLM then from that we have the least A0 that

1914
02:20:42,180 --> 02:20:43,859
it is precisely the dictionary mode

1915
02:20:43,859 --> 02:20:46,020
that we are going to take and we have the rules at the

1916
02:20:46,020 --> 02:20:47,760
end generally we will use

1917
02:20:47,760 --> 02:20:51,020
several different rules

1918
02:20:51,439 --> 02:20:53,819
typically when we crack

1919
02:20:53,819 --> 02:20:55,920
passwords a company that has never done it

1920
02:20:55,920 --> 02:20:57,420
before that does not do that in a way

1921
02:20:57,420 --> 02:21:00,479
regular we can crack about 50%

1922
02:21:00,479 --> 02:21:02,819
of passwords in 24 hours and

1923
02:21:02,819 --> 02:21:05,280
about 80% of passwords in a

1924
02:21:05,280 --> 02:21:07,340
week

1925
02:21:08,100 --> 02:21:10,200
so here we will see how our two

1926
02:21:10,200 --> 02:21:12,180
corporations

1927
02:21:12,180 --> 02:21:15,780
managed to resist this

1928
02:21:15,780 --> 02:21:19,220
attack there what are the percentages

1929
02:21:23,700 --> 02:21:26,280
so we are not surprised when we

1930
02:21:26,280 --> 02:21:29,819
attack Yolo corp we fall to 80% when

1931
02:21:29,819 --> 02:21:33,200
we attack that we know that we fall to 1%

1932
02:21:33,200 --> 02:21:36,620
we will look at someone password

1933
02:21:36,620 --> 02:21:40,620
on the side of our friends at court sec so

1934
02:21:40,620 --> 02:21:42,359
the  first password is welcome

1935
02:21:42,359 --> 02:21:45,600
20-23 etc and the second is password

1936
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:47,840
password and we

1937
02:21:47,840 --> 02:21:52,819
cleverly replace the highs with 0s

1938
02:21:52,819 --> 02:21:56,120
so if we go back to our table

1939
02:21:56,120 --> 02:21:58,380
the difference between the two

1940
02:21:58,380 --> 02:22:02,779
passwords which have 12 and 12 and 17  characters

1941
02:22:03,720 --> 02:22:08,160
it would be 3000 years versus 7 million

1942
02:22:08,160 --> 02:22:09,840
years

1943
02:22:09,840 --> 02:22:10,640
so

1944
02:22:10,640 --> 02:22:12,960
which of these two passwords is

1945
02:22:12,960 --> 02:22:15,000
the hardest to crack

1946
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:16,800
but in fact it's my Thai friends

1947
02:22:16,800 --> 02:22:19,680
who have the correct answer 500 boots these

1948
02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:20,819
two passwords go  take a

1949
02:22:20,819 --> 02:22:22,740
few seconds to be cracked

1950
02:22:22,740 --> 02:22:25,140
because changing a zero for a high a high

1951
02:22:25,140 --> 02:22:26,580
for a zero but buying an exclamation

1952
02:22:26,580 --> 02:22:28,859
putting the year at the end of a

1953
02:22:28,859 --> 02:22:32,640
password is really really bad

1954
02:22:32,640 --> 02:22:34,260
now let's see what kind of word

1955
02:22:34,260 --> 02:22:38,960
passwords are used at Yolo Corp

1956
02:22:46,220 --> 02:22:48,600
de one with dots instead of

1957
02:22:48,600 --> 02:22:51,180
spaces so if we look at how many of these

1958
02:22:51,180 --> 02:22:54,600
passwords there actually who thinks

1959
02:22:54,600 --> 02:22:57,120
the first password is more

1960
02:22:57,120 --> 02:22:59,540
secure

1961
02:23:00,359 --> 02:23:02,100
who thinks the second password

1962
02:23:02,100 --> 02:23:04,500
is more secure

1963
02:23:04,500 --> 02:23:06,420
we have a little more people for the

1964
02:23:06,420 --> 02:23:08,520
first the two passwords are 23

1965
02:23:08,520 --> 02:23:10,979
characters

1966
02:23:10,979 --> 02:23:14,399
so according to password Monster.com the

1967
02:23:14,399 --> 02:23:15,979
first would take

1968
02:23:15,979 --> 02:23:18,540
161 million years while the

1969
02:23:18,540 --> 02:23:21,060
second would take only 29 million

1970
02:23:21,060 --> 02:23:23,300
years

1971
02:23:24,120 --> 02:23:26,460
so here we see that it  y used the

1972
02:23:26,460 --> 02:23:27,780
number of special characters to

1973
02:23:27,780 --> 02:23:30,120
calculate in his algorithm whereas

1974
02:23:30,120 --> 02:23:32,899
if we go on security

1975
02:23:35,420 --> 02:23:37,560
but it must be really extremely

1976
02:23:37,560 --> 02:23:41,040
long not to use our word

1977
02:23:41,040 --> 02:23:43,260
but again it is my

1978
02:23:43,260 --> 02:23:44,840
Thai friends who have the correct answer

1979
02:23:44,840 --> 02:23:48,960
it  is 500 boots of Friends bots same

1980
02:23:48,960 --> 02:23:51,420
the two are going to be way too long

1981
02:23:51,420 --> 02:23:53,880
to crack for anyone there's

1982
02:23:53,880 --> 02:23:55,140
no chance people will

1983
02:23:55,140 --> 02:23:58,319
find that type of password there

1984
02:23:58,319 --> 02:23:59,939
so what the hell  court sec did

1985
02:23:59,939 --> 02:24:02,700
exactly to arrive at this result

1986
02:24:02,700 --> 02:24:03,660
which is still really

1987
02:24:03,660 --> 02:24:06,720
impressive and much better than

1988
02:24:06,720 --> 02:24:10,740
the majority that went from 80% to less than 1%

1989
02:24:10,740 --> 02:24:13,859
it's still quite impressive

1990
02:24:13,859 --> 02:24:15,180
so the first thing

1991
02:24:15,180 --> 02:24:18,720
they did they  have implemented

1992
02:24:18,720 --> 02:24:21,120
15-character passwords that never expire they

1993
02:24:21,120 --> 02:24:22,740
have implemented

1994
02:24:22,740 --> 02:24:25,140
weekly password cracking and a

1995
02:24:25,140 --> 02:24:26,939
cracked password equals a change password

1996
02:24:26,939 --> 02:24:29,180


1997
02:24:30,300 --> 02:24:31,740
if we go a little further into  the

1998
02:24:31,740 --> 02:24:33,840
detail but the first thing we do

1999
02:24:33,840 --> 02:24:37,680
if we create a service account we will

2000
02:24:37,680 --> 02:24:41,600
give the rights replicated

2001
02:24:42,560 --> 02:24:44,580
obviously we will give him a very good

2002
02:24:44,580 --> 02:24:46,740
password because it is

2003
02:24:46,740 --> 02:24:48,899
the equivalent of having a D6 5 for  those

2004
02:24:48,899 --> 02:24:51,080
who know about the attack

2005
02:24:51,080 --> 02:24:53,640
we will create a GPO that has the

2006
02:24:53,640 --> 02:24:56,760
recommendations of the nest inside

2007
02:24:56,760 --> 02:24:59,399
we will target our users who will

2008
02:24:59,399 --> 02:25:00,899
soon have to change their password

2009
02:25:00,899 --> 02:25:02,880
take 15 characters and the Good

2010
02:25:02,880 --> 02:25:04,920
News if we don't crack you

2011
02:25:04,920 --> 02:25:06,560
don't change it

2012
02:25:06,560 --> 02:25:09,479
then from that when we deploy to the GPO

2013
02:25:09,479 --> 02:25:11,939
obviously then finally but we force

2014
02:25:11,939 --> 02:25:13,800
the change of passwords for

2015
02:25:13,800 --> 02:25:17,300
all our accounts in the company

2016
02:25:26,580 --> 02:25:27,540
so now we are going to really go

2017
02:25:27,540 --> 02:25:29,939
into detail

2018
02:25:29,939 --> 02:25:32,580
there are different ways to

2019
02:25:32,580 --> 02:25:36,000
get the file  NTS or

2020
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,160
passwords in actor assets the way

2021
02:25:38,160 --> 02:25:40,979
that I've seen used in actually in

2022
02:25:40,979 --> 02:25:42,840
two things most of the companies

2023
02:25:42,840 --> 02:25:44,939
that I've seen implement that are

2024
02:25:44,939 --> 02:25:47,160
financial institutions so well done

2025
02:25:47,160 --> 02:25:49,260
that's really good by  cons often

2026
02:25:49,260 --> 02:25:51,720
it's not super elegant we ask the

2027
02:25:51,720 --> 02:25:53,880
domain admin to give us a copy

2028
02:25:53,880 --> 02:25:56,460
of a West Indian audit of

2029
02:25:56,460 --> 02:25:58,620
admitted domains but it's already relatively

2030
02:25:58,620 --> 02:25:59,840
busy

2031
02:25:59,840 --> 02:26:03,240
with files every week so

2032
02:26:03,240 --> 02:26:05,220
here we're going to use the internal DS module

2033
02:26:05,220 --> 02:26:08,040
which is made by Michael graff

2034
02:26:08,040 --> 02:26:11,100
meter who lives in Canada so Oz

2035
02:26:11,100 --> 02:26:12,380
for a Canadian

2036
02:26:12,380 --> 02:26:14,819
after that but we will obviously import

2037
02:26:14,819 --> 02:26:16,859
the module I put it there just because

2038
02:26:16,859 --> 02:26:18,600
I often forget it then I lose

2039
02:26:18,600 --> 02:26:20,160
precious minutes

2040
02:26:20,160 --> 02:26:23,580
then that we go  the account that we created

2041
02:26:23,580 --> 02:26:27,000
previously we will associate the creeden

2042
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:28,859
show of the variable Creed with our

2043
02:26:28,859 --> 02:26:30,000
dancehalls that we use this command

2044
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:31,500
there it will make a little dad for where we

2045
02:26:31,500 --> 02:26:32,939
can type

2046
02:26:32,939 --> 02:26:34,740
username password for those who are

2047
02:26:34,740 --> 02:26:36,060
back there  places if you want to

2048
02:26:36,060 --> 02:26:37,260
sit down instead of standing

2049
02:26:37,260 --> 02:26:38,939
in the door there are plenty of places in

2050
02:26:38,939 --> 02:26:40,560
front

2051
02:26:40,560 --> 02:26:41,819
[Music]

2052
02:26:41,819 --> 02:26:43,500
and then from that we move on to

2053
02:26:43,500 --> 02:26:47,660
serious things we're going we're going to roll the

2054
02:26:47,660 --> 02:26:50,460
diacentrone module so we're going to get we're going

2055
02:26:50,460 --> 02:26:53,419
we are going to use the command

2056
02:26:54,020 --> 02:26:56,819
on the server on the DC we are going to point

2057
02:26:56,819 --> 02:26:58,979
to the DC we are going to pass in

2058
02:26:58,979 --> 02:27:00,960
black parameter something that we entered in the

2059
02:27:00,960 --> 02:27:02,460
previous step we are going to look for

2060
02:27:02,460 --> 02:27:05,220
only the accounts which are enable

2061
02:27:05,220 --> 02:27:06,540
because we are not going to  start cracking

2062
02:27:06,540 --> 02:27:08,700
passwords that are bowls for

2063
02:27:08,700 --> 02:27:09,660
people who have left or things

2064
02:27:09,660 --> 02:27:11,100
like that

2065
02:27:11,100 --> 02:27:12,660
and we can after that now in a

2066
02:27:12,660 --> 02:27:15,540
file that H4 can read so very very

2067
02:27:15,540 --> 02:27:17,880
simple then from that we can roll the

2068
02:27:17,880 --> 02:27:20,640
command second time  so the almost almost the

2069
02:27:20,640 --> 02:27:22,319
same apart from the end we will

2070
02:27:22,319 --> 02:27:25,800
use the passwordy test module then

2071
02:27:25,800 --> 02:27:27,899
that what it will do is that it will

2072
02:27:27,899 --> 02:27:29,340
look at all the passwords that we have

2073
02:27:29,340 --> 02:27:31,680
already cracked are they present

2074
02:27:31,680 --> 02:27:33,120
in  our database if we cracked them

2075
02:27:33,120 --> 02:27:34,680
once we agree we will

2076
02:27:34,680 --> 02:27:37,020
crack them a second time in addition to that

2077
02:27:37,020 --> 02:27:38,520
there is something very cool in

2078
02:27:38,520 --> 02:27:41,180
this function there

2079
02:27:55,020 --> 02:27:57,260
4 accounts it is rarer

2080
02:27:57,260 --> 02:27:59,399
one of the things which is  well in the

2081
02:27:59,399 --> 02:28:00,660
when you want to do administration

2082
02:28:00,660 --> 02:28:02,220
was doctory it's to go with

2083
02:28:02,220 --> 02:28:05,280
shots so domains those who are

2084
02:28:05,280 --> 02:28:06,899
admin domains should have a

2085
02:28:06,899 --> 02:28:09,420
domain admin account those who administered

2086
02:28:09,420 --> 02:28:10,920
servers should have an

2087
02:28:10,920 --> 02:28:13,080
admin account of  servers which is

2088
02:28:13,080 --> 02:28:15,060
different and finally your

2089
02:28:15,060 --> 02:28:16,140
user account that you use every day

2090
02:28:16,140 --> 02:28:17,780
to read your emails

2091
02:28:17,780 --> 02:28:20,220
if you have the same password for

2092
02:28:20,220 --> 02:28:23,580
all these accounts there that's a good French

2093
02:28:23,580 --> 02:28:25,319
that's a purple belly there aren't really any

2094
02:28:25,319 --> 02:28:28,500
points if your  hash of my password is

2095
02:28:28,500 --> 02:28:30,720
stolen by a tool like resppender for

2096
02:28:30,720 --> 02:28:33,180
your user it can be used

2097
02:28:33,180 --> 02:28:34,979
for other accounts you have

2098
02:28:34,979 --> 02:28:37,800
so this is the function later will

2099
02:28:37,800 --> 02:28:39,800
tell you how many

2100
02:28:39,800 --> 02:28:42,600
similar Hs there are another thing obviously  if

2101
02:28:42,600 --> 02:28:43,859
it's the same user we see him

2102
02:28:43,859 --> 02:28:45,720
asking to change it but if we have two

2103
02:28:45,720 --> 02:28:48,479
users who are the same age

2104
02:28:48,479 --> 02:28:50,340
it probably means that the

2105
02:28:50,340 --> 02:28:51,780
password even if we haven't cracked it yet

2106
02:28:51,780 --> 02:28:54,600
and easy to guess or clip  it's

2107
02:28:54,600 --> 02:28:55,740
predictive because we have two people

2108
02:28:55,740 --> 02:28:57,960
who have the same sentence so is it

2109
02:28:57,960 --> 02:28:58,680
related to our

2110
02:28:58,680 --> 02:29:00,899
company is it related to I do

2111
02:29:00,899 --> 02:29:02,280
n't know me tomorrow is the

2112
02:29:02,280 --> 02:29:03,680
World Cup  or I don't know what

2113
02:29:03,680 --> 02:29:08,340
so we can be like

2114
02:29:08,340 --> 02:29:10,500
preventing rather than curing once again

2115
02:29:10,500 --> 02:29:12,420
using

2116
02:29:12,420 --> 02:29:15,720
good judgment the other steps afterwards but here we

2117
02:29:15,720 --> 02:29:17,880
go to cracking so you will see

2118
02:29:17,880 --> 02:29:22,759
that the command that is rolled by

2119
02:29:23,160 --> 02:29:25,640
that is

2120
02:29:25,900 --> 02:29:27,500
[Music]

2121
02:29:27,500 --> 02:29:29,700
exactly  the same that had been rolled

2122
02:29:29,700 --> 02:29:34,399
by our level 4 2 at the base so H4

2123
02:29:34,399 --> 02:29:38,100
minus 1000 for the MTLM files the

2124
02:29:38,100 --> 02:29:41,100
usernames Rock You the rule dive after it

2125
02:29:41,100 --> 02:29:42,420
will roll another rose called

2126
02:29:42,420 --> 02:29:47,160
dead OBO there is Besty for NSC there is  there are a

2127
02:29:47,160 --> 02:29:50,700
lot of rules here depending on

2128
02:29:50,700 --> 02:29:52,500
your company it can be more or

2129
02:29:52,500 --> 02:29:54,560
less successful with different

2130
02:29:54,560 --> 02:29:57,600
rules finally when we are finished but we will go

2131
02:29:57,600 --> 02:30:00,439
get the file

2132
02:30:16,620 --> 02:30:18,899
we have cracked passwords we will go

2133
02:30:18,899 --> 02:30:21,500
get the information of this

2134
02:30:21,500 --> 02:30:25,080
user there  or of 16 users there

2135
02:30:25,080 --> 02:30:28,080
in our activity with properties

2136
02:30:28,080 --> 02:30:29,700
like the email of things like that that we

2137
02:30:29,700 --> 02:30:32,160
will be able to notify them we have we

2138
02:30:32,160 --> 02:30:33,240
managed to find your

2139
02:30:33,240 --> 02:30:36,200
password so you will have to change it

2140
02:30:36,200 --> 02:30:38,640
if it's been three times in three weeks

2141
02:30:38,640 --> 02:30:40,640
that the user changes the password

2142
02:30:40,640 --> 02:30:43,260
he risks having a word desk call

2143
02:30:43,260 --> 02:30:44,340
saying what is

2144
02:30:44,340 --> 02:30:46,399
happening

2145
02:30:46,399 --> 02:30:48,479
the time to have a conversation with

2146
02:30:48,479 --> 02:30:50,100
the user he is explained to him that

2147
02:30:50,100 --> 02:30:51,420
it is safe only if he  always takes the

2148
02:30:51,420 --> 02:30:53,220
same word then changes the number at the

2149
02:30:53,220 --> 02:30:54,420
end but we will find it every

2150
02:30:54,420 --> 02:30:55,740
week then every week he will

2151
02:30:55,740 --> 02:30:58,580
have to change his password

2152
02:30:59,880 --> 02:31:01,260
you will see that after a

2153
02:31:01,260 --> 02:31:03,120
while you will have fewer and fewer

2154
02:31:03,120 --> 02:31:05,160
success in cracking the passwords of

2155
02:31:05,160 --> 02:31:06,420
your users because they will have

2156
02:31:06,420 --> 02:31:08,580
chosen secure passwords

2157
02:31:08,580 --> 02:31:11,700
this is my secure password there it is

2158
02:31:11,700 --> 02:31:13,500
kept as we said we do not

2159
02:31:13,500 --> 02:31:15,600
need to change them then there it is

2160
02:31:15,600 --> 02:31:16,620
that's how this interesting

2161
02:31:16,620 --> 02:31:18,740
to go like a tick further

2162
02:31:18,740 --> 02:31:21,960
then there's a good toc from Travis palmer

2163
02:31:21,960 --> 02:31:24,540
that had been done at defqon i think

2164
02:31:24,540 --> 02:31:26,780
it was advers survive

2165
02:31:26,780 --> 02:31:29,340
on how to crack

2166
02:31:29,340 --> 02:31:31,460
15 character passwords and  more

2167
02:31:31,460 --> 02:31:34,560
for less than 500 bucks

2168
02:31:34,560 --> 02:31:35,840
so

2169
02:31:35,840 --> 02:31:40,160
then some information

2170
02:31:40,520 --> 02:31:43,620
that was done by michael graffitor

2171
02:31:43,620 --> 02:31:45,180
a year or two ago where he presents

2172
02:31:45,180 --> 02:31:46,380
other modules that weren't

2173
02:31:46,380 --> 02:31:48,420
featured in today's presentation

2174
02:31:48,420 --> 02:31:50,720


2175
02:31:51,479 --> 02:31:53,520
last year at  left secure left

2176
02:31:53,520 --> 02:31:54,600
dry sorry there was a

2177
02:31:54,600 --> 02:31:56,939
presentation on passwords one

2178
02:31:56,939 --> 02:31:58,380
of the questions that was asked of the

2179
02:31:58,380 --> 02:32:00,780
person presenting what is

2180
02:32:00,780 --> 02:32:03,120
the advice for creating a good password

2181
02:32:03,120 --> 02:32:04,439


2182
02:32:04,439 --> 02:32:05,520
so I thought that  you were going to

2183
02:32:05,520 --> 02:32:06,840
have the same question so i put it

2184
02:32:06,840 --> 02:32:08,880
in the presentation

2185
02:32:08,880 --> 02:32:10,380
so for me there are two types of

2186
02:32:10,380 --> 02:32:12,180
password there is the password that you

2187
02:32:12,180 --> 02:32:14,300
use that you type on a machine

2188
02:32:14,300 --> 02:32:16,200
there is the password  that you will

2189
02:32:16,200 --> 02:32:19,080
ever type for your service accounts

2190
02:32:19,080 --> 02:32:21,180
for service accounts 64

2191
02:32:21,180 --> 02:32:24,000
characters randomly generated by a

2192
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:27,660
tool and story in a password manager

2193
02:32:27,660 --> 02:32:30,540
for the passwords you type i call

2194
02:32:30,540 --> 02:32:33,200
that dressing the password

2195
02:32:33,200 --> 02:32:35,819
what is it  what I mean by that we are going to

2196
02:32:35,819 --> 02:32:38,060
take a phase here

2197
02:32:38,060 --> 02:32:41,280
we are going to add two and four

2198
02:32:41,280 --> 02:32:43,680
characters at the beginning and at the end so

2199
02:32:43,680 --> 02:32:45,540
already here there if we put two then it is

2200
02:32:45,540 --> 02:32:47,960
still easy to remember

2201
02:32:47,960 --> 02:32:50,120
at the end

2202
02:32:50,120 --> 02:32:53,100
we have just  add 8 characters to

2203
02:32:53,100 --> 02:32:55,580
our password the phrase

2204
02:32:55,580 --> 02:32:58,080
I don't think so firstly it's typed

2205
02:32:58,080 --> 02:32:59,880
very quickly on a keyboard secondly

2206
02:32:59,880 --> 02:33:02,399
it's very hard to forget so if we have a

2207
02:33:02,399 --> 02:33:06,019
37-character password

2208
02:33:06,960 --> 02:33:08,100
how long do you think it

2209
02:33:08,100 --> 02:33:11,120
takes a  password of 17 37 characters

2210
02:33:11,120 --> 02:33:15,000
september 17 year decision no

2211
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:16,500
idea what a september year decision is

2212
02:33:16,500 --> 02:33:18,060
but it's even longer than

2213
02:33:18,060 --> 02:33:19,740
what we had earlier

2214
02:33:19,740 --> 02:33:22,920
another thing like you are so in

2215
02:33:22,920 --> 02:33:25,800
this room the songs to  part Brian

2216
02:33:25,800 --> 02:33:28,800
you speak French very well so

2217
02:33:28,800 --> 02:33:31,859
use your mother tongue in

2218
02:33:31,859 --> 02:33:34,140


2219
02:33:34,140 --> 02:33:36,240
password cracking dictionaries it's almost just

2220
02:33:36,240 --> 02:33:38,040
words in English there are there are

2221
02:33:38,040 --> 02:33:39,420
languages ​​that have dictions there are

2222
02:33:39,420 --> 02:33:41,399
languages  who don't even have a

2223
02:33:41,399 --> 02:33:42,200
dictionary

2224
02:33:42,200 --> 02:33:44,580
I've never seen a Romanian dictionary

2225
02:33:44,580 --> 02:33:46,200
for example but there may be one

2226
02:33:46,200 --> 02:33:49,500
but I haven't seen one so here we

2227
02:33:49,500 --> 02:33:51,780
still have the password

2228
02:33:51,780 --> 02:33:54,780
fear leads to anger  which is a line

2229
02:33:54,780 --> 02:33:56,280
from Yoda this is for those who had

2230
02:33:56,280 --> 02:33:58,020
n't noticed

2231
02:33:58,020 --> 02:34:00,660
and an interesting fact here is that neither

2232
02:34:00,660 --> 02:34:04,800
the words anger nor even are present

2233
02:34:04,800 --> 02:34:05,720
in

2234
02:34:05,720 --> 02:34:09,380
Rock You point

2235
02:34:10,260 --> 02:34:12,060
so just to see how many years it

2236
02:34:12,060 --> 02:34:13,880
was taking here  we are talking about

2237
02:34:13,880 --> 02:34:16,979
900 million years so it's

2238
02:34:16,979 --> 02:34:20,279
still quite long I imagine

2239
02:34:20,640 --> 02:34:22,140
as I saw that there were not the words

2240
02:34:22,140 --> 02:34:26,420
even and anger in the Rocky file

2241
02:34:26,420 --> 02:34:29,580
it brought me another question

2242
02:34:29,580 --> 02:34:32,819
so how many there  is there a CD with an

2243
02:34:32,819 --> 02:34:36,420
acute accent on the S there that we have in Slovak with a

2244
02:34:36,420 --> 02:34:39,960
German double S or an

2245
02:34:39,960 --> 02:34:42,240
upside-down exclamation in rock you

2246
02:34:42,240 --> 02:34:44,939
the one we are I was very surprised

2247
02:34:44,939 --> 02:34:46,560
but the one who l  most often it's

2248
02:34:46,560 --> 02:34:51,260
the CD with 800 words that have a CCD

2249
02:34:51,260 --> 02:34:53,640
then from that we go to the acute accent

2250
02:34:53,640 --> 02:34:55,920
which is much less surprising to me in my

2251
02:34:55,920 --> 02:34:58,040
opinion but we are still at 500 less

2252
02:34:58,040 --> 02:35:01,979
the German double s 65

2253
02:35:01,979 --> 02:35:08,160
no sorry 70  the S with Slovak 65 then

2254
02:35:08,160 --> 02:35:10,560
almost 90 with the exclamation upside down

2255
02:35:10,560 --> 02:35:12,260
which is more or less surprising

2256
02:35:12,260 --> 02:35:13,979
because it is still used

2257
02:35:13,979 --> 02:35:17,340
a lot there in Hispanic languages

2258
02:35:17,340 --> 02:35:21,240
to compare the letter A it is there

2259
02:35:21,240 --> 02:35:25,380
9.5 million times no  9.5 million

2260
02:35:25,380 --> 02:35:27,858
password

2261
02:35:29,600 --> 02:35:33,120
ok so

2262
02:35:33,120 --> 02:35:35,700
I leave you with this little sentence

2263
02:35:35,700 --> 02:35:38,819
here against whom you want to protect

2264
02:35:38,819 --> 02:35:41,880
your network against listeners or

2265
02:35:41,880 --> 02:35:44,839
against attackers

2266
02:35:47,340 --> 02:35:49,620
I have nothing against listeners but I

2267
02:35:49,620 --> 02:35:50,760
find that sometimes we have to do

2268
02:35:50,760 --> 02:35:52,439
Chinese but  it's true but I

2269
02:35:52,439 --> 02:35:54,359
find that sometimes we have to do

2270
02:35:54,359 --> 02:35:55,439
things that are a bit

2271
02:35:55,439 --> 02:35:57,780
counter-intuitive or that they do

2272
02:35:57,780 --> 02:35:58,800
n't even know why they are asking us

2273
02:35:58,800 --> 02:36:01,979
things so the goal here is to

2274
02:36:01,979 --> 02:36:04,080
think about saying what is  -does it

2275
02:36:04,080 --> 02:36:05,819
really change what you ask me

2276
02:36:05,819 --> 02:36:09,000
about my security posture and above all

2277
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,100
is it enough are you

2278
02:36:11,100 --> 02:36:13,660
asking me enough

2279
02:36:13,660 --> 02:36:16,800
[Music]

2280
02:36:16,800 --> 02:36:18,080
so

2281
02:36:18,080 --> 02:36:21,180
you repeat passwords MFP

2282
02:36:21,180 --> 02:36:22,680
told me authentication factor especially

2283
02:36:22,680 --> 02:36:24,780
what you have on the internet do that

2284
02:36:24,780 --> 02:36:26,000
tuesday morning

2285
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,500
use your mother tongue to

2286
02:36:28,500 --> 02:36:30,479
create passwords i was talking with

2287
02:36:30,479 --> 02:36:32,220
people there swiss people who said

2288
02:36:32,220 --> 02:36:33,500
yeah in addition to

2289
02:36:33,500 --> 02:36:35,819
writing it looks like fries

2290
02:36:35,819 --> 02:36:37,939
in your cotton water

2291
02:36:37,939 --> 02:36:41,340
you  try to crack this you're going to

2292
02:36:41,340 --> 02:36:43,740
have fun I think

2293
02:36:43,740 --> 02:36:46,200
so for those who liked the

2294
02:36:46,200 --> 02:36:48,899
presentation you can follow me on

yes

2312
02:37:34,800 --> 02:37:36,800
it is

2313
02:37:43,340 --> 02:37:46,200
depends it takes very good arguments

2314
02:37:46,200 --> 02:37:49,319
but when you present the results of the

2315
02:37:49,319 --> 02:37:51,540
cracking generally it passes under

2316
02:37:51,540 --> 02:37:53,520
it always depends on the person

2317
02:37:53,520 --> 02:37:56,460
but it can pass there it also depends

2318
02:37:56,460 --> 02:37:59,160
on who the comment comes from if it comes

2319
02:37:59,160 --> 02:38:00,380
from

2320
02:38:00,380 --> 02:38:03,359
an analysis it does not pass also  although

2321
02:38:03,359 --> 02:38:04,800
if it comes from the scissors of the company

2322
02:38:04,800 --> 02:38:07,920
so when we have the sport of scissors for

2323
02:38:07,920 --> 02:38:10,380
these decisions there it really helps better

2324
02:38:10,380 --> 02:38:13,380
so

2325
02:38:20,580 --> 02:38:22,439
what I think of what to create my

2326
02:38:22,439 --> 02:38:24,500
account

2327
02:38:25,859 --> 02:38:28,500
ok the question is what  I

2328
02:38:28,500 --> 02:38:30,060
think of choosing words at random to

2329
02:38:30,060 --> 02:38:32,819
create passwords a bit like

2330
02:38:32,819 --> 02:38:37,080
the example in Exciting Me I think

2331
02:38:37,080 --> 02:38:39,420
it's much harder to

2332
02:38:39,420 --> 02:38:41,460
remember these words than a sentence

2333
02:38:41,460 --> 02:38:43,640
that we have chosen

2334
02:38:43,640 --> 02:38:45,420
often  it just happens that it's

2335
02:38:45,420 --> 02:38:47,880
harder to type also if it works

2336
02:38:47,880 --> 02:38:49,979
for you it's not a problem i

2337
02:38:49,979 --> 02:38:51,060
just find it's harder to

2338
02:38:51,060 --> 02:38:53,359
remember

2339
02:38:53,479 --> 02:38:56,960
tomatoes or tomato potatoes

2340
02:38:56,960 --> 02:38:58,800
every day it's not really a

2341
02:38:58,800 --> 02:38:59,640
problem  but it's something we

2342
02:38:59,640 --> 02:39:02,460
use a little less often I prefer

2343
02:39:02,460 --> 02:39:06,560
the phrases that make sense to me

2344
02:39:07,020 --> 02:39:09,680
our question

2345
02:39:10,979 --> 02:39:12,420
but thank you so much for coming I hope

2346
02:39:12,420 --> 02:39:15,200
you're having a great time do
