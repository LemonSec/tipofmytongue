1
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:08,639
all right so we're about to start with

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,360
using geopolitical conflicts for

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,129
geopolitical conflicts right

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,750
fort red anthing how global awareness

5
00:00:12,129 --> 00:00:16,090
cable news surveillance where

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,440
discoveries by Kristin del Rosso so

7
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,480
she's a member of lookout red

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,339
intelligence team in San Francisco where

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,470
she runs for nation-state malware and

10
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:25,029
targeted surveillance where she recently

11
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,009
spoke at blackhat Europe on a

12
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:28,419
state-sponsored malware campaign and she

13
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:30,970
continues to work with her team to map

14
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:32,860
out attacker infrastructure and better

15
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,110
understand the actors and motives behind

16
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:38,140
these mobile threats Christina for floor

17
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:39,940
thank you okay this is in my face I'm

18
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:42,280
Kristen del Rosso I was like she said I

19
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,050
came in from San Francisco and it's my

20
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,180
first time in Canada so really excited

21
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,040
to be here and today we're gonna be

22
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,150
looking at several nation-state mobile

23
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,379
surveillance campaigns that we've

24
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,540
discovered over the years and that we've

25
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,430
been monitoring but specifically with a

26
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,980
context on the geopolitical landscape

27
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,390
that we found them in and so my goal

28
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,220
today is to give you guys a broader

29
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,470
understanding of not only what the

30
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,940
surveillance where campaigns can do but

31
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,229
how actors go about targeting their

32
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,869
victims how they've developed their

33
00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:09,039
tools over times and kind of put it in

34
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:10,450
the real-world context that the

35
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:13,450
software's being deployed and because

36
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:15,070
it's made for humans and kind of get you

37
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,270
to ask new questions when you're trying

38
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,719
to like expand your overall

39
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:22,869
understanding of these campaigns and so

40
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:24,999
this works okay a little about me at

41
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:26,770
lookout in San Francisco I actually have

42
00:01:24,999 --> 00:01:28,509
a background in history in politics but

43
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,359
I somehow I'm now reverse engineering

44
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:34,299
Android applications so different career

45
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:35,889
change and in my day to day though I get

46
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:37,840
to see a really wide variety of malware

47
00:01:35,889 --> 00:01:39,219
from like banking Trojans to adware to

48
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,649
spouse where like Eva talked about

49
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:43,719
yesterday but I focus on surveillance

50
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:45,399
where and specifically kind of building

51
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:47,439
out a larger picture behind who the

52
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:48,969
actor is who they're going after and how

53
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,548
they might be targeting them and you

54
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:53,949
know how they're spreading and one thing

55
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:55,659
that I've noticed over going through all

56
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,829
these samples is when you're start

57
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:59,289
hunting there seems to be a correlation

58
00:01:56,829 --> 00:02:00,969
between areas that have a political or a

59
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:03,189
physical conflict and the presence of

60
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:04,689
surveillance where and I think as a

61
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:06,339
researcher that's a really important

62
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:07,719
relationship to look at because

63
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,069
especially when you're looking at

64
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:11,230
surveillance where it's more than just

65
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:13,329
source code and the technical components

66
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,989
because by definition surveillance where

67
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,030
it has like an inherently human ass

68
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,200
- it's designed to target a specific

69
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,210
group of individuals for a specific

70
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,859
reason by an actor who is trying to

71
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:24,710
essentially solve like a problem or a

72
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,790
pain point by spying on them and so the

73
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,380
actor is gonna get something out of

74
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,970
being successful you know a political

75
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,970
advantage or battlefield advantage

76
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:35,150
whatever it might be and so today what

77
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:36,740
we're gonna go into is just kind of not

78
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,000
just what the malware can do but how if

79
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,070
you understand the context that it's

80
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,630
deployed in it will kind of trigger like

81
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:43,010
new questions of like oh that's why it's

82
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,150
packaged the way it is or that's who

83
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,440
they're going after that's why they

84
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,640
would use this lure document it makes

85
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,070
more sense based on the context that

86
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,140
you're finding it in and so we're gonna

87
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:53,329
give you guys a brief overview of the

88
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,440
mobile landscape because it is kind of a

89
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,310
niche thing it's not just general

90
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,410
surveillance we're but mobile

91
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,610
particularly and then the technical

92
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:02,450
components of some of these campaigns

93
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:04,130
and you know where we found them and so

94
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,750
like I said mobile surveillance where it

95
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,310
might seem like a niche area to focus on

96
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,320
specifically Android mobile surveillance

97
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,880
where but in terms of nation-state

98
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,310
attacks it's a lot more prevalent than

99
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,690
most people might think in the mobile

100
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,920
threat landscape nation-states were

101
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,270
actually some of the first actors to

102
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,399
fully adopt as platform as a threat

103
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:21,860
vector and if you combine that with the

104
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,780
fact that 80 7.5 percent of a global

105
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,130
smartphone market is Android that's a

106
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,680
really high number of potential targets

107
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:30,079
that people could reach and go after and

108
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,180
if you consider also that androids open

109
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,800
source and makes it a lot easier to

110
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,780
install third-party applications and

111
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,310
like iPhone for example it's a really

112
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,920
interesting attack vector to look at and

113
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:42,470
then also you have a lot of open source

114
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,929
Android code online you know you can

115
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:46,130
find surveillance we're on github for

116
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,480
Android phones and people tweak it all

117
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,160
the time so whether someone's copying

118
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,109
source code developing their own or

119
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,000
buying it off of someone we're seeing

120
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:54,470
nation-states as a whole not only used

121
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,370
mobile but also in conjunction with

122
00:03:54,470 --> 00:04:00,109
their traditional desktop campaigns and

123
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:01,940
why wouldn't they because if you have

124
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:03,920
access to someone's phone you have

125
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,270
access to their entire lives and if I

126
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,309
look around here how many of you don't

127
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,810
have your cell phone on you I'd say a

128
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,790
lot of you actually have it on you I

129
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,750
don't even turn mine off when it's when

130
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,160
I'm charging when I'm sleeping it's

131
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,959
always on me it's always on me and as an

132
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,070
attacker if I knew that someone was

133
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,660
gonna be carrying around this tiny

134
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,519
little box that has my pictures my

135
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,410
passwords my login and my text messages

136
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,669
my phone calls everything at all times

137
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,919
it's not leaving my side it's right

138
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:26,060
there that's what I'm gonna target it

139
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:28,609
because I'm not carrying around a

140
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,530
computer with me or a PC

141
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,659
and so what we're gonna get into today

142
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:35,030
kind of like three different campaigns

143
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:37,580
for kind of but so the first one is

144
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:39,409
SilverHawk this is a malware family that

145
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,849
we found targeting anti-assad dissidents

146
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:43,490
in Syria

147
00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:45,770
secondly in the Middle East same region

148
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,449
in VIPRE rat that was targeting members

149
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,948
of the Israeli Defense Force and on the

150
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:50,719
opposite end we have frozen cell and

151
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:53,360
desert scorpion two families that we're

152
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:55,759
targeting Palestinians and then finally

153
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,580
we have accessory em rat which is a

154
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,960
Chinese mobile rat that was targeting

155
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,938
democracy activists in China

156
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,128
and so hopefully by going through these

157
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:05,719
you'll see not just technically what

158
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:06,860
they do but also like how it ties in to

159
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:08,750
the landscape where we found them and

160
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,159
just get a broader because I know some

161
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,689
people stop by just reversing and

162
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:13,069
figuring out what the code does but my

163
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:16,330
job is to build out the larger picture

164
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:17,599
and this is kind of how we do it so

165
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,609
SilverHawk

166
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:21,110
this is an ongoing campaign we're still

167
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,729
getting new samples for it but we

168
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:26,240
initially discovered it in October of

169
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:27,919
2017 um after a little bit of digging it

170
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,779
became clear that it was targeted

171
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,938
surveillance where custom tooling and

172
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:33,889
I'll get into what those indicators were

173
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:35,839
in a little bit but first just to kind

174
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:37,789
of set the stage I want to go into its

175
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,650
technical capabilities of what it can do

176
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:41,419
as surveillance aware because all the

177
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:43,039
families we're looking at today have

178
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:45,318
basically the same capabilities because

179
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,878
it spies on you that's what it does but

180
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:49,639
just how sophisticated it's built out is

181
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,259
a little different and so in terms of

182
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:53,089
SilverHawk I'm not going to read them

183
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:55,039
all off for you guys but some of the key

184
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:57,500
ones that stand out is the ability to

185
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,089
remotely record audio so if I'm an

186
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,009
attacker and I have compromised your

187
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:02,300
device and I can just decide to turn the

188
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:04,310
microphone on and off whenever I want

189
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,529
especially in these you know tense

190
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,000
situations or warzone situations they're

191
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:08,870
gonna be talking likely about something

192
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,009
that's more interesting than like the

193
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,110
weather or what's happening for dinner

194
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:13,789
so if a target has their device on them

195
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,610
you can use drop when you don't even

196
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:18,259
have to be there same thing with the

197
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,330
ability to take photos remotely activate

198
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:21,949
the camera take pictures take videos not

199
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,089
only that but access all the files and

200
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:24,500
photos that are already on the device

201
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:26,659
and send it back to the command control

202
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,810
servers as well as exfiltrate your call

203
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:30,409
logs your contacts your text messages

204
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,460
SilverHawk was actually kind of

205
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:33,680
interesting because it also had a

206
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,330
survival counter built-in where every

207
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,940
time it would check to see if it could

208
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,289
access the c2 server it had up to two so

209
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,070
it would try twice and if a fail dude

210
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:41,659
reset just be

211
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,530
because it would drain battery life and

212
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,080
it didn't want to give away the fact

213
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,099
that I was on the phone and so that was

214
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,820
a way to make sure it wouldn't keep

215
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,960
draining the users battery life but so

216
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,969
it has access to all this wonderful

217
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,710
information but it has to send it back

218
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,540
somehow to the servers and so this is a

219
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:59,479
packet capture of one of advices that

220
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:01,010
had SilverHawk on it um and you know you

221
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,500
can see it's going back to an IP address

222
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:05,180
with a set port which was in plain text

223
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,440
in the source code because SilverHawk

224
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,140
didn't really have any obfuscation

225
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,480
efforts but interestingly about it it

226
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:14,539
had a command so here it's command 17

227
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,680
and we see this a lot and different

228
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,060
types of surveillance families they have

229
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,030
different command lists that they can do

230
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:22,460
but 17 here for example has device

231
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:24,530
information so the IMEI the sim the

232
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:27,109
mobile carrier will send all that

233
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:29,989
information back and the other commands

234
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:31,880
it might have all line up with the

235
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,720
capabilities of the malware but it's

236
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,490
kind of good when you're analyzing

237
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,410
malware family and tracking it's like

238
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,210
evolution over time because you can see

239
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:39,350
if it had ten capabilities when you

240
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,599
first started and then all of a sudden

241
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,460
next year it has 15 it's easy jumping

242
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,780
off point you can see what's changed and

243
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:48,229
so with SilverHawk we kind of are just

244
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:50,299
mapping out its commands as well but so

245
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:52,010
now we know what it does and kind of how

246
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,020
it sends all that information back but

247
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:55,760
if we go back to when we were talking

248
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,169
about we knew from some investigation

249
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,420
like that it was kind of a targeted

250
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,710
surveillance where what could the

251
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,300
location we found it and tell us about

252
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,700
who it might be targeting or how I might

253
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,710
go infect those people and so I'm sure

254
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,150
many of you guys are aware serious in

255
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:10,700
the middle of a civil war it's been in a

256
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:12,250
civil war since 2011 and there was

257
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,210
decades of political stress before that

258
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,860
so there's a struggle between the

259
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:18,590
current dictator bashar al-assad and

260
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:20,780
those who are against him and so off the

261
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:22,039
bat along with a huge amount of national

262
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,940
international interest in the area as

263
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,110
well it seems like there would be

264
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,960
surveillance campaigns going on there

265
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:28,610
and if we look at the past there were a

266
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,950
lot of digital suppression efforts there

267
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:32,240
heavy digital censorship the regime was

268
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,950
known for shutting off the internet

269
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,490
censoring social media blocking social

270
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:39,320
media sites and in 2014 they were even

271
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,930
listed as an enemy of the internet by

272
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,390
reporters without borders

273
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:45,579
it's 177th out of 180 on the World Press

274
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:48,069
Freedom Index and so that's between

275
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:50,440
China at 176 and North Korea at 180 just

276
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,060
to give you some reference there and so

277
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,350
this is something I think you need to

278
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,520
look at because it creates this

279
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,380
environment where people are already

280
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,610
aware that they are potentially being

281
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,839
monitored or can't fully express

282
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:01,120
themselves usually how they might like

283
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:02,620
to and it's no surprise that they might

284
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:07,660
be looking for an alternate or like a

285
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:09,310
secure means of communication and so

286
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,899
with SilverHawk it made sense then it

287
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:12,430
had a variety of packaging's

288
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:14,260
and different applications on it

289
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:15,939
masqueraded us but a lot of them were

290
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:18,160
for applications for secure

291
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:20,320
communication and so it would have

292
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,360
titles like chat privacy chat secure alt

293
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,190
emit whatsapp upgrade or whatsapp crypt

294
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,680
telegram like these known secure

295
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:27,820
messaging applications and that makes

296
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,199
sense because it's kind of like the pure

297
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,910
like the perfect way to entice someone

298
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,290
who's worried that rebelling you know

299
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:34,719
this is something I can use to be safe

300
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:36,550
and so we know how the actors then

301
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,600
packaging it and going about targeting

302
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,589
them but the next tip is how do you

303
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,830
actually get them to download this

304
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:43,660
malware onto their phones and so what

305
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:45,070
we've seen is mo for a lot of people who

306
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,990
create targeted surveillance right like

307
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:48,700
this so it tools like this if they're

308
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,920
not using exploits which in this case

309
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:52,270
SilverHawk wasn't they'll fall back to

310
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,920
setting up watering hole sites so

311
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,720
basically these fake sites where you can

312
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,250
convince people to download malware off

313
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,050
of there because this is what they're

314
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,860
offering and what we saw that they did

315
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,449
is they actually made a really

316
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,910
convincing version of the Guardian

317
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,990
project strat secure webpage with

318
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:08,079
download instructions and everything

319
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,529
they had it for download there it's all

320
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,390
on there

321
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:13,000
but we also found out that they were

322
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:14,439
posting links to malicious downloads and

323
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,709
Facebook pages that would have been of

324
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:20,080
interest to Syrian rebels and so what we

325
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:21,219
did is for example here you have a page

326
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,640
for the Syrian National Democratic

327
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:26,350
Alliance anti-assad what they would do

328
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,300
is they would finish the admins of these

329
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:30,490
Facebook pages and then post as the

330
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,020
admin or as the page this is like a

331
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,890
secure means of communication or like

332
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,180
this is something you should download

333
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,770
and we found that they were posting

334
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,779
links on like mediafire to these

335
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:40,120
malicious downloads and they all said

336
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:42,910
other phishing campaigns as well and so

337
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,920
it's kind of wartime creates this unique

338
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:46,870
opportunity to fish people or to infect

339
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,430
people because there are parts of groups

340
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,450
or they have communications with areas

341
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,489
or they'll click on things that they

342
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,050
might not usually

343
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,899
because it's of interest em or it's may

344
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:57,870
be a matter of life and death and so

345
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:59,970
that's what we saw silver not doing but

346
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,440
on that page we also found out that they

347
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,450
had a desktop component as well as

348
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,430
mobile so along with that line of slowly

349
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:07,050
enhancing this and their desktop

350
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:09,589
component was an open-source rat and J

351
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:12,750
rat and what they did is they had

352
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:14,040
malicious e exceeds as PDFs but the

353
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,570
titles that they had him as were again

354
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,069
these very click Beatty titles that

355
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,779
people would be interested in perhaps so

356
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,820
exchange of prisoners or like

357
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:24,120
geolocation coordinates or information

358
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:25,560
about a bombing things that would be of

359
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,730
interest to rebels or people fighting

360
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:32,939
this war and so from the outset though

361
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:35,399
we kind of had a theory of you know okay

362
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,050
it's probably one side or the other but

363
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,670
we got really lucky kind of coming full

364
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,859
circle with a campaign investigation

365
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:42,719
here they didn't properly secure all

366
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,670
their c2 servers and so we were able to

367
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,860
uncover some information like databases

368
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,719
of lists of who they were targeting why

369
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,459
they were going after them how they plan

370
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,600
to infect them you know I just want

371
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,130
their email and/or they're gonna

372
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,630
download this app or how long it took us

373
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:56,730
to infect them and these are just

374
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,260
descriptions translated of who they were

375
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,790
going after and you can see it's you

376
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,560
know a political and human rights

377
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:04,260
activist or we saw doctors or a

378
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:07,890
secretary of arms for the Depot of this

379
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:09,149
free army and so coming full circle it

380
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,529
was just kind of a good way to confirm

381
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:12,180
our theories but also get a better

382
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:13,740
understanding of the area of this is

383
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,589
what's going on and this is how they're

384
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:19,440
going to go about targeting those people

385
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:21,540
and so in the same region of the world

386
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,579
we also had Viper rat

387
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,260
and so this was deployed against members

388
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:28,319
of the Israeli Defence Force or the IDF

389
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:29,399
and in this area you know it's kind of

390
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,529
one of the longest-running conflicts

391
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:32,670
regions in the world but Israel's

392
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:34,110
interesting because it's also proven to

393
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:38,189
be a leader in the cybersecurity space

394
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:39,390
they have wonderful technology but so

395
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,950
this is an interesting thing to look at

396
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:44,399
because how do you successfully target a

397
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:45,779
group like the IDF who they have unit

398
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,310
8200 which is one of the most

399
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:49,439
sophisticated cyber units in the world

400
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,609
I've spoken with friends in the idea if

401
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,230
they have monthly if not weekly

402
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,640
trainings on cyber awareness they're

403
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,140
aware their target they could be hacked

404
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,370
they're given basic security training

405
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,589
like don't talk to strangers online

406
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:00,480
don't download things like this so

407
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:02,160
compared to perhaps like a doctor or

408
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,430
like a citizen in Syria who might not

409
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,930
even be aware that they're being

410
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,729
targeted you know you would think that

411
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:08,649
it might be a little harder to

412
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:10,089
compromise them and so that office about

413
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:11,980
gets me to ask some different questions

414
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:13,720
of does the malware need to be more

415
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,890
sophisticated perhaps or are they gonna

416
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,570
have to have any lower documents or how

417
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:20,439
are they going to go about compromising

418
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:22,000
these people and so for vipre at these

419
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,520
are the packaging dates of the samples

420
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,880
that we had it first came out in 2015

421
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:31,899
but wasn't really used and targeted

422
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:33,430
attacks until 2016 early 2017 um it was

423
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:34,270
more sophisticated in the silverhawk and

424
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:36,430
it was interesting because we actually

425
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:38,230
got her to watch it evolve over time so

426
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:41,079
like it's most sophisticated stage at

427
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:42,520
twenty eighteen and I think its

428
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,560
sophistication might have helped play a

429
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,910
part in its success because I'll get

430
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,619
into this you don't need to have the

431
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,180
most complex malware to be successful

432
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,670
but depending on the target you're going

433
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:54,099
after it can definitely help because of

434
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:56,800
just how you get them to entice it or to

435
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,760
download it and so VIPRE OTT was

436
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,709
interesting because it was a Tuesday

437
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,080
Joplin or a two-stage malware family

438
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:03,969
where the first stage you download an

439
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,890
app that looks totally benign does basic

440
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:07,209
device profiling and on certain

441
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,709
conditions it'll attempt to download a

442
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:11,709
more robust surveillance web component

443
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:13,540
and the second component was packages as

444
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:15,400
things like system update VIPRE update

445
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,020
whatsapp updates to try and Li blend in

446
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,089
on your phone but where they took it a

447
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:21,819
step further was instead of a generic

448
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:23,740
system update which they had they would

449
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,000
query of his vibrance Talde on this

450
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,380
phone if it's installed on this phone

451
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,450
install the package titled a viper

452
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,920
update same with whatsapp and if it

453
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,660
wasn't on there then you know they would

454
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,770
go to generic system update but I think

455
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,959
it's also interesting to look at kind of

456
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:38,500
thinking a step ahead trying to blend in

457
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:41,560
the best you can um and again similar

458
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,390
capabilities to Syria to SilverHawk but

459
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,800
what they also did was you know you get

460
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:47,949
your browser search history on your

461
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,050
browser bookmarks they were you know

462
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:52,390
phone calls metadata everything you have

463
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:53,859
there but also in terms of how they were

464
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,420
posting information out to the command

465
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:57,430
control servers there was a little more

466
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,900
complex because they were compressing

467
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:01,870
the data before they sent it out and

468
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:03,640
that kind of silverhawks didn't do and

469
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:05,350
the first thing I think of when I hear

470
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,670
compressed data is like okay it must be

471
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,620
like large files like what are you going

472
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:09,729
after to potentially have something

473
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:14,230
really large that you need to send out

474
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:15,880
and jumping into how they then actually

475
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,850
infected them it shows that no matter

476
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,740
how much training you

477
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,029
if someone if pretty girls go on the

478
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,949
internet and tell you to talk to them

479
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:23,779
that's like you're gonna get compromised

480
00:15:21,949 --> 00:15:25,790
I guess they get them to download stupid

481
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:28,069
things and so what they were doing in

482
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:30,259
the earlier samples is fake profiles men

483
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:32,930
and women would be targeting members of

484
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:35,300
the IDF chatting them up and then after

485
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:36,949
like talking for a bit being like hey um

486
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,930
you know we should go move our

487
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:40,880
conversation to this like chatroom app

488
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:43,550
or this like dating app chat thing or

489
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:46,279
whatever things called wink chat or chat

490
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:48,258
talk stuff like that um and they did

491
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:50,000
have male and female profiles and I just

492
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:51,050
think it's funny because the women were

493
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,910
more likely to realize it was a

494
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,620
catfishing attempt or something than the

495
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:57,139
men were but that's neither here nor

496
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,399
there but it kind of also makes sense it

497
00:15:57,139 --> 00:15:59,810
because the IDF does have not a

498
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,600
mandatory military service for young

499
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:03,920
adults 18 - like 25 roughly and so you

500
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,209
have people who might not want to be in

501
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,589
the army they're away from home you're

502
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:08,329
either being talked to by an attractive

503
00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:09,769
woman or the other versions that we saw

504
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:11,569
this application package in we're like a

505
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:13,850
billiards game for your phone or like a

506
00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:16,699
song player app so things that would

507
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:18,949
kind of appeal to a younger target but

508
00:16:16,699 --> 00:16:20,329
on the other side of things the more

509
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:21,800
sophisticated way that they were able to

510
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:24,529
infect people was they actually around

511
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:27,170
2018 upgraded their tooling and got into

512
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:28,160
the Google Play Store and this kind of

513
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,870
shows me that they might have been

514
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,389
changing who they're going after target

515
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,680
wise because some of the commands or

516
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:35,509
capabilities that this malware as well

517
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,040
was the ability to look for PDF

518
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:38,779
documents or Word documents on someone's

519
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,579
phone and I don't think you're gonna

520
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:42,410
have sensitive military documents really

521
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:44,750
like super high-level ones on a teen

522
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:46,610
girls phone or just join the army so

523
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,230
here you have someone who might be

524
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:50,779
security aware it's on the Google Play

525
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:52,279
Store and it's kind of maybe a different

526
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:54,050
level ranking it'll take person that

527
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:55,730
you're going after and that along with

528
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:57,229
the fact that even if you've gone

529
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,339
through security training no one expects

530
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,529
not where to be in the Play Store it

531
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:02,420
does happen but you think oh it's safe

532
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:04,220
it's been vetted you know I can download

533
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,709
this safely it has that aura of trust

534
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,429
you don't need to install a third-party

535
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:11,299
application installs you can just

536
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:12,949
one-click install it and kind of one

537
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:14,900
thing I wanted to point out is so we did

538
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:16,640
watch them evolve over time from when we

539
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,970
first saw it when it made it into Google

540
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,039
Play

541
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:21,110
these are screenshots of SilverHawk and

542
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,089
just kind of for comparison I've been

543
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:25,280
tracking this for a while and to the

544
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:26,780
point of sophistication doesn't need to

545
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,339
be super high nor did we successful

546
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,980
we've only seen the most minor changes

547
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,360
in SilverHawk

548
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,070
over the years and they're still seeing

549
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,540
success what they did they went from

550
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:36,059
hard coding and IP address and a port

551
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,230
number in it to doing like a simple

552
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:38,700
replacement thing where they took out

553
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,919
one number replace it with a pound sign

554
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,500
and you replace it so like most recently

555
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:46,049
just writing their strings backwards and

556
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:48,419
same thing so it doesn't need to be

557
00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:49,530
complex to work but I kind of I think

558
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:52,710
just might depend on who you're going

559
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:54,299
after and so we mentioned previously

560
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:56,070
that you know they've been compressing

561
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:57,270
data before they explode it out so I'm

562
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:59,040
thinking okay what are they potentially

563
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:00,870
going after is it generic surveillance

564
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,790
like general phone calls like SilverHawk

565
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:05,699
might've been going after in this case

566
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:07,620
the idea that when the people that were

567
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,660
being targeted this attacker the

568
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,280
overwhelming majority of information

569
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,860
that we saw on improperly secured

570
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,970
servers was exfil from on one so ever

571
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,320
almost 9,000 files

572
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,690
ninety seven percent of that was photos

573
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,610
from the camera and this just gave us

574
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:22,020
give us such more insight into the act

575
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:24,689
as a whole because we found visas

576
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:26,610
passports military equipment heads of

577
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:28,640
state meeting with each other just

578
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:30,600
things that you know if you teach your

579
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,830
anyone in your employees or your friends

580
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,879
whatever don't take pictures of your

581
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:36,030
visa and keep it on your phone or

582
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,169
sensitive docks like that but it kind of

583
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,780
gave us insight into what they were

584
00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:41,340
going after and also just as a whole put

585
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,960
it in the context of how valuable a

586
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,590
successful surveillance campaign can be

587
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,179
for an actor because you know you spend

588
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:49,740
so much money or the army or spies will

589
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:51,330
spent on like aerial surveillance or

590
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,710
trying to get insights into who their

591
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,899
target is and here you have just

592
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,970
everything that's on someone's phone

593
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:58,860
same with geolocation data they are

594
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:01,260
straight up telling them where the

595
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:03,030
soldiers are because and you don't need

596
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,290
to spend money and it's spying or

597
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,668
satellites to get this you have people

598
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:07,080
who don't take their phone out of their

599
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:08,520
pocket and they're just wandering around

600
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,389
and we saw them along the border and

601
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,840
then also when they were going through

602
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:15,500
Belgium then so just gives you a lot of

603
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:19,500
information in what they're going after

604
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:22,530
and so for this next kind of counter

605
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:24,350
family in this region you know we saw

606
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:26,639
that this was going against IDF forces

607
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:28,559
if something's there's multiple sizes

608
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,640
conflict in this region and so if

609
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,139
something is working for one side you

610
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,490
could potentially assume that there are

611
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,380
other campaigns for other actors going

612
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,000
on in the same region and so that's what

613
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:38,970
we saw with frozen cell and desert

614
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,890
scorpion frozen so we found her on the

615
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,810
same time mid 2017

616
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:44,250
kind of worn the simpler side and we're

617
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:46,440
actually able to connect it to the same

618
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,700
actor as desert scorpions so kind of two

619
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,740
different campaigns by the same actor

620
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,590
and I'll get into that connection in a

621
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,270
bit but it was fairly simple no major

622
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:56,820
text operation it didn't make it into

623
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:58,790
google play like desert scorpion did but

624
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:01,710
again basic surveillance tools

625
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:03,899
geolocation call records could look for

626
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:05,670
certain documents on there and just kind

627
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,500
of in terms of how they packaged it the

628
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:09,030
overwhelming majority of the apps that

629
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,250
we have that were packaged as Facebook

630
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:13,680
updater or Android setting or whatsapp

631
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:17,100
update so again kind of trying to blend

632
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:19,140
in this is just for going after here but

633
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:21,389
compared to the previous two examples we

634
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,340
didn't really get ex ville like to the

635
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:26,190
extent but the first thing that we did

636
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:29,669
get was we saw the tracking location

637
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:31,440
from you know one set one set of

638
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,730
tracking data and it gave the

639
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,850
information at first of all who they're

640
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:36,930
targeting and so from Gaza Palestine

641
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:38,040
okay good first step to see who

642
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:40,770
potentially might be targeting that

643
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,870
person but as we dug further we actually

644
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:45,750
saw that the frozen cell infrastructure

645
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:47,310
was tied to a desktop campaign it's

646
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:49,380
malware's Families known as my crop Co

647
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:50,429
and cuz first agent and that's a Palo

648
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,370
Alto and checkpoint did some good

649
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:55,920
research into that but um the desktop

650
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:58,620
portion was hosting and acting a situ

651
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:00,300
for the Android samples as well but back

652
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,949
to kind of how they were going about

653
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,960
learning people in it's the same thing

654
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:06,510
kind of how we saw with SilverHawk is

655
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,640
they had very clickbait here things that

656
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:10,020
people might want to click on and it

657
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,070
appeared to be targeting employees of

658
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,470
different palestinian government

659
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:16,080
agencies security services and people

660
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:17,700
associated with the FATA party because

661
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,990
what the attackers would do is they

662
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:22,230
would send out malicious executables

663
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:24,000
through fishing campaigns and pretend to

664
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:25,830
be individuals associated with like the

665
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,090
palestine security services or the

666
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:29,100
seventh thought a conference of the

667
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:32,129
palestinian national liberation front

668
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:33,810
and so you had files called minutes on

669
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:36,870
today's meeting or details on the

670
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:39,090
assassination of president arafat um and

671
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:40,739
again just shows how areas with this

672
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:43,350
going on you have more quick video

673
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:47,370
titles that work but connecting the two

674
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:48,719
families in early 2018 we came across a

675
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:50,399
more sophisticated two stage

676
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,140
surveillance where family same region

677
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,299
and we were able to tie the two together

678
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,009
because

679
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:57,559
Facebook profile it's a long-running

680
00:21:55,009 --> 00:21:59,149
Facebook profile and it was promoting

681
00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:01,428
desert scorpion on there by posting a

682
00:21:59,149 --> 00:22:03,408
link to Google Play for it but

683
00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:04,999
previously the profile had posted Google

684
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:06,799
Drive links to frozen cell malware and

685
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:08,629
so that along with the fact that the C

686
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,639
twos were in similar IP blocks kind of

687
00:22:08,629 --> 00:22:12,259
gave an indicator that the actors might

688
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:15,350
be the same if not developing it

689
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:17,659
together as well but how it does that

690
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:19,189
scorpion worked is it had two stages

691
00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:22,279
they got in a google play it's called

692
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:23,749
ardèche chat application but what was

693
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:25,100
interesting about this is how it

694
00:22:23,749 --> 00:22:27,559
probably bypassed a lot of dynamic

695
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:29,029
malware analysis tools is because the

696
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:30,859
victim had to first download this app

697
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:33,440
and really interact with it in order to

698
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:35,029
trigger the install of the spooky

699
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,799
surveillance for a second stage one the

700
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:39,019
second stage one was also called

701
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,249
settings and again this trend going on

702
00:22:39,019 --> 00:22:42,350
of how to actually blend in once you get

703
00:22:40,249 --> 00:22:44,749
someone to install your first stage but

704
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:47,059
interestingly the second stage also had

705
00:22:44,749 --> 00:22:51,350
a non malicious apk inside of it called

706
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:53,090
Fatah media apk and as we saw also with

707
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:55,549
frozen cell they were referencing the

708
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:57,439
Fox a political party and so this is

709
00:22:55,549 --> 00:22:59,029
kind of a good understanding of where

710
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,799
political context really helps your

711
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:01,970
research and why I think people need to

712
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,859
not just look at the source code but

713
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:06,619
read Foreign Affairs comm check your

714
00:23:03,859 --> 00:23:08,178
news every morning the FACA party its

715
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:10,129
formerly the palestinian national

716
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:11,480
liberation movement and it was the

717
00:23:10,129 --> 00:23:13,820
largest faction of the palestinian

718
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,409
liberation organization on the second

719
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:17,689
largest in the Palestinian Legislative

720
00:23:15,409 --> 00:23:20,149
Council but in 2006 they lost their

721
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:22,399
majority to Hamas and since then there's

722
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:25,219
been this conflict and they still

723
00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:26,508
haven't really reconciled and also they

724
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,220
used to be considered a terrorist group

725
00:23:26,509 --> 00:23:29,840
by Israel in the US but not anymore

726
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:32,359
because they were announced terrorism in

727
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,678
1988 but that history and that

728
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:35,119
background that context I think is

729
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,220
really necessary because off the bat

730
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:38,209
that gives me three people who might be

731
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,460
interested in targeting people

732
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:41,769
associated with the FASTA party and

733
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,749
that's important for two reasons because

734
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:47,239
one the contextualise lure documents and

735
00:23:44,749 --> 00:23:48,889
interest in the FATA party tells you who

736
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:50,869
they might be going after but it also

737
00:23:48,889 --> 00:23:52,279
brings up a problem that we're security

738
00:23:50,869 --> 00:23:54,678
researchers have a really hard time with

739
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:56,210
which is accurate attribution because in

740
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:58,279
the cyber security space there's a lot

741
00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:00,200
of false facts sometimes you don't

742
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:02,840
really ever have someone coming forward

743
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,100
me like that was me and so you need to

744
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,050
understand how to go about properly

745
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,850
attributing it and this campaign

746
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:10,129
the actor behind these in general and

747
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:12,830
the other malware they're known as a ptc

748
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:15,410
23 and several other research

749
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:18,050
organizations have claimed that this apt

750
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:20,240
is tied to Hamas is part of mosses cyber

751
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:22,520
armed and while that may or may not be

752
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,890
the case it does fit an mo theoretically

753
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:28,340
if Hamas is bent and warring with the

754
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:29,720
fighter group since 2006 and so well we

755
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,270
can say that we've seen this malware

756
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,220
appear to be tied to able to see 23 like

757
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:36,800
I'm not making any attributions because

758
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:39,020
it's hard but the context around that

759
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,669
does help you as a researcher get better

760
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,930
ideas of you know who might click on

761
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:43,250
these lures and who would benefit from

762
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:44,630
someone clicking on those lures and

763
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,980
she's kind of building a list of

764
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:51,680
potential suspects of who might be

765
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:55,940
behind it and then so finally accessor

766
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:57,440
imrat um we focused previously on

767
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:59,150
surveillance where that we found it kind

768
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,570
of like war-torn regions but that's not

769
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:04,700
the only area that you're gonna find

770
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:06,649
surveillance wherein there's new york

771
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,450
times phrased it really nicely this idea

772
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,920
of tech driven authoritarianism and

773
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:11,570
we're seeing a lot of surveillance web

774
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,490
campaigns in countries that have

775
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:15,200
authoritarian rules or dictator regimes

776
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:17,270
because as they become more

777
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,470
technologically advanced they're

778
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:20,270
starting to leverage more and more

779
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:22,790
useful surveillance where specifically

780
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,930
mobile in addition to desktop and they

781
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:25,430
can use that to keep implementing

782
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:27,500
impressive measures on their people and

783
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:30,020
so we've seen a massive growth in

784
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,970
surveillance in China not just on you

785
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,770
know like the desktop front or mobile

786
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:35,570
that we're going into just in aspects of

787
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:37,310
their social light they have a social

788
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:39,409
credit system they're monitoring ethnic

789
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:41,750
minorities they're you know they have a

790
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:43,250
history of conformity and making sure

791
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:45,140
you don't rebel or speak out against the

792
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,550
government you know the chanmin square

793
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:48,110
anniversary 30 year anniversary is

794
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:49,280
coming up next month so in like two

795
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:51,500
weeks

796
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,210
and they've made it clear that they

797
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:55,100
don't really like protests like this

798
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:56,600
it's that in mind it doesn't really come

799
00:25:55,100 --> 00:26:00,110
as a surprise that you have China

800
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:02,540
targeting private citizens who are kind

801
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:05,320
of stirring the pot and so to set the

802
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:07,220
stage for accessor imrat in 2014 a

803
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,050
Laocoon who's later acquired by

804
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:11,420
checkpoint they reported that they

805
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:13,220
noticed dissidents democracy activists

806
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:15,710
were being targeted by a malware family

807
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,029
and kind of the situation behind it Hong

808
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,979
Kong

809
00:26:16,029 --> 00:26:19,929
was demanding fully democratic elections

810
00:26:17,979 --> 00:26:22,440
instead of just getting to choose from a

811
00:26:19,929 --> 00:26:24,369
list of Beijing pre-approved candidates

812
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,570
people were protesting students were

813
00:26:24,369 --> 00:26:28,238
protesting and played a really large

814
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:29,979
role in it and that obviously drew the

815
00:26:28,239 --> 00:26:31,809
attention of the government so what

816
00:26:29,979 --> 00:26:34,779
happened was they would get messages

817
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:36,489
from an unknown whatsapp number and say

818
00:26:34,779 --> 00:26:38,200
hey check out this ad Android app

819
00:26:36,489 --> 00:26:40,029
designed by code for Hong Kong for the

820
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,769
coordination of occupy central which is

821
00:26:40,029 --> 00:26:44,440
the movement to you know do these

822
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:46,479
protests code for Hong Kong is an actual

823
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,889
group of activist coders but they had to

824
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:50,950
come out and say we did not develop an

825
00:26:47,889 --> 00:26:52,570
app for this this isn't us but when you

826
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:55,210
actually took a deeper look it was

827
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:57,249
surveillance we're not protesting half

828
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:58,809
and in comparison to other families it

829
00:26:57,249 --> 00:27:00,159
was on the more sophisticated side and

830
00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:01,719
after the user was tricked into

831
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,239
downloading it through targeted social

832
00:27:01,719 --> 00:27:06,339
engineering it there was a second

833
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:09,099
malicious apk hidden again with a handy

834
00:27:06,339 --> 00:27:10,989
android logo called system thread trying

835
00:27:09,099 --> 00:27:12,609
to help it blend into the phone but if

836
00:27:10,989 --> 00:27:14,649
you take a step back and look at why it

837
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:15,849
was presented that way if again you look

838
00:27:14,649 --> 00:27:17,559
at the context of China and where you

839
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:18,879
found it in in the history there for

840
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:20,469
years dissidents have kind of been

841
00:27:18,879 --> 00:27:21,759
concerned that their messages could have

842
00:27:20,469 --> 00:27:24,070
been intercepted or read by the Chinese

843
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:25,509
government and just last year Chinese

844
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:27,009
authorities admitted that they could and

845
00:27:25,509 --> 00:27:29,799
they were doing that for summer for some

846
00:27:27,009 --> 00:27:31,659
time you know they admitted they could

847
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:32,499
retrieve deleted WeChat messages and

848
00:27:31,659 --> 00:27:35,469
they did that when they are

849
00:27:32,499 --> 00:27:37,119
investigating a suspect in 2018 they

850
00:27:35,469 --> 00:27:39,669
passed a Chinese cybersecurity law and

851
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:41,349
that required network operators to store

852
00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:43,479
select data on servers regarding

853
00:27:41,349 --> 00:27:44,499
messages and logs for not less than six

854
00:27:43,479 --> 00:27:46,419
months and then it was up to the

855
00:27:44,499 --> 00:27:49,570
discretion afterwards and even before

856
00:27:46,419 --> 00:27:51,249
that in 2016 they had the regulation on

857
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:54,549
collecting and using electronic data as

858
00:27:51,249 --> 00:27:56,289
evidence where they said they could use

859
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:58,239
private messages and public comments on

860
00:27:56,289 --> 00:28:00,369
social media as criminal evidence

861
00:27:58,239 --> 00:28:01,479
against defendants in courts so needless

862
00:28:00,369 --> 00:28:02,978
to say if you disagree with Chinese

863
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:04,450
government there was a good reason for

864
00:28:02,979 --> 00:28:06,339
you to kind of be scared that this was

865
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:07,509
going on and there were other indicators

866
00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:09,219
that they had been messaging or

867
00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:12,249
monitoring messages for well before this

868
00:28:09,219 --> 00:28:16,029
as well so it makes sense that it would

869
00:28:12,249 --> 00:28:18,299
be packaged as this organization protest

870
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:20,619
tool instead of you know Chinese

871
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:23,889
programmed messages like WeChat where

872
00:28:20,619 --> 00:28:25,059
people would organize on and again so

873
00:28:23,889 --> 00:28:27,008
you can see the number of samples that

874
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:28,720
we found it really spiked in fall of

875
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:29,120
2014 which is when these protests were

876
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,600
happened

877
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,030
and let's not had tons of commands lots

878
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,649
and lots of commands of what it could do

879
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:37,879
so not only does it stand back packages

880
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:40,100
with like your phone information your

881
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,740
contacts or call logs but it can run

882
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,520
super user delay phone recording at a

883
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,460
later time

884
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,960
complete specific files off the device

885
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:52,550
just kind of lots of things that I can

886
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:54,320
do but unlike the other campaigns that

887
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:55,730
were looking at this one actually had an

888
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,500
iPhone component as well so we

889
00:28:55,730 --> 00:29:00,380
previously saw Android with desktop but

890
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:02,690
this was Android with iPhone and so

891
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:04,429
around the time in 2011 booming did a

892
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:07,370
report that roughly one to three phones

893
00:29:04,429 --> 00:29:09,500
in China were jailbroken and assuming

894
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:11,750
it's roughly that same statistic in 2014

895
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:13,090
you at least have a decent chance of

896
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,470
getting someone with a jailbroken iPhone

897
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:17,240
but in order for accessory not to work

898
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:19,970
the iOS device had to be jailbroken

899
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,980
Cydia had to be installed and then it

900
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:24,679
could add a repository and install the

901
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:26,330
malicious application and iOS and

902
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:27,910
Android attacks both had the same c2

903
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:30,050
server which is how it was discovered

904
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:32,780
but because China is a sophisticated

905
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:34,340
doctor with lots of resources it doesn't

906
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,870
really surprise me that they were able

907
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,350
to develop both it was just kind of a

908
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:40,280
good find

909
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:42,379
and so um we continue to research and to

910
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,820
monitor the family and we're actually

911
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:46,250
able to watch it evolve into another

912
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:47,450
family that we call it X rat and that's

913
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,530
actually my co-workers are presenting

914
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,090
off to me on that and doing a full

915
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:51,920
technical deep dive into it if you want

916
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:54,889
to watch how family's evolved over five

917
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:58,010
years and its technical capabilities so

918
00:29:54,890 --> 00:30:01,340
that's what's coming next but I think

919
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:03,110
what I've seen from all this is spying

920
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:05,510
happens in a variety of conflict zones

921
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:08,629
and so be it a place with a physical

922
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:10,010
warfare or authoritarian governments you

923
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:11,240
can really find it everywhere and what

924
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:13,129
we looked at was China for example is

925
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,240
interesting because technically the

926
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:16,850
surveillance they were doing was legal

927
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,900
because they have anti subversion laws

928
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:19,939
that can be used to prosecute

929
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,920
individuals who are wanting to protest

930
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,360
or exercise free speech and so that kind

931
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,190
of brings you into the greater issue or

932
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,559
a greater topic of lawful intercept

933
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:28,850
software and the market for it and the

934
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:30,379
kind of the role that it plays in global

935
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:32,389
surveillance where and if you think

936
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:33,740
about it nation-states are kind of like

937
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:36,230
any other business they have their pain

938
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:37,640
points and they're gonna face a builder

939
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:39,110
by decision they're either gonna create

940
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,510
their own surveillance or copy it or buy

941
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:42,260
it off someone and there are plenty of

942
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,940
businesses where

943
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:45,080
willing to take in the good money to do

944
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:47,990
that and these are several you know

945
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:50,120
finfisher dark matter and a so group I

946
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:51,799
think a lot of people here are probably

947
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,969
aware of the whatsapp exploit that was

948
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:56,330
found earlier this week and I should

949
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:59,660
attend a so group they have a history of

950
00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:01,730
you know going after people you know who

951
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:03,140
shouldn't be targeted in my opinion you

952
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:04,669
know Mexican journalists or Saudi

953
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:07,730
dissidents are most recently a human

954
00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:11,059
rights lawyer in the UK and so I think

955
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:12,260
whether an actor decides to builder by

956
00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:15,139
their own they're still going to use it

957
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:16,850
and that's where I think just because

958
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:19,340
you know not to say no one's really safe

959
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:20,449
but the geopolitical context around

960
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,949
things if you understand where people

961
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:24,020
are kind of going against the grain or

962
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:25,520
create perhaps making enemies or if you

963
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,840
see what's going on it gives you a

964
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,370
better idea of where to look at because

965
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,870
even if it's not this huge nation-state

966
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:31,639
campaign towards it they still have a

967
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:33,229
capabilities and the ability to buy

968
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,530
technology that will do the job for them

969
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:38,210
and get it done and so it's a little bit

970
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:41,678
early of a wrap-up but that was kind of

971
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:41,679
mostly all on my talk

972
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,820
you
