00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:38,260
going to talk a bit about the security

11
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:43,260
of videoconferencing systems sorry I

12
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:46,239
move a lot in stage I can't help it

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,460
well before starting the talk I want to

14
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,269
tell you two things the first one is

15
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:54,309
that I organized a talk as a story

16
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:57,910
because I liked it and I think it's

17
00:00:54,309 --> 00:01:01,209
funny and the second one is that I come

18
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:03,959
from Argentina yes I think you might

19
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:07,810
know my country but some of these things

20
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,229
may see I think you all of you knows

21
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:13,090

27
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:32,740
I couldn't bring asada with me but I did

28
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:36,369
bring canítö SaLuSa leche is that thing

29
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:39,729

31
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:50,850

32
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:50,850
some of it'll video from Argentina well

33
00:01:51,299 --> 00:02:01,750
no no I tried but Messi didn't want to

34
00:01:55,689 --> 00:02:03,788
come with me also okay well as I said

35
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:07,979
before I work as a security researcher

36
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:10,360
in Lebanon but but I also also

37
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:13,030
collaborate with an international

38
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,160
organization whose goal is to combat

39
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,840
organized

40
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:22,200
they know me as Asian storm can see the

41
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,630
pretty picture of of storm well one

42
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,119
night I was chilling at home watching

43
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:31,440
Game of Thrones not the lab the last

44
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,600
episode another one and drinking from

45
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,890
head and coke the furnace it's really

46
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:40,019
good and I suddenly received the

47
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:49,109
following message that I want to share

48
00:02:40,020 --> 00:03:00,920
with you I think is not a Kucha if it

49
00:02:49,110 --> 00:03:00,920
doesn't work it so it's just music but

50
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:16,830
well if you want I can sing the song of

51
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:21,299
Mission Impossible

52
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,299
[Music]

53
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:07,970
well so the mission the mission is to

54
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:11,520
attack the video conferencing system of

55
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:13,709
Acme corporation in order to listen and

56
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,739
listen to and record their

57
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:19,350
videoconference in which they talk about

58
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:24,780
their plans and weapons they are going

59
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:28,740
to use to conquer the world well with

60
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,070
the help of hamsters against organized

61
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,889
crime

62
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:37,200
it's another organization and we work

63
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:39,410
very close we were thinking what we

64
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:42,810
could do to complete this mission and

65
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:45,330
the first thing that we need to find out

66
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,760
is which video conferencing system they

67
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:51,210
are using in order to develop the tools

68
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:57,409
that we need to attack it and access and

69
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:57,409
access the video conferences so well

70
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:05,340
okay

71
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:09,750
the first thing we did was to look for

72
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:12,479
Acme in our friend show them and this is

73
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:15,630
real this is a real domain and it's very

74
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:18,870
funny one of the first result was Acme

75
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:22,200
dot cisco.com it was great for this

76
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:26,550
presentation so I have to show to show

77
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:29,520
you well we have scanned them this

78
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:34,800
device with nmap and we found the ports

79
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:39,960
open HTTP HTTPS and XMPP you already

80
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:42,419
know HTTP HTTPS and XMPP is a protocol

81
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,960
for instant messaging formerly known as

82
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:44,960
jabber

83
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:52,310
well it seems for the open port like

84
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:56,659
some kind of video conferencing system

85
00:05:52,310 --> 00:06:04,740
via the web because it has opened the

86
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:10,880
HTTP and an HTTP port so next we are

87
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:14,430
going to to see what

88
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:18,930
what is in in this part in HTTP and

89
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:22,800
HTTPS and in four four three we found

90
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:26,250
this this application cisco meeting up

91
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,010
it seems like some kind of some kind of

92
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:33,870
client for a cisco video conferencing

93
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:38,159
system but we didn't know what what

94
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:42,450
video conferencing system is so after

95
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:46,800
looking on the internet for a while we

96
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:49,260
come up to this so they video

97
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:54,150
conferencing system in news is I don't

98
00:06:49,260 --> 00:07:00,659
know this i okay I doesn't this commit

99
00:06:54,150 --> 00:07:03,900
in server okay so we already identified

100
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:07,010
the video conferencing system that you

101
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:11,219
are using is cisco meeting server but

102
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:14,370
what are the components that cisco

103
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:16,200
meeting server has what components we

104
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,900
could use to attack the system and

105
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:25,110
access and record the video conferences

106
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:27,719
and how is infrastructure so okay it

107
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:30,419
seems for the open port that participant

108
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,240
access to video conference using the web

109
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:35,729
browsers but mobile and desktop

110
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:40,010
applications seems like a very

111
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:45,169
interesting attack vector to so we could

112
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:48,050
we could use this to the infrastructure

113
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:53,669
Cisco meeting server could use a

114
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:56,190
dedicated device like a appliance it

115
00:07:53,669 --> 00:08:01,669
could use a virtualized environment with

116
00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:06,180
VMware or hyper-v or the private cloud

117
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:09,000
AWS so what are the components the

118
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:15,389
competing server has an API API sorry

119
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:22,920
API and the components sip and h.323

120
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:27,750
are for for signaling m4a

121
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:31,290
so over IP XMPP instant message in the

122
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:35,850
database saves the configuration

123
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:38,490
information of the color spaces a turn

124
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:40,830
allows to host a conference behind a

125
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:45,780
firewall or use not network address

126
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:48,600
translation to host the conference the

127
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:52,110
recorder is used for the automatic

128
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:55,340
recording of video conferences and the

129
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:58,230
web bridge is the component that allows

130
00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:02,010
participants to connect to the video

131
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:07,560
conference using the web browsers be a

132
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:10,800
web RTC the hamster think that this

133
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:21,150
slide is very boring so let's move on

134
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:26,699
with another one okay where RTC the

135
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:30,090
component we will focus on is the web

136
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:32,100
bridge that allows toad to connect to a

137
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:37,860
video conference through our browser

138
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:40,980
using WebRTC where T C stands forth we

139
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:43,350
have real-time communication is an open

140
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:48,360
source project that aims to incorporate

141
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:52,530
voice text and video capabilities into

142
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:57,090
rousers without install any software any

143
00:09:52,530 --> 00:10:02,220
plugin without need needing any any more

144
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:04,650
than just a browser well as you can see

145
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:08,070
in the key features that's from Cisco

146
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:10,230
meeting server anyone can show you can

147
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:12,510
join you don't need any plug-in you

148
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,470
don't need any software you can use

149
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:18,420
several roser

150
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:22,790
like almost every browser and this is

151
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:26,160
interesting you can join the conference

152
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:28,410
logging in as a user or you can show in

153
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,890
the conference as a guest that's

154
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:35,089
interesting for us to go unnoticed in in

155
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:35,090
our attack so

156
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:42,840
well we're trying to join the meeting

157
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:45,550
using this option showing meeting is for

158
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:49,560
joining the conference as a guest yes

159
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:53,380
this sign-in is for joining us a user so

160
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:57,040
they in order to join a conference we

161
00:10:53,380 --> 00:11:00,460
need a conference ID that it's a numeric

162
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:05,349
value and a Pascal that is also a

163
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:09,910
numeric value so the first thing we we

164
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:13,410
try was random values so we always try

165
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:17,290
to random values in in everything so and

166
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:20,189
we discover that the response of the

167
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:24,870
server is different if the meeting

168
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:35,860
exists or if the meeting does not exist

169
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:44,380
yes does does she surprised about this

170
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:45,880
information okay I need to explain some

171
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:49,620
configuration and the pass code before

172
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:52,450
before moving today to the attack well

173
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,880
we already know that the conference ID

174
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:57,520
is a numeric value but it can be any

175
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,439
random value it must be long to arrange

176
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,410
the specific range configured on the

177
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:10,480
server the pass code is also a numeric

178
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:13,930
value and it can contain a up to 100 no

179
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:17,050
one something I always mix up with

180
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:20,079
numbers why bad characters long dish it

181
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:24,089
long but really the users need to type

182
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:27,940
in two to join the conference so

183
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:30,820
generally they use four to six digit

184
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:37,170
passcode I never saw a passcode this

185
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:41,950
long and I will never never see one and

186
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:45,790
this is a a parameter gets access via ID

187
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:48,160
and passcode this parameter controls how

188
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:52,120
guests access video conferences

189
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:57,089
if the parameter is configured in legacy

190
00:12:52,120 --> 00:13:00,399
mode when you enter the conference ID

191
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:04,209
the server verifies just the conference

192
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:06,670
ID and not the passcode in order to

193
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:10,779
answer if the conference exists or not

194
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:14,439
or does not exist yes thus with legacy

195
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:17,380
and insecure mode the server requires to

196
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:22,000
enter both pieces of data at the same

197
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:24,759
time and verifies the conference ID and

198
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,750
the passcode before answering if the

199
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:35,740
conference exists or not this is

200
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:40,389
important for the for the attack well we

201
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:42,880
open the sap attack proxy in order to

202
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:46,920
perform a more detail analysis

203
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:53,740
I like group 2 so in this case I just

204
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:56,349
use UBB well and we discover that we

205
00:13:53,740 --> 00:14:00,189
first need to detect the valid

206
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:02,860
conference ranges yes and in order to

207
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:03,370
then list the videoconference active on

208
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:07,509
the server

209
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:12,569
well we discover that we need to make a

210
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:18,100
post request to that URL with the

211
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:23,709
conference ID you can for example you

212
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:26,560
can try with 0 0 0 1000 2000 3000 and so

213
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:32,800
on and the response of the server varies

214
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:35,589
if the range is valid or not that's the

215
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,050
response for a valid range and that's

216
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:40,120
the response for an invalid range yes

217
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:43,420
and that's the first part of the attack

218
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:46,990
we need to detect the valid conference

219
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:49,959
range on the server so we have the valid

220
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:53,829
ranges now we need to list the active

221
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:56,529
conferences on the server for that we

222
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:59,260
need to make a post request - it's the

223
00:14:56,529 --> 00:15:01,540
same URL but with different parameters

224
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:05,980
the conference ID

225
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:09,610
and a passcode but the Pascal for for

226
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:18,490
this for this test I will use a a blank

227
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:20,830
passcode in null passcode and according

228
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:27,000
the configuration of the parameter of

229
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:30,850
the last slide this this could return M

230
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:35,200
if configured in legacy mode it will

231
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:40,960
return all active conference they are

232
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:43,240
regard without if they are predicting by

233
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,860
a passcode it will return it and if they

234
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,530
are not protected by a passcode they

235
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,840
will return it too but in secure mode

236
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:52,720
because we are trying with a blank

237
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:56,620
password and the server verifies both

238
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:59,350
data before answer if the conference

239
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:01,930
exists in secure mode it will only

240
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:06,520
return the conference is not protected

241
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:09,969
by a Pascal it's it's clear yes okay

242
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:12,220
well that's the response in case of an

243
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:15,670
existent meeting and a correct and

244
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:20,860
incorrect passcode and in the other case

245
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:26,620
is this message the same as as for valid

246
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:28,720
range okay we detected they the valid

247
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:32,920
ranges and we can list the active

248
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:35,170
conferences but what if if we detected

249
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:41,410
detected conferences protected by a

250
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:46,209
Pascal okay so we started to make a test

251
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:48,939
and and we discovered that we could make

252
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:50,890
a brute-force or dictionary attack to

253
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:55,530
the Pascal remember that it's a numeric

254
00:16:50,890 --> 00:17:00,400
value so the number of combinations is

255
00:16:55,530 --> 00:17:03,510
not so it's not so big and also in

256
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:07,300
general video conferences use pascal

257
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:10,449
from four digits five digit and six

258
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:13,709
digit and i didn't see any conference

259
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:13,709
with with more than that

260
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:21,820
okay in order to do this attack we need

261
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:24,310
to make a post request to this URL with

262
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:27,399
all information of the conference that

263
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:29,950
we are going to attack we need to send

264
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,530
all these as a parameter and the pass

265
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:35,140
code the pass code will be taken by a

266
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:42,129
list generated by us a list of package

267
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:45,400
generated by us the response of the

268
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:48,310
server again is different and we can

269
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,790
tell if the pass code is wrong or if the

270
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:54,610
pass code is correct and in that case

271
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:56,920
just start the just showing you to the

272
00:17:54,610 --> 00:18:00,159
video conference and and start all the

273
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:08,710
negotiation you need to you need to join

274
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:14,500
it okay we send them an ability report

275
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:17,320
to Cisco and I started to write the to

276
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:19,990
develop their proof of concept because

277
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:30,100
it's very report things with the proof

278
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:35,530
of concept Cisco last November publish

279
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:40,020
this Advisory the CV is that and and

280
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:48,730
that's the Cisco Val back ID and

281
00:18:40,020 --> 00:19:00,310
underscore so from version 2.5 point 0

282
00:18:48,730 --> 00:19:02,350
the issue is solved yes I itself and I

283
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:04,780
developed two tools for the

284
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:08,919
proof-of-concept the first one mid

285
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:11,050
finder it's a Python tool that lists all

286
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:13,180
the active conferences on a Cisco

287
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:16,930
meeting server and the second tool is

288
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:20,020
called mid break and is used to perform

289
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:23,190
the attack on the pass code it performs

290
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:27,750
the brute force or the dictionary attack

291
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:27,750
to the pass codes of the conference

292
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:38,820
well oh sorry

293
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:41,820
okay well this is a Python code fragment

294
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:44,309
for mid finder the first function is

295
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:47,250
used to detect the valid range is the

296
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:51,149
valid conference ranges we use a a sync

297
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:57,080
i/o and a or HTTP because we need to

298
00:19:51,150 --> 00:20:00,090
send multiple simultaneous post requests

299
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:06,830
the second function is used to detect a

300
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:09,959
valid conference IDs and this is metric

301
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:13,799
the first function is used to test the

302
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:17,570
Pascal's and it's called from and a

303
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:20,549
single loop and the Pascal's are

304
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:26,970
obtained from a file

305
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:29,639
pinch txt that is contains all the

306
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:37,970
possible pass code with four five and

307
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:42,870
six - Eden and we we develop that well

308
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:46,710
and now I let's see the videos of the of

309
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:50,340
the tool work in order to use mid finer

310
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:54,559
we just need the URL of the cisco

311
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:54,559
meeting server to attack is its justice

312
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:04,020
the tool at first is trying to attack

313
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:08,639
the Valley Conference ranges it detected

314
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:23,690
a range I so sorry sorry I got excited

315
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:32,330
and now that's not the one now yes

316
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:38,300
I will not touch this okay until the

317
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:41,090
video is finished okay now it's trying

318
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:45,500
to detect the active conferences within

319
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:48,679
the range it's starting with conference

320
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:52,580
six steering it sounds interesting that

321
00:21:48,680 --> 00:22:00,850
in that conference committee also could

322
00:21:52,580 --> 00:22:00,850
be interesting conference for 1408 16

323
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:23,709
2014 2 4800 that's an intersting

324
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:23,709
27 I think that's the last one

325
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,820
yes I think that's the last one will

326
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:49,860
okay zero one and 23 well mid finder

327
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:55,049
detected a total of 12 conference calls

328
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:57,658
and 10 of these conference calls were

329
00:22:55,049 --> 00:23:00,389
protected by a passcode so we are going

330
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:01,860
to use mid break to try to obtain the

331
00:23:00,389 --> 00:23:04,740
passcode of the last conference

332
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:08,758
detective six zero zero two three

333
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:12,029
telepresence second biases I did all the

334
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:15,000
tests on honest is committing server

335
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:21,570
with consent they they allow me to to do

336
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:24,029
this all this all this test so in order

337
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:27,590
to use meet break we need the URL and

338
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:27,590
the conference ID

339
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:45,930
oh it should start one

340
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:10,599
sorry really I don't know it doesn't

341
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:10,599
work

342
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:27,959
sorry it was working a few hours but I I

343
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:32,240
can can make it work now

344
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:36,080
well trust me it works

345
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:43,169
the Pascal was zero eight eight one and

346
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:46,408
um we we now just the two sir working

347
00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:47,690
yes and we need to use them to complete

348
00:24:46,409 --> 00:24:52,860
our mission

349
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:55,379
so after executing mid finder several

350
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:59,008
times at different days and at different

351
00:24:55,379 --> 00:25:04,289
times to list the active conferences in

352
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:06,259
the in the admin server we detected a

353
00:25:04,289 --> 00:25:10,259
promising one

354
00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:13,860
the name is gone Acme world domination I

355
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:17,730
I like to show in that conference well

356
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:22,279
but look it's protected by a passcode so

357
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:22,279
we are going to need to use mid break

358
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:34,019
okay

359
00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:34,559
it seems that me trick work but let's

360
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:37,830
play a game

361
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:40,168
let's play guess the passcode game what

362
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:44,070
do you think the passcode could be I

363
00:25:40,169 --> 00:25:47,039
I'll start the passcode could be 1 3 3 7

364
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:49,980
because it's the conference ID and some

365
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:55,200
people use button know if it's not the

366
00:25:49,980 --> 00:26:05,159
Pascal so you 1 2 3 4 it's interesting

367
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:09,899
but now she he has a wine the first the

368
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:14,210
first Connie told Selita is for you ok

369
00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:16,649
yes zero zero zero this remember me of

370
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:21,740
reminds me of something

371
00:26:16,649 --> 00:26:21,739
do you yes

372
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:31,100
if if then could use zero zero zero like

373
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:34,020
eight zeros as a top secret code for

374
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:39,300
launching nuclear missiles

375
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:41,760
okay so Acme will use zero zero zero as

376
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:49,110
as a Pascal for a confidential meeting

377
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:51,990
and without problems well we already

378
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:55,500
have the conference ID and the pass code

379
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:57,630
so we so we are needing we need to show

380
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:03,870
in the conference in order to show in

381
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:10,770
the conference we will just put the the

382
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:14,879
data and it you need to select a name

383
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:18,180
but it will be any name I choose Acme

384
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:21,270
Acme B IP to avoid suspicions but it

385
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:24,660
could be Cisco's board she's committing

386
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:32,310
server guest it could be anything

387
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:35,010
yes but I I just add okay we now could

388
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:43,800
join the the conference without our

389
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:46,950
camera and microphone I hope after

390
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:50,580
shining we are able to listen to the

391
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:54,570
entire conferences and we could record

392
00:27:50,580 --> 00:28:03,300
the following audio I hope it worked I

393
00:27:54,570 --> 00:28:04,560
know it this one is not oh okay you

394
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:08,430
need to trust me

395
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:13,169
that's only it was really the design is

396
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:15,810
here it was an audio but you can an and

397
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:16,590
it was really good I I use a voice

398
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:25,919
changer

399
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:30,600
and it was really well don't worry okay

400
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:33,000
so we have only evidence we need to

401
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,929
complete this mission so mission

402
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:40,110
accomplished

403
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:42,370
the hamster is very happy and so do i so

404
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:44,740
thank you very much for for your

405
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:46,629
attention and don't forget to come and

406
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:50,980
get the Coney toes did you say leche I

407
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:56,100
will put icing in the table like like

408
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:56,100
there so thank you

409
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:05,739
I will use it now before the questions

410
00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:07,899
hahaha

411
00:29:05,739 --> 00:29:11,249
thank you so much for Allah we still

412
00:29:07,899 --> 00:29:23,049
have a few moments for questions so yes

413
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:27,729
let's take time for that all the wait

414
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:30,279
for I just want to know it was there any

415
00:29:27,729 --> 00:29:32,709
form of like brute force traveling or

416
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:36,190
was there anything of the kind

417
00:29:32,709 --> 00:29:38,679
I was there any kind of brute force

418
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:41,079
traveling like when you were guessing

419
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:45,339
the password after like five attempts

420
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:49,389
was there a delay or anything for for

421
00:29:45,339 --> 00:29:49,899
the loop with simultaneous attempts I

422
00:29:49,389 --> 00:29:53,769
tried

423
00:29:49,899 --> 00:29:58,168
now it's not very fast is like a 50

424
00:29:53,769 --> 00:29:58,169
tries single simultaneous
