1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:09,230
with that I believe I am through talking

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:12,710
to you and I am thrilled to introduce

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:15,139
our keynote this morning Eva galperin

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,940
I think she is probably someone many of

5
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:20,000
you are familiar with and I'm gonna let

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:23,349
her fully introduce herself she's a

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,730
woman who wears many hats so I think

8
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:33,650
here we go thanks a lot

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:36,560
have fun good morning thank you so much

10
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:39,050
everyone for getting up so early I have

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:41,180
come here from the west coast and I

12
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:46,370
usually go to bed around I'm gonna go

13
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:50,540
with now so if I'm not entirely awake

14
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:52,280
please understand fortunately there are

15
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:55,400
some things that I can do even in my

16
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,750
sleep and that includes being really

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:04,220
really angry about spouse we're in

18
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:06,900
stalker where so let's start by making

19
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:09,060
slides go

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,740
my name is Eva galperin and I'm the

21
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,320
director of cybersecurity at the

22
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:17,039
Electronic Frontier Foundation how many

23
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:20,160
of you here are familiar with PFF a few

24
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,950
people one or two three or four this is

25
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,830
good it saves me a lot of time I like it

26
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,080
when I don't have to explain what we do

27
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:30,600
so for those of you who don't know what

28
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,160
the Electronic Frontier Foundation is we

29
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,830
are a digital civil liberties

30
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,649
organization based out of San Francisco

31
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:39,900
and our job is to make sure that when

32
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:43,140
you go online your rights come with you

33
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:46,770
so there are a bunch of ways that we can

34
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:49,260
go about this and you know in the same

35
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,810
way that the the Internet is global and

36
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:56,070
its problems are global and they require

37
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:58,380
a fairly broad toolkit if you want to

38
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:02,309
deal with them so the the tools that we

39
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:05,190
have in our toolkit are we have lawyers

40
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:09,209
I have an entire floor of angry attack

41
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:11,400
lawyers in in the US and sometimes we

42
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:14,550
file lawsuits we do what is called

43
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,410
impact litigation the purpose of impact

44
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:18,989
litigation to protect digital civil

45
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,940
liberties is not just to file lawsuits

46
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:23,670
that protect the people who are involved

47
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:27,959
in the lawsuit but that lawsuits that

48
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:31,950
will create good precedent or get rid of

49
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:35,040
bad precedent so that's what our lawyers

50
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:36,630
are for sometimes the situation calls

51
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,920
for activists you have to get people out

52
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,959
in the streets you need to get people

53
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,049
angry they need to sign petitions they

54
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:46,700
need to wave signs around so we have an

55
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:49,980
entire floor of angry activists and then

56
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:52,738
sometimes the answer is to throw

57
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:56,810
engineers at the problem and so we also

58
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:58,930
have an entire floor of angry engineers

59
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:10,359
this

60
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:10,750
I am one such angery engineer there we

61
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:14,469
go

62
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:16,780
who has managed to mess everything up so

63
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:19,769
we also have a floor of angry engineers

64
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:23,560
I have my own team of angry engineers

65
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:25,569
called a ffs threat lab and we are

66
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,209
particularly concerned about privacy and

67
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:29,858
security for vulnerable populations all

68
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:34,109
over the world so not just like your

69
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:38,739
average user but activists journalists

70
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:43,510
women people of color LGBTQ populations

71
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:46,450
and you know people in abusive

72
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:49,298
relationships as it turns out is among

73
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:52,358
those the people that we are helping out

74
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:55,629
in threat lab when I started threat lab

75
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:57,430
i sat my people down and I said okay

76
00:03:55,629 --> 00:04:01,418
everybody pick an industry that you want

77
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:04,359
to destroy and this is the story of the

78
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:08,440
industry that I decided to destroy where

79
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:10,030
do we go from here so the first thing

80
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,500
that we need to talk about in order to

81
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,389
sort of get to the area of spouse

82
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:20,680
wearing stalker wears first we must go

83
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:26,470
back in time to 2017 or like I call it

84
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:31,750
the beforetime in 2017 I was a security

85
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:33,940
researcher I mostly did work on on apts

86
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:36,340
advanced persistent threats which is

87
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:42,250
what we call especially annoying

88
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:45,840
governments and I specialized in the

89
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:48,610
sort of you know b-team of governments

90
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:53,258
when I first started doing my work in

91
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:57,400
2011 most discussion of apts centered

92
00:04:53,259 --> 00:05:00,789
around the five eyes and China and

93
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,960
Russia and Israel and there wasn't

94
00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:03,759
really thought to be a whole lot of

95
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,900
other game in town I

96
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,460
and because these apts were particularly

97
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,779
sophisticated there was a lot of

98
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,320
research about them because their

99
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:15,969
interest

100
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:21,400
sting but around 2010 and 2011 we

101
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:30,180
started to see a rise in in lower level

102
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:34,150
apts so Vietnam Kazakhstan Lebanon

103
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,440
Mexico Saudi Arabia and these were

104
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:40,030
countries that were essentially just

105
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:42,130
buying software from it turned out

106
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:46,359
software that was often built in Western

107
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:50,050
countries like the UK and Germany and as

108
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,580
it later turns out Israel and that way

109
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,050
they didn't have to you know roll a

110
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,430
bunch of their own infrastructure they

111
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,490
didn't have to train up a whole bunch of

112
00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:00,730
their own people it was sort of like

113
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:01,990
turnkey surveillance and this was one of

114
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:04,690
the big things that we started to see

115
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:06,820
happening around around 2011 when I

116
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:09,340
started doing my security research so I

117
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:11,800
spent years publishing security research

118
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:17,280
on you know Syria and Vietnam and

119
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:23,290
Lebanon with a guy who turned out in

120
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:28,030
2017 to be a serial rapist so I got mad

121
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:31,720
I got really really angry and I didn't

122
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:35,260
know what to do and I did what most

123
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,640
angry people do on the internet when

124
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:40,810
they don't know what to do I am I

125
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:42,490
tweeted and I tweeted that if you are a

126
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,990
woman who has been sexually abused by a

127
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,030
hacker who threatened to compromise your

128
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,080
devices you can contact me and I will

129
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:50,469
make sure that they are properly

130
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:53,859
examined now the reason I sent out this

131
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:56,920
specific tweet was that I had just read

132
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:59,980
an article with an interview with one of

133
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:02,530
this guy's victims and the journalist

134
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,720
asked the ask the victim whoa what took

135
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:06,489
you so long to come forward why why did

136
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,190
you spend you know years not telling

137
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:12,790
anybody that you'd been raped by this

138
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:14,469
guy and she said I mean never mind that

139
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:16,900
this is some like stupid victim-blaming

140
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:19,210
but what she said was he was a hacker

141
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,979
and he threatened to compromise my

142
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:22,859
devices I was really worried about what

143
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:25,050
he was going to do to me

144
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,060
and I was so mad and I didn't want

145
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:31,490
anybody to ever feel that way again

146
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:36,210
hence tweeting what I did not foresee

147
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:39,259
was this at nine thousand four hundred

148
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:41,758
and eighty three sixty three retweets

149
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:45,810
sixteen thousand three hundred and

150
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:49,050
thirty nine likes so that kind of went

151
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:51,840
viral I and it would go viral once every

152
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:54,300
few months so it would it would make the

153
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,789
rounds on Facebook it made the rounds on

154
00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:00,990
tumblr before the great porn band and

155
00:07:56,789 --> 00:08:05,460
now tumblr is just tumbleweeds and so I

156
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:07,139
would get messages all the time and I

157
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:10,620
was swamped I was getting somewhere

158
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:13,199
between zero and a dozen contacts a day

159
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,860
depending on whether or not by this

160
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:19,379
message was currently going viral and

161
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:22,680
every day I would go into my inbox and I

162
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:24,210
would have a dozen stories of people

163
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,839
telling me about the worst thing that

164
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:31,109
ever happened to them the victims were

165
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:33,149
mostly women abusers were mostly men but

166
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:36,959
I also dealt with cases of women abusing

167
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:40,549
men and of abusive same-sex couples one

168
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:43,679
man who came to me had been outed as gay

169
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:46,880
by his by his former boyfriend who is

170
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:51,420
extremely conservative Korean family

171
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:53,760
which was super upsetting so I saw many

172
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:59,269
different kinds of abuse and it was

173
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:01,230
really disturbing but for the most part

174
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:03,410
these people who thought that their

175
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:06,320
devices had been compromised were wrong

176
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:09,420
most people didn't need forensics

177
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,430
sometimes they were the victims of a

178
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:14,279
scam I don't know how many of you had

179
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:16,739
seen the email scam emails going around

180
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:20,459
saying I have you know I installed a

181
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:22,709
malware on your computer and I have seen

182
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:25,979
you looking at porn and masturbating

183
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:28,380
through your you know through your

184
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,910
computer and I have recorded this and

185
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:34,319
I'm going to send it out to all of your

186
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:35,819
contacts you bad bad person you so this

187
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:36,360
was making the rounds and I got a lot of

188
00:09:35,819 --> 00:09:38,939
people come

189
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,959
to me saying I got this email and I

190
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:46,680
could tell them you know this is a scam

191
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:49,229
done sometimes it was not a scam but

192
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:52,739
most often it was a account compromise

193
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:54,420
so people had their their email accounts

194
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,100
compromised their Google drive's

195
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,899
compromised their Facebook accounts

196
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:01,190
compromised their Twitter accounts

197
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:04,320
compromised snapchat Instagram whatsapp

198
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:06,990
Apple IDs everything you could think of

199
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:10,050
it somebody has somebody has compromised

200
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:13,380
it and now they have pictures or are

201
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:18,199
sending messages or in some other way

202
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:22,290
harassing a person and for me this is

203
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,880
actually kind of good news because we

204
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:26,670
can do something about account

205
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:29,250
compromise we have we have solutions for

206
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:30,630
account compromise you send them to go

207
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:33,360
look at who's been logging into their

208
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:36,600
accounts you tell them get a password

209
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,790
manager use it correctly have strong

210
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,430
unique passwords use security questions

211
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:43,079
as more passwords use the highest level

212
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:45,810
of two-factor authentication that's

213
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:50,000
feasible for you so we have a lot of

214
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:53,869
answers for securing your account and

215
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:59,339
that makes my job a lot easier but

216
00:10:53,870 --> 00:11:02,730
sometimes it really is a rat and those

217
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:04,709
were the most disturbing cases I see

218
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:06,870
only a small fraction of the cases that

219
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:08,250
actually exist in the wild and this is

220
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,110
partly because the kind of person who

221
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,959
threatens to hack their victim usually

222
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:16,529
doesn't it turns out those people are

223
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,359
cowards and also lazy and the kind of

224
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:20,250
abuser who has a rat on their victims

225
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,250
device often keeps quiet about it in

226
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:26,519
order to maintain access abusers lie

227
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:28,440
about their capabilities all the time it

228
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:31,050
helps keep the victims feeling confused

229
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,570
and powerless when they don't know the

230
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:36,240
shape and the limits of their of their

231
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:38,550
abusers surveillance so it's a really

232
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,910
really powerful tool with even when it's

233
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:45,300
not being deployed but I did

234
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:48,420
occasionally see rats and those were the

235
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:50,579
most disturbing cases because those were

236
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,560
cases in which people got

237
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:55,650
they got new phones they got new

238
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,880
computers they kept switching they kept

239
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:59,579
switching accounts they kept switching

240
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,410
their passwords and evidence of

241
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:03,510
compromise kept persisting

242
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:07,620
and they didn't know how to get rid of

243
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:11,670
it so here I am getting all of these

244
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:15,150
getting all of these messages and I'm

245
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:18,390
kind of exhausted but I feel great I get

246
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:20,280
to be a hero I am Captain Marvel every

247
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:23,100
every day people come to me and they say

248
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:26,430
you're doing extremely important heroic

249
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:28,050
work I have a profile about me written

250
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:31,699
by Wired in which I'm looking off into

251
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:34,589
the distance like a thought leader and

252
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:39,560
but I'm also really tired and I don't

253
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:44,100
scale I and the hero thing is

254
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:46,640
having just one person doing forensics

255
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,500
on people's computers one at a time

256
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,840
holding their hands talking to them

257
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:54,060
about you try trying to kind of

258
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:58,080
distinguish between account compromise

259
00:12:54,060 --> 00:13:02,520
and device compromise is not scalable

260
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:06,510
it's not a good use of my time I and it

261
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:09,960
is honestly like not so great for my

262
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:12,720
mental health so the hero model feels

263
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:18,570
really good but if you're a model is

264
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:20,880
 so I'm lazy and I started

265
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:24,630
thinking about this in in a sort of more

266
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,850
EF Fe way in the same way that the

267
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:28,589
Electronic Frontier Foundation does

268
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:30,860
impact litigation I started to think

269
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:34,460
about how we could do you know some

270
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:37,200
impact activism impact engineering

271
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:41,610
punching above our weight so that it's

272
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:44,339
not just one person doing the work of of

273
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:46,950
talking to one person at a time because

274
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:49,380
even though that feels good it's dumb

275
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:53,670
so because I'm lazy I have decided to

276
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:55,170
engage in some thought leadership so I

277
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:57,569
had advice for people with compromised

278
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:59,610
accounts but the worst abuses were

279
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,200
definitely compromised devices mostly

280
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,840
Android phones running spouse we're in

281
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,910
stalker where

282
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:08,480
the spouse we're in stalker war would

283
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:12,020
hand over emails text messages whatsapp

284
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:14,840
messages photos snapchats all your

285
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:16,880
Instagram messages web browsing searches

286
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:21,680
basically having access to somebody's

287
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:25,370
phone is tempting to an abuser for the

288
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:28,069
same reason that it's tempting to a to a

289
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:29,900
state actor which is the access to

290
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:34,100
somebody's phone is the next best thing

291
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:35,900
to access to somebody's mind if you want

292
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,040
to know where someone is going what

293
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,199
they're doing what they're thinking

294
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:43,969
breaking into their phone is a pretty

295
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:46,670
damn quick way to do it and so I started

296
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:53,360
looking at the spouse we're in stalker

297
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:55,459
where industry as a whole so the good

298
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,730
news is the investigating spouse we're

299
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:01,430
in stalker where is a lot easier than

300
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:05,300
investigating a PT's a PT's don't

301
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:07,400
usually advertise on Google and because

302
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,839
this is these are all commercial

303
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,120
products

304
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,760
I had the easiest time in the world just

305
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,340
Google how do I spy on my girlfriend how

306
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:19,730
do I spy on my boyfriend how do I catch

307
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:23,900
a cheating spouse I and results come up

308
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:27,230
lots of results and so that's where I

309
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:29,930
started and I started to see the

310
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:35,120
language that they use around around

311
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:37,189
their products for example access to

312
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,930
cocoa spy gives you the lead on how to

313
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:40,370
spy on your wife with ease you don't

314
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:42,800
have to worry about where she goes who

315
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:44,420
she talks to or the websites she visits

316
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,800
I mean never mind you didn't have to

317
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:49,610
worry about those things in the first

318
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:51,439
place but this is the this is kind of

319
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:55,310
the way that they frame it you get peace

320
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,380
of mind by spying on your wife it's

321
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:58,760
totally reasonable who wouldn't want to

322
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:03,140
do that peace of mind sounds very

323
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:04,910
soothing the other way in which these

324
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:07,370
these things are frequently framed

325
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:09,589
is that a cheating cheating happens all

326
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:12,830
the time you you need to spy on your

327
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:14,250
spouse in order to to catch that no-good

328
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:17,180
man or

329
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:20,160
woman or person of your preferred gender

330
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:21,959
cheating on you what is particularly

331
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,640
interesting about this picture aside

332
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:27,390
from that it is a man holding a woman

333
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:31,199
with a black eye and possibly blood on

334
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:34,800
her face is that this this article is on

335
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:37,170
the side of the man the whole point of

336
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,979
this article is that cheating happens

337
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:40,530
all the time

338
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,540
and so what you really need to do is you

339
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:45,540
need to spy on your wife so you can

340
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:49,079
catch her and then beat her up that is

341
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:51,719
what these products are for and the way

342
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:54,720
that they often work is that you buy a

343
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,340
subscription so the first thing you do

344
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,430
is you google how am I going to catch my

345
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:03,870
cheating wife then you pay them some

346
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:05,760
money you download the the apk onto the

347
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:09,209
phone that your they are going to spy on

348
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:12,689
and then you log into a portal you buy

349
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:14,790
access to a portal which is which is run

350
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:16,800
by the company that has sold you the

351
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:18,510
product and as long as you pay your

352
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,490
subscription you have access to the

353
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:23,490
portal and therefore the contents of

354
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:26,270
whatever is going on on on the phone so

355
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:30,660
it's not just that these companies are

356
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:32,670
are possibly writing spyware or that

357
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,380
they're advertising spyware it is that

358
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:38,040
they are taking money in order to

359
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:45,510
continuously give you access to this

360
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:48,330
data and why do we think this sort of

361
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:51,780
thing is okay well there's actually sort

362
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:55,159
of a long history in in hacker culture

363
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:59,570
of of drawing a distinction between

364
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:03,380
spying on your spouse and like

365
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:07,379
nation-state attackers so this is

366
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:12,780
jean-pierre lassoo he is a French hacker

367
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:15,800
who around 2011 2012 had a project

368
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:19,290
called dark comet so dark comment was a

369
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:21,629
free rat that anybody could download and

370
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:24,720
it turned out that it was being used a

371
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:26,100
lot by at least two groups that were

372
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,940
sympathetic to

373
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:33,899
to the Assad regime in the sort of early

374
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:35,460
stages of the of the Syrian civil war so

375
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:41,250
we're starting we were starting to see

376
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:44,160
these rats being used to target people

377
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:46,080
who were opposed to Assad who would then

378
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,230
get visits from the security services

379
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,960
who would then be sent to prisons and

380
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:53,940
tortured and possibly killed so we had

381
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,789
these like very distinct links all the

382
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,710
way from this free rat to people dying

383
00:18:56,789 --> 00:19:03,270
in Syria and that was really disturbing

384
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:09,179
and jean-pierre lesser shut the project

385
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:12,900
down he basically said that he never

386
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:16,650
meant for people to use his free rat in

387
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:19,799
this way that it was not okay for it to

388
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:24,450
be used by by pro-assad regime forces

389
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:28,230
that he didn't want people in in Syria

390
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:32,100
getting hurt the wired coverage of this

391
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:34,380
was hilariously sympathetic the title of

392
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:36,899
the of the wired article that was

393
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,299
written about him was how the boy next

394
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:44,580
door accidentally built a Syrian spy

395
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:48,889
tool but the subtext behind all this is

396
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:54,090
that oh sure you can't have you know

397
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:56,400
pro-pro Syrian pro-assad people using

398
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:59,399
this to spy on on enemies of the Assad

399
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,780
regime but if some dude wants to use it

400
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,350
to spy on his cheating girlfriend that's

401
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:05,580
fine

402
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:10,230
go to town that's that's entirely legit

403
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:15,809
and for a very long time just no one

404
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:18,210
called on this attitude so how

405
00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:20,940
do you know if it's spouse where because

406
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:24,570
there's there's a lot of software out

407
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:27,030
there and sometimes it is framed as so

408
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:29,480
you run a business and you want to see

409
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:32,820
what your what your employees are doing

410
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:34,169
you give your employees a phone you want

411
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,389
to make sure that they're not you know

412
00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:37,450
doing anything illegal on it you want to

413
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:40,269
make sure that they're like

414
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:43,210
leaks from your organization you are a

415
00:20:40,269 --> 00:20:45,970
parent and you want to you want to keep

416
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:47,380
track of your child so maybe you might

417
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,850
want to use these tools so these are

418
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:52,600
these are other things that you might

419
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:57,250
want to do with with sort of tracking

420
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:59,110
software for people's phones and most of

421
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,909
these are legitimate uses so how can we

422
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:02,469
tell the difference between between

423
00:21:00,909 --> 00:21:05,309
these kinds of legitimate uses and

424
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:11,159
spouse where slash stalker where

425
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:16,059
deception I if the software is designed

426
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:18,669
to run in such a way that the user does

427
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:22,870
not see it on the device if it's meant

428
00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:24,940
to deceive the person who has the device

429
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:28,090
into thinking that there is no spyware

430
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:30,130
on the phone then that spouse where a

431
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:31,990
stalker where and we can argue about

432
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:33,820
whether or not it's illegal but I am

433
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:39,429
here to tell you that it's unethical as

434
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:40,928
hell I now this also includes situations

435
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:43,419
in which in order to install the

436
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:46,029
software you need to have the device's

437
00:21:43,419 --> 00:21:47,950
login credentials for a very long time

438
00:21:46,029 --> 00:21:49,960
companies believed that if you had

439
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:53,139
physical access to the device and you

440
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:55,630
had say the Apple ID and and the

441
00:21:53,139 --> 00:21:59,379
password then that is legitimate access

442
00:21:55,630 --> 00:22:02,649
to somebody's phone and I'm here to tell

443
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:04,750
you that that's not how abuse works it

444
00:22:02,649 --> 00:22:06,309
is extremely common in abusive

445
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:09,279
situations for the abuser to have

446
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:13,658
physical access to his partners phone

447
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:15,700
and to have the password and the

448
00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:19,809
username which they have compelled out

449
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:22,899
of out of their partner so that's really

450
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:24,668
not enough to count as legitimate access

451
00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:27,789
anymore and this is one of those cases

452
00:22:24,669 --> 00:22:31,350
in which essentially our threat modeling

453
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:33,460
is wrong we did not take into account

454
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:35,980
abusive partners in abusive situations

455
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:37,269
and we thought oh certainly there's

456
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:40,299
never going to be a case where you just

457
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:45,519
give away your password to somebody who

458
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:47,168
you know doesn't mean well so I went

459
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:49,120
ahead - you know I went up over to

460
00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:51,320
virustotal after having downloaded a

461
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:56,780
bunch of a bunch of spouse where

462
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:59,629
and I went to see you how how the

463
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:03,260
various antivirus companies treat this

464
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:04,820
software and I've discovered back in I

465
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:08,330
think that this is from a few months ago

466
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:10,780
this is from like April I discovered

467
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:14,030
that detection rates were very low

468
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:16,970
not only our detection rates quite low

469
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:20,629
but for the most part AV companies

470
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:23,510
largely ignore stalker wear and spouse

471
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:26,900
wear because it has some legitimate uses

472
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:29,990
in in their eyes here we have more

473
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:32,240
examples I believe this is a copy of the

474
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:37,730
truth spy that I was that I was looking

475
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:39,430
for and as you can see we had 10/10 AV

476
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:43,190
companies were able to detect it and

477
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:45,440
that's out of 61 so that's pretty damn

478
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:47,740
disappointing what are these security

479
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:53,360
researchers even doing with their time

480
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:55,160
so I I went to the AV industry and I am

481
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,070
managed to convince a couple of

482
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:00,620
companies to start treating spouse where

483
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:02,360
as malicious to start marking it and say

484
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:04,489
like this is spouse where this is

485
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,429
stalker where I see it on your phone

486
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:08,870
here possibly I can remove it it

487
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:11,120
shouldn't remove it automatically

488
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:13,070
because I am very much in favor of

489
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,239
making sure that the that the user is

490
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:19,100
able to make an informed decision and

491
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:23,420
also because there may be some cases

492
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:27,080
where removing the spouse where from the

493
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:29,810
phone may cause the abuser to escalate

494
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,840
to either violence or a greater violence

495
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:35,169
than they're already engaged in so I'm

496
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,850
I'm all about marking it rather than

497
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:41,660
rather than just sort of nuking it from

498
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:45,409
orbit because that decision really needs

499
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:48,380
to be made by by the victim so this is

500
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:51,890
the privacy alert that the Kaspersky put

501
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:56,600
out this is this is how they mark spouse

502
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:58,580
where and and stalker where now but not

503
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,740
everybody is down for installing

504
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:05,020
Kaspersky products on their devices for

505
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:08,450
some strange reason I and so

506
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:10,250
they were soon joined by look out look

507
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:11,840
out put out a statement that was like oh

508
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:14,750
yeah stalker where and spouts poor we've

509
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:20,590
always been doing that we we've always

510
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:23,240
been at war with with East South Asia so

511
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:25,669
lookout also does this and I'm very

512
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,440
happy that now I have alternatives we

513
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:29,030
have we have two companies that are

514
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,020
treating stalker where and spouse who

515
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:33,170
are in the way that I think that they

516
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:36,500
should be but I think that what we

517
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:37,910
really need to see is this needs to

518
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:41,420
become the new normal

519
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:42,770
there are there were what like 61

520
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:50,620
company is on virustotal

521
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:50,620
and this is - so 59 to go I'll wait here

522
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:56,750
so let's talk a little bit about what

523
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:58,040
antivirus can do because even in the

524
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:00,080
cases where these products are legal

525
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:02,540
they're unethical and AV should detect

526
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,679
them again if you should not

527
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:06,620
automatically remove them because

528
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,540
victims should have a choice there I am

529
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:11,949
worried about abusers escalating to

530
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:15,230
violence and our first duty which I have

531
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:19,520
blatantly stolen from the medical

532
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:21,530
profession is to first do no harm I am

533
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,860
very excited that both lookout and

534
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:27,770
kaspersky are doing this but there is so

535
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:29,360
much work left to do I do have AV

536
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:31,670
companies reaching out to me saying well

537
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,709
just like give me a list of all the

538
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:35,900
spouse where and then we will just you

539
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:40,240
know add it to our add it to our engine

540
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:43,310
and we will be done I and this is I

541
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,160
think not the right approach to the

542
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:48,590
problem because again once more we are

543
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:52,160
relying on the hero model where suddenly

544
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:54,080
it's my job to maintain lists of stalker

545
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:57,470
wear and spouse wear for the entire AV

546
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:00,260
industry to use I don't work for them

547
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:01,940
I'd be paid much better if I worked as a

548
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,500
Navy researcher than I do at the

549
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:06,950
Electronic Frontier Foundation a

550
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:08,870
non-for-profit organization whose money

551
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:10,790
comes entirely from 40,000 volunteers

552
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:13,159
all over the world

553
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:15,200
and so what I would really like AV

554
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:19,180
companies to do is to stay on top of it

555
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,180
themselves and do their damn jobs

556
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,720
there are also something as the Google

557
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:25,970
can do Google could do a better job of

558
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:28,549
policing the Google Playstore it is

559
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:32,649
already against Google's Terms of

560
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:35,870
Service for their Play Store to have

561
00:27:32,649 --> 00:27:39,649
software which surreptitiously spies on

562
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:43,279
you which does not appear with a like

563
00:27:39,649 --> 00:27:44,959
large icon on on your dock

564
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:49,330
showing you this is the thing which is

565
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:52,490
running on your device so having that

566
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:53,689
policed better would be a tremendous

567
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:58,629
relief to me

568
00:27:53,690 --> 00:28:02,509
and finally what can government's do

569
00:27:58,629 --> 00:28:05,860
often when I tell people about a problem

570
00:28:02,509 --> 00:28:10,129
the very first reaction that I get is

571
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:11,809
there ought to be a law now I am

572
00:28:10,129 --> 00:28:14,959
extremely skeptical if this because I

573
00:28:11,809 --> 00:28:17,570
have seen many bad laws I have seen many

574
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,230
poorly written laws used against

575
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:24,080
security researchers used against

576
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:25,909
journalists and activists and people who

577
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,928
really need to defend their privacy and

578
00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:33,230
their anonymity and their speech

579
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:35,179
generally if a law is written badly I it

580
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:37,129
is not going to get used against bad

581
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:38,720
guys it's going to get used against the

582
00:28:37,129 --> 00:28:41,750
most vulnerable populations and those

583
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,519
are the people that I protect all day so

584
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:47,299
I'm very skeptical when somebody says

585
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:49,129
there ought to be a law but it turns out

586
00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:53,539
that there are some laws and

587
00:28:49,129 --> 00:28:58,219
they already exist this is a brief list

588
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:59,570
of of US federal laws that apply which I

589
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:02,480
understand will be less interesting in

590
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:04,100
Canada but this is the when all you have

591
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,009
is a hammer problem which is to say that

592
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:11,360
my hammer is a floor of angry US lawyers

593
00:29:07,009 --> 00:29:14,990
I and so I do not have a Canadian

594
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:18,979
analysis of what laws these guys are

595
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:22,210
breaking but I in the United States they

596
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:27,379
may be violating the federal wiretapping

597
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:31,420
Act the FWA which generally prohibits

598
00:29:27,379 --> 00:29:34,330
the interception of wire oral or

599
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:36,390
Communications so if there was spying on

600
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:42,600
your on your phone calls in real time

601
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:45,100
the stored Communications Act again very

602
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:47,620
this time when the when the information

603
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,719
is stored and then you pull it down and

604
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:53,860
finally the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act

605
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:57,600
which is often used against against

606
00:29:53,860 --> 00:30:00,399
hackers and so I'm very concerned about

607
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:03,730
overzealous prosecution of people under

608
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:06,490
the CFAA but it is fairly clear that

609
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:10,330
what we're talking about here it does

610
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:17,560
violate the CFAA and it's it's

611
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:19,780
prohibition on I've totally lost it

612
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:25,240
anyway it is a violation of the CFAA and

613
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:27,129
it is bad so the federal wiretapping Act

614
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,080
prohibits the manufacture distribution

615
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:32,830
possession and advertising of certain

616
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:36,939
interception devices so it's not limited

617
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:38,770
to the developers of spyware and some

618
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:40,360
courts have held that the maker of

619
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:42,360
spyware installed on a computer used to

620
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:44,560
intercept electronic communications and

621
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,139
send them to the company's server is

622
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:49,330
itself guilty of the interception under

623
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:55,810
the FWA even though it was not the end

624
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:58,090
user and you can see the in 2014 the CEO

625
00:30:55,810 --> 00:31:01,330
of a company called stealthGenie was

626
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:05,290
indicted under USC twenty five one two

627
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:08,260
he pled guilty and was fined $500,000

628
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:11,710
another spyware software was indicted a

629
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:15,460
developer was indicted in 2005 but he

630
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:18,040
fled the country and prosecutions have

631
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:25,210
also occurred with respect to the end

632
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:27,040
users of spyware and additionally

633
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:30,700
another tool that we have at our

634
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:33,370
disposal is the FTC in 2012 the FTC

635
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:34,930
charged designer where LLC a company

636
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:37,270
that provided spyware to rent to own

637
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:39,250
computer providers and entered into a

638
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:41,320
consent to greet decree with the company

639
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:43,000
agreeing not to collect data from

640
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,050
computers without giving clear and

641
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,680
prominent notice

642
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:50,919
and obtaining affirmative consent in

643
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:54,370
2008 the FTC sued cyber spy software

644
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:56,020
which sold a keylogger program the

645
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:58,209
company entered into a consent decree

646
00:31:56,020 --> 00:32:00,010
with the FTC in 2012 and which agreed

647
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:01,900
not to promote sell or distribute

648
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:03,280
software to be installed on computers

649
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:08,010
without the knowledge or consent of the

650
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:08,010
computers owner so it can be done

651
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:17,290
additionally there are state laws in the

652
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:19,810
u.s. such as any any state wiretapping

653
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:22,960
statutes states with two-party consent

654
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:25,270
we're recording a conversation without

655
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,900
the consent of both parties is illegal

656
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:31,030
and the consumer protection against

657
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:34,870
consumer spyware Act which is sure

658
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:37,960
specific which exists in the great state

659
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:40,510
of California where I am from you may

660
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,050
ask yourself but maybe maybe I am a

661
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,970
parent

662
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:45,370
shouldn't I be allowed to spy on my

663
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:47,200
children I and while I have already

664
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:52,810
answered that earlier in the in the talk

665
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:54,910
that it's it's unethical it is kinda

666
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:57,370
legal so most courts have found that

667
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:59,140
parents may vicariously consent on

668
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:01,780
behalf of their minor children to record

669
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:03,940
their child's oral wire or electronic

670
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,770
communications which makes these

671
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:10,510
interceptions legal under the federal

672
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:13,180
wiretapping Act however this is not an

673
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:15,100
unlimited power the parent has to

674
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:18,130
demonstrate a good faith objectively

675
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:20,169
reasonable basis for believing that such

676
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:23,770
consent was necessary for the welfare of

677
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:28,750
the child so it's not like a phenomenal

678
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:30,700
cosmic power so this is sort of my my

679
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:32,290
wrap-up of all the different tools that

680
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,870
we could possibly use to solve this

681
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:38,110
problem and the last thing that I wanted

682
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:41,860
to talk about were a bunch of other

683
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:43,929
people so I didn't invent the term

684
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:45,699
spouse wear or stalker wear I think the

685
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:47,710
first use of the term that I was able to

686
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:51,970
find goes back to something like 2007

687
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:55,260
I didn't even invent doing security

688
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:57,639
research on spouse wear or stalker wear

689
00:33:55,260 --> 00:34:00,219
none of the work that I have done

690
00:33:57,639 --> 00:34:02,678
would have been possible if it was not

691
00:34:00,219 --> 00:34:07,539
for the work of people like Harlow

692
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:08,740
Holmes at the free that the freedom of

693
00:34:07,539 --> 00:34:10,839
press foundation who has been working

694
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:14,288
with with individuals on things like

695
00:34:10,839 --> 00:34:18,808
this for years the work of journalists

696
00:34:14,289 --> 00:34:22,210
at advice especially vices motherboard

697
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:24,730
blog this this blog actually has a

698
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:27,730
series called when spies come home which

699
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:32,079
is focused entirely on spouse where and

700
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:33,849
and the stalker where industry which you

701
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,139
know really saved me a lot of time and

702
00:34:33,849 --> 00:34:37,389
explaining what the hell this stuff is

703
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:40,089
and saved me an awful lot of research

704
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:43,510
and trying to find bad actors in the

705
00:34:40,089 --> 00:34:45,190
space and there are also journalists

706
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:47,500
like Thomas Brewster who works for

707
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:50,109
Forbes who has also spent a lot of time

708
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:53,069
covering the spouse we're and stalker

709
00:34:50,109 --> 00:34:56,918
we're industry so we don't do this alone

710
00:34:53,069 --> 00:34:59,470
we don't have to do it alone and the

711
00:34:56,918 --> 00:35:02,529
more people that we have looking into

712
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:06,189
the way that this stuff is being abused

713
00:35:02,529 --> 00:35:08,890
and pressuring companies to take action

714
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:11,680
the faster we can stop this kind of

715
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:14,140
abuse and we can change we can change

716
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,810
the norms around the use of spouse we're

717
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:18,180
in stalker where thank you very much

718
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:24,420
