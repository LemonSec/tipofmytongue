1
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:08,410
hello everyone I hope you had a great

2
00:00:06,069 --> 00:00:10,180
lunch so this is room two and we're

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,039
going to have a talk on what is our

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,500
ethical obligation to ship secure code

5
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:16,740
so if this not what you were expecting

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:20,740
now is a good time to head to room one

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:23,320
we will be hosted by ELISA chevensky

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,459
she's CEO of faster-than-light and she's

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,680
building developer tools

10
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,990
she purely launched everyday health

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:31,150
which was an IPO geek corpse which was

12
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:33,699
acquired and brave which was a thirty

13
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:35,710
five million ICO our focus is on

14
00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:37,660
bringing security best practices earlier

15
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,400
in the development cycle and building

16
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,819
tools to make it easier to ship secure

17
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,350
code

18
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,899
she's also the author of lean out

19
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:46,270
published by Orr books so just a few

20
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:48,970
notes before we start is going to be a

21
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:50,829
short ish presentation of 15 minutes and

22
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,420
afterwards we'll open the floor I just

23
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:53,860
like you guys to be mindful of the code

24
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,630
of conduct which was exposed this

25
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,519
morning if you have any questions about

26
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:59,290
that you can reach out to any of the

27
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,629
volunteers in the room and with that

28
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:04,899
Thank You Alyssa you have the floor yeah

29
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:09,490
thank you I'm really pleased to be here

30
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:11,590
at North sac which is as most of you

31
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:13,899
probably have seen such a special event

32
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:16,060
like a real community event an event

33
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:18,189
that brings together different points of

34
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:21,009
view and I'm really pleased to be giving

35
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:23,079
this talk in particular this is my first

36
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:25,719
time giving this talk which I made just

37
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:28,479
for this event and I think it's a little

38
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:30,999
bit unique to North SEC to be willing to

39
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,310
host this conversation and ask these

40
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:35,949
questions I think we can agree it's

41
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:38,609
pretty important right now

42
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:41,139
and I know this is a privacy conscious

43
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:44,169
audience so I want to invite you to

44
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:46,810
please tweet this talk niceness is

45
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:50,590
appreciated but it's certainly not owed

46
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:53,649
to me my handle is Elizabeth on Twitter

47
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:56,560
and I'm seeing folks tweeting under and

48
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:58,959
SEC oh I got that wrong so that'll be

49
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:05,499
wrong throughout the deck 2019 not been

50
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:08,050
SEC 1919 and so open this up and said

51
00:02:05,499 --> 00:02:11,140
quote the good place what are our

52
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:13,240
obligations to each other many reasons

53
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,559
why ethical conversations are in the air

54
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:19,459
these days not the least of which is its

55
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,770
in fusion in pop culture fit of a hats

56
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:24,890
if they're to utilitarianism what is

57
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:31,250
good what is bad what is Aristotle have

58
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:33,769
to say on all of this or better yet what

59
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:36,770
are the obligations of companies towards

60
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:39,770
users it's a better question right I

61
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:41,540
think we should ask what we're obligated

62
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,930
towards each other and that's an

63
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,760
important conversation code of conduct

64
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,620
nods towards that but really what are

65
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,620
the obligations of companies towards

66
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:54,380
users we really need to understand and

67
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,959
examine this I think about this a lot as

68
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:59,480
someone who is CEO of a company but I

69
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,730
think whether you're an employee or an

70
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,500
individual developer there's a lot to

71
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,450
think about there and certainly if

72
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,010
you're on Twitter or Facebook you've

73
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:10,480
thought about perhaps what they owe to

74
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:12,890
you I've certainly given that thought

75
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,350
there is a 100 million dollar

76
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:18,200
class-action lawsuit filed in calgary

77
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:22,100
over a massive data breach for Marriott

78
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:27,950
hotels and I thought their claim was

79
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:30,890
interesting the defendants knew or ought

80
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:33,950
to have known that their databases were

81
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:37,458
vulnerable to loss or theft how about

82
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:41,209
that maybe they are obligated because

83
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:43,600
they knew and they fail to protect

84
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:46,359
appropriately or if they didn't know

85
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:50,150
perhaps they were obligated to know

86
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:53,079
perhaps they should have known perhaps

87
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:56,690
you should know better and if you don't

88
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:58,940
and I post this question to some people

89
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:01,820
who I think of as ethical and moral

90
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,540
authorities I said what what accompanies

91
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:07,880
o us

92
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:11,358
what are they OS Terms of Service what

93
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:15,560
an answer right Terms of Service is like

94
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:18,918
the minimum possible obligation that a

95
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,769
company has to the users and clearly

96
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:24,680
there's some legal obligations there but

97
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:27,919
I mean agree view Terms few terms is

98
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,030
like do you even view the terms raise

99
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:33,289
your hand if we

100
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:36,409
Yuli returns of service I'll read them

101
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:38,060
sometimes as a curiosity like maybe I

102
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:42,800
think I'm going to go back to the

103
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:46,220
company and and complain Spotify

104
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,800
had some privacy issues that bothered me

105
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,810
and I wrote to them and had a

106
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,610
conversation and I think I read the

107
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:55,550
Terms of Service at some point in the

108
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:57,500
middle of being a customer but it's

109
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:59,330
widely understood we're not reading

110
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,180
Terms of Service much less widely

111
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:04,130
understood is that the companies can

112
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:07,910
change the terms of service and it's

113
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:12,469
retroactive right so like Terms of

114
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:18,460
Service can hardly be the barometer for

115
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:21,860
what companies owe us and what's more

116
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,719
Terms of Service isn't an ethical thing

117
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,420
right like it's just a legal obligation

118
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,070
it's the minimum legal obligation and

119
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,660
we're trying to have a conversation I'm

120
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:32,060
hoping to have a conversation today

121
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:34,610
about something beyond the minimum

122
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,260
letter of the law and my hope is someone

123
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:39,980
who runs a company is that I'm going to

124
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:44,000
do better than just the minimum and I

125
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:45,560
had promised in the top proposal to talk

126
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,390
about different schools of thought right

127
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,640
you've got constant Rawls and

128
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:52,430
utilitarianism and if anyone here really

129
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:54,020
wants to do a deep dive into frameworks

130
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,800
you know ethical frameworks and

131
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,859
foundations

132
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,290
I am professionally professionally I am

133
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:02,780
academically trained in that and I am

134
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:05,060
here to have those conversations but I

135
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:08,479
just kept coming back down so the Golden

136
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:10,760
Rule you know it was really simple to me

137
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,310
I don't want to get hacked I don't want

138
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:16,099
to get out in security people privacy

139
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:18,470
people tend to feel that about their own

140
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,960
data you don't want to get hacked and

141
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:24,650
because you care about this because it's

142
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:28,219
a value for you you want to take care of

143
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:30,169
this for other people so you know we're

144
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,420
gonna open the floor in a little bit and

145
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:35,390
I am very open to the idea that you know

146
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:37,340
maybe I've made too many assumptions

147
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:41,000
about where everyone's coming from

148
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,830
ethically but it's my guess that this is

149
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,050
the moral framework guiding a

150
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:47,870
a lot of us that you know we don't want

151
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,970
to get that so you know we feel

152
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:52,960
obligated towards that protection and

153
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:55,640
also I don't want to get hacked and I

154
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,109
imagine that the executives that these

155
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,640
companies don't want to get hacked and

156
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:00,920
so they should be doing this for me

157
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,659
right like Jack Dorsey he doesn't want

158
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,240
to be hacked and Jack Dorsey doesn't

159
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:08,240
want to be harassed and so he should be

160
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,040
able to you know make that leap and say

161
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,290
that he should do the same for the users

162
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,960
that's probably why there was a lot of

163
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:17,210
talk when Mark Zuckerberg had some

164
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,979
features that not all the users had was

165
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:21,409
like well he has these features he is

166
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,660
the ability to unsend a message so

167
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:25,370
clearly he understands that's valuable

168
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:28,430
why doesn't eat then that's everyone and

169
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:32,770
then they did to Facebook's credit they

170
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:35,930
actually do have some responsiveness so

171
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:38,960
I'm just saying that a lot of these

172
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:43,310
companies could do better and that laws

173
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:45,289
can be changed and laws aren't ethics so

174
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:47,740
what should companies be obligated to do

175
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:51,260
in terms of shipping secure code

176
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:53,720
protecting user data and responsibility

177
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,310
for their platforms and I thought that

178
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,540
this is an interesting opportunity we're

179
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:59,300
all here together we care about these

180
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:01,040
things to open it up a little bit I have

181
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,590
a story that I want to share after this

182
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:07,760
so this isn't the end of the part where

183
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:09,440
I stand up and talk but I'm gonna step

184
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,320
away from the laptop for a minute and

185
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,790
let's open this up really what do you

186
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,830
think what do you think the obligations

187
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:18,620
are what our company's obligations to be

188
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:21,260
shipping secure code clearly clearly

189
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:23,870
companies are not shipping the most

190
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,950
secure code that they could be but

191
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:30,230
they're following their Terms of Service

192
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:32,419
I don't think this is okay and if you

193
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:36,050
have opinions on this I'd really let's

194
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:38,228
hear it yep thank you if you'll say your

195
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,228
name

196
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:48,869
I'm widely known as Jay Bash from the

197
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:50,759
FBI no less okay I'm not from the I am

198
00:08:48,869 --> 00:08:52,079
not impersonating a US federal officer

199
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:54,540
which is probably illegal in Canada too

200
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:55,079
yes yes I'm glad we clarified that for

201
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,939
the record

202
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:59,069
I'm interested in why you choose to cast

203
00:08:56,939 --> 00:09:01,410
this in terms of companies if I were a

204
00:08:59,069 --> 00:09:04,199
real engineer doing real engineering and

205
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:06,990
I designed this room and it fell on

206
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:10,769
people because I screwed up I would be

207
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:13,170
personally held responsible yes so

208
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:16,949
that's the next question actually I

209
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:19,529
thank you to go to our next point um

210
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:21,508
there's there's a responsibility is that

211
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:23,970
corporations have but corporations are

212
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:25,619
just made up of people anyway and so I

213
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,869
think it can be kind of easy to look at

214
00:09:25,619 --> 00:09:29,579
companies and say well companies have

215
00:09:27,869 --> 00:09:31,199
these legal obligations but the

216
00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:32,849
decisions aren't made by companies

217
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:34,559
they're made by individuals inside the

218
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,480
companies even though those decisions

219
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:37,740
are made by you know people sitting

220
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,959
around a table it's the board of

221
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:44,399
directors it's three or five or seven or

222
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:46,138
you know some number of people and a lot

223
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,269
of us in this room are their individual

224
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:50,819
developers or pen testers we fall

225
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:53,910
somewhere along that spectrum so I think

226
00:09:50,819 --> 00:09:56,009
that's perhaps an even better question

227
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:58,589
and one that is more appropriate to

228
00:09:56,009 --> 00:10:00,269
those of us in the room as for

229
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:01,889
individual liability I don't know right

230
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:03,839
like that probably depends on the

231
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:07,410
contracts that you sign which again is a

232
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:10,410
legal question but ethically if I design

233
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:18,799
this room and it fell on people I would

234
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:18,799
feel bad so let's keep it going please

235
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:31,290
hello I'm Jeffrey Goldberg and I think

236
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:37,920
that you know just following up on that

237
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:41,400
I feel bad I've noticed that a fair

238
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,699
number of people actually do say well it

239
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:49,319
isn't illegal or what I exactly lawful

240
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:54,210
and they somehow pin their view of

241
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:57,060
what's ethical to what they can legally

242
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:59,790
do that's right I have a legal right to

243
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:04,020
be an asshole but I oh that's right

244
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:06,089
that's right and I think if there's one

245
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:08,970
point that I really have to share and

246
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:11,280
it's one that I believe is widely shared

247
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,260
in the security community but that we

248
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,380
could discuss more on top or and bring

249
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:19,080
more out into mainstream awareness it's

250
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:22,950
that tremendous difference between

251
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:26,790
what's legal and what should be and it's

252
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:29,100
legal right now for companies to ship

253
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:31,620
code knowing that it's insecure or

254
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:34,380
rather like knowing that they haven't

255
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:37,320
done everything that they could to

256
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:39,780
secure data to secure their processes

257
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,360
all of that could be legal you know and

258
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:44,880
then the marketplace you know a lot with

259
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:49,080
companies is fiduciary responsibility

260
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:51,630
and that's legal and that's very real

261
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,790
you company executives have what's known

262
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:55,470
as fiduciary duty they have to make some

263
00:11:53,790 --> 00:12:00,380
money for the companies they have to put

264
00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:03,630
making money first but you can ship

265
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:08,700
secure code and still be successful

266
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:12,930
still make money and saying it was legal

267
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:14,640
is obviously not good enough and if it

268
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:16,489
is good enough we're able to change the

269
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:19,050
laws this is in a moment right now

270
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:20,520
certainly in America maybe also in

271
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:23,160
Canada other places around the world

272
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,630
where people are making really big

273
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,640
changes in laws

274
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:28,560
I think the abortion law that people are

275
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,090
talking about in the southern states in

276
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,699
the United States is a really good

277
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:34,800
example very big legal change that's

278
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,200
happened without even a lot of support

279
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,979
necessarily and so just because

280
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,570
something is legal

281
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,790
doesn't even mean it's permanent it's

282
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:43,620
legal today what if we all decide we

283
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,589
don't want it to be legal anymore you

284
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:54,750
know things things can certainly change

285
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:56,670
yes as a counterpoint to what you were

286
00:12:54,750 --> 00:13:00,150
saying particularly from a small

287
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:01,740
business point of view CEOs in the sense

288
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:04,819
that they are CEOs when the business is

289
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:07,290
still that small are looking together

290
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:10,770
are looking to get a product to market

291
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:13,439
and beat their competitors and see that

292
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:15,960
if we can cut some of this security the

293
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,510
engineers provided a proof of concept it

294
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,580
works let's get it out there see if

295
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:23,040
anybody wants to pay for this right and

296
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:26,820
then once we have money we can fix it

297
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:29,310
and I think often too you know that the

298
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,570
fix comes a little late but they're

299
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:33,300
looking to get something out there

300
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:35,670
they're looking to actually have the

301
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,870
money stopped I don't know using their

302
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,969
personal savings or whatever they're

303
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:44,610
using to to fund the company early on

304
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:49,290
and it's seen as a fairly dramatic

305
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:51,840
overhead - right and considered a

306
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:55,260
high-cost thing to be secure as a

307
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:57,720
start-up with all of my startups since

308
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,730
at least 2013 we just deleted all the

309
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,130
user data we said okay we're a really

310
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:04,050
small company were not a great position

311
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:06,150
to protect everything and one of the

312
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:07,920
tops that I gave a lot over the last few

313
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:09,870
years was doing security for startups

314
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,209
and if you just don't hold on to user

315
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:15,210
data that can be a really good way to

316
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:17,850
manage like just don't hold it if you

317
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:19,800
don't have the capability to protect it

318
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:22,620
like just don't hold on to it that's

319
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,120
been my take that said I definitely

320
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,800
understand there are a lot of startups

321
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,540
and they just don't have that protection

322
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,630
I had a friend who wrote to me and he

323
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:32,400
said please try my product by the way

324
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:35,070
don't use an important passcode cuz

325
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:37,170
there's like no SSL on it like there's

326
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:39,030
nothing good that you need on any of

327
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:41,430
this and I actually wasn't mad about

328
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:43,709
that I was like okay he has been

329
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:45,689
transparent with me and I know what I'm

330
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:47,700
signing up for and so I think that's

331
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:49,920
also a model that from my point of view

332
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,140
is reasonably ethical like we are

333
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,370
shipping a beta prod

334
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,740
to our users this week a

335
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:57,500
faster-than-light rather next week this

336
00:14:54,740 --> 00:15:01,010
week next week and we're just going to

337
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:02,510
be really clear about the status of the

338
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:05,600
product like we actually have pretty

339
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:07,760
good security for security people but

340
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,800
it's a beta and we're just being really

341
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,600
clear like here's the things that are

342
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,819
edge cases there's the stuff we haven't

343
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,320
tested really well and so I think some

344
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:17,240
measure of transparency the problem is

345
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,640
people ship stuff you have no idea what

346
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:22,149
the security is with tools that you use

347
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:24,709
and people just a lot of founders

348
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:27,380
there's an attitude that it's just okay

349
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:29,119
and that it doesn't matter but then

350
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,279
there are consequences for people down

351
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,019
the line and so it's we'll see an

352
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,060
attitude of not thinking through or

353
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:41,600
caring enough about those consequences

354
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:46,279
which I'd argue is a problem this is

355
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:52,220
probably a good moment I have um a story

356
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:54,470
that I want to share story time I've

357
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:57,050
been working in the blockchain space and

358
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:59,510
I saw something just wild

359
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:02,300
I saw something that I've never seen as

360
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:04,160
a security person anywhere else these

361
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,620
are all screenshots from what's known as

362
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,300
an audit report everyone I'm watching

363
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,709
security knows the word audit is the

364
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,109
wrong word to use but we've been using

365
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:13,430
it so we just call it Auto report the

366
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:17,120
way you do and everyone just agrees to

367
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:20,479
use the wrong word and it's it's wild

368
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,240
before companies in the blockchain space

369
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,699
especially if the area but also EOS also

370
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,699
other parts of the blockchain ecosystem

371
00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:31,370
they get a pen test report before they

372
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:33,649
ship code live it doesn't matter how big

373
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:34,730
or small the company is and companies

374
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:37,220
all come to me they're like we don't

375
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:38,720
have any money we'll give you tokens

376
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,730
we'll give you a kadhi like we need an

377
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,019
audit report like we don't have any

378
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,339
money and we're not gonna go live

379
00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:46,519
without a report we're gonna find

380
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:49,040
someone who will do it for us and

381
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:52,970
oftentimes I was like well I have to pay

382
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,880
people so you know we only do work for

383
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:57,980
money because I have to I pay people

384
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,260
with money if I can find people who'd

385
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:03,640
like will work for not money then I like

386
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,640
okay great but

387
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:12,000
it's to show this the seriousness of

388
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:15,000
this in this one area like why why is it

389
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,400
that even these tiny launching startups

390
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,349
are insisting on like really good

391
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:23,910
security what happens with the auto

392
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:25,770
reportedly really great developers like

393
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:28,290
the folks from consensus who are doing a

394
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:31,020
workshop tomorrow folks from trail of

395
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:33,200
bits we're building on top of a tool

396
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:35,550
from trailer pits they're wonderful um

397
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:39,600
they go in and they actually review the

398
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:42,000
code like line by line and using static

399
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,409
analysis tools and then they send in

400
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,990
fixes and the companies have to make the

401
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:48,420
fixes or else it goes in the auto report

402
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,740
that the code has vulnerabilities and

403
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:52,020
they ship the code like that nobody

404
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,420
wants that they all want the auto report

405
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,710
to say that they did a good job and so

406
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,150
we all come together they're all aligned

407
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,470
around like we're gonna do static

408
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:00,150
analysis we're gonna read the code and

409
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:01,950
then you're gonna fix the code it's

410
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:06,840
amazing it's like a security person's

411
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:09,000
dream right it's it blows my mind why

412
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:12,209
did this happen it happened because

413
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,100
investors mostly investors and there are

414
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:15,720
a lot of regular people who were able to

415
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:18,000
be investors in the blockchain space

416
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,050
because of the way the token sales work

417
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,870
because of the way all the crowdfunding

418
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:25,560
happened you just since this still

419
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:28,260
insecurity it just insisted on it and so

420
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:31,320
I think there's a bit of a lesson there

421
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:34,020
for those of us who want companies and

422
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,850
individuals inside those companies to

423
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:38,910
take security more seriously it's like

424
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:41,010
well if enough of us come together as

425
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:43,650
investors and his customers and say like

426
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:47,670
hey this is really important this

427
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:51,930
matters it can make a really big

428
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:56,970
difference pose for the photo all right

429
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:58,170
let's go back um I'm gonna talk for a

430
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:01,230
few minutes and then open it back up

431
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:03,900
around developers in general we're in a

432
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:06,660
really special moment you know I

433
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:09,630
remember when I first started like 20

434
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:11,730
years ago you would show up to work and

435
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:13,740
you didn't get to choose what tools you

436
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:16,050
used at work just like you showed up and

437
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,059
like this is your work station and you

438
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:19,039
logged in

439
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:21,860
and use whatever tools they gave you and

440
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:25,908
then you went home and you like didn't

441
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:27,709
get work calls very different and these

442
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:29,629
days you know it's like 2:00 in the

443
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:32,889
morning and I'm slacking with my team so

444
00:19:29,629 --> 00:19:35,509
there's a price we pay for where we are

445
00:19:32,889 --> 00:19:37,459
but on the other side we're really

446
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:40,610
empowered you know you show up to work

447
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:43,100
you just decide whatever tools you want

448
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:45,019
to use and you can also decide that you

449
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,240
want to pay a lot more attention to the

450
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:49,610
security of your code so I think we get

451
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:52,429
to ask right now who do we want to be

452
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:54,529
what do we want to create is it our job

453
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:56,360
to ship code without vulnerabilities I

454
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:59,179
think this is a real question it's a

455
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:01,610
question I don't have an answer to can

456
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:04,309
we rely on QA and pen testers I don't

457
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:06,289
know maybe maybe not maybe it depends on

458
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:09,289
your organization maybe this is a really

459
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:13,820
personal decision but I think it's worth

460
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:17,658
asking and I also just really like this

461
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:20,090
slide so I wanted to include it to view

462
00:20:17,659 --> 00:20:21,649
the best version of you I came across

463
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:29,059
this image as I was looking for the

464
00:20:21,649 --> 00:20:31,758
other ones so unless someone has

465
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:34,340
something very strong to say about

466
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:35,869
developers and developer epics do we

467
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:43,699
have a hand because we can keep going on

468
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:45,289
this otherwise we'll switch gears yes so

469
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,669
maybe they should be saved for later

470
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:47,990
discussion but I want to bring it up

471
00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:51,080
after your story

472
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:52,940
when I'll be around um after Norman's

473
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:56,119
talk I'm gonna stay and I encourage

474
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:58,210
every mistake but just so I can make the

475
00:20:56,119 --> 00:21:01,340
points but not get into the discussion

476
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:03,259
with that story I was wondering whether

477
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:06,980
people were aware of the conflict of

478
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:09,740
interest that offering tokens in what

479
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:12,590
they're auditing would do and the second

480
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:15,619
thing is that the is that what you were

481
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:19,100
kind of suggesting there was at least in

482
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:21,949
this case the market works so the market

483
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,990
actually does work if customers and

484
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:27,169
investors are empowered about it so let

485
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:29,929
me go back to where I put the wrong

486
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:31,580
handle they're very human we have to

487
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:33,889
give each other these things but then

488
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:37,009
fix them and correct them when we can so

489
00:21:33,889 --> 00:21:38,928
that's my handle on Twitter so feel free

490
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:40,039
to tweet me over that and then we could

491
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:41,269
have that conversation a little more

492
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:43,999
publicly because those are interesting

493
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:45,919
questions and I also want to give a

494
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:49,100
shout out to Norman who came over and we

495
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,690
spoke before and I think the top that

496
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,730
follows in this room and fee stay in

497
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:54,740
this room the conversation will continue

498
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:56,330
I think are really useful way what are

499
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:59,059
the responsibilities to protect users

500
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:02,539
from harm on social media this came out

501
00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:04,249
recently with the viral video that

502
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:06,679
wasn't shut down quite so quickly on

503
00:22:04,249 --> 00:22:08,509
social media and there seem to be a lot

504
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:10,309
of consensus around the idea that it

505
00:22:08,509 --> 00:22:12,409
should have been but I think a lot of

506
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:14,539
these questions are not obvious they

507
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:17,090
certainly haven't been discussed at

508
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:19,460
length and how does this fit into

509
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:21,080
traditional security and threat modeling

510
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,429
right like is this something a red team

511
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,850
should be doing like who should be

512
00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:27,440
thinking about these things and when and

513
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:29,809
since this was also part of the proposal

514
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,899
even though it's a bit of shifting gears

515
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:34,549
I think it's important when we ask what

516
00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:37,129
are the ethical obligations from these

517
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:38,720
companies where it's like very heated

518
00:22:37,129 --> 00:22:41,600
right now you know President Trump

519
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,970
recently in the United States released a

520
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,289
form he calls it a tool though I just

521
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:49,220
called it a tool it's not a tool it's a

522
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:52,279
form to fill out if you were silenced on

523
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:54,320
social media like this is an issue that

524
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:56,929
is really heating up the White House has

525
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,119
taken it on as something that really

526
00:22:56,929 --> 00:23:00,649
matters but I think the answers are

527
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:02,178
really non-obvious we need to be

528
00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:05,350
discussing it as a community so with

529
00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:05,350
that let's open up the floor
