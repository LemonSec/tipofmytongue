00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:08,300
I am super excited to present Matisse

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:09,769
ani he is a security enthusiast and he

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,329
has held numerous positions as a

4
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:13,639
consultant within several of Quebecers

largest institutions for the last six

6
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:17,300
years he has specialized in blue teaming

7
00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:19,280
content creation threat hunting and

8
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,960
mentorship he's the senior security

9
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,570
architect at Bell Canada which is one of

10

Toronto besides charm in Baltimore and

14
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,379
he has been accepted to speak at be size

15
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:43,970
Las Vegas in August please give him a

16
00:00:33,379 --> 00:00:45,290
hand welcome thank you welcome to this

17
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,540
talk called the Sark

18
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:50,089
counter-attack my name is Matias Oni you

19
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:52,550
can find me on twitter at Scooby MTL a

20
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:55,399
little bit about me I work in in for sex

21
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:57,199
in 2000 I'm a blue team member for the

22
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:59,329
last seven years senior security

23
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,850
architect at Bell Canada where my roles

24
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:05,750
our adversary detection team lead and

25
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,799
trade hunting team lead I'm also a blue

26
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,780
defconn's

27
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,120
blue team village volunteer since its

28
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:13,220
creation last year

29
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,320
you might have noticed sorry that I'm

30
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:18,080
french-canadian so I will or not

31
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:22,759
pronounce HSN from the word NS at the

32
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,798
end of word sometimes I'm also a big

33
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,990
star Wars fan so if you've seen any of

34
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,200
my other presentation this one is also a

35
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:32,689
star war teamed even the title is like a

36
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,610
bad double Google Translation from the

37
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:36,158
empire strike back to Lapierre

38
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,619
counter-attack to the Sark

39
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,299
counter-attack a little bit about the

40
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:44,299
agenda for today so we're gonna talk

41
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:46,610
about the overview of attack we're gonna

42
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:47,960
dive in the attack navigator then we're

43
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:51,020
gonna explain what a preliminary

44
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,699
assessment is using attack and then

45
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,560
we're gonna talk about attack and some

46
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:59,320
open source projects that can actually

47
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:03,740
help you get started as I mentioned

48
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:05,929
overview so what is attack attack stands

49
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:08,389
for adversarial tactics techniques and

50
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:12,290
common knowledge it is a knowledge base

51
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:14,420
of adversary behaviors or TTP's TTP

52
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,690
stands for tactic techniques and

53
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,899
procedure

54
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:21,540
tactics is the why or adversary tactical

55
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:26,220
objective the reason for performing an

56
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:28,260
action such as credential axis or plane

57
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,069
dumping credential persisting on your

58
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,350
system sorry

59
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:33,839
techniques is there how adversary

60
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:36,269
achieve tactical objective for example

61
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,959
they will dump credentials or they will

62
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:42,660
do brute force then the procedure is the

63
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,200
exact way of using those techniques for

64
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:48,450
example using mimic ads to read L SAS or

65
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,310
the exact command line such as cat Etsy

66
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:54,649
password and Linux to access the

67
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:57,030
password hash it focuses on real attack

68
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:59,489
so it doesn't contain all the attack

69
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:02,160
under the Sun it is not a Bible of

70
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:05,370
everything that exists it is focused on

71
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:09,720
what I've been seen in the wild being

72
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:11,940
used by adversaries it also provides a

73
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:16,109
common languages for red team or blue

74
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:17,970
team er the community vendors so when we

75
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:20,690
talk about a technique they all know

76
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:23,790
exactly what they are talking about and

77
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:28,290
finally it is open-source community

78
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:30,480
driven and it is actively maintained

79
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:32,910
so there's quarterly release of new

80
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,700
content if you wanna learn more about

81
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:37,769
what attack is there's an excellent talk

82
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,440
from last year beside in Las Vegas

83
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:44,910
called attacking the static Oh from

84
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:47,910
Kathy Nicholls and John wonder pyramid

85
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:49,980
of pain so this is a simple diagram that

86
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:52,170
shows a relationship between the types

87
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:55,018
of indicator you might use to detect

88
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:57,839
adversary activities and how much pain

89
00:03:55,019 --> 00:04:00,930
it will cause them if you deny them

90
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,420
those indicators you don't need to take

91
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,070
pictures the last slide will contain a

92
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:09,540
link where you can download the whole

93
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:13,380
presentation so as you can see we start

94
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:15,720
with at the bottom until domain names it

95
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,269
is fairly simple for defenders to detect

96
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:21,570
but it's also very simple for adversary

97
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:24,479
to modify those indicators when we get

98
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:26,940
to network artifact or host artifact

99
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,539
those can be user agent string or

100
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,230
function name in

101
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:34,600
a program or a script those become

102
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:36,460
annoying to change for adversaries when

103
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,800
we start targeting their tools then it

104
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:41,530
becomes challenging for example if the

105
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,350
adversary is using method pretty shell

106
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:47,380
from Metasploit and you have 100%

107
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:49,570
detection on that you will force them to

108
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:55,750
use another forum work such as Kabul

109
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:58,870
strike or Empire if you if you focus on

110
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:01,570
detecting TTP then it becomes stuff so

111
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,250
if you deny them everything that is past

112
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,290
the act for lateral movement for example

113
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,390
then it becomes tough because they need

114
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:09,610
to find a new technique in order to do

115
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:11,560
lateral movement same thing if you

116
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,020
monitor your registry properly and you

117
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,460
can monitor all the run Keys in your

118
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,530
environment auto run keys in the

119
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:20,859
registry it becomes tough for them to

120
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:23,739
choose a new method of persistence this

121
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,660
is exactly what attack aim for the

122
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,520
highest level of the pyramid of thing if

123
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,710
you want to learn more about the pyramid

124
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:34,289
of pain this is the link for the

125
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:37,239
original posting in 2013 by David Bianco

126
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:39,520
there is multiple attack there is the

127
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,200
pre attack there's the enterprise attack

128
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,710
and there is the mobile attack which

129
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,900
focus on iOS devices and androids in

130
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:49,630
this talk we will focus on enterprise

131
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:52,090
and this is a representation of the pre

132
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:54,969
attack and the attack framework where

133
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:57,580
you can see their line in blue is what

134
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:00,520
we called initial access and the two in

135
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:02,919
red are recon and weaponized which are

136
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,180
in the pre attack so as I mentioned

137
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,310
we're going to focus on enterprise

138
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:09,760
attack so the second graph in this

139
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:11,860
presentation here is a representation of

140
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,930
pre attack and attack on the Lockheed

141
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:16,180
Martin cyber kill chain so you can see

142
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:18,130
that pre attack focuses on recon and

143
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,860
weaponize as I mentioned whereas

144
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:25,330
Enterprise focuses on deliver exploit

145
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:28,450
control execute and maintain a little

146
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:32,620
bit about the history of attack it was

147
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:34,420
created in September 2013 as a need to

148
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,250
systematically categorize adversary

149
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,260
behaviors

150
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:41,350
it used to enumerate and categorize

151
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:42,430
adversary TTP's only against Windows now

152
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:45,700
it also cover

153
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:48,550
Mac OS and Linux and iOS and Android

154
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:51,099
devices in the mobile one it was

155
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:54,010
released to the public in May 2015 it

156
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:58,090
used to contain nine tactics and 96

157
00:06:54,010 --> 00:07:01,360
techniques as of April 30th there is 12

158
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:04,390
tactics and 244 techniques when I wrote

159
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,190
this slide there were 11 tactics and 233

160
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:10,570
techniques so you can see that it

161
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:13,990
involves rapidly an example of that when

162
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:15,550
I first started looking at Meyer the

163
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:18,430
attack framework for mitre sorry

164
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:21,310
Kerberos thing was not in it it started

165
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:26,350
being used by attacker so it was added

166
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:28,780
in the matrix attack also have its own

167
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:31,870
security conference called attack corn

168
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:33,849
it was two days in October 2018

169
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:36,190
it was live streaming on YouTube and you

170
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:38,620
can still go to this website and you'll

171
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:41,860
be able to watch the 20 presentation

172
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:43,990
that were made on YouTube a little bit

173
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:47,800
of a scoop there will be another edition

174
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:50,080
this year October 28th to October 30 it

175
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,030
should still be streamed on YouTube so

176
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,680
you can book those dates and you can

177
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:56,140
have training and you can train from the

178
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:00,850
comfort of your couch or your office

179
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:03,010
depending what you prefer now we're

180
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:15,400
going to talk about the attack navigator

181
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:19,570
a little bit of a demo so here you have

182
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:22,570
the attack navigator at the top you can

183
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:25,810
see up here all the tactics down there

184
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:27,580
you have all the techniques there 244 of

185
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,800
them as I mentioned so we are not

186
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:31,810
expected to know them all you can see

187
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,180
when I move my mouse that sometimes some

188
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:36,400
techniques are in more than one tactic

189
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:37,959
so for example if you do not know what

190
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,179
bits job is and you want to have some

191
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,700
information you can right-click and

192
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:44,140
click on View technique I'm going to

193
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,520
switch to the other tab because I'm not

194
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:48,460
connected to the Internet because I

195
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:51,069
don't trust any of you

196
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:53,020
so when you go there you will see a

197
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:55,450
windows background you'll see like a

198
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:58,319
background of the technique you'll see

199
00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:01,240
the ID which is T and four digits every

200
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,240
other project that will refer to my

201
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,340
attack will use this ID then you can see

202
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,340
in which tactics the technique belong

203
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:12,340
the platforms used the permission that

204
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:14,770
are required in order to execute this

205
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:17,050
technique and very important for

206
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:20,280
defenders the log sources that you can

207
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:22,810
use to actually detect those techniques

208
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:25,839
if we go a little bit down here in an

209
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:28,510
example you'll see a list of tread

210
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:31,240
actors and malware that have been known

211
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:33,460
to use that technique then you'll have

212
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,770
some information about mitigation and in

213
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:38,710
the detection you will often see the

214
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:40,960
exact procedures that you can use in

215
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:44,950
order to leverage this technique or to

216
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:47,490
detect it detect it let's get back to

217
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,490
the navigator

218
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:51,730
so another interesting thing about a

219
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:53,710
navigator if you're into threat modeling

220
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:55,630
and you want to follow threat actor is

221
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:58,750
that you can use a drop-down list here

222
00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:01,689
and for example if you know that a PT 28

223
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:04,500
target your enterprise you can select

224
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:07,390
all the techniques and you can give them

225
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:10,770
a color using the background color and

226
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:14,319
we can say for example a light blue is a

227
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:16,390
PT 28 if you're more into other things

228
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,190
maybe you know you've been infected by

229
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:20,680
agent Tesla and you want to make sure

230
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:24,270
that you detect it you can select it

231
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:28,719
again choose another color maybe yellow

232
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:31,750
now you can save those layers here in

233
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:35,550
JSON format and you can load them easily

234
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,550
by clicking on the little plus sign here

235
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:42,120
open an existing one and you can upload

236
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:45,350
from local or from a URL

237
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,350
[Music]

238
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:54,470
yay no internet anyway Emma was almost

239
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:58,100
done there's a legend at the bottom that

240
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:59,690
is fairly important to use because in

241
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:04,880
three months you might not remember what

242
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:08,240
the color means so use the legend so

243
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:11,930
back to the presentation how do we get

244
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,910
started with those 244 technique well I

245
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:16,609
recommend starting with the preliminary

246
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:18,800
assessment of those 244 techniques in

247
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:21,650
order to do that you need to select some

248
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,260
basic question that apply to your

249
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:26,810
enterprise here are a list of potential

250
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:28,580
questions they might apply or not so you

251
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:31,180
need to select but for example you can

252
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:34,070
start about logs no logs no detection

253
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,599
what is the complexity of building this

254
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,730
detection for this technique are we

255
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,620
talking about monitoring one file or one

256
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,910
registry key or are we talking about

257
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,470
something that's going to generate a

258
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:44,089
lots of false positive that might need

259
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:46,190
the machine learning a lot of

260
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:48,950
whitelisting so this one thing to

261
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:51,650
consider then is the severity is this

262
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:55,460
high low medium impact for my enterprise

263
00:11:51,650 --> 00:12:00,110
was the probability of being hit by that

264
00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:03,230
technique if it's if it focuses on Mac

265
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:05,390
OS and you only have your a few of them

266
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:10,130
it's probably the probability is very

267
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:12,740
low do you have any dependency on other

268
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:15,140
team in your and enterprise

269
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:17,150
for example this might not apply to

270
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:19,580
small companies but in large companies

271
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:22,550
where you might have a Linux admin a

272
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:26,540
Windows admin and I is admin an Apache

273
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:29,390
admin nginx admin MySQL admin an Oracle

274
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:31,010
admin èr èr èr èr it might get very

275
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:32,960
complicated to get all of those nice

276
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:34,970
people around the same table in order to

277
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,660
get all the logs you need to build a

278
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:40,010
detection so one thing to consider

279
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,630
targets again if you're a small

280
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:44,030
enterprise maybe it doesn't apply maybe

281
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:46,460
your scope is everything if you are in a

282
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:51,319
large enterprise maybe you want to focus

283
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:55,700
on databases for example or web servers

284
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:58,070
or workstation so what does it target

285
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,140
and is that my priority right now and

286
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,520
then is there any open source project

287
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:05,060
that I can

288
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:08,120
to detect this technique about the data

289
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,829
sources so of course the number of data

290
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,140
sources that you have is very important

291
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:13,880
you need to know which data sources

292
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,189
you're currently collecting and storing

293
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,510
in your cm or any other type of

294
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:20,000
application like that when you can

295
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:21,980
create your rules in your detection you

296
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,529
need to focus on getting the one that

297
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:27,709
you don't have for example sis Mon can

298
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:30,890
be used to detect roughly 70% of the

299
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:32,510
techniques in the metrics so if you do

300
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:34,130
not have this man it's probably one of

301
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:36,200
the first thing that you should go after

302
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:38,660
installing sis Mon and getting the logs

303
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,160
and if you're not assessment person

304
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,890
there's other tools that are similar

305
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,100
we're gonna talk about another one later

306
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:48,319
you also need to plan on your log

307
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:52,760
retention with an return on investment

308
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,860
what I mean by that is that your

309
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:57,140
incidence response team will need logs

310
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:59,240
and they might not need the logs for the

311
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:01,610
same amount of time for example they

312
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,500
might want to retain firewall logs for

313
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:07,550
30 days whereas they might want to

314
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:09,860
retain system on logs for 90 days six

315
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:11,839
months a year so you need to know how

316
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:14,959
much it cost your enterprise to store

317
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,390
those log in hot warm and cold courage

318
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,699
so what's the price per gigabyte for

319
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:23,689
your organization and then you can plan

320
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:25,730
your retention around that if you want

321
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:27,760
to know another way to start with the

322
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:30,170
data source when your enterprise is

323
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,149
fairly mature there was an excellent

324
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:34,490
talk I'll qualify your aunt not your

325
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:36,560
parent red teaming from Devon Kerr and

326
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:41,600
Roberto Rodriguez that was presented

327
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,619
both at beside sharm and at san stret

328
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,600
hunting summit

329
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:49,190
those are the two links for the DOS

330
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:51,200
presentation once you have decided when

331
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:53,450
your question so you need to assign

332
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:57,290
points or weights to every question that

333
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:59,390
you've selected so you can score F HTTP

334
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:02,660
and assign them a color in the navigator

335
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:04,550
or another way of tracking then when you

336
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:08,270
have your score you can up you can apply

337
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:10,069
a script and apply those colors in your

338
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:13,730
JSON file automatically you can do that

339
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:14,420
manually but again 244 techniques doing

340
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:18,290
manually

341
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:19,969
it's quite tedious this is an example of

342
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:23,060
the question that you might select with

343
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:26,570
the weight how many lockers do I have

344
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:28,219
for this technique for 35% weight what

345
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:32,420
is the probability to be targeted by

346
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:34,519
this maybe 30% does this target Linux

347
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,110
server because my DMZ is full of Linux

348
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:38,660
server and that's what my corporation

349
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:40,279
wants me to focus on and is there any

350
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,689
open source project that can help me

351
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:45,470
speed up the development of the

352
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:48,190
detection maybe just a 10% wait then

353
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:50,870
with the points you can assign color and

354
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:54,529
development priority so this is just an

355
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:55,760
example you can use anything else one

356
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:57,709
thing I forgot to mention when I was

357
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,540
doing the navigator demo is that you can

358
00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:01,310
have as many layers as you want so you

359
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:03,230
don't need to cram everything in one

360
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,729
layer you can have one layer for every

361
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:07,610
things that you want to track that you

362
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,839
want to show to your management so this

363
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:11,630
can be another view when you're done

364
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:12,680
with your preliminary assessment when

365
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:14,320
you're done with the problem yes this

366
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,599
man I should look something like this

367
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,910
each the color are each techniques are

368
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,620
colored if you don't have a legend as I

369
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:24,500
mentioned it's very hard to tell what

370
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,690
these color means green green might

371
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,399
means that you have everything and this

372
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:31,100
is your priority or the other way around

373
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,380
that green is low priority and red is a

374
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:37,220
high priority we're no legend we have no

375
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:41,240
idea then we can build another layer and

376
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:42,589
track our coverage and in progress so

377
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,170
here for example you see that there's

378
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:46,970
five techniques that are selected we

379
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:49,430
have our gray Edition that is in orange

380
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:51,560
which might need means for us that we

381
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:54,079
only have dashboards or hunting

382
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,729
capabilities and the green ones may be

383
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,529
that we have some detection and you see

384
00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:00,050
there's a light green which means maybe

385
00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:02,269
we have only one rule and a darker green

386
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:05,089
which might mean means that we have more

387
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:07,520
than one rule we have one in red that

388
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:10,220
might means that we have only the logs

389
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:13,299
but nothing else again you choose your

390
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:17,000
color but make sure to make a legend

391
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:19,389
this could be our cue to version so that

392
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,069
one was now we see that we have 15

393
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:23,659
techniques that we cover very visual

394
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:25,010
your management will understand that

395
00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:26,209
they will understand where their money

396
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,309
goes

397
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:31,070
and you can see here that our tradition

398
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:33,470
when from orange to green because maybe

399
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:35,178
we with all the hunting that we did now

400
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,760
we have detection for that and we have a

401
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:39,110
rule that is sent to our sock and you

402
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:44,059
can see that we have improve our

403
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:46,428
detection when you have layer like this

404
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:49,399
it's extremely easy to answer management

405
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:51,640
questions on March 19 red cannery

406
00:17:49,399 --> 00:17:55,459
released the threat detection report

407
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:58,159
it's this is the top ten techniques that

408
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:00,679
IDI have seen being used by adversary in

409
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:02,779
the wild so with the layer you can

410
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:05,029
answer your management in five minutes

411
00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:07,370
about your coverage for example for us

412
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:11,179
we knew in five minutes that we had 90%

413
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:13,580
of those technique that we could detect

414
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:14,990
and the next print we started working on

415
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,820
the one that we couldn't and now we have

416
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,240
a hundred percent visibility on the top

417
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,879
ten

418
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,350
it goes up to 40 but I think the top ten

419
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,539
is very important as you can see

420
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:29,570
PowerShell is the most widely used

421
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:33,408
technique after that you need to know

422
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:37,070
your enemies how do you do that well you

423
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:39,679
do that by doing threat modeling there's

424
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:41,658
a workshop about threat modeling at the

425
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,649
same times but thank you for coming to

426
00:18:41,659 --> 00:18:49,190
my talk instead threat modeling you

427
00:18:45,649 --> 00:18:52,039
wouldn't attack a retailer for the same

428
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:55,039
reason that you would attack a media

429
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:57,950
company for example so if you're the

430
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:01,250
trait actor is after a retailer he might

431
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:02,960
be after credit cards he might want to

432
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:05,059
reroute some goods to an addressee

433
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,000
control you might want to change the

434
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:10,879
prices before making a shipment if

435
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,980
you're attacking or if a tractor is

436
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:17,659
attacking a media they might be after

437
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:19,730
the journalist sources to maybe pay them

438
00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:22,640
to change their mind or them depending

439
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:25,669
on the country you live in they might

440
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,140
want to change the meaning of an article

441
00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:28,429
that you've already published or they

442
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:32,510
might want to just publish their

443
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:34,460
propaganda on a credible media once you

444
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:36,649
know which vertical you're operating in

445
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:39,100
you can start looking for tractors that

446
00:19:36,649 --> 00:19:42,100
are actively targeting your

447
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:43,689
vertical when you know which tractor you

448
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:46,178
can start following ristretto

449
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:48,760
researchers that focus on those tractors

450
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:51,429
and that will give you a list of TTP's

451
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,650
that those straight actors are using and

452
00:19:51,429 --> 00:20:01,320
that can be used again to prioritize

453
00:19:53,650 --> 00:20:05,470
which TTP you want to detect first now

454
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:09,189
matrix and KPI if attackers thinks in

455
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:11,320
graph management things in matrix so

456
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:13,840
there's good metrics and they're bad

457
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,939
matrix or pitfall good matrix a little

458
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,539
bit what we saw earlier showing monthly

459
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:21,690
progression showing your coverage

460
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:24,940
prioritizing your data source ingestion

461
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:26,380
alerting versus hunting other thing for

462
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:28,360
me is when you send a ticket to your

463
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:31,510
sock that someone will investigate

464
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:34,149
hunting might be a dashboard some query

465
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:36,039
that you run a dark or on a regular

466
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:38,590
basis there might be some reports that

467
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:42,100
you get and then you pick the entries

468
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:46,270
that look suspicious to you you might

469
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:48,490
want to represent if the if you have a

470
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:51,850
single detection or multiple detection

471
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:55,179
by shades of green or by a score then

472
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:57,668
there's the bad ones or the pitfall one

473
00:20:55,179 --> 00:21:00,100
of them is assuming that all TTP's are

474
00:20:57,669 --> 00:21:03,429
equal as we saw in the slide from the

475
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:06,039
red canary report PowerShell is

476
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:10,179
extremely huge you can do

477
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:14,320
70% of the 75% of the techniques using

478
00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:15,850
PowerShell whereas bash history for

479
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,210
example that's only one file that you

480
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:23,080
need to monitor in every user directory

481
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:26,020
so not equal at all falling for coverage

482
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:28,600
versus depth so that means that if your

483
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:30,820
team is core only on the number of TTP's

484
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:33,780
that they have detection for they might

485
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:36,668
be enticed to the built very weak

486
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:39,850
detection for each technique and I will

487
00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:42,730
leave you vulnerable to a lot of bypass

488
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:46,928
again taking PowerShell as an example if

489
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:50,509
you only if you only do detection for

490
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:53,419
file download then you're vulnerable to

491
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:57,440
dll reflection loading you're vulnerable

492
00:21:53,419 --> 00:22:01,419
to obfuscation so on and so forth many

493
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,419
things that you can do persistence

494
00:22:01,629 --> 00:22:07,129
it's also important to remember that

495
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:10,730
some of the TTP's in the matrix are not

496
00:22:07,129 --> 00:22:13,189
for alerting they're more for contextual

497
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:16,549
when you do incident response if we

498
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:18,919
think about deleted file or created file

499
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:20,509
if you make a detection rule for that

500
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:24,859
and you make an alert and you send that

501
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:27,529
to your sock they won't be happy they

502
00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:29,480
will get flooded they will probably hate

503
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:32,880
you they will probably ate the mire

504
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:35,049
attack forever and it will eat you

505
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,700
[Music]

506
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:40,279
another pitfall would be not counting

507
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:43,309
non attack detection that you built

508
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:45,980
again attack is not a Bible it does not

509
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:49,249
contain every techniques that exist for

510
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:52,340
example persistence with with SSH

511
00:22:49,249 --> 00:22:53,929
authorize key as it's not in the matrix

512
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:56,139
but it's something that you might

513
00:22:53,929 --> 00:22:58,940
consider building detection for and

514
00:22:56,139 --> 00:23:00,979
reporting that you actually do or that

515
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:05,179
you do detect that technique it might be

516
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:07,700
added in a lower version another pitfall

517
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:11,570
is converting all the rules from a

518
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:14,690
project into a rule or an alert

519
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:16,879
this will also flood your sock again

520
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:18,950
they will lose faith in me the attack

521
00:23:16,879 --> 00:23:20,689
framework they will lose faith in your

522
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:22,549
process and they'll lose faith in you

523
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:25,609
we'll talk about that a little bit later

524
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:30,889
in a few slides if you want to learn

525
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:32,570
more about pitfall of attack there's a

526
00:23:30,889 --> 00:23:34,758
good talk that was presented at attack

527
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:38,178
Con last year called 5 ways to screw up

528
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:40,340
your security program with attack now

529
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:42,580
we're going to talk about attack an open

530
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,580
source

531
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:51,490
first project Sigma from Florian truck

532
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:52,420
which is a generic signature format for

533
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:56,260
CM system

534
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:57,670
this is Yama file that you can use and

535
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:01,360
then there's a converter that you can

536
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:05,530
use if you have elk Splunk ArcSight q

537
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:09,010
radar and many others um this is the

538
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:11,139
coverage that the project has as you can

539
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:13,870
see there is a lot so if you again if

540
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:16,390
you convert all of them into alert not

541
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:19,270
good a better approach would be go by

542
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:23,350
batch select a number of techniques that

543
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:25,389
you can actually soak for a week to a to

544
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:27,100
a month maybe maybe you go with five I

545
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:28,870
don't know the number but let's say five

546
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,820
when you're done and you have a high

547
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:32,409
confidence that you don't generate too

548
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:34,629
much false positive you put that into

549
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:39,190
production and you focus on the next

550
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:41,590
five then there's this Mon modular from

551
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:44,800
Olaf art on which is a system on

552
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:48,540
configuration file where all the the

553
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:53,080
detection are mapped to the minor attack

554
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:55,270
if sis this is the average of the system

555
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,980
on modular so as you can see this mon

556
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:59,680
covers a lot of the technique

557
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:00,250
if you're more of an OS query type of

558
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,350
person

559
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:07,300
do not worry Philippa Matheny got your

560
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:10,899
back with the OS attack this is the

561
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:12,940
techniques that it covers all have short

562
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:16,060
on strikes again with its Splunk apps

563
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:18,670
called tread hunting remember the name

564
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:21,970
tread hunting not alerting very

565
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:25,210
different if you're not using Splunk do

566
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:28,240
not worry it is very simple to open any

567
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:30,550
of the files and then you locate the

568
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,410
search line and then you'll see that on

569
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:36,159
this search particularly it looks for

570
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:38,140
sis Mon it looks for event ID one it

571
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:40,840
looks for a process name or a command

572
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:43,120
line very specific this you can convert

573
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,610
to any cm that you have as long as you

574
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,560
have sis Mon in your log you can build a

575
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:51,459
detection for that using what's in in

576
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:54,250
this this is the coverage of the project

577
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:56,610
again now when you've built some

578
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:59,220
detection maybe you want to test them

579
00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:01,260
red canary build the atomic red team

580
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:03,929
project which are small and highly

581
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,850
portable detection test based on mitre

582
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:09,480
you can chang them and we call them

583
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:11,939
reaction this is a very well maintained

584
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:15,960
project it's all Yama file that you can

585
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:18,149
use they have a slack channel where we

586
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:21,929
can discuss about detection and they

587
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:24,389
also do atomic Friday's almost every

588
00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:28,769
month they will do a webinar at

589
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:30,419
lunchtime this is the coverage and I

590
00:26:28,769 --> 00:26:32,820
want to thank Casey Schmitt and Toni

591
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:35,070
Lambert for private providing this to me

592
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:38,090
Monday when I told them that their old

593
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:41,689
lair was not working thank you guys

594
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:44,158
now there's another project similar to

595
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:46,740
the atomic red team which is called red

596
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,419
team automation from endgame it's almost

597
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,760
the same thing but it's built in Python

598
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:56,460
it's it's light it is slightly less

599
00:26:50,760 --> 00:27:00,029
maintain now commercial EDR also started

600
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:02,610
using iron attack attack to showcase

601
00:27:00,029 --> 00:27:04,919
their detection here is the list it's

602
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:06,809
not an endorsement from my part or my

603
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:09,019
company in any sense it's just what's in

604
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:12,510
the list so those are the ones that were

605
00:27:09,019 --> 00:27:16,559
evaluated as round 1 and these ones are

606
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:21,510
the one that are evaluated in round 2 in

607
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:25,769
conclusion here are the key takeaways

608
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:28,460
for you guys and girls attack address

609
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:30,620
the highest level of the pyramid of pain

610
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:33,510
you should start with a preliminary

611
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:35,399
assessment of all the techniques this

612
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:38,370
way you will know the matrix and you'll

613
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:39,689
be able to show what you will be able to

614
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:42,239
have a clearer picture of where you

615
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:44,460
should start to do a successful

616
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,990
preliminary assessment you need to

617
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,659
choose the right question for your

618
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:51,210
organization they find scores that make

619
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:52,980
sense for you and your organization and

620
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:55,169
you need to track your progress

621
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:57,720
somewhere such as the enterprise

622
00:27:55,169 --> 00:27:59,820
navigator so you can see you can show

623
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:03,210
sorry your management what you've been

624
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:05,490
doing try to leverage open source

625
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:08,610
project to improve your coverage and

626
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:10,260
speed up your detection do not confuse

627
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:15,209
alerting and

628
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:17,610
and reporting and forensic and you can

629
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:19,920
use attack to make a selection of

630
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:21,840
vendors that cover some techniques that

631
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:25,860
you cannot detect with what you

632
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:28,470
currently have if you want to have

633
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,850
another idea of how to start there was

634
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:31,830
an excellent talk at the blue thing

635
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:37,800
village last year called stop dropped

636
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:40,439
NSS your sock from nd Appelbaum sorry

637
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:43,710
that works for mitre this is the link

638
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:45,480
for his presentation finally something

639
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:47,820
to you so I want to thank grifter

640
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:52,200
pyrotech and Daniel Bohannon for

641
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:54,780
inspiring me to do come on a stage and

642
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:57,060
talk to you people more closely to us I

643
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:58,740
want to thank LD aka lava and a good

644

friend of mine is also a very good

645
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:03,330
inspiration I always deliver very good

646
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:05,520
talks I was a very inspired and Olivier

647
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:08,760
Bilodeau also I think he's a great guy

648
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:11,520
in the community makes us together make

649
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:14,790
us stronger as a community one also to

650
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,680
thank Meijer cup for MITRE Corp for

651
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:19,139
releasing attack as an open source

652
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:21,240
project and making the community a safer

653
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:23,340
place as well and finally I want to

654
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,680
thank Belle my employer for giving me

655
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:28,800
times to come here and present prepare

656
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:33,000
and also send me in different city to

657
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:34,620
present thing as promised last slide you

658
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,130
have the link to the deck if you're

659
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:41,219
interested I think I have like one

660
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:43,620
minute left so if you have question
