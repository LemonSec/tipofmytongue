1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,000
hi everybody i'm alex orleans i'm the

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,760
deputy manager for targeted intrusion at

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,440
crowdstrike intelligence global threat

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,040
analysis cell and this is the sales

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,200
director katie blankenship we're here to

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,559
talk to you today about how iran has

7
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,000
started their own little war adopting

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,759
disruptive ransomware and information

9
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,839
operations which marks a new horizon in

10
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,520
computer network attack operations

11
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,800
all right so since last summer we have

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,119
seen an increasing number of iran nexus

13
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,439
groups and adversaries starting to use

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,519
ransomware in their operations now while

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,679
these operations will use ransom notes

16
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,719
and dedicated leak sites demanding hard

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,960
cryptocurrency we're really not seeing

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,280
any viable effort at actual currency

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,559
generation

20
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,320
what we are seeing our actors

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,120
increasingly use ransomware's disruptive

22
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,520
capability blended with information

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,800
operations

24
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,360
and we call this a lock and leak model

25
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,480
approach

26
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,440
so what we think iran is doing here is

27
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,520
that they're using these tactics to

28
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,199
start their own

29
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,160
lower form of cyber attack which draws

30
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,680
less visibility

31
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,760
it's less costly to perform and it

32
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,799
provides more room for deniability

33
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,960
all while allowing these actors to

34
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,479
successfully fulfill

35
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,479
their suspected motivations at the end

36
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:15,680
of the day

37
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,360
so with that being said

38
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,439
we think that we are at a critical

39
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,240
horizon of what computer network attack

40
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,720
can evolve into in that medium term

41
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,000
so as i mentioned we are seeing

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,600
increasing number of groups and actors

43
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,439
use this tactic but for today we're

44
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,320
going to highlight four primary actors

45
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,000
and groups that we believe have been

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,400
trendsetters along this path

47
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,079
so first up we have a group that we

48
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,399
track as tarnish gauntlet

49
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,960
now this group back in the summer and

50
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,920
fall of last year they started to use a

51
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,759
variant of the commodity ransomware

52
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,000
known as thanos and a huge shout out to

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
palo alto for publicly detailing this

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,920
activity

55
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,960
next up we have in october of 2020 the

56
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,600
iran nexus adversary pioneer kitten

57
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,040
started to use their own custom

58
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,360
ransomware called pay2key against

59
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,920
operations targeting an israeli target

60
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,160
base and huge shout out to clear sky as

61
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,200
well for detailing this activity

62
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,800
so i'd like to highlight with the

63
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,640
pioneer kitten activity as well they

64
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,440
have continued into

65
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,120
2021 however they are switching those

66
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,720
custom ransomware tooling that they're

67
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,840
using

68
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,440
and this year to include the use of

69
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,959
networm

70
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,680
so if pioneer kitten pioneered the lock

71
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,879
and leak model for their initial

72
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,840
campaigns during 2020 and into 2021

73
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,760
spectral kitten which was uh first got

74
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,360
public attention through sentinel one's

75
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,360
coverage of spectral kittens apostle

76
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,440
ransomware variant certainly represents

77
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,680
a savvier approach much more aggressive

78
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,560
use use of personas of cross-channel

79
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,640
media engagement of direct engagement

80
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,959
with the press in order to leak and

81
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,640
embarrass targets again across an

82
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,480
israeli target base

83
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,480
um we've seen them adopt a different

84
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,959
persona in 2021 they used a persona

85
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,400
known as dark crypt for a very short

86
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,239
period of time but as recently as last

87
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,680
month they've reverted to the black

88
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,920
shadow persona and again are engaging in

89
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,239
very aggressive leak operations with

90
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,959
faux e-crime ransom demand narratives

91
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,400
accompanying them

92
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,400
and then separately from pioneer and

93
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,239
spectra we have an actor called nemesis

94
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,680
kitten uh

95
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,280
microsoft referred to these guys as

96
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,879
phosphorus earlier today we tracked them

97
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,319
as nemesis kitten

98
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,480
and they're really about in

99
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,280
in

100
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,000
excuse me inflicting disruptive impacts

101
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,760
as opportunistically and as immediately

102
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,519
on targets as they possibly can

103
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,200
specifically across north america and

104
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,120
the middle east we've seen them use

105
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,040
custom wipers we've seen them use custom

106
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,040
ransomware we've seen them use bitlocker

107
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,959
and descriptor they'll use whatever they

108
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,200
have on hand uh they've been active

109
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,040
since about q2 of this year and they're

110
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,840
still active right now

111
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,599
so with

112
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,879
we've thrown the phrase lock and leak

113
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,799
around a lot and so we wanted to give

114
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,640
you a hypothetical timeline of what this

115
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,400
might look like with the idea of the

116
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,319
dedicated league site for such an actor

117
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,080
being established on today at

118
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,920
cyberworkon they debuted their dedicated

119
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,760
league site which you can see down there

120
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,519
at the bottom on november 16. this is

121
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,400
this is hypothetical it's very

122
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,720
fan dancy kind of a thing but

123
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,720
it's really two stages you have an

124
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,478
initial intrusion with a data x fill

125
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,399
window right before the encryption date

126
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,000
they're compiling whatever tool they're

127
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,079
going to be using for disruptive impacts

128
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,840
and then very shortly thereafter they'll

129
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,080
encrypt begin initial messaging across

130
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,639
things like twitter or telegram very low

131
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,960
key then they'll get the dls up they'll

132
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,800
get a public one usually in an onion one

133
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,479
as well and then the aggressive

134
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,080
messaging will begin there'll be a lot

135
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,000
of public shaming they'll leak just

136
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,880
conversations with targets they'll say

137
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,400
the targets aren't paying fast enough

138
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,520
they'll say you know the pain is going

139
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,040
to continue again and again and again

140
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,479
and that's where you get into the leak

141
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,720
portion and really aggressiveness and

142
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,880
more recently the press engagement

143
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,400
directly reaching out to the press to

144
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,919
say so and so isn't paying has become a

145
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,840
much more prominent feature

146
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,280
all right so why are the iranians

147
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,800
adopting this model

148
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,039
well if we look at the arc of activity

149
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,639
we can really start to see a common

150
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,280
theme of iranians testing the water in

151
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,280
the attack space to really see what they

152
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,440
can get away with without drawing those

153
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,759
high profile responses like they saw

154
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,080
with previous disruptive operations such

155
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,440
as shimon

156
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,199
additionally the use of ransomware and

157
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,680
operations by state nexus adversaries

158
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,479
for non-currency generation purposes has

159
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,320
been observed and has also been

160
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,320
successful

161
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,479
so going back to our four examples we'd

162
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,400
like to go through what we've observed

163
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,800
as far as motives in each of these and

164
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,960
parallel them with other observations

165
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,479
that we've seen by other state nexus

166
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,759
adversaries

167
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,919
so the first motive we have is cover for

168
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,759
action the use of ransomware as cover

169
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,160
for action or a distraction so going

170
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,039
back to that tarnish gauntlet activity

171
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,400
that i talked about

172
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,400
when we saw tarnish gauntlet

173
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,319
last summer we saw them deploy that

174
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,360
variant of thanos in operations that

175
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,680
dovetailed espionage espionage

176
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,639
operations by another iranian adversary

177
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,120
static kitten we believe that this was

178
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,199
actually a cover for action then by

179
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,319
tarnish gauntlet for static kitten

180
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,240
so this is an interesting motive that we

181
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,440
see with ransomware and we've seen it

182
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,440
before particularly by north korean

183
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,160
actors i'd like to highlight a specific

184
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,639
example by a group we track as stardust

185
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,840
shalima

186
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,960
so back in 2017 2018

187
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,600
stardust chelima used a variant of the

188
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,520
commodity ransomware known as hermes and

189
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,840
their operations that were targeting uh

190
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,759
the financial sector so they use this

191
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,240
variant as a cover for action for their

192
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,479
cash out activity

193
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,479
the second motive that we've identified

194
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,400
is the use of ransomware for harassment

195
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,160
and embarrassment purposes

196
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,759
so going back to that pioneer kitten

197
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,840
example those initial operations we saw

198
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,440
by pioneer kitten

199
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,759
really embody an operation that was

200
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,680
designed to annoy and harass their

201
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,319
targets there was no real viable effort

202
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,039
at currency generation there

203
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,720
so to parallel that with another north

204
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,039
korean adversary i want to highlight a

205
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,280
group that we track as velvet chalima

206
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,039
now velvet shalima back in december of

207
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,240
2014 they targeted the south korean

208
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,039
entity the creo korea hydro and nuclear

209
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,440
power plant and interestingly in this

210
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,160
operation they ransom the victim they

211
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,000
threaten them with leaks and at the end

212
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,680
of the day the whole purpose of that was

213
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,680
to really embarrass and harass that

214
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,440
victim and that's what we're seeing with

215
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,759
those pioneer kitten operations

216
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,319
so very similarly to how pioneer kitten

217
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,840
you know was an initial actor that we

218
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,680
observed engaging in lock and leak and

219
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,520
then we saw spectral kitten engage in a

220
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,919
more refined version of that the savvier

221
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,520
way that it is engaged in those

222
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,880
operations that spectral kitten has

223
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,680
engaged in leaks and use of personas

224
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,280
seems to also be a maturation of

225
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,800
objective as well while we haven't been

226
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,520
able to link pioneer to spectral it does

227
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,039
appear that one is learning from the

228
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,120
model of the other in that the goals of

229
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,720
spectral kit and operations seem much

230
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,160
more aligned with achieving

231
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,240
psychological or influence operations

232
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,440
impacts which was a point first

233
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,120
mentioned publicly on mandiant's ion

234
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,960
security podcast

235
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,479
spectral seems very intent in its

236
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,400
targeting of israeli entities uh

237
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,160
including recently uh you know across

238
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,680
the tech sector really to trying to

239
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,599
undermine a sense of faith and stability

240
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,440
and the security of israeli networks and

241
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,960
the ability of the israeli government

242
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,199
and of network defenders to secure those

243
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,400
networks

244
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,720
we see a parallel here with voodoo bear

245
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,639
also known as sandworm activity between

246
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,680
2016 and 2017 that targeted multiple

247
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,280
entities in the ukrainian financial

248
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,440
sector with a variety of destructive and

249
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,760
disruptive attacks these included

250
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,399
killdisk x data bad rabbit the latter of

251
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,000
two of them being disruptive ransomware

252
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,559
variants and so we're seeing that kind

253
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,719
of psychological operational parallel

254
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:43,519
now

255
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,519
degradation is an ancillary impact to

256
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,440
any of these other three uh kris krebs

257
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,440
mentioned degradation earlier today uh

258
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,360
the folks from meta alluded to a version

259
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,959
of degradation earlier

260
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,480
and what degradation is it's the

261
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,200
psychological stress the wearing down

262
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,800
the impact operations they're having to

263
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,360
recover it's it's all of that drag that

264
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,800
you get it's the friction in in

265
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,120
klaushwitz's terms that you have to deal

266
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,360
with from responding to an intrusion

267
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,200
particularly one that is disruptive and

268
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,120
even more so that one that is amplified

269
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,200
through an information operation

270
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,120
and that impact can ripple up and out

271
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,360
from the network that has to be defended

272
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,120
and responded to all the way up through

273
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,880
things like the press which again with

274
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,640
spectral kittens engagement especially

275
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,640
of the israeli media you see an effort

276
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,160
to do that

277
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,399
and there's a big parallel here again

278
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,560
alluding to the activity that uh

279
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,560
chris talked to during his keynote the

280
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,560
fsb related activity which we track as

281
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,440
berserk bear the sort of wide aperture

282
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,519
targeting of a wide variety of us

283
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,600
government uh state local and tribal

284
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,920
entities in 2020 leading up to the 2020

285
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,240
election this activity was very shallow

286
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,920
didn't really have any impact but it got

287
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,680
near enough to some things to maybe make

288
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,760
some people nervous or worried and that

289
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,839
was kind of we think related to that

290
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,600
generating that degradation impact

291
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,920
all right so what can we expect on the

292
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,079
horizon for this type of activity well

293
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,920
first and foremost we do not believe

294
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,440
that this activity is going to pivot

295
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,240
into

296
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,399
large-scale real viable currency

297
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,240
generation operations

298
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,560
such a move would severely jeopardize

299
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,480
iran's ability to participate in the

300
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,000
global energy markets and they don't

301
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,040
want that

302
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,560
but what the lock and leak model does

303
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,519
tell us

304
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,440
is that the future of disruptive

305
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,640
operations

306
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,240
they're moving from the hacktivist

307
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,959
persona into the e-crime personas

308
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,519
and this is really because those e-crime

309
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,560
personas can organically capitalize on

310
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,120
ransomware's disruptive capabilities

311
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,440
while also allowing actors to blend in

312
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,640
with a large volume of e-crime activity

313
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,160
so just like that e-crime activity

314
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,920
they're trying to blend in with this

315
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,800
very model of cna operations is less

316
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,360
discriminate more opportunistic and more

317
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,959
widely target-scoped so in that sense

318
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,440
you have more pervasive risk and what

319
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,120
that pervasive risk amounts to is more

320
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,640
and more entities are potentially the

321
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,800
targets of state nexus cna operations

322
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,880
than ever before now that ransomware has

323
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,279
been fully operationalized as a cna tool

324
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,360
as it has been with iran

325
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,120
now we've thrown a lot of information at

326
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,200
you guys today very quickly we wanted

327
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,320
for the threat hunters and for the

328
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,760
people playing along at home to throw up

329
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,160
some hashes related to the four actors

330
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,000
um that are associated here you know

331
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,600
shout out to clear sky and palo alto for

332
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,040
some of their coverage here that helped

333
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,040
us put together this slide and also to

334
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,480
note that checkpoint just put out a

335
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,399
great blog on enactus no actor known as

336
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,040
moses staff that is also engaging in

337
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,120
