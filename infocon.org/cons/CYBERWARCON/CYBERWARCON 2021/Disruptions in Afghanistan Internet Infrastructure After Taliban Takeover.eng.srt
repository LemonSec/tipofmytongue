1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,720
so as you all can see

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,279
when i'm standing over here i'm supriya

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,279
when i'm standing here i'm nicole and

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,800
when i'm standing here i'm me um

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,880
uh so thank you all we're gonna talk a

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,200
little bit today about changes in the

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,800
internet infrastructure

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,480
post-taliban takeover in afghanistan

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,470
so a little bit of history

10
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,599
[Music]

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,119
when the taliban first took over

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,400
afghanistan from 96 to roughly 2001 the

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,920
internet was effectively banned

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,600
obviously except for the taliban who

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,680
were able to continue using it and it

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,920
wasn't really banned but they did a lot

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,520
to try

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,520
and ban it

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,680
so everybody wanted to know what the new

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,200
takeover

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,719
what we were what we were going to start

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,160
to see because

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,440
as of february of 2021 um

24
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,559
you know there had been a lot of

25
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,800
penetration mostly mobile

26
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,079
of um of the internet in afghanistan and

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,000
it's kind of hard to take it back once

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,760
you have that

29
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,720
so

30
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,159
right now

31
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,640
most again most internet access is

32
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,760
mobile

33
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,439
through these five providers although

34
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,960
one of those

35
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,240
five is planning on leaving and is still

36
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,400
planning on leaving even post taliban

37
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,400
takeover

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,600
since the taliban takeover

39
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,759
there's

40
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,720
i apologize for reading this um

41
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,640
there's been some afghans who work at

42
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,560
telegrams who've said that there's no

43
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,560
chatter of shutting down so a big part

44
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,680
of it is

45
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,000
uh the taliban gets a little bit of

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,320
every monthly bill that is paid in a

47
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,720
telecom bill so 10

48
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,720
goes to the taliban the taliban needs

49
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,040
that money so there hasn't been any talk

50
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,200
of shutting it down but what we are

51
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,159
seeing is a big increase in

52
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,720
self-censorship

53
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,200
um so there's a lot of pro-taliban

54
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,200
accounts that have been set up not a

55
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,280
whole lot unsurprisingly not a whole lot

56
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,920
of protest accounts at least not set up

57
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,240
in afghanistan and a lot there's been a

58
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,200
lot of

59
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,399
you know uh

60
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,360
not a whole lot of uh

61
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,599
not a whole lot of people uh uh even

62
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,959
outside of afghanistan um

63
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,599
uh who are afghani uh

64
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,879
uh doing uh uh you know negative posts

65
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,480
about the taliban

66
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,400
um

67
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,520
so looking at the data um and this is uh

68
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,480
collected from grade noise um we saw a

69
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,080
surge of uh overall internet traffic

70
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,400
collected during the period right as the

71
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,160
taliban moves into

72
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,440
kabul

73
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,760
mobile activity continues to be primary

74
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,000
but we are seeing it start to level off

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,879
a bit

76
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,720
internet scanning and bot activity

77
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,480
coming from afghanistan has remained

78
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,040
consistent for the last few months

79
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,360
we are seeing actually an increase in

80
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,360
the kind of bots and botnet activity

81
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,239
coming out of afghanistan

82
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,599
possibly because of the confusion um

83
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,319
there's been less focus on security so

84
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,599
we're seeing less uh less activity um

85
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,519
and then we're seeing an increase in

86
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,319
reports of blackouts in regions

87
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,120
so

88
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,040
internet shutting down uh and we don't

89
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,519
know again if that's incompetence or if

90
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,040
that is

91
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,920
uh intentional shutdown um

92
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,000
uh honestly with the taliban it could be

93
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,080
both uh same thing that we saw kind of

94
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,400
in yemen where you had new people come

95
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,080
over and take over the infrastructure

96
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,280
who didn't actually know what they were

97
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,200
doing that results in a whole lot of

98
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,280
outages because it turns out managing a

99
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,440
network and keeping it online is really

100
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,360
really hard

101
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,599
external scanning

102
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,760
so we've seen a drop in the number of

103
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,159
external a drop of about a hundred

104
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,200
thousand

105
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,000
in externally reachable nodes

106
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,360
uh since the start of the uh takeover

107
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,680
now while you see that line kind of

108
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,519
slowly drawing down

109
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,360
those outages are having you know

110
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,439
increasingly impact so you'll see much

111
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,000
more regional outages happening at any

112
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,680
given time but overall there are a

113
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,280
hundred thousand

114
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,159
uh

115
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,000
fewer reachable nodes now than there

116
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,280
were

117
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,560
back in the beginning of a taliban

118
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,000
takeover

119
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,918
we've also seen the

120
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,240
nick.af website go offline

121
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,960
so

122
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,360
even though you can still register.af

123
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,680
domains and their whois server is still

124
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,759
working so that registration

125
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,040
infrastructure is still there so anybody

126
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,960
who wants to take advantage and uh

127
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,040
and take advantage of the dot af domain

128
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,639
which i really think the taliban if they

129
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,120
were good at marketing would um would

130
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,199
push out there because like

131
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,160
like woke.af is available um there are

132
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,800
all kinds of really cool domains that

133
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,360
haven't been hit yet that we'd love to

134
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,320
see registered

135
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,240
so

136
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,960
primarily what we're seeing right now is

137
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,440
a lot of self-censorship again that's

138
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,840
happening inside of afghanistan and

139
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,639
outside of afghanistan so 70 percent of

140
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,199
journalists have stopped working

141
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,039
um freedom of the press has basically

142
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,800
been wiped out overnight

143
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,600
um

144
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,199
again pro taliban accounts are

145
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,840
mushrooming across

146
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,759
across all kinds of social media

147
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,039
profiles

148
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:27,840
um

149
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,639
and then of course we've seen reports

150
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,880
but it we have not seen any evidence

151
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,800
that it's been implemented yet

152
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,360
of the taliban wanting to put together

153
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,199
like you know whole country censorship

154
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,919
capabilities so again we haven't seen

155
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,680
that actually go live but we've seen

156
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,360
reports that they're very interested in

157
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,000
it

158
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,320
not unusual we see that a lot with

159
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,479
repressive regimes where when they come

160
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,080
in they immediately want to kind of shut

161
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,360
things down

162
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,880
um

163
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,000
and so again uh social media criticism

164
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,199
criticism of afghan leadership um is

165
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,479
basically non-existent at that point um

166
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,800
and then right now we're also seeing a

167
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,319
lot of people who are outside of

168
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,319
afghanistan that just aren't able to

169
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,160
contact people inside because they don't

170
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,479
want to respond they don't want to risk

171
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,680
uh being detected being alerted on

172
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,560
and and possibly taken away so again

173
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,240
we're seeing this kind of

174
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,680
self-censorship

175
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,600
really really come through

176
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,479
um

177
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,960
and unfortunately i expect that we'll

178
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,440
continue to see more of that

179
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,759
so that's all i have i think i finished

180
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,840
up actually a little early and thank you

181
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,280
all for giving me a chance to talk about

182
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,479
something that's not ransomware

183
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,758
very much appreciated
