00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,399
here um sort of following all of these

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:07,759
these really great talks and hopefully

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,719
we will live up to that uh

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,559
that tall order from professor right

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,880
here so my name is ben reed i am the

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,119
director of mandiant's uh cyber

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,880
espionage analysis team

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,640
and my name is gabby ronconi i'm a

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,080
technical analyst on ben's team at

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,039
mandiant and we are talking today about

13
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,439
uncle m51 and the ghost rider operation

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:28,320
um

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,480
but first i wanted to give some

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,719
acknowledgements um this is we obviously

17
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,719
are both on the cyber espionage side a

18
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,880
lot of the work here is from

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,320
mandiant's information operations team

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,800
we've got a couple of them here today um

21
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,559
sam riddell over there and then alice

22
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,600
rivelli david maynor uh

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,600
alden wahlstrom um also did a ton of

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,000
work on this lee foster who is no longer

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,160
with our company but um worked a ton on

26
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,680
this when he was with us as well is here

27
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,760
as well so we're going to talk about io

28
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,520
and just sort of want to make clear that

29
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,039
we're as with

30
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,640
uh we're kind of we're standing on their

31
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,480
shoulders um so we're lucky enough to

32
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,840
present up here but

33
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,680
a lot of the great work was also done by

34
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,680
the mandiant research team um they're

35
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,360
sort of invaluable partners of our

36
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,600
analysis side here and also external

37
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,280
partners who who know who they are

38
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,119
who've really contributed to this um and

39
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,680
so this was infosec is a team sport and

40
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,479
this

41
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,840
this presentation was the work of a lot

42
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,000
of people so if anything's wrong blame

43
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,360
me but if it's good give them the credit

44
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,520
um so we're going to go through kind of

45
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,200
some background who is ghostwriter uncle

46
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,960
1151 how do we track them what do we

47
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,000
think of them

48
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,560
and then get into the attribution um

49
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,079
and then sort of a little bit in

50
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,960
significance take away stuff

51
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,759
all right so first we're going to get

52
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,920
into understanding ghostwriter and uncle

53
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,000
1151 i'm a big scooby-doo fan so you'll

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,680
see a lot of these throughout our talk

55
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,520
um

56
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,880
what is

57
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,720
ghostwriter we all know of the

58
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,479
ghostwriter profession but what we are

59
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,119
talking about is um

60
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,240
the cyber-enabled uh i o campaign with

61
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,840
operations targeting audiences in poland

62
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,960
lithuania latvia and ukraine

63
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,840
these operations push primarily uh

64
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,239
anti-nato themed narratives

65
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,120
and

66
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,200
there are several different components

67
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,560
of ghost writer operations that we track

68
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,040
ghost ghostwriter operations start out

69
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,040
with falsified articles

70
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,599
and these are often com posted on

71
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,319
compromise news website so if you are

72
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,239
one of those people who sits in the

73
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,480
morning with your coffee or your tea

74
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,160
and you're reading through your local

75
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,040
news website on your phone

76
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,120
you might not notice that one of those

77
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,800
articles that you're reading isn't

78
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,120
supposed to be there and that's really

79
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,680
the point they want to make sure that

80
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,400
their falsified articles look legitimate

81
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,360
and so they will post them on compromise

82
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,680
news websites to legitimize them in that

83
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,360
way

84
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,879
they also send these narratives through

85
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,959
direct email dissemination

86
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:01,680
to

87
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,040
media entities press outlets at various

88
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,400
organizations

89
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,080
sometimes just individuals that they

90
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,640
think are interesting

91
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,800
and this these emails contain sort of

92
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,599
snippets of those narratives links to

93
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,519
the falsified articles themselves on

94
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,959
those compromise news websites sometimes

95
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,599
or potentially a link to a blog

96
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,159
in order to sort of have a secondary

97
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,400
source for their falsified falsified

98
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,440
articles

99
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,360
they will either repost some of the

100
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,920
narrative content or rewrite it slightly

101
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,159
basically plagiarizing themselves on a

102
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,239
blog that they hope to look legitimate

103
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,640
and sometimes they'll even

104
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,200
cite these blogs in their initial

105
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,799
falsified article

106
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,799
they'll also use personas some of whom

107
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,360
are inauthentic and some of whom are

108
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,680
impersonating legitimate journalists or

109
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,720
academics or just real people

110
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,519
to

111
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,159
legitimize the articles as well and they

112
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,599
will post them on social media

113
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,319
these ghostwriter operations have a

114
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,200
primarily anti-nato focus and here's a

115
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,720
really good example

116
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,280
of a document that was used in one

117
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,560
operation

118
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,238
that said basically hey lithuania uh you

119
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,680
know we see that kovit is spreading in

120
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,040
your country so nato is just going to

121
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,759
withdraw his troops i i hope that's okay

122
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,680
um and it's a pretty good looking

123
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,280
document you know it's not it's not

124
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,119
really it's not too shabby

125
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,520
but these are really the majority of the

126
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,479
kinds of narratives that we see between

127
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,840
2016

128
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,840
and

129
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,960
mid-2020 uh you can see here on our

130
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,960
little graphic we have a key in case you

131
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,560
don't know your flags but if you if you

132
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,680
don't know your flags you should learn

133
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,880
your flags um

134
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,639
sorry

135
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,160
um

136
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,040
and

137
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,400
these are primarily targeting audiences

138
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,919
in lithuania

139
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,240
sometimes these narratives foray into

140
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,720
domestic political interference so

141
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,800
trying to make the current government of

142
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,120
lithuania look bad in some way but

143
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,080
primarily anti-nato and the anti-nato

144
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,000
narratives that we've seen sort of range

145
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,160
from disparaging the character of nato

146
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,720
allies to

147
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,720
talking about nuclear

148
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,400
weapons or

149
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,160
radioactive spills in lithuania

150
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,600
a couple of my

151
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,520
a couple of the sort of classic

152
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,360
narratives that disparage the nato

153
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,120
allies are

154
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,560
one of them is like related to

155
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,240
carjacking i don't know why they think

156
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,240
that carjacking is the

157
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,320
the moral crux that we all have to live

158
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,759
by um

159
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,080
but they like to say that u.s troops for

160
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,199
example are

161
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,360
carjacking in lithuania we shouldn't

162
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,120
have them here anymore etc so um

163
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,919
that is sort of primarily what we see

164
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,600
but then

165
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,919
i have to go into who uncle 1151 is and

166
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,560
uncle 1151 is an intrusion group

167
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,479
that we have tracked since 2017 they do

168
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,120
cyber espionage operations but they also

169
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,039
have some ghost-like features they also

170
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,240
support

171
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,000
ghostwriter information operations

172
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,960
i'll get into the cyber espionage part

173
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,720
first

174
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,319
but one thing i just want to note before

175
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,240
i go into this graphic is that

176
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,039
um

177
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,919
uncle 1151 primarily uses go fish

178
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,160
infrastructure to

179
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,600
send all of their

180
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,520
their emails regardless of whether they

181
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,479
are espionage related or the direct

182
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,479
email dissemination for

183
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,280
um

184
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,400
ghostwriter operations so

185
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,120
primarily what we see on global51 doing

186
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,479
is sending phishing emails with

187
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,840
malicious links and these lead victims

188
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,479
to credential harvesting websites

189
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,039
this is the bulk of their operations for

190
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,599
sure but occasionally we'll see as well

191
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,039
phishing emails with attachments with

192
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,639
malicious documents

193
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,720
that lead to malware primarily.net

194
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,919
malware

195
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,960
and sometimes we see malware being used

196
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,360
opportunistically so in one case

197
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,000
we actually saw um

198
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,840
when there was a lot of panic in ukraine

199
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,240
about uh coven 19 in the country

200
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,720
the uncle 1151 group clearly took

201
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,560
advantage of that

202
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,759
that panic and sent out a phishing email

203
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,360
with a malicious attachment that would

204
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,000
drop dot net malware that we call half

205
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,639
shell um that claimed to have

206
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,160
information about the pandemic at that

207
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,400
time

208
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,039
primarily these malware operations are

209
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,680
targeting ukraine and lithuania uh sorry

210
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,120
and poland as well

211
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,520
and then you have uncle 1151 sending

212
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,280
benign emails that just have i o

213
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,720
narratives for dissemination

214
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,599
the targets of uncle 1151 um

215
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,240
between 2017 and 2020 specifically

216
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,680
mid-2020

217
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,720
range

218
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,240
kind of greatly

219
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,039
most often we see lithuania ukraine and

220
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,599
poland being targeted and industries

221
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,759
such as government military

222
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,919
media non-profits and political

223
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,840
organizations but sometimes there are

224
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,840
some outliers we've seen

225
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,080
colombia be targeted kuwait being

226
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,080
targeted and we are not really quite

227
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,639
sure what to make of those

228
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,520
the last thing that uncle 1151 does

229
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,199
that's kind of a weird thing i just want

230
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,720
to say briefly is they like sending

231
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,599
bomb threats so these one-off sort of io

232
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:32,799
operations that don't connect to

233
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,000
ghostwriter that are really inflammatory

234
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,120
and scary but we're not sure

235
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,200
why they do that

236
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,719
and in summary

237
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,440
uncle 1151 is an intrusion group that

238
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,240
provides operational support to

239
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,440
ghostwriter operations

240
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,680
so

241
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,360
this popped up it's obviously espionage

242
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,800
targeting in eastern europe there's

243
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,680
information operations and sort of very

244
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,839
familiar with some russia stuff and i'll

245
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,600
get into sort of our sort of more

246
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,279
nuanced views on that

247
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,160
but

248
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,839
we think that this activity does have

249
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,360
some links to belarus and that's kind of

250
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,440
why we're up here trying to

251
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,440
to make this point um

252
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,040
and it is a little bit unusual and i'm

253
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,279
gonna try to take folks through how we

254
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,279
arrived at this conclusion

255
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,240
so

256
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,040
the sort of the this kind these links

257
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,440
started to crystallize for us in

258
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,720
starting really the summer of 2020 um

259
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,200
sort of the activity there and august

260
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,000
2020 is an important date in belarus

261
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,920
because that was when their most recent

262
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,440
elections were and these were heavily

263
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,920
disputed elections there was a opposit

264
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,760
sort of lukashenka has been the

265
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,680
president since 1994 this is probably

266
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,080
the most serious challenge he had

267
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,040
opposition opposition uh sort of outside

268
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,040
observers estimate that the opposition

269
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,279
candidate may have won uh however

270
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,200
lukashenko reported so the government

271
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,839
reported out that he got 80 of the vote

272
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,120
there were any number of people that

273
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,880
were not thrilled about this both within

274
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,880
lithuania and various other places and

275
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,240
so there are protests and then you have

276
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,640
a spiral of crackdowns and then you have

277
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,560
sort of a diplomatic

278
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,959
diplomatic problems here and so that is

279
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,040
you have countries condemning it sort of

280
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,200
start sanctions this gets to where

281
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
belarus is diverting a plane to arrest

282
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,320
somebody who's flying over their

283
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,560
airspace more sanctions

284
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,480
and under that period of stress both

285
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,320
internally and externally we saw a shift

286
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,240
in the information operations whereas

287
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,720
with the sort of up until that time you

288
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,120
see it's it's almost entirely

289
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,640
nato related

290
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,320
but after that you see a lot more and i

291
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,760
know sorry it's hard to read for folks

292
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,839
here in the room um

293
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:38,800
i think

294
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,399
on top is sort of you've seen increase

295
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,000
in domestic political interference and

296
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,079
so this is stuff where they're saying

297
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,800
that the um essentially the ruling

298
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,480
parties primarily of of poland and

299
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,720
lithuania there's corruption they're

300
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,160
they're having problems and on the

301
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,600
bottom you see

302
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
sort of specific criticism of these

303
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,000
countries policies towards belarus so

304
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,519
you have these information operations

305
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,200
narratives i mean they still you know

306
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,120
say bad stuff about nato occasionally

307
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,079
but

308
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,120
uh

309
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,800
these information operations narratives

310
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,279
become increasingly focused on belarus

311
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,720
specific

312
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,440
uh narratives

313
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,519
uh

314
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,880
and so these are some examples of that

315
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,200
so you've got the the the tweet here um

316
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,720
by what we think is likely an actor

317
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,240
controlled account it sort of got taken

318
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,839
down fairly quickly so

319
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,519
our our team wasn't able to make a final

320
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,440
determination but talking that that

321
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,800
poland's spending too much money

322
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,040
supporting the fellow russian uh

323
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,040
extremists and not enough money on sort

324
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,959
of healthcare in poland which i don't

325
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,360
think those are really comparable budget

326
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,880
line items for the polish government but

327
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,480
that was the narrative

328
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,880
and you've got examples here of stuff

329
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,800
published in august of 2020 so right

330
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,720
after things that sort of people

331
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,120
protesting against the belarusian

332
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,040
elections in lithuania they're going to

333
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,600
get coveted they shouldn't protest um

334
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,839
that sort of trying to mess up relations

335
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,440
between poland and lithuania which both

336
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,279
in the nato context and the eu context

337
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,079
is a really crucial diplomatic hub

338
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,120
because they're they're they are the

339
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,839
neighbors of belarus um that this is

340
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,000
going to lead that sort of this

341
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,120
supporting the opposition is going to

342
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,720
lead to russian military intervention so

343
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,880
a lot of narratives sort of specifically

344
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,040
around the belarusian elections and what

345
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,399
peop what folks should do about it

346
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,880
their narratives have also paralleled

347
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,639
and sometimes intermingled with the

348
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,560
other provocative actions taken by

349
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,720
belarus obviously i mean this talk has

350
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,079
been in the works for a while uh

351
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,000
obviously the the

352
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,160
the crisis on the belarus poland border

353
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,399
with with migrants is is awful and has

354
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,360
crested but this sort of the screenshot

355
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,240
here of a compromised polish

356
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,000
sort of municipal website so still very

357
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,120
much

358
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,240
in the pattern of what they've done

359
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,240
before the same ttps but this one is

360
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,240
about a priest that was allegedly

361
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,000
murdered by a

362
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,519
sort of i think an iraqi national they

363
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,240
said who was a migrant um they

364
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,519
not just a migrant but a migrant that

365
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,519
had gone into lithuania and then then

366
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,800
traveled from there in poland so you

367
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,320
have anti-migrant stoking you have kind

368
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,040
of

369
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,000
uh

370
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,079
relationship between the two countries

371
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,720
the media called the priest he is alive

372
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,639
it was pretty quickly debunked

373
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:09,440
um

374
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,040
so these are not always sort of like

375
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,560
long-term

376
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,519
uh

377
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,000
successes but you're also seeing sort of

378
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,240
poland and lithuania urge sort of nato

379
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,480
to send troops into belarus you have

380
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,839
kind of different narratives here sort

381
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,279
of both

382
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,440
playing up the the problems that these

383
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,560
governments are causing with their

384
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,880
anti-belarus things and also sort of in

385
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,560
some cases sort of putting extreme

386
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,360
versions of the threat out there

387
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,120
and we think what one another thing

388
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,600
we've noticed with this is that these

389
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,040
information operations we don't think

390
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,600
are necessarily just to impact the

391
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,160
public in poland or in lithuania but we

392
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,079
see them being funneled back into

393
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,600
belarus so there's been a couple of

394
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,440
ghost writer information misinformation

395
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,040
sort of false stories that have been

396
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,920
reported as fact on belarusian tv

397
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,800
and

398
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,320
i can't speak to the sort of

399
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,920
journalistic standards of bel russia and

400
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,600
state television so it's possible

401
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,880
they're just grabbing anything that

402
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,279
looks friendly um but we've seen we've

403
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,639
seen sort of those narratives posted

404
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,600
there we've also seen uh there's sort of

405
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,519
a extensive campaign of leaking private

406
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,279
document allegedly private documents out

407
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,639
of the polish government we've seen that

408
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,160
heavily featured on dollar russian state

409
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,800
tv we've got screenshots of here and

410
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,880
we've also seen a couple of content from

411
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,760
ghostwriter associated telegram channels

412
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,760
reposted into

413
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,399
pro belarus sort of pro lukashenko

414
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,199
nationalist belarus russian uh telegram

415
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,800
channels and we don't have the

416
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,880
information to say that these telegram

417
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,839
these pro

418
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,399
lukashenka telegram channels are owned

419
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,040
by them it may just be sort of um

420
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,040
again sharing friendly news but there is

421
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,560
some indication that that these

422
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,959
narratives are used to influence

423
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,800
um with really kind of a boomerang

424
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,240
effect we get okay there's this thing in

425
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,760
a polish paper

426
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,839
talking about how poland's so bad so for

427
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,360
the belarusian public you may think that

428
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,880
your foe your government may not be

429
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,720
great but these people who are trying to

430
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,680
undermine us are worse

431
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,399
so in addition to sort of the the

432
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,240
information operation shift the the

433
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,279
targeting sort of in the 2020 2021 time

434
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,399
frame shifted as well um it's become

435
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,480
more sort of a little bit parochial a

436
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,839
little focused on neighboring countries

437
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,440
where we saw as gabby mentioned the the

438
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,600
wider spread earlier um these are just

439
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,160
some examples from of some phishing or

440
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,320
sorry uh spoofing domains that

441
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,480
that we reported i think a few months

442
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,639
ago so you've got some microsoft stuff

443
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,720
um some yahoo stuff some things that are

444
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,000
used pretty widely but then you've got

445
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,600
also got sort of local polish webmail

446
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
providers the polish parliament things

447
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,480
like that

448
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,160
and sort of most interestingly there's

449
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,000
been a lot of targeting that's very

450
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,440
specific to belarus in terms of the

451
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,240
opposition in terms of journalists um

452
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,320
these this targeting really starts in

453
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,000
the spring of 2020 in the lead up to the

454
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,040
election

455
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,600
um in some cases folks who were able to

456
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,279
identify having been targeted were later

457
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,519
arrested or detained by the state so

458
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,959
these are people that are definitely of

459
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,560
interest to the state um it kind of

460
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,839
builds the

461
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,920
profile that this is happening for

462
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,680
for the benefit of the the belarusian

463
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,680
regime

464
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,560
so

465
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,360
um

466
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,279
this is the the annoying part so in

467
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,759
addition to this we have some

468
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,759
technical indicators that some of these

469
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,759
operators are likely based out of minsk

470
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,680
and some may have ties to the belarusian

471
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,120
military

472
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,040
this is i understand this is very much a

473
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,720
pcap or it didn't happen kind of

474
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,880
conference and i don't have that to

475
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,160
share right now

476
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,480
um due to the sort of the sensitivity of

477
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,519
the stuff some of the partners um so i i

478
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,199
am sorry to to come to you with that i

479
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,360
know it's frustrating and i'm not asking

480
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,639
i'm not putting this up here because i'm

481
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,480
trustworthy and i want you to believe me

482
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,120
i'm putting this up here because

483
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,120
this is going to factor into the

484
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,480
assessments that we're going to get into

485
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,839
next and i want to explain where that

486
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:46,880
came from

487
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,399
everybody is welcome to take the public

488
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,160
stuff and come to your own assessments

489
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,839
um do your own research on that we're

490
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,759
happy i'm looking forward to hopefully

491
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,519
more discussion of this these potential

492
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,199
links coming out of this um but just

493
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,560
kind of wanted to

494
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,399
say that we have seen this it's been

495
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,399
sort of directly reviewed we have sort

496
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,360
of

497
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,199
looked at corroborated stuff with second

498
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,039
and third sources there's stuff that has

499
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,079
matched up

500
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,079
um and we think it's strong but i'm not

501
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,480
able to get into details so apologies

502
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,799
for that

503
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,520
so not much is known publicly about

504
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,760
belarusian cyber capabilities and so we

505
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,160
took a deep dive to see where they

506
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,520
showed up in policy and where they

507
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,280
showed up in practice

508
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,280
and in 2014 there was actually a video

509
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,520
that was released publicly on belarusian

510
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,880
state tv

511
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,559
that confirms that the belarusian

512
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,039
military has a defensive cyber

513
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,120
capability now the theme here what

514
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,600
you'll see in the policy

515
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,440
examples that we pull out is that many

516
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,080
of these examples are purely defensive

517
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,799
or could be purely defensive in 2016

518
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,720
again the bel-russian security doctrine

519
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,760
includes the concept of hybrid war now

520
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,559
we see belarus doing hybrid war right

521
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,799
now by weaponizing migrants on their

522
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,760
border with lithuania and now

523
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,480
um in poland

524
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,919
but when they did declare this

525
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,640
security doctrine in 2016 they made note

526
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,000
that they were going to learn from their

527
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,960
neighbors in ukraine and as we know

528
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,120
ukraine has experienced several

529
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,160
different

530
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,960
cyber operations prior to 2016 and since

531
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,240
2016

532
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,559
and thus one can assume that belarus is

533
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,760
probably taking note of those and may

534
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,320
seek to develop capabilities themselves

535
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,559
to prevent things like that happening in

536
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,000
belarus

537
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,080
in 2019 their information security

538
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,760
concept mentions that belarus will

539
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,360
defend its interests using all available

540
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,320
forces and means and in 2021 there's

541
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,160
actually a call to update their national

542
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,559
security concept to account for nato

543
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,799
cyber capabilities so this is something

544
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,440
that belders is clearly aware of and

545
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,080
they're thinking about um but again

546
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,760
framed very defensively here

547
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,440
is it possible that they could have

548
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,520
cyber capabilities in practice though

549
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,039
and one thing about belarus is that they

550
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,679
have a flourishing i.t sector and so

551
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,760
given that they could probably draw from

552
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,840
a pretty experienced pool of talent um

553
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,280
and there's infrastructure in place

554
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,880
there potentially to outsource

555
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,360
capabilities should they need to do that

556
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,520
and in 2018 the bella russian military

557
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,160
announced the creation of an i.t company

558
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,520
to help

559
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,240
develop military capabilities so there's

560
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,559
definitely some of the groundwork there

561
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,200
that's out publicly um

562
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,840
and it is definitely plausible

563
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,039
that these exist

564
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,799
so now to get into sort of specifics of

565
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,960
what were sort of our analytic line and

566
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,400
it is a little bit

567
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,880
nuanced um because you know what would

568
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,640
an analyst if you give if you give

569
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,520
people space they're going to come up

570
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,160
with very specific assessments um but so

571
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,840
what we're saying is uncle 1151 the

572
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,120
intrusion set is linked to belarus

573
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,960
uh with high confidence

574
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,160
so that it is linked um that is because

575
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,679
this you have the specific targeting of

576
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,080
belarusian interests um you have the

577
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,919
links to the ghostwriter campaign which

578
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,280
is also sort of very parochial for

579
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,559
belarus

580
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,240
and we have sort of the technical

581
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,240
indications and they

582
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,679
the the ties to the military things like

583
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,280
that it also matches up with their

584
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,960
targeting they tend to be sort of more

585
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,720
focused on mysteries of defense or

586
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,840
militaries both abroad and sort of the

587
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,440
like the france targeting was the the

588
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,240
french military spoofing domain there so

589
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,919
it all seems to to align there um

590
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,320
the ghost writer is tied to belarus with

591
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,159
moderate confidence and you have a lot

592
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,480
of the similar sort of softer alignments

593
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,520
but

594
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,480
um and i've seen the ties to 1151 um the

595
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,679
technical support that you're getting

596
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:42,799
from this group that we have to have

597
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,600
with high confidence but there are some

598
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,200
questions there with the the content

599
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,000
generation and

600
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,159
i do also want to sort of get into a

601
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,240
little bit of the questions that are

602
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,559
still out there so we think

603
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,400
we think it's very likely that belarus

604
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
is involved there are other countries

605
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,159
we'll get to russia specifically that

606
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,000
that are also plausible plausibly

607
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,240
involved as well so this is the things

608
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,559
we don't know as much about so the io

609
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,480
content has sort of been they've used

610
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,559
seven different languages um a lot of

611
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,840
it's been in neighboring countries it's

612
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,799
obviously there are a lot of people in

613
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,240
belarus i'm sure people people speak

614
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,640
german and lithuanian and russian

615
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,400
there but it's a different skill set

616
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,799
than running an intrusion campaign

617
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,960
um so we don't want to bleed over too

618
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,320
much of having the intrusion campaign

619
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,400
linked very plausible it's the same unit

620
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,240
but it's just something we don't know

621
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,760
the other one is the source of their

622
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,520
malware they have sort of

623
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
interestingly sort of used almost all

624
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,200
custom malware that we haven't seen used

625
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,120
by any other groups

626
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,000
so

627
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,320
again as gabby mentioned they have a i.t

628
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,799
sector sort of malware is just software

629
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,240
that you don't want on your computer

630
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,520
it's not um they certainly have the

631
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,120
capability it's dotnet malware it's

632
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,600
nothing not sort of a zero-day rootkit

633
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,080
or whatever um but it is something that

634
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,440
they possible they're outsourcing

635
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,559
possible they're getting from somewhere

636
00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,360
else

637
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,760
and we just don't don't know there

638
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,760
and the third is the there are a few

639
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,159
operations in pre-2020 that we don't

640
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,039
have kind of an iron-clad

641
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,360
reason for there are sort of columbia

642
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,440
ireland kuwait

643
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,679
um there are plausible explanations for

644
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,240
this uh there may be bilateral sort of

645
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,960
stuff that is not we don't know about um

646
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,960
there may be maybe testing it may be

647
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,320
sort of people caught in the crossfire

648
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,440
there are a couple of things that look

649
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,919
like they were sent to a diplomatic list

650
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,760
that had multiple embassies

651
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,480
uh but it is a question out there and

652
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,919
the big question that leads into is

653
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,200
what is the role if any of russia here

654
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,840
and is this is a joint operation things

655
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,000
like that and so where we are is we

656
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,320
can't rule out russian involvement

657
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,640
especially given the close political

658
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,679
union

659
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,760
the literal political union between

660
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,520
belarus and russia

661
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,799
obviously russia has a long history of

662
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,159
doing intrusion operations and

663
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,000
information operations in

664
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,280
in eastern europe um

665
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,039
however the one thing sort of to

666
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,120
consider is that these are at least post

667
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,000
2020 are politically sensitive infra

668
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,840
operations they are sort of dealing with

669
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,320
belarus's bilateral relations and there

670
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,840
is some friction between belarus and

671
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,200
russia

672
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,320
so

673
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,679
i don't we don't know exactly what this

674
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,640
is um but one thing to note here is we

675
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,679
don't see any overlaps between

676
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,679
the 1151 or the ghost writer activity

677
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:26,720
and other

678
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,240
other cyber espionage information

679
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,520
operations that have been publicly

680
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,200
attributed to russia

681
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,360
um whether that's i mean we've seen sand

682
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,200
worm and sort of tampa armageddon

683
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,679
gamerdon active in ukraine at the same

684
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,240
time as 1151 but they've been distinct

685
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,240
operations that operate distinctively

686
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,080
even sort of their credential

687
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,880
theft operations look differently um

688
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,960
and similarly with io sort of there's

689
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,720
the secondary infection campaign but

690
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,159
this that is distinct from the

691
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,919
ghostwriter campaign

692
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,120
so there's it is its own thing and i we

693
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,799
think it should be operated as sort of

694
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,799
evaluated as such

695
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,360
and again like i said there are a number

696
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,960
of good reasons to suspect russian

697
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,440
involvement we just don't have the hard

698
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,080
evidence there again plausible but i

699
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,960
certainly can't disprove it

700
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,520
so significance and takeaways um i got

701
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,960
one minute and then we will have time

702
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,559
for some questions but sort of three

703
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,159
main points here that i wrote down so

704
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,880
don't forget um and certainly mine isn't

705
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,360
the ours isn't the only presentation to

706
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,279
emphasize this but these types of

707
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,919
intrusion and information operations

708
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,559
campaigns are accessible it is not just

709
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,640
russia and china that can do this um

710
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,400
that's gonna be obviously iran has done

711
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,480
it um it's gonna be driven home later

712
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,320
that we think that this is accessible to

713
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,360
a broader

714
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,000
um range of folks and we're seeing that

715
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,360
now

716
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,039
the second is that

717
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,640
cyber is a tool that is sort of

718
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,240
intrusions are useful for gathering

719
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,480
information but it is but the pivot to

720
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,000
information operations is fairly

721
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,480
straightforward and it's something that

722
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,320
again we'll see i think there are their

723
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,600
presentations later today about um

724
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,520
but it's something i think we can expect

725
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,400
to see more of um and the final thing is

726
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,320
that these are just tools for the

727
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,520
government they do

728
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,760
they use it to accomplish their goals

729
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,640
and

730
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,080
if the leader says hey we need to do

731
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,600
this people are going to use all the

732
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,120
tools available to them so you shouldn't

733
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,880
so cyber operations don't exist in a

734
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,799
vacuum it is happening alongside the

735
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,559
migrant crisis alongside belarus

736
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,159
threatening to cut off gas supplies to

737
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,200
europe so it's important to remember the

738
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,039
geopolitical side of things not just the

739
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,880
sort of the bits and bytes

740
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,080
so

741
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,279
thanks folks

742
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,559
um yeah it looks like we do have a lot

743
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,200
of time questions

744
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,919
hi great talk um to go back to the bits

745
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,200
and bytes even though you said it's not

746
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,960
as important um have you seen them sort

747
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,960
of evolve their whether it's direct

748
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,720
tradecraft in the fishing operations or

749
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,240
their malware capability develop and

750
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,080
mature or has it sort of stayed somewhat

751
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,720
stagnant during your visibility

752
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,799
so we have seen their malware operations

753
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,360
mature somewhat over time um

754
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,320
in

755
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,640
we found some early stuff that they did

756
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,039
um and they uploaded to virustotal some

757
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,039
weird lore documents

758
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,159
um that were pretty rudimentary and they

759
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,559
started off with a

760
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,400
powershell based

761
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,559
backdoor that handled very basic

762
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,960
commands and they sort of evolved into

763
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,400
putting together

764
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,360
more

765
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,760
i guess slightly more built out

766
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,320
dot net malware but it wasn't you know

767
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,559
it was clear that from

768
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,320
from the first sort of instance of

769
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,120
powershell malware that we saw um

770
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,559
that they

771
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,919
they had an idea of what they were doing

772
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,400
they were familiar with with

773
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,120
um at least powershell based frameworks

774
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,880
excellent presentation i just had a

775
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,320
quick question on the degree to which

776
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,919
you guys did comp it sounds like you did

777
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,440
some comparing and contrasting with

778
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,880
known um

779
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:57,440
gru ttps did you do the same for fsb

780
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,080
so we we compared it against all of the

781
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,960
the russia sets um so whether that's 29

782
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,559
or whether that that's other that's sort

783
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,640
of the armageddon or things like that

784
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,960
and yeah um

785
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,480
this these guys just are they're just a

786
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,520
little bit different i mean some of the

787
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,360
things there's overlap they use they use

788
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,840
freenom other people use freenum um

789
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,360
there are kind of some of those things

790
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,000
that do look similar and certainly that

791
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,840
when we first found the first cluster of

792
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,279
phishing commands like oh is this the

793
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,559
next thing from

794
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,880
whoever but it really it's been a

795
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,320
continuous operation since 2017 and so

796
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,960
we that we have as a single cluster

797
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,640
with no overlaps so it's we haven't seen

798
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,000
sort of any picture starts or things

799
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,080
like that

800
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,480
in your slide on the uh appealing to a

801
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,799
belarus public you had something that

802
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,720
was in russian not in belarusian

803
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,480
language but it used the word bilal

804
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,120
russia not be alarus

805
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,039
suggesting it was generated in russia as

806
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,919
far as i know even russian-speaking

807
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:56,559
belarusians

808
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,679
refer to themselves as belarus

809
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,720
that is above my i i took german i that

810
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,880
is above my favorite um we both took

811
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,340
german

812
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,600
[Laughter]

813
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,360
so um happy to talk about this

814
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,799
afterwards um

815
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,000
these are

816
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,120
um

817
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,360
the top left yeah these are screenshots

818
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,000
from um i think the top one is the

819
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,919
television panel yeah it's a telegram

820
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,600
channel so

821
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,279
yeah i mean they're

822
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,320
um

823
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,799
try not to read too too much into

824
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,880
into sort of one specific word um but

825
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,039
we've we've been able to link it to to

826
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,399
the broader operation through through a

827
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:33,919
bunch of different different technical

828
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,760
sides i'm sure the io folks here happy

829
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,960
to to talk about that

830
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,240
do we have any uh final question if not

831
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,440
i just want to

832
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,220
everybody wants lunch

833
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,440
[Music]

834
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,559
quickly

835
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,799
up here and say thank you again to ben

836
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,440
uh gabby but really also to john and to

837
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,760
mandian for especially

838
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,640
uh accepting this talk and making it

839
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,559
make going public with a controversial

840
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,320
finding i'll just remind you that there

841
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,640
are governments some of them were you

842
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,440
know in those flags um that have skin in

843
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,200
the game in this attribution

844
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,600
in this particular case and i think it's

845
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,080
a sign of a more mature conversation in

846
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,760
our space that we can

847
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,159
bring into the public domain a set of

848
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,240
uh empirical findings and forensic

849
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,960
artifacts perhaps at some point that uh

850
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,080
just

851
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,840
make for a better and more nuanced

852
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,360
attribution conversation so thank you

853
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,360
for everyone for doing that

854
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,479
all right thanks folks thank you
