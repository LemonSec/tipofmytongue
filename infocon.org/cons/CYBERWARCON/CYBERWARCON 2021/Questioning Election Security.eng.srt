1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,399
this talk came out from kind of thinking

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,840
of all the questions i get asked about

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,440
election security and my experiences

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,960
doing election security related stuff

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,800
for one of the major platforms so these

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,559
are the five questions i sort of like

7
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,480
dashed off when the cfp came out and

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,400
then i wrote the answers to them in the

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,720
last couple of days and mostly opinion

10
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,720
questions opinion answers but you can at

11
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,760
least know what my answers to these

12
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,960
questions are

13
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,760
so who am i if you don't know me i am in

14
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,320
google's threat analysis group we do

15
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,560
understanding countering serious threats

16
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,119
government-backed threats uh financially

17
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,600
motivated disinfo but it's all about

18
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,920
serious threats and we consider threats

19
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,160
to the election process to elections to

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,440
be some of the most serious threats we

21
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,440
deal with so we put a lot of effort and

22
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,960
energy and prioritize looking at these

23
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,559
threats very heavily and we've been

24
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:45,600
doing this number of years i've been in

25
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,520
this team for over 10 years so i've been

26
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,800
a fewer through a few election cycles in

27
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,039
quite and not just american but other

28
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,559
election cycles

29
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,039
and just a you know last year we

30
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,800
actually came out we were one of the

31
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,640
first people saying that we saw

32
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,840
significant targeting against the

33
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,600
campaign from both

34
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,559
russia

35
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,920
not russia china and iran not russia and

36
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,240
that's we went public with that so

37
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,240
hopefully this says why i'm able to

38
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,000
speak about this topic so the first time

39
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,600
i'd say when you do election security

40
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,320
stuff is welcome to the circus in charge

41
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,119
of like of all the threats we deal with

42
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,479
none gets more attention more focus more

43
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,560
people wanting to be involved more

44
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,119
politicians journalists everybody else

45
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,880
interested in the topic and also more

46
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,560
people just wanting to help

47
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,960
so it turns which can be great it gets

48
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,400
you a lot of resources get you a lot of

49
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,040
energy means you can get things done but

50
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,119
it also means that there's a lot of

51
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,680
churn chaos meetings i've made jokes

52
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,640
that the growth in number of people

53
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,720
having meetings about election security

54
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,399
has grown much faster than the number of

55
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,640
people actually doing election security

56
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,600
so

57
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,040
when you call a cyber attack election

58
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,439
related so basically i'm talking about

59
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,200
this now because not an election major

60
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,439
election year in a major election year i

61
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,600
probably get asked about three times per

62
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,439
day on average what tag is seeing for

63
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,439
election related threats and my flippant

64
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,960
answer is always what do you mean by

65
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,318
election related threats how are you

66
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,679
defining that

67
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:10,800
and

68
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,720
i think it's an important question

69
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,640
because you know at one end you've got

70
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,720
the real purists who want to say that

71
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,319
it's only if you're trying to actually

72
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,160
hack voting machines and election

73
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,080
infrastructure and trying to actually

74
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,680
change votes that's election hacking and

75
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,200
everything else isn't

76
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,120
i don't buy that because like that kind

77
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,959
of knocks out things like dc leaks and

78
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,879
micron leaks and like major cyber

79
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,480
operations from

80
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,920
major governments that actually are

81
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,440
trying to have an effect on the flip

82
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,360
side i've seen people just wanting to

83
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,720
get into the game wanting to get their

84
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,720
pr so anything tangentially related to a

85
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,200
uh elected official also gets kind of

86
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,480
put in this election bucket and i don't

87
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,160
buy that either right like if you think

88
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,840
about it we all know you know the nature

89
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,239
of this conference espionage happens and

90
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,920
people spite on all the time so if some

91
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,000
staff are for some senator who's on an

92
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,920
important committee is being targeted by

93
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,159
a phishing message just because that

94
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,519
senator happens to be up for election

95
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,120
like a lot of the senators doesn't mean

96
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,800
it's election related especially if it's

97
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,959
part of a broader campaign so i draw the

98
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,640
line that there has to be some sort of

99
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,200
plausible understanding of the operation

100
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,040
and what's going on to say that this is

101
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,319
related to the election and not the

102
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,159
background before i call it because if

103
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,080
you call everything related election

104
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,400
related nothing is

105
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,080
this question i wrote the question as i

106
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,680
said like a couple of months back

107
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,640
unfortunately i don't think i had the

108
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,640
answer to it yet where is the line

109
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,280
between politics and disinformation um i

110
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,480
like the hacking side more than the

111
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,000
disinformation side

112
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,360
you're either hacking or you're not

113
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,799
right like you're the sufficient message

114
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,560
it's a phishing message it's not i look

115
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,159
at a youtube video going is this

116
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,720
disinformation is this politics like i

117
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,159
don't do the policy side but it's a lot

118
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,239
more complicated we have like this an

119
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,159
example from spamoflash dragon of you

120
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,319
know one of the 50 000 channels we've

121
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,239
taken down from spamoflash dragon only

122
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,720
small very tiny number of political but

123
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,080
we took this down under coordinated

124
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,480
influence operations um in authentic

125
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,239
behavior so it's coordinated it's

126
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,080
inauthentic it's to do with politics

127
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,680
it's easy to take down but there's a lot

128
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,879
more

129
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,879
complicated cases right state-sponsored

130
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,920
media people using pr firms one of the

131
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,680
big challenges there's a great evolution

132
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,280
in this space that's not all internet

133
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,760
research agency from

134
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,760
2016 2000 2016

135
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,560
we now actually have like adapting and

136
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,478
people straddling that line so expect a

137
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,400
lot more work in this policy space so i

138
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,440
don't have a clear answer about where

139
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,199
the line is but kind of you know when

140
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,560
you see it

141
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,160
and kind of theme of the conference as

142
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,560
of today is it always the russians um

143
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,440
and yet no it is not always the russians

144
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,280
um

145
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,720
you know of all the things we saw last

146
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,919
year um we looked at this as well and

147
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:40,800
seeing

148
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,840
like

149
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,680
this report come in of voters being

150
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,360
threatened by

151
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,280
by you know spoofed email accounts

152
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,639
claiming to be the proud boys telling

153
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,560
them about email telling them about you

154
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,840
know threats and not the votes

155
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,600
but i did not predict that at the same

156
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,720
time i was actually looking at two

157
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,160
things that night and for some reason i

158
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,360
was personally doing some analysis for

159
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,600
once instead of doing management and

160
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,880
these two things i was looking at once

161
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,639
suddenly converged that my like iranian

162
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,080
infrastructure and this like um proud

163
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,759
boys threats became the same thing and

164
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,080
we were able to independently attribute

165
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,600
this to iran and that was not on my

166
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,840
bingo card for 2020. but even then do we

167
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,400
know the real intent here like was it to

168
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,720
actually do the threat was it to make it

169
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,080
look like there was more internal

170
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,280
threats

171
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,360
intent is tricky even if it's more

172
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,199
tricky than attribution

173
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,440
and again as i pointed out before like

174
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,759
when we actually saw phishing

175
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,320
going towards campaigns

176
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,240
it wasn't russia everybody was rushing

177
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,600
about the entire year thinking that it

178
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,080
was going to be apt-28 everyone was just

179
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,280
saying that it was going to be a big

180
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,120
repeat of 2016

181
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,520
but no what we actually saw and observed

182
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,880
with regards to the phishing attacks

183
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,400
against campaigns

184
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,520
was iran and china and again they were

185
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,919
not successful as far as we know but and

186
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,840
do we know the intent was it espionage

187
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,520
was it influence

188
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,199
but it's something we had we came out

189
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,639
with and you know went public with

190
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,840
because we thought it was an important

191
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,600
part of the conversation

192
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,240
is it always a government-backed actor

193
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,039
um

194
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:09,840
so

195
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,120
people really care about election

196
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,039
security and people get very on edge i'd

197
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:13,919
say

198
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,280
you know people who are like on the

199
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,039
firing lines they're kind of like you

200
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,560
know the little kids sitting on their

201
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,759
bed with the blanket over their head

202
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,680
every time they see a shadow they think

203
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,520
it's a monster and every time they get

204
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,440
some sort of like weirdness on their

205
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,759
computer they think it's apt 28 coming

206
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,560
back

207
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,840
so

208
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,840
you know we've like

209
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,039
just because you're in a campaign

210
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,720
doesn't mean you're suddenly exempt from

211
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,360
getting nigerian phishing emails or like

212
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,440
weird marketing stuff or everything else

213
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,440
that happens on the internet so we have

214
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,360
we track down a lot of those but i think

215
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,639
it's great like it's really good that we

216
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,919
are looking very closely and we should

217
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,680
look very closely but it's a sign we

218
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,840
have to be very careful because jumping

219
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,000
to conclusions here really hurts

220
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,680
and so this is like one of the ultimate

221
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,080
examples that we come across here is

222
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,240
that this was

223
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,160
somebody fishing

224
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,199
uh

225
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,520
this is a phishing campaign against

226
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,720
uh i think it was in the primaries

227
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,880
against presidential candidates sending

228
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,479
them to like i think

229
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,759
google docs will form something which

230
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,080
was trying to steal credentials and you

231
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,080
know some us government folks at least

232
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,599
one of the sort of like security

233
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,080
companies here we're kind of going down

234
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
like yeah we think this is ap28 because

235
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,520
they're doing fishing

236
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,319
side note this comes up a lot

237
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,000
um there seems to be a lot of people and

238
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,440
who've come to me in very different

239
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,000
forms saying we're seeing a threat actor

240
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,080
going after political targets sending

241
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,160
them to face login pages therefore we

242
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,880
think it's russia

243
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,560
break if anyone doesn't realize that

244
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,080
every single nation just about this

245
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,240
doing threat act is using that ttp

246
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,919
that's not enough to do attribution but

247
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,199
in this case we were actually able to

248
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,360
see the attribution and it subsequently

249
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,759
came out publicly in this indictment it

250
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,160
was actually a you know

251
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,720
18 or 19 year old making some kind of

252
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,280
poor life just choices here to send this

253
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,039
out and they were like

254
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,479
for some reason decided this would be a

255
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,479
good thing to do and play this game and

256
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,319
yeah it was a 19 year old mcdonald's

257
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,720
worker not apt 28 and that subsequently

258
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,360
came out but quite luckily we were like

259
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,440
we and others were able to work that out

260
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,440
but imagine the media cycle if it had

261
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,560
come out that this was apt 28 and

262
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,520
somebody would jump to that other

263
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,879
conclusion

264
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:19,840
so what do you do when you find

265
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,400
something this is a tough question be

266
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,879
prepared for it um i'd say the main

267
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,479
thing you have to do is like you know

268
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,639
strap in you're in for a ride because if

269
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,360
you find something you suddenly like as

270
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,279
a platform especially we're sort of

271
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,958
under the obligation like as i said

272
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,719
we're asked by a lot of serious people

273
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,240
many times a day whether we've seen

274
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,000
something so the day that went from no

275
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,479
to yes we knew we actually had to go

276
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,040
public and say something about it but

277
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,240
whenever you say something about

278
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,440
election security especially if you're

279
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,720
coming from some sort of position of

280
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,640
power like being a major platform you

281
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,560
are going to be injecting yourself into

282
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,560
the new cycle in an election

283
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,399
and i'll tell you what like the one

284
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,320
thing campaigns are trying to do is

285
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,720
control their news cycle so if you were

286
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,240
saying something you were getting into

287
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,480
the new cycle and potentially messing up

288
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,320
these careful plans about how they want

289
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,760
the new cycle to go

290
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,480
so

291
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,399
my biggest advice is make sure that you

292
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,000
can stand by everything you say and that

293
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,800
you're right um it's not the time to

294
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,040
like take some really marginal evidence

295
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,959
and jump to some conclusions to get a pr

296
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,800
cycle i think it'll blow up on you but

297
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,120
the other thing i can say is just be

298
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,399
you know work out what you're going to

299
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,320
do be principled about it in our case

300
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,320
our principles were that we thought this

301
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,839
was going to become public it had to

302
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,200
become public

303
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,279
we knew it would leak around so we did

304
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,279
inform the people being targeted but we

305
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,320
believe we had to get that into the

306
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,839
public conversation and then you just

307
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,839
have to stand by your principles and you

308
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,600
know you're going to get criticism like

309
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,200
everybody thinks that they should be

310
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,440
given a heads up and be told first but

311
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,880
by definition if you tell everybody

312
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,480
first you're basically just making it

313
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,720
public so you have to make your calls

314
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,880
live by it and take the criticism and

315
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,640
just hope to do the right thing

316
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,600
so

317
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
with all that that's sort of my rough

318
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,440
rundown of like some of the ways that

319
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,560
i've been thinking about election

320
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,120
security how we see it um hopefully if

321
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,800
any of you involved in that maybe it's

322
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,680
useful as we go into the future election

323
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,599
cycles god help us thank you
