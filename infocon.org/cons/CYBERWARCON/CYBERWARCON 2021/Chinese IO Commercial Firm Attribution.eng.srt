1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,800
yes respectful of everyone's time we

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,319
made a little bottom line upfront

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,879
summary of what to expect on this talk

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,000
today we're doing a tactical look at one

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,679
specific company

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,120
but

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,960
you can use the workflow that we showed

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,400
today to investigate any company uh

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,680
and use it for multiple disinfo

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,960
investigations

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,439
also there's some overlap with um

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:24,800
i wasn't expecting this but from the

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,279
lightning talks mike and david at meta

14
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,119
mentioned some stuff about uyghur

15
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,760
activist groups being targeted and shane

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,440
at uh google mentioned spamoflos dragon

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,000
and uh we see some instances of both of

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,360
those in our research today and um

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,719
yeah so we're gonna be going over

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,039
disinfecta attribution we're going to be

21
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,800
looking at how to look at marketing

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,160
firms and advertising firms that are

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,039
working

24
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,160
and doing this info on behalf of

25
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:52,960
of

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,879
countries and we're going to be pivoting

27
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,440
off of some brief data and this is the

28
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,199
investigation workflow and this should

29
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,239
be the

30
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,879
china flag emoji which got broken up in

31
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,199
whatever conversion we use so apologies

32
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,119
for that

33
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,280
so who am i i've been at niso's for

34
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,119
about a year and a half doing a counter

35
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,479
info investigations as a security

36
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,479
researcher i also am a digital

37
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,320
sherlock's fellow at the atlantic

38
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,400
council of the dfr lab i've previously

39
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,799
worked at immunity inc and i am a

40
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,560
university of miami kane so go keynes

41
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,240
so uh disinformation investigations

42
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,439
there's no one side fits all uh at nisos

43
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,880
we have a lot of different tools that we

44
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,320
can use to

45
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,119
investigate this info and um just

46
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,880
depends on customer requirements really

47
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,720
like what we're trying to do but for

48
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,560
this talk today we're going to be using

49
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,759
a

50
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,439
narrative tool such as social listening

51
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,200
tools we're going to be looking at

52
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,399
outlets

53
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,119
domain registration data dns data we're

54
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,560
going to be using social network

55
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,320
analysis tools and looking at digital

56
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,920
footprint collection

57
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,399
we have some spicy stuff like uh mobile

58
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,799
app tech data and netflow data at nisos

59
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,560
but it's not used for this research

60
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,320
yeah

61
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,200
so

62
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,038
when it comes to narratives about china

63
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,318
this is something that i track a lot of

64
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,480
my free time um

65
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,640
we there was a narrative last year uh in

66
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,080
the last months of the trump

67
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,480
administration mike pompeo at the state

68
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,200
department uh delisted the east

69
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,800
turkistan islamic movement which is

70
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,879
a group that china uses to justify their

71
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,120
crackdowns on weaker muslims throughout

72
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,959
china and justify their global war on

73
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,360
terror so with mike pompeo delisting

74
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,440
them it kind of was a middle finger to

75
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,680
china and uh

76
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,680
china was not happy because they used

77
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,239
this group as a justification for

78
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,400
everything that they're doing so

79
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,160
i figured hey this isn't something that

80
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,519
a lot of people really know or talk

81
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,640
about in english language social media

82
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,840
content

83
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,640
um

84
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,080
so who's going to be talking about this

85
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,040
online

86
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,280
uh we call this a narrative so

87
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,680
narratives can be very broad or niche

88
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,120
depends what you're trying to look up if

89
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,640
you're trying to investigate like kobe

90
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,560
19 disinformation online

91
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,920
that's a narrative that's like very

92
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,519
broad everyone's talking about it

93
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,400
because everyone's life has been

94
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,280
affected by coven but that's not a good

95
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,680
narrative to do your research on if

96
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,000
you're trying to do attribution so

97
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,480
the e-circus on islamic movement

98
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,959
uh d-listing is a very niche narrative

99
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,640
that we uh

100
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,560
actually found this info pretty easily

101
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,760
uh

102
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,599
earlier this year

103
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,959
so

104
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,040
back to tools uh and this is not a plug

105
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,959
for melt water this is just an example

106
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,480
to show you guys like how does this work

107
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,760
actually happen

108
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,200
at a company like nissos and other

109
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,720
disinfo companies

110
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,959
melt water is a social listing tool that

111
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,760
lets you search specific keywords

112
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,680
in mass across social media sites so you

113
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,760
don't have to do manual searches on

114
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,400
twitter on facebook or any other social

115
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,159
media site or blog space that you're

116
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,480
trying to investigate so

117
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,239
uh there's so many tools that can do

118
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,159
this kind of work and i don't even know

119
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,239
if this type of tool works anymore but

120
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,680
uh this is what we use for the research

121
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,360
and just wanted to show you guys

122
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,760
step by step how how this the sausage is

123
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,799
made so here i did a search

124
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,400
of etim and china to see who's talking

125
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,360
about

126
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,640
the topic that we discussed as our

127
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,519
narrative

128
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,320
and uh the load of filtering i filtered

129
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,440
out twitter results and we're just

130
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,358
looking at facebook

131
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,160
posts and comments related to this topic

132
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,240
so melt water is picking up people

133
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,160
mentioning both of these keywords and as

134
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,759
you can see majority of this is like

135
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,320
body comments on mainstream media

136
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,280
outlets like dw and rfi

137
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,280
going through these results uh i saw

138
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,120
something really strange

139
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,199
so i read a lot of news and there was

140
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,680
one outlet i did not recognize that had

141
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,280
a very big reach

142
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,840
and it's called teahouse

143
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,240
and unlike the other results it's not a

144
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,120
comment as an original post so i'm like

145
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,199
what the hell is this like it has

146
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,320
4.5 million views i mean likes

147
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,479
and i've never heard of this

148
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,600
so

149
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,160
we go to the post that this uh that is

150
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,080
pointing to from our tool and we look at

151
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,199
it directly

152
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,880
so some of the things that we found

153
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,560
suspicious from this post

154
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,919
and keep this in mind if you're doing

155
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,840
disinfo investigations you want to think

156
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,280
like this because you don't want to go

157
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,880
down random rabbit holes about

158
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,919
narratives that are not specific or

159
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,520
posts that are just like body looking

160
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,039
because you think it's russia or china

161
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,960
like you have to be you have to be very

162
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,840
conscious of your time so for this post

163
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,639
we can see that unlike the other

164
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,720
results of our tool it's an original

165
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,800
post not a comment

166
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,320
we can't write we don't really recognize

167
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,960
this mainstream media outlet

168
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,560
in the us

169
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,160
the actual post is a very high

170
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,560
production value video that is talking

171
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,160
about this very specific narrative from

172
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,639
a pro-china angle filmed in london by

173
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,840
someone who claims to be a muslim

174
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,160
activist that i'm not familiar with and

175
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,560
so this actor is in this video made for

176
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,759
teahouse

177
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,440
and uh

178
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,120
another strange thing is a tea house

179
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,880
like we had seen in the previous slide

180
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,440
had 4.4 million likes

181
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,319
and the post only has 79 likes and i

182
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,680
don't know about you guys but i've got

183
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,840
like 400 instagram followers and i get

184
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,759
more likes on my posts than this

185
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,120
facebook page so that's kind of

186
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,639
suspicious

187
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,440
so uh when we follow the page to the the

188
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,680
post to the page that originates from we

189
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,240
find a uh commercial firm

190
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,319
so we see that on the page transparency

191
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,039
for this page it says that it's run

192
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,800
by some company that's responsible for

193
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,520
it in mandarin and in english and i'm

194
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,160
not fluent in mandarin at all so i do

195
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,840
what the rest of us do

196
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,000
and i just google it

197
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,280
so

198
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,199
when we google this we get a domain

199
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,039
young

200
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,160
hotend.cn and depending on where your

201
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,160
computer is coming from it'll redirect

202
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,880
you to onesite.cn or onesite.com so

203
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,960
that's the commercial firm that we're

204
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,360
investigating uh today

205
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,280
there's a lot of osint that i did on

206
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,440
that company looking at their website

207
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,520
directly what one side does is uh they

208
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,240
do a lot of legitimate marketing and pr

209
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,240
for chinese products and e-commerce

210
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,400
outside of china so like on

211
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,479
places like youtube facebook instagram

212
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,039
twitter etc so

213
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,360
on the outside it's a very legitimate

214
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,319
company

215
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,800
but we found a lot of uh

216
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
of their activity was doing a lot of

217
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,080
government just info that donate they

218
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,880
don't even talk about publicly so

219
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,960
we discovered the marketing firm and now

220
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,360
we're going to go to the next section so

221
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,800
i'm not going to stand up here and admit

222
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,199
to a cfa violation because it's illegal

223
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,479
to hack companies

224
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,199
but

225
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,120
we don't have to worry about doing that

226
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,440
if some other person or group

227
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,720
hacks the company that we're

228
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,400
investigating so last year last august

229
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,639
there was a hacktivist group called ccp

230
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,800
unmasked and what they did is that they

231
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,280
hacked one site and two other chinese

232
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,120
social media monitoring firms

233
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,879
and dumped a ton of data on them such as

234
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,800
like screenshots of their tools screen

235
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,160
recordings of what's happening

236
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,919
internally internal communications like

237
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,039
memos

238
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,000
and

239
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,280
they just dumped it online because they

240
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,280
wanted people to investigate it

241
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,919
uh ccp unmasked we don't know who that

242
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,680
is kind of like the talk about intrusion

243
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,560
truth

244
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,000
they just did this dump and they haven't

245
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,240
been attributed to any other uh

246
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,560
hacktivist campaigns that i'm aware of

247
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,800
so we went ahead and we obtained some of

248
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,080
the

249
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,280
hack materials that they have and the

250
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,599
the hacktivist had logged into

251
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,160
one site's internal tools and dashboards

252
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,559
and took screen recorded videos of

253
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,559
what the hell was happening and what we

254
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,479
have is an extremely

255
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,200
complex and sophisticated social media

256
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,200
management tool that allows for mass

257
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,000
posting from multiple personas and

258
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,959
accounts

259
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,880
so just breaking this down a little bit

260
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,360
more granularly we have that

261
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,200
uh there's a field in the middle where

262
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,320
you can search through accounts that

263
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,240
have already been created by you like

264
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,760
for their names or

265
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,040
industry or

266
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,800
different attributes and then we have

267
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,399
the table on the bottom that lists the

268
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,360
actual

269
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,680
uh personas with an id number that's

270
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,839
internal and links to external selectors

271
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,640
like emails phone numbers etc so this is

272
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,240
kind of like a gold mine for us as a

273
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,839
disinfo investigator because attribution

274
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,680
is very difficult when you go from

275
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,080
content to actor but here we have

276
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,839
attributes that are directly

277
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:18,720
uh

278
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,200
attributable to a specific organization

279
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,680
so we can play with this a lot and we'll

280
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,760
show that later in the presentation

281
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,399
but this tool in general um

282
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,399
very sophisticated uh software that they

283
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,040
built and assa nisos we got one of our

284
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,200
chinese linguists to translate every

285
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,200
single frame of the video so if any of

286
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,720
you guys are interested in that or a

287
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,880
full selector list from this research

288
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,399
please see me personally because i will

289
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,839
not email this to someone i haven't met

290
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,519
at this conference

291
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,560
and we'll provide that but the

292
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,240
important thing is we have all these

293
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,519
personas

294
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,720
that are posting on social media and

295
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,279
they have their phone numbers and email

296
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,360
addresses that we can pivot off of and

297
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,399
look into

298
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,680
and if you want to have some fun look at

299
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,519
this unique domain that's the one above

300
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,160
qq

301
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,680
so every single persona in this uh tool

302
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,120
it's kind of like a real person they

303
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,519
have multiple social media accounts uh

304
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,560
and

305
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,279
it's really easy to use uh because

306
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,640
they'll list out like what's the

307
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,160
quantity of facebook accounts connected

308
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,120
to what's the quantity of twitter

309
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,480
accounts instagram linkedin youtube etc

310
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,680
it also has the selector that it was um

311
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,920
assigned to like the phone number it has

312
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,000
a and really interesting it also has the

313
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,320
ip address and timestamp so if you have

314
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,120
any

315
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,880
interest in pivoting off of that with

316
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,640
netflow data you can go and have some

317
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,880
fun

318
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,279
for the sake of time like i said there's

319
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,800
a lot of features that we were not able

320
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,279
to uh to show you today but one of the

321
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,720
most interesting things was near the end

322
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,480
of the video there are a lot of

323
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,399
sections of this tool

324
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,720
that imply uh social media surveillance

325
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,720
and other sophisticated features

326
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,560
this is just a mapping of

327
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,320
chinese on the right to english on the

328
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,200
left

329
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,279
and uh they appear to have some sort of

330
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,000
a

331
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,160
tool that can look at how facebook

332
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,120
operations are happening granularly they

333
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,560
have uh

334
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,880
some sort of feature to look at how

335
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,959
accounts in their network are performing

336
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,959
and potentially like

337
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,640
surveillance of specific accounts on

338
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,120
facebook um and it's not just limited to

339
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,959
that platform there's a lot of different

340
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,480
social media networks that they're

341
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,640
active on and this is just limited to

342
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,200
what the hacktivist was able to film and

343
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,040
exfiltrate before they're potentially

344
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,560
kicked out

345
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,880
so like i had promised since we have

346
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,959
selectors from the video

347
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,440
we can go ahead plug those in to social

348
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,120
media sites and see what the hell are

349
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,959
these accounts posting about

350
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,360
we can see that the personas that this

351
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,720
company has set up

352
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,160
uh

353
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,279
some of them

354
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,200
they they're in two themes one of the

355
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,560
teams are just fake people the others

356
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,959
are fake companies uh this company for

357
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,959
example is a company that sells ppe

358
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,959
equipment and most of their posts are

359
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,200
about ppe equipment but in between

360
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,920
the posts they have a lot of like videos

361
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,720
and propaganda videos that are anti-us

362
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,959
for example on covet narratives and pro

363
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,160
china anti-trump and this is pretty

364
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,760
suspicious because like a ppe company

365
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,720
has no

366
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,120
use of like posting this and that's why

367
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,279
we we get to some of the overlap with uh

368
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,440
spamoflash dragon which isn't

369
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,839
attributable to a specific company but

370
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,279
it it rhymes a little bit with some of

371
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,880
the video content that other researchers

372
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,040
have talked about

373
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,279
uh another investigation uh pivot point

374
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,480
that i just wanted to show you guys in

375
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,600
the room since a lot of you do

376
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,519
investigate this is since we have one

377
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,959
twitter account this is being the

378
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,279
twitter account from the pve company

379
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,279
we're gonna and we have one domain that

380
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,399
was uh

381
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,240
mentioned in the website on the video

382
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,320
hack video we can use some tools like

383
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,480
risk iq to plug in that twitter account

384
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,920
and see hey what other domains are

385
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,839
connected to this thread actor and we go

386
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,440
from like one data point to

387
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,680
six new domains so

388
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,200
if you're trying to scale like very

389
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,000
attributable selectors uh this is just

390
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,959
one example we did a lot of oceans uh on

391
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,480
this and i can talk all day about how

392
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,160
many hours i've spent on this but that's

393
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,480
just one uh one interesting tidbit not

394
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,519
many of you

395
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,959
i'm not sure if many of you have used

396
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,079
this

397
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,160
uh some of the twitter personas that

398
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,839
were used in this operation for example

399
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,279
this is a person

400
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,279
and it was a very old account which has

401
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,120
very benign content

402
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,959
on the left it was pretty dormant and

403
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,040
then during cove it started posting all

404
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,880
this kobe 19 this information and

405
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,800
linking to chinese state media on

406
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,880
youtube and talking about

407
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,320
you know how

408
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,200
you know

409
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,120
the or disputing the origins of covet

410
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,279
19.

411
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,880
another persona which is still active

412
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,160
and you can go follow on twitter right

413
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,399
now as this account that claims to be

414
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,600
from taiwan

415
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,639
um

416
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,040
and it has quite a significant following

417
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,399
and uh

418
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,720
after the fall of kabul uh tweeted about

419
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,720
how you know the us is weak and you know

420
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,680
they got defeated by the taliban and

421
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,359
follows the same anti-us narrative

422
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,000
if uh you guys are in the room and if

423
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,920
you just want to get more selectors off

424
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,639
of

425
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,560
really solid selectors we know that

426
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,399
we can do password resets and kind of

427
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,600
interpolate

428
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,839
what email addresses potentially belong

429
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,000
to a specific account we're looking at

430
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,880
so for the akanda taiwan we're able to

431
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,959
guestimate that it's probably the

432
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,440
account handle at gmail.com and plug

433
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,360
into that into google we do get back the

434
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,360
google id and it matches with the name

435
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,680
and location of the account and then

436
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,160
this other account i wasn't able to

437
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,600
figure out what domain that is so if any

438
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,040
of you guys have any ideas let me know

439
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,000
after the

440
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,800
uh conference but this one was suspended

441
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,519
so

442
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,639
you can't really do much with this

443
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,690
account anymore

444
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:40,959
[Music]

445
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,279
uh when we go on like facebook for

446
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,560
example looking at this firm uh this

447
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,079
profile here qn was a a persona built to

448
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,760
boost the ppe company that was shown in

449
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,360
the previous slides

450
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,240
and

451
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,959
even its posts on facebook

452
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,279
were also like covet 19

453
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,560
narratives from china that are anti-us

454
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,160
anti-imperialist

455
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,320
anti and this one here is talking about

456
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,120
how

457
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,120
the russian vaccine is good

458
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,360
and what's really interesting is that if

459
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,800
we go to the friend list for this

460
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,680
account

461
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,440
it has a lot of like accounts that

462
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,920
either look farmed or body or just

463
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,440
really suspicious for example there's a

464
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,240
jammu and kashmir profile which is not a

465
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,680
friend like that's not a person that's

466
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,000
conflict and it has a pro pakistan like

467
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,480
flag on it so like you go down a rabbit

468
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,839
hole looking at each of these profiles

469
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,120
and saying hey are they doing i o

470
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,120
related to southeast asia related to

471
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,040
other muslim countries are these like

472
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,480
laying dormant

473
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,560
what's the what's happening

474
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,240
so

475
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,920
that's just some food for thought uh

476
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,920
there are people like we we also don't

477
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,120
know if

478
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,639
these accounts were built by the same

479
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,440
actor that set up qn persona or if they

480
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,600
were bought on the e-crime marketplace

481
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,480
um

482
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,320
so this just some unknowns that we don't

483
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,839
know but we do know it's these are all

484
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,160
friends of an account that we know is

485
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,800
attributable to one site

486
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,120
and then this is supposed to be uh the

487
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,199
chinese emoji flag emoji

488
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,759
uh but yeah there's a direct attribution

489
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,959
to the chinese government i'll show you

490
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,839
how

491
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,680
so in 2019 pro

492
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,600
publica did some great research where

493
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,040
they're looking at

494
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,480
pretty much the equivalent of fed biz

495
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,560
ops or gsa over here in the us on the

496
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,959
federal contracting side but in china

497
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,639
and looking at companies that were

498
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,680
providing um

499
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,959
digital services to the chinese

500
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,440
government so they found that

501
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
chinese government was paying

502
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,880
in chinese currency

503
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,480
money to one site

504
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,279
to uh boost

505
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,880
the twitter following of china new

506
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,560
service which is a state controlled

507
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,759
media outlet in china and they were paid

508
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,440
like around like 175 k us dollars for an

509
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,720
operation lasting a certain period

510
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,480
within 2019 and

511
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,240
one site when you do ocean on them when

512
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,920
you look at their website they never

513
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,199
talk about the government customer so

514
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,959
this is not something that they

515
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,440
publicize or overtly talk about

516
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,559
and we're able to look at more

517
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,599
government contracts on china's

518
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,959
system for posting info like that and uh

519
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,839
potentially find other firms however

520
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,959
funny enough

521
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,359
unlike gsa or fed bizops

522
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,119
which doesn't delete data china

523
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,559
immediately deleted all the contract

524
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,520
data once uh people had reported on it

525
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,520
so this just gives you a sense of scale

526
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,000
of how much money is potentially at

527
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,160
stake by the people helping enable

528
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,039
information operations in china this is

529
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,080
like almost 200 000 for like one chinese

530
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,919
news service and there's like

531
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,840
over 30 of them and this is only on

532
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,400
twitter for a certain amount of time so

533
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,760
you know you can kind of enumerate you

534
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,039
can do your own like approximation of

535
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,240
how many companies there are what's the

536
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,919
average contract cost and what are all

537
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,440
the platforms you're interested in and

538
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,960
get a guesstimate of how much potential

539
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,440
money is at is potentially available for

540
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,360
chinese companies doing this to like

541
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,400
compete in the i o space

542
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,559
so again the key takeaways uh that i

543
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,799
hope you guys learned is that we can do

544
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,080
this info actor attribution uh by going

545
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,280
from content to actor

546
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,840
we can uh investigate companies that are

547
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,520
doing

548
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,720
uh

549
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,799
the i o marketing

550
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,120
on on behalf of governments like we

551
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,039
showed on mouthwater and that page was

552
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,559
run by one site

553
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,120
we can show that uh and this being very

554
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,400
new because no one had talked about this

555
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,240
tool like some of the tools that these

556
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,679
companies will build if they're very

557
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,280
technically sophisticated to enable

558
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,720
their io

559
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,120
and a little fun bit about how do you

560
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,280
pivot off of hacked data because when

561
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,799
one site when

562
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,880
ccp unmasked release their data dump it

563
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,720
was just data and they're desperately

564
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,320
looking for researchers to pivot off of

565
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,000
it and find some stuff that later could

566
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,200
be reported on

567
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,000
so

568
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,080
brief data is very cool and just like

569
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,840
with some of the other talks we had seen

570
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,360
today you can do a lot with it just got

571
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,520
to keep an eye on which countries or

572
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,600
types of brief data do you want to look

573
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,200
at for whatever your organization's

574
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,400
working on combating or investigating

575
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,600
and and yeah you can follow this

576
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,760
workflow for multiple countries and

577
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,960
types of disinfo projects

578
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,400
some other reporting

579
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,559
uh on one site that just wanted to let

580
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:13,760
you guys know

581
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,080
there is a new york times article that

582
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,679
looked at the

583
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,240
memos included in the data dumps kind of

584
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,240
like organizationally how is this info

585
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,760
being paid for and spread

586
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,200
which i think is really cool because if

587
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,640
you understand the process it may be

588
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,720
easier to combat at scale if they're

589
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,000
persistent

590
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,880
then

591
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,320
there is a reporting by propublica on

592
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,559
twitter operations that they attributed

593
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,400
to one site however their attribution is

594
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,440
not

595
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,240
that

596
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,640
solid and i would uh i would be very

597
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,840
cautious about attributing something

598
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,360
publicly unless you can prove it really

599
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,520
well because that does just that just

600
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,280
does injustice if like

601
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,280
the accounts aren't run by an entity

602
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,120
people will just say you're fake news

603
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,160
and

604
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,720
the other the other companies that were

605
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,640
included in the in the league data that

606
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,440
ccp on mass had hacked there was also a

607
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,440
company called you run big data and it

608
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,760
was a company called analysis and one of

609
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,919
the slides company slides that you run

610
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,400
had for the twitter ops was this where

611
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
they list social media as weapons and

612
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,000
they created this infographic with the

613
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,280
twitter icon

614
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,039
guns saying you know your enemy is gonna

615
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,280
you know like this this is just

616
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,120
bringing attention to what these people

617
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,320
are doing and what their actual

618
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,360
intentions are if they're making

619
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,559
marketing material like this to the

620
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:29,840
government customers

621
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,679
they're not good people and we should do

622
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,120
our best to combat this to protect

623
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,640
audiences online and make sure they're

624
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,320
not being influenced by

625
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,159
foreign actors that are

626
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,840
faking engagement and content online

627
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,640
so any any questions or comments i do

628
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,360
have an email address and twitter so you

629
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,280
can tweet me or follow me

630
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,960
if you want any data please see me in

631
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,880
person at this conference

632
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,559
just because of uh some risky data but

633
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,760
uh but yeah i'm all ears for what you

634
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,740
guys want to hear

635
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,080
[Applause]

636
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,039
so i was wondering if you could

637
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,760
elaborate a little on the spammer flag

638
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,320
related activity you saw did you see

639
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,559
some of that being conducted by

640
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,880
this specific organization or

641
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,280
what were the kind of overlaps there

642
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,760
yes a great question so a spam flash

643
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,760
dragon which when others read intel

644
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,280
shops wrote about it did not really

645
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,799
focus on attribution they focus a lot

646
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,880
about content and when you do look at

647
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,559
the disinfo content posted by the

648
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:29,919
accounts that we've already attributed

649
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,679
to one site they follow a lot of the

650
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,640
same like video format and uh copies

651
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,400
from like chinese state media

652
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,280
so that's where i see a lot of the spam

653
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,679
flash dragon overlap but keep in mind

654
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,039
like there's at least three companies

655
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,559
doing social media this info for the

656
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,840
chinese government from those leaks so

657
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,760
can we go from spam dragon to a specific

658
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,120
company you need something more

659
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,200
technical like that but maybe they're

660
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,720
all doing the same operation under

661
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,400
different contract prices to you know

662
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,240
see who's doing it best but that's the

663
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,600
context in which i brought up spammer

664
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,280
flight dragon does that answer your

665
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,400
question

666
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,000
great

667
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,120
thanks for the talk i just had a

668
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,640
question about the contract information

669
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,240
you were talking about so

670
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,159
i've always wondered in particular when

671
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,080
there are marketing firms working for

672
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,520
either a government entity a media

673
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,720
company a

674
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,799
company like mercedes

675
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,640
how to differentiate between if all

676
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,039
you've got is contract data whether the

677
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,480
organization that they're working for

678
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,320
directed or had the intent of them doing

679
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,919
this type of like clandestine influence

680
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,440
campaign on their behalf or if they

681
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,960
simply have a marketing relationship and

682
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,080
aren't aware of what the marketing

683
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,760
firm's doing for them do you have a

684
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,200
sense from what you've seen whether

685
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,799
there's even a knowledge

686
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,480
on the state media side that this is

687
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,919
what those contracts are for or did the

688
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,000
contracts lay that out so i would defer

689
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,760
that to the new york times analysis

690
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,280
because they look at the the boring

691
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,039
memos that actually will explode down in

692
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,400
detail on how these operations were

693
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,640
going like from the organization to the

694
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,720
companies or state media outlets to the

695
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,120
firm that's being contracted out

696
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,320
um

697
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,120
does that answer your question because

698
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,320
the uh

699
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,840
the the novel thing that we want to show

700
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,280
was the tool that no one had talked

701
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,080
about

702
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,240
so yeah the the article i'm referring to

703
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,400
if any of you didn't catch it is on the

704
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,320
last slide as a new york times

705
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,679
so

706
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,120
if you read that i think that'll give

707
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,760
you a more granular detailed deep dive

708
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,240
into your question

709
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,000
hi i have an observation and two

710
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,840
questions the observation that that

711
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,840
persona misha uryakova sounds like a

712
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,200
check name

713
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,080
and um uh two questions uh the that

714
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,760
organization called qn

715
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,760
k-q-u-e-e-n

716
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,120
is that is it possible there's any

717
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,880
relation to q and on

718
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,720
and the other question is is it possible

719
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,120
that leaked data was poisoned uh the the

720
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,360
hacked data so

721
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,640
the first question being about um

722
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,400
my bad your first question was about one

723
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,840
of the selectors um

724
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,720
yes so you're talking about the twitter

725
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,520
account uh miso or

726
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,760
which i don't see any check connection

727
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,679
because i looked at all the tweets but

728
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,200
we're originating all of our social

729
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,880
media leads and selectors and handles

730
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,640
from the hacked data

731
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,559
that was like filmed and screen recorded

732
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,799
like surreptitiously by the hacktivist

733
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,799
so it could be that there's a there's a

734
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,799
localized like or intention when they

735
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,960
set up this account to influence check

736
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,200
stuff but the only content we see is the

737
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,080
anti-us pro-china narratives on cobit 19

738
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,000
and this was burned pretty quickly and

739
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,840
taken down by twitter

740
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,720
the other question is on um

741
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,480
poison data right

742
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,799
yeah so uh there's nothing to say that

743
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,520
what tcp on mass talked about or leaked

744
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,159
was manipulated because

745
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,080
other groups like propublica and new

746
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,080
york times have done research

747
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,640
off of what they've talked about so i

748
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,880
have a hard time believing that

749
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,640
it's not real and and you can do a

750
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,039
technical analysis of the subnets that

751
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,440
are hosted on like onesite.com

752
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,400
and

753
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,279
you know

754
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,200
potentially see social media traffic or

755
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,120
other sorts of traffic so

756
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,520
we know that one site has done work for

757
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,720
the government because of the government

758
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,919
contracts

759
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,679
and this was not something they'd like

760
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,200
to talk about and there was some deep

761
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,640
dive i did on their website where they

762
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,840
were leaking some of the government

763
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,039
pages they were promoting but that

764
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,600
didn't fit into the slide account for

765
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,440
this conference but if you want to talk

766
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,279
more in detail you just see me after the

767
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,200
after the talk

768
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,240
um hi thanks so much for the talk um

769
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,600
when

770
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,520
i find these really interesting but when

771
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,600
when when we have found some similar

772
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,919
operations of just like

773
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,240
something that looks suspicious some

774
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,440
fake kind of news online media leading

775
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,559
to some

776
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,480
agency leading to some operation it

777
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,400
feels a bit serendipitous

778
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,159
of you know someone just happens to

779
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,400
stumble across the website and

780
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,000
have used tools like melt water before

781
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,919
and it feels just like a big fire hose

782
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,520
of information

783
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,600
so when thinking about right the best

784
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,080
way to come across these things do you

785
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,520
feel that

786
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,960
you just need to be

787
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,799
watching the conversation

788
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,200
and a pretty it's like pretty monotonous

789
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,880
work right just doing it ongoing or do

790
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,200
you have any strategies for i'm a big

791
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,440
fan of you know

792
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,559
a lot of this work is needed on the

793
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,120
haystack and you want to

794
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,640
look for the right haystacks and you

795
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,400
want to look you want to be very precise

796
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,760
in what you're researching like i said

797
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,440
covet 19 if you're just looking at

798
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,600
narratives and chatter about that this

799
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,880
is going to be too much noise look for

800
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,200
something that the person or a country

801
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,799
or group of interests is like extremely

802
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,039
furious about or like cares about then

803
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,880
no one gives a about on the us or

804
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,279
english social media side because if you

805
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,640
find content

806
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,760
that is being posted by like

807
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,520
predominantly english like language

808
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,120
accounts and it's not something that

809
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,039
people in the west talk about that's

810
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,400
pretty suspicious and you can find a lot

811
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,559
of good leads because this took you know

812
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,080
didn't take too much time for me to find

813
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,120
and also on melt water didn't fit the uh

814
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,799
the slide cam but there was a breakdown

815
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,480
of where the accounts that were posting

816
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,480
about this narrative originated from

817
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,960
number one was u.s number two were china

818
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,720
number three was hong kong but when you

819
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,159
look at the content a lot of it was in

820
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,640
mandarin but meltwater is pulling the

821
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,559
u.s location from how these accounts are

822
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,480
self-certifying where they're from

823
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,640
like their twitter location uh in their

824
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,279
bio or other you know self-reported like

825
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,480
what people when people fill out their

826
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,760
profile so i think it's pretty

827
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,159
indicative that the accounts that are

828
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,840
talking about this in the time period

829
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,000
that we did the research are likely not

830
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,480
authentic and when they're pushing this

831
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,240
narrative that like no one in the u.s

832
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,399
really talks about outside of some

833
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,039
fringe outlets

834
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,520
it's it's definitely a much better use

835
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,679
of your time as an investigator

836
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:34,880
to

837
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,200
think more precisely about what you're

838
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,399
going to search if you're going the

839
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:39,679
route from when you're going from

840
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,440
content to actor

841
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,960
uh and then just one question like when

842
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,480
you say we because you're not an

843
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,399
organization i'm just curious like

844
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,039
where you're coming from like uh the

845
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,960
tech company side or academic side

846
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,880
because

847
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,919
okay

848
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,240
yeah so uh there's no standardized way

849
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,399
of like how we do these investigations

850
00:27:58,399 --> 00:27:59,679
and that's a mix of just business

851
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,480
decisions also like to make sure that

852
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,760
the threat actors are constantly

853
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,240
evolving how they do this info so i

854
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,919
don't know if like a miter attack would

855
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,279
type framework would work to counter

856
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,679
disinformation uh but

857
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,440
all i could do is you know tell you guys

858
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,799
about some some

859
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,399
uh workflows that worked really well for

860
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,480
me and that i suggest you guys also look

861
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,520
at like you know narrative to suspicious

862
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,720
pages of groups you know websites uh we

863
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,159

864
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,080

865
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,480

866
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,919
to um

867

868
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,880
attribute to a nation state

869
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,840
