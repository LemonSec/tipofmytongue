1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,520
i want to take you back in time to the

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,560
early days of the yemen conflict

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,040
in march 2015

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,400
the civil war in yemen was still fresh

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,040
the shia houthi militias had just taken

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,920
over the capital city senate and asked

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,240
the president the saudi-backed president

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,000
hadi

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,960
a saudi-led coalition had launched a

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,439
military campaign in yemen

11
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,400
called operation decisive storm which

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,800
caused much damage and casualties and

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,480
the purpose was to counter the

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,480
iran-backed houthis

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,680
it also provided context for

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,239
a cyber-enabled intervention that

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,520
shrouded in mystery to this day

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,000
operation wiki saudi digs contrary to

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,200
its name

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,840
was probably not a cogent unified

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,600
operation

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,920
there were a lot of moving pieces it was

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,520
a massive campaign involving hacks leaks

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,520
and a disinformation and a forgery

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,039
campaign that hasn't been discussed

26
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,440
before

27
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,400
and the the intent seems to be to have

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,360
been to embarrass undermine

29
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,270
and um

30
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,159
[Music]

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,439
to embarrass undermine and subvert the

32
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,080
saudis as the the war in yemen was

33
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,200
escalating by day

34
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,920
so

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,000
websites were getting hacked for the

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
sake of analysis i'm going to break it

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,680
into three parts

38
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,079
um hacks which have termed collection

39
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,720
here then the dump of confidential

40
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,520
cables um or the exposure material that

41
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,000
had been exfiltrated from networks and

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,159
then someone out there was exploiting

43
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,119
the leaked material to their own benefit

44
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,840
so you might ask yourself why we should

45
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,759
care about something that happened six

46
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,399
years ago in the middle east

47
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,360
well historically this was a significant

48
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,880
case that created a blueprint for iran

49
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,759
iranian io that we didn't really pay

50
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,719
much attention to at the time

51
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,520
and especially given what happened in

52
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,479
this country in 2016 and much later

53
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,840
we probably should have learned our

54
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,200
lessons

55
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,160
second disclosures that have come to

56
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,000
light since

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,920
2015

58
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,160
shed new light on details of this

59
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,200
operation that makes revisiting it quite

60
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,440
interesting

61
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,440
and then lastly the methodology is

62
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,040
interesting because it enables us to

63
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,680
take it apart and look at each component

64
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,080
in its own light and deal with the

65
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,160
question of attribution in a way that

66
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,920
cuts through the fog

67
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,720
and

68
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,000
allows for a more sophisticated analysis

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,080
in a way that

70
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,560
that helps us deal with the technical

71
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,879
and operational nuances of what was

72
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,800
going on

73
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,560
so let's walk through these each of

74
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,159
these components

75
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,400
the story began on april 12 2015 when

76
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,360
the social media accounts of iran's

77
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,239
arabic news channel and el alam were

78
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,720
defaced and replaced with

79
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,840
pro-saudi imagery and rumors that the

80
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,080
houthi leader might be dead

81
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,959
the

82
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,480
anonymous hacking group that took

83
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,959
responsibility for it cyber emotion had

84
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,239
previously

85
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,879
attacked official saudi targets so the

86
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,200
possibility of it having links to the

87
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,760
saudi government is kind of slim

88
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,599
but what happened next was more

89
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,760
significant because

90
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,400
the day after on april 13 the

91
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,640
saudi-owned news site al-hayat was the

92
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,920
face

93
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,720
and the home page was replaced with

94
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,640
pro-iran imagery and also intimidating

95
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,680
messages

96
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,879
that

97
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,000
the saudis and their allies should be

98
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,799
preparing for their graves and the

99
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,120
packing group that took responsibility

100
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,959
for it was kind of unknown it came out

101
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,519
of blue yemen's cyber army

102
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,319
so until this point it seemed that

103
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,959
patriotic hacker groups were going after

104
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,599
each other as the civil war in yemen was

105
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,000
getting worse

106
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,239
but then things snowballed from there

107
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,680
pretty quickly

108
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,560
uh farce news the semi-official news

109
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,959
agency of iran that's also affiliated

110
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,880
with the irgc

111
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,360
started promoting the al-hayata faceman

112
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,680
attributing it to

113
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,000
yemen's cyber army without providing any

114
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,560
further context or information

115
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,320
iranian hacktivist groups were

116
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,400
amplifying the hack on twitter and i'm

117
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,240
going to get to how we know this is a

118
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,840
this is an iranian group in a

119
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,759
bit and then came the big hack on may 20

120
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,479
2015 the saudi ministry of foreign

121
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,600
affairs

122
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,400
was the face the home page was

123
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,680
replaced with very strong pro-iran

124
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,440
persia imagery

125
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,680
intimidating pieces of anti-saudi

126
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,560
propaganda

127
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,280
like blaming the atrocities that were

128
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,360
going on in yemen on the saudis and

129
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,199
their allies announcing that all the

130
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,600
servers were encrypted

131
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,000
and yemen's cyber army again took

132
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,199
responsibility for it

133
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,880
so

134
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,120
in their hacking announcement they were

135
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,600
identifying as cutting sort of justice

136
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,479
the same actor behind the first shamoon

137
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,120
attack in 2012

138
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,880
then came the exposure

139
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,240
forest news once again was hard at work

140
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,520
they started a series of exclusive

141
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,400
stories on what they termed for the very

142
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,440
first time as saudi leagues

143
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,360
they wanted the entire world to know

144
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,160
what was going on they were not just

145
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,320
writing about the hack they were even

146
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,000
promoting the hacking announcement and

147
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,240
then they were like here is a

148
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,280
password-protected file that you can

149
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,120
check out in order to get some of the

150
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,680
files that had been exfiltrated from the

151
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,440
network and here is the password by the

152
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,479
way

153
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,960
and all along attributing it to yemen's

154
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,600
cyber army once again without any

155
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,919
further information or background

156
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,520
the activist groups that were

157
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,000
active about the al-hayat de faceman

158
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,319
once again we're promoting the the

159
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,080
incident

160
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,800
but it wasn't the first news reporting

161
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
um that

162
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,120
made everyone pay attention to what was

163
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,160
going on it was wikileaks when it came

164
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,479
out on june 19

165
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,880
and dumped a trove of confidential

166
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,680
cables um that they termed as the saudi

167
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,960
cables

168
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,840
so far they there has been over 120 000

169
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,759
confidential cables that not only

170
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,800
includes diplomatic communications but

171
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,160
also

172
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,000
personal information about visa

173

applicants sick children the mentally

174
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,960
ill

175
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,960
really questioning the ethics of this

176
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,960
leak as well

177
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,120
in their press release

178
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,319
wikileaks cited yemen cyber army as

179
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,160
their initial source of the documents

180
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,280
which

181
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,800
made the

182
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,800
yemen cyber army go dark but they were

183
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,800
still active on twitter promoting one of

184
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,120
their websites yemenika.com

185
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,160
which had been registered with a

186
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,960
yandex.com email account the same email

187
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,560
that was used

188
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,360
to register another website associated

189
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,479
with the with the yemen cyber army wiki

190
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,479
saudi leaks

191
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,360
the website was an even more aggressive

192
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,840
anti-saudi manifesto

193
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,639
dubbing the operation as cyber operation

194
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,440
cyber decisive storm in direct reference

195
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,160
to the saudi-led operation decisive

196
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,680
storm presumably in retaliation for it

197
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,560
and it wasn't just reposting what

198
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,199
wikileaks had already published

199
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,000
someone had gone out of their way

200
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,360
to really curate and put together the

201
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,240
most damning documents

202
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,039
that wikileaks had already done so if

203
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,440
you were interested in international

204
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,120
affairs between bahrain and saudi there

205
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,440
was a folder for you afghanistan no

206
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,759
problem here is something for you enjoy

207
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,639
so

208
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,039
moving on to the exploitation okay i'm

209
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,680
gonna say this as well so so far we had

210
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,879
one hack

211
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,000
at least three platforms that were

212
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,640
um leaking the material so whoever that

213
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,719
did the hack really got so much out of

214
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,240
this leak then came the exploitation

215
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,120
part

216
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,680
as the international news cycle and on

217
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,320
wiki saudi leagues was kind of fading

218
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,640
a fringe news site

219
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,600
and other western dawn news or odd news

220
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,720
came out

221
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,160
and um

222
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,160
it was a month after almost a month

223
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,680
after wikileaks had published the

224
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,040
documents

225
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,399
saying

226
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,720
well then special reporter on the

227
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,839
situation of human rights

228
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,360
on on the situation of human rights in

229
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,560
iran

230
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,519
from the yuan dr ahmed shaheed had

231
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,640
received bribes from the saudi embassy

232
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,080
in kuwait

233
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,120
to

234
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,519
write bias reporting against the iranian

235
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,640
government

236
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,120
to substantiate their claims

237
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,720
they were referencing one of the

238
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,360
documents that wikileaks had allegedly

239
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,880
published a month before

240
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,760
so the iranian media loved this

241
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,160
they jumped at the opportunity trying to

242
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,519
promote the story that look

243
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,120
with all the reporting about the

244
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,959
situation of human rights turns out the

245
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,240
un expert has received bribes

246
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,360
test name news the irgc affiliated

247
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,000
another irgc affiliated platform was

248
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,360
writing about it

249
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,480
um

250
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
kind of fringe news sites like the

251
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,680
middle east press

252
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,040
were also promoting it so this caused

253
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,600
much chaos in the iranian

254
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
human rights community journalists

255
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,519
started contacting wikileaks for

256
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,760
comments and the platform came out

257
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,440
basically disavowing this this document

258
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,160
well turns out this was this was clearly

259
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,120
a forgery and someone out there was

260
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,399
trying to exploit the leaked material to

261
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,800
their own benefit

262
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,480
so who did it

263
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,440
why was this operation not conclusively

264
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,720
attributed

265
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,920
for one

266
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,480
the saudi government might have lacked

267
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,480
the political will to come out and

268
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,200
publicly attribute the operation

269
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,040
they might have lacked the technical

270
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,880
skills to do it although they could have

271
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,440
hired someone to do it for them but

272
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,320
there are sticky points in the operation

273
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,720
itself that have made

274
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,560
uh hb a conclusive attribution um pretty

275
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,240
difficult

276
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,079
so

277
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,200
we have a multi-component campaign that

278
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,000
requires a multi-component kind of

279
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,839
attribution

280
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,480
we had the al-hi attack we had the

281
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,560
ministry of foreign affairs getting

282
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,680
defaced

283
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,399
then a few platforms came out to

284
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,480
to expose the material

285
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,880
and then someone out there was doing a

286
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,920
disinformation campaign

287
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,160
so for the sake of analysis i really

288
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,440
want to advocate for for a platform for

289
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,680
a framework um that deals with multiple

290
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,800
vectors of analysis and many of you

291
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,279
probably use one version of this in your

292
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,959
own work

293
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,680
but what's important in this case and

294
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,200
probably similar other cases is that we

295
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,160
need to take this framework and apply to

296
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,720
all of those components separately

297
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,360
because the answer to one component may

298
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,519
not lead us to the same answer to the

299
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,480
other to the other phase or part

300
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,760
so

301
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,320
who may have a history of operations of

302
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,959
this kind against that target who may

303
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,120
have the motivation to pull something

304
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,040
like this off did they have the

305
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,320
expertise and resources is there a trace

306
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,200
of

307
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,959
the infrastructure being linked to

308
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,040
specific actors

309
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,760
and does the messaging and the purported

310
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,519
reasoning match the actors interest

311
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,279
so when we apply these vectors to the

312
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,079
highly likely suspects because at the

313
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,320
time there were there was a debate among

314
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,639
researchers that well maybe yemen's

315
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,440
cyber army was a was a front for for the

316
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,519
russians maybe it was iranians maybe it

317
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,920
was yemen's cyber army although

318
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,079
probably yca didn't really exist they

319
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,560
didn't have any history but if it did it

320
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,880
would definitely have the motivation and

321
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,040
use the right messaging to go after the

322
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,160
targets that they probably hated most um

323
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,079
iran and russia similarly score higher

324
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,240
on the chart and i'm not going to bore

325
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,399
you with the details of this matrix but

326
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,040
i want to focus on on the in in the

327
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,200
infrastructure part for a second

328
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,320
so

329
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,120
iranians were in the al hayat network

330
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,720
how do we know this

331
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,760
the

332
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,320
hacking announcement on pastebin from

333
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,480
from the alhayat defacement included

334
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,399
email addresses

335
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,480
from al-hayat users subscribers

336
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,519
admins possibly reporters

337
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,639
one of them turns out had all the admin

338
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,040
rights but it wasn't an admin but had

339
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,120
accessed the website a few days before

340
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,720
the leak

341
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,399
that email

342
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,519
turns out

343
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,880
it's linked to

344
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,440
an iranian individual that

345
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,680
is also the same registrant of one of

346
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,800
the associated domains to

347
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,399
the quickly

348
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,000
hacktivist group

349
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,880
another associated domain was also

350
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,519
registered by another iranian individual

351
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,120
and by the way i can't take credit for

352
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,279
this piece shout out to charlie collins

353
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,440
for sharing his his own research on

354
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,320
yemen cyber army so thanks charlie

355
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,279
um

356
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,120
also on infrastructure

357
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,399
we know thanks to one of the the cables

358
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,760
um from wiki wikileaks that iranians

359
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,680
were also in the

360
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,440
network of saudi ministry of foreign

361
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,399
affairs turns out in early

362
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,839
2015 saudi officials were discussing a

363
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,199
an incident response report um about an

364
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,120
incident a breach into their network

365
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,160
from july of 2014 that had gone

366
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,800
unnoticed until much later that year

367
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,720
they frequently

368
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,920
cited operation cleaver which as we know

369
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,720
has been widely attributed to to iranian

370
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,279
actors

371
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,160
and identified this breach to have been

372
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,000
probably part of the same operation

373
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,199
but we also know that russians were also

374
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,120
in the saudi network at some point in

375
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,600
time russian hackers also have a history

376
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,160
of saudi-oriented espionage and

377
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,120
especially in the months before

378
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,079
we saudi leaks happen

379
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,120
moving on to the exposure piece again

380
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,800
yemen's cyber army

381
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,360
didn't really exist but iran and russia

382
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,079
had a slightly higher chance of

383
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,560
pulling something like this off

384
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,079
um

385
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,120
so

386
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,120
i'm focusing on the infrastructure for a

387
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,279
second again

388
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,240
so the website wiki saudi leagues

389
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,600
that launched

390
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,600
after the wikileaks dump happened

391
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,639
was

392
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,720
registered on an ip address through a

393
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,639
company called mono vm which at the time

394
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,759
accepted many forms of cryptocurrencies

395
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,279
as you know if you want to be a bad

396
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,279
actor on the internet that's probably

397
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,360
one of your best shots

398
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,920
the mono vm domain itself had been

399
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,000
registered under iranian individuals

400
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,360
names

401
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,320
and

402
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,759
who had moved on to also register ip

403
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,519
addresses websites and different parts

404
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,279
of iran as well

405
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,079
and while this was probably one of the

406
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,720
first instances of monavie and being

407
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,040
involved in an operation like this it

408
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,320
was certainly not going to be the last

409
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,440
because in december of last year

410
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,360
a website emerged enemies of the people

411
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,720
that was doxing public officials civil

412
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,800
servants in the u.s who had refused to

413
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,920
confirm trump's election fraud campaigns

414
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,079
shoutout to kris krabs for

415
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,680
being picked on by everyone including

416
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,000
including iranians

417
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,360
so one of the associated domains to this

418
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,079
website had been registered once again

419
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,079
through monovm

420
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,399
within days the fbi came out and

421
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,480
attributed this whole operation to iran

422
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,360
but

423
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,119
it's more complicated

424
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,240
because the ip addresses of wiki saudi

425
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,679
leaks

426
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,480
was part of the same range of ip

427
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,400
addresses that

428
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,559
fancy bear had used

429
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,240
in their campaign and during like 2014

430
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,280
and 2015.

431
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,839
and what about the exploitation part

432
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,360
iran on this matrix scores highest

433
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,679
because of the later disclosures that

434
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,320
have come to light since 2015.

435
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,919
in october 2018 in their very first io

436
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,679
takedown announcement

437
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,080
facebook and twitter

438
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,480
took down the domains that we're

439
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,559
promoting the story of the yuan expert

440
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,160
having received

441
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,760
bribes from the saudis

442
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,720
and

443
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,039
linking that to iran

444
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,559
in november

445
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,640
of 2020 the

446
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,039
department of justice also

447
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,840
seized odd news the main source of that

448
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,120
story

449
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,559
as part of their larger domain seizure

450
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,720
linked to iranian

451
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,120
ios

452
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,760
so in conclusion

453
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,240
this was a

454
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,679
multi-component operation

455
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,400
when we break it down to its own parts

456
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,720
we kind of come up with

457
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,799
different answers for each of those

458
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,559
components so the al hayat hack was most

459
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,919
likely iranian but we can't say

460
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,120
the same for sure about the hacking of

461
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,120
the saudi ministry of foreign affairs

462
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,520
because there were different actors on

463
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,000
both on the iranian and russian side in

464
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,640
the network

465
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,120
and so the exposure similarly is even

466
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,880
murkier because

467
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,720
farce news was definitely iranian

468
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,120
wikileaks wasn't and the jury is still

469
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,080
out on wiki saudi leagues

470
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,320
but we do know thanks to the later

471
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,440
disclosures that the exploitation piece

472
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,520
was definitely iranian and can be

473
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,720
attributed to iran with high confidence

474
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,120
so this operation was important because

475
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,080
it created a blueprint for iran's ios

476
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,600
that we didn't really catch until years

477
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,320
later when things had happened already

478
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,160
in iran and

479
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,280
sorry

480
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,520
here and elsewhere and everyone was

481
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,000
talking about information operations and

482
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,760
this information

483
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,720
it also speaks to the strength of

484
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,919
a methodology like this because once we

485
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,120
start to deconstruct the operation to

486
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,320
its part it allows us to deal with the

487
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,799
question of attribution for each of

488
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,280
those components

489
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,020
and

490
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,600
[Music]

491
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,640
we can avoid the common traps of

492
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,400
oversimplification

493
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,080
and kind of come up with a more

494
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,200
sophisticated analysis that deals with

495
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,760
the tactical and operational nuances

496
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,480
so

497
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,880
that was my curious tale of wiki saudi

498
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,440
leagues thanks for listening happy to

499
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,960
take questions

500
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,360
seriously sorry um so i i thank you for

501
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,559
the presentation i'm actually like

502
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,159
really invested in this case

503
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,039
um

504
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,880
to what extent are you

505
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,039
like i love the nuance with which you

506
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,440
address the possible sourcing versus the

507
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,480
use

508
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,039
of the material to what extent would you

509
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,200
be comfortable with the idea of let's

510
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,640
say the russians having sourced the

511
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,559
material and the iranians having

512
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,679
amplified it or some sort of you know

513
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,440
mixed up whether it was coordinated or

514
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,960
not you know just taking advantage of

515
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,159
the fact that this material was out

516
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,360
there is that something that would sit

517
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,880
well with you

518
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,240
yeah i think

519
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,280
so

520
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,240
with

521
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,600
within a framework like what i discussed

522
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,600
i think

523
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,840
we may not be able to put a finger on a

524
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,840
single actor

525
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,760
and we should be comfortable with that

526
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,000
because it's quite complicated it's

527
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,760
massive and there are so many moving

528
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,280
parts and it's quite possible that

529
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,159
whoever that did the hack was not the

530
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,760
same actor who did the exposure or vice

531
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,799
versa or even the exploitation campaign

532
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,880
there might have been some sort of

533
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,559
collaboration although we don't really

534
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,080
have a solid any solid evidence for it

535
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,360
but i wouldn't rule out the possibility

536
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,918
all right thank you very much
