1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,159
i'm super excited to be here and thank

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:03,919
you for choosing my talking for that

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,120
awesome intro uh i am a bit nervous

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,320
because this talk is going to be a

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,160
little bit different uh there's not

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,559
going to be any uh vulnerabilities in

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,040
the traditional sense of the word um i'm

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,800
not talking about any specific campaign

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,279
or threat actor i actually want to take

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,439
a journey towards what i think is

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,960
probably we can all agree the most

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,840
exciting aspect of infosec which is

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,240
government audits

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,039
so

15
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,240
i'm going to use government audit

16
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,640
reports to essentially show

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,280
how the u.s department of defense views

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,559
its own defensive posture and one of the

19
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,239
things that chris said in his keynote he

20
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,440
talked about

21
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,079
the permissive environment and that is

22
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,760
particularly relevant to here because we

23
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,960
are going to be talking about the

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,120
ultimate permissive environment as a

25
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,559
result of the dod's defensive posture so

26
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,320
this talk is plane ships and satellites

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,280
we're going to talk a little bit about

28
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,039
the general aspects of it and then i'll

29
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,600
go straight into the meat

30
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,480
okay

31
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,960
so why this talk uh first of all because

32
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,280
the graphs are the best this this talk

33
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,560
is essentially the

34
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,280
talk embodiment of the defense charts

35
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,799
twitter account which is the best if

36
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,880
you're not following it um but really

37
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,040
because there's not enough public

38
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,200
coverage of offensive cyber operations

39
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,360
that target um

40
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,280
military equipment and networks i'm not

41
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,799
talking about intelligence gathering

42
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,040
networks i'm not talking about uh

43
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,040
necessarily the

44
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,320
the civilian side of things

45
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,600
but rather

46
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,200
i actually want to talk about military

47
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,360
equipment and specifically i want to

48
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,320
discuss

49
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,320
what's called mdaps or

50
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,479
military defense acquisition programs

51
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,079
and how they are systematically

52
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,479
vulnerable to many kinds of compromises

53
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,960
and effects and you're going to hear

54
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,159
i'm going to try and limit the amount of

55
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,360
jargon that i use but one specific term

56
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,840
is particularly important because it

57
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,159
comes up in almost every single report

58
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,439
and that

59
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,600
term is

60
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,040
survivability survivability essentially

61
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,799
says that if some kind of combat

62
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,920
platform goes into combat it goes out

63
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,520
that it actually survives contact with

64
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,598
the enemy and um

65
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,878
in many cases what you're gonna see

66
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,360
today is that the vast majority of

67
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,440
combat platforms used today

68
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,239
by

69
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,280
uh the us military and its allies is not

70
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,080
actually survivable specifically because

71
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,480
of cyber security concerns so let's talk

72
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,080
about this let's talk about the

73
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,040
vulnerabilities in the process itself

74
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,879
rather than

75
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,720
in any specific piece of equipment

76
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,720
though that exists as well and i want to

77
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,040
start off with a quote and you'll see a

78
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,760
lot of quotes here from various as i

79
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,680
said amazing government audits with

80
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,000
amazing people working on them uh truly

81
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,440
not sarcastically these are people doing

82
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,720
fantastic job with very limited

83
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,239
resources and doing the very best that

84
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,680
they can

85
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,599
and if you look they look at 45 current

86
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,440
programs as i said defense acquisition

87
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,879
programs those are major weapons

88
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,720
programs like the f-35 like some of the

89
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,200
major combat ships like uh satellite

90
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,440
constellations used by military services

91
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,840
they said in

92
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,599
2016 31 reported that they plan to

93
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,080
complete an evaluation of potential

94
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,640
cyber vulnerabilities by 2019.

95
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,760
so

96
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,720
out of the ones that they surveyed

97
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,640
about two-thirds said that they will do

98
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,280
some kind of assessment within three

99
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,159
years

100
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,319
one assessment in three years not to

101
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,319
mention actually actioning

102
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,319
the things that they find there so that

103
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,879
already gives you some notion of the

104
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,799
time spans that we're talking about in

105
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,480
dod constraints

106
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,640
in 2019

107
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,480
one of the things that the amazing

108
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,120
people at dote or director operational

109
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,799
test and evaluation have said is that

110
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,400
cyber security flaws are one of the

111
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,480
biggest concerns that would cause a

112
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,920
system to be as i said not survivable so

113
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,920
think about this in the context of

114
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,360
modern conflict and there are certain um

115
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,280
potential geopolitical hot spots which

116
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,360
may turn into actual open conflict in

117
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,200
the coming years think about this

118
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,799
posture adopted by

119
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,080
dod and how they view their own

120
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,599
equipment and its ability to go through

121
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,040
that successfully

122
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,879
so

123
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,120
let's look at the actual evaluations of

124
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,120
what they mean so again this is just a

125
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,120
high-level view from the official

126
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,440
auditor that says uh programs most

127
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,199
frequently reported the tabletop

128
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,440
exercise as characterizing their cyber

129
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,040
security assessment that means that out

130
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,960
of the ones that actually did something

131
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,720
the vast majority of them just did a

132
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,479
tabletop exercise

133
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,720
the amount of organizations that took

134
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,520
their

135
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,520
weapons platforms through a full

136
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,360
systematic evaluation including red

137
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,160
teaming uh component analysis

138
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,560
uh proper uh adversary assessments and

139
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,560
so on that is that

140
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,120
uh tiny bit at the bottom that's 10 out

141
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,759
of the total of 45.

142
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,600
so and again this is just for the actual

143
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,400
evaluation done once think about the

144
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,520
security posture that you would

145
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,680
recommend to your organizations to your

146
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,600
victims to your potential people that

147
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,120
you try to defend on a daily basis

148
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,120
and from 2020 and i cannot stress this

149
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,960
enough uh this is something that's been

150
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,560
said by the various auditors over the

151
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,440
course of the years they are screaming

152
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,560
screaming that cyber security is a major

153
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,479
uh concern this is the by the way the

154
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,759
official government equivalent to

155
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,000
screaming um it's cyber security is

156
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,600
treating as an add-on feature rather

157
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,000
than being baked in we all know this to

158
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,520
be a concern in our respective areas

159
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,880
and essentially what they're flanking is

160
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,280
that both for software and hardware used

161
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,240
within dod programs there's a systematic

162
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,479
flaw in how we approach it fundamentally

163
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,800
okay so that was on the general side of

164
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,240
things let's talk about specific

165
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,120
programs and one of my favorite ones is

166
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,320
the f35

167
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,759
so the f35 is amazing it is the plane

168
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,400
that can do everything it comes in three

169
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,400
flavors

170
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,960
and it supposedly is not just an

171
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,840
airplane it is essentially a platform

172
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,400
it's a platform that does many things it

173
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,600
has many many many on-board systems it

174
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,600
also is one of the most code-heavy

175
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,160
software-reliant

176
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,319
modern combat platforms that we see

177
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,039
anywhere especially in the dod

178
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,319
now what that means is that there is

179
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,000
both a lot of significant on-board

180
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,919
computing a lot of software processes

181
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,560
that govern everything from targeting to

182
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,880
the engines to oxygen regulation and

183
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,280
everything in between but also it's not

184
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,199
just about this it's about the entire

185
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,080
ecosystem that fuels the f-35 so we're

186
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,120
going to talk a little bit about the

187
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,199
systems that make it fly and allow it to

188
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,720
be what it's meant to be

189
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,240
but essentially it's more than just the

190
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,120
plane itself

191
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,800
and also think about this

192
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,880
it's built by many partner countries

193
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,880
it's meant to facilitate working with

194
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,280
allies in some or even the us itself

195
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,759
working with more outdated platforms so

196
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,360
backwards compatibility is also the

197
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,400
order of the day for this

198
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,360
and now come the quotes from the program

199
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,880
itself

200
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,759
there are many many amazing quotes about

201
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,560
issues with the f35 uh one of them and

202
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,319
it starts very early that program has

203
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,560
been in the running for over 25 years uh

204
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,919
since its original inception but one of

205
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,120
the amazing things that you see is

206
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,120
actually around at software processes

207
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,400
whether that's getting a blue screen

208
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,319
while you're flying your f-35 and your

209
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,599
radar just stops working um but also the

210
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,680
actual auditor is repeatedly reporting

211
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,840
that the software development process is

212
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,599
inherently and fully flawed from top to

213
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:30,479
bottom

214
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,440
so

215
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,720
for example they're talking about

216
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,000
development of mission system software

217
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,520
continue to experience delay that

218
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,759
affected flight test progress in many

219
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,520
cases you will see that the report says

220
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,039
that they're not actually able to even

221
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,520
fully test the platform because uh

222
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,960
things just did not work well enough to

223
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,599
even be fully tested and as these tests

224
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:48,639
continue

225
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,199
uh the platform actually goes live

226
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,280
the f-35 flies

227
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,440
in some cases in some countries it flies

228
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,000
combat missions too while entire chunks

229
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,080
of its onboard systems and its support

230
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,919
systems don't actually work as intended

231
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,280
or at all

232
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,319
um

233
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,720
to the point where they in 2019 say that

234
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,560
software changes intended to introduce

235
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,639
new capabilities or fixed efficiencies

236
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,000
instead introduced new ones

237
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,639
and ones that not just new bugs and bugs

238
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,520
can be

239
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,199
fine and things that you can live with

240
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
as we all know

241
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,479
but things that actually affect critical

242
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,639
functionality and that's a big deal for

243
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,840
something that's meant to fly into

244
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,080
battle especially in heavily contested

245
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,000
areas so if we're talking about the

246
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,080
permissive contested environment as

247
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,320
chris said this is it this is meant to

248
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,679
be in that

249
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,599
and there are significant concerns about

250
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,360
the survivability of this

251
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,559
it goes on

252
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,440
um

253
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,440
yes an f35 actually shot itself with its

254
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,760
cannon that's only one piece that cannon

255
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,839
had major software issues that caused it

256
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,680
to essentially miss every single time

257
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,880
that it fired

258
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,800
because it fire the targeting computer

259
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,160
caused it to fire to the right and

260
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,560
forward of the actual target uh many

261
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,000
many issues

262
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,240
but one might say okay so they're aware

263
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,519
of their problems they're fixing them

264
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,360
it's gonna get better over the course of

265
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,839
time but not entirely so if you're uh

266
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,800
talking about 2020 we're still seeing uh

267
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,880
severe quality deficiencies

268
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,680
um

269
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,800
in 2020 they said the program had 871

270
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,200
open deficiencies 10 of which designated

271
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,640
category 1. category 1 is dod speak for

272
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,519
things that adversely can impact um

273
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,600
mission success and the most severe of

274
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
category ones can also put

275
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,959
people's lives at risk though this

276
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,600
specifically did not entail that

277
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,480
okay

278
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,519
so in 2020 they said 871 obviously

279
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,120
they're gonna fix those especially the

280
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,720
category ones right

281
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,320
nope

282
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,240
in 2021 it had 857 deficiencies of which

283
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,720
seven are considered category one so

284
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,800
we're talking about a year's worth of

285
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,360
time between the testing intervals they

286
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,200
fix some they probably introduce new

287
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,360
ones but they still have multiple

288
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,440
critical gaps in getting the plane to

289
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,600
work as intended and this is

290
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,279
let's be honest in not the most

291
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,760
difficult of scenarios uh we have not

292
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,440
seen those yet come to fruition so

293
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,320
imagine the actual conflict in place

294
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,760
again with the amazing charts

295
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,000
i want to talk about alice alice or the

296
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,279
autonomic

297
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,920
logistics information system is

298
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,680
essentially that support network that i

299
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,320
mentioned it is a piece of software and

300
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,480
hardware that sits within the unit that

301
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,800
deploys f35 and also connected to a

302
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,560
central hub and what it provides is

303
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,880
essentially um logistical maintenance

304
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,839
and automation for uh the plane itself

305
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,519
it's what tells you what maintenance you

306
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,880
need to do what is the status of the on

307
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,800
of every single piece of diagnostic that

308
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,480
comes from the onboard

309
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,360
plane computer but it also

310
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,800
gives you

311
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,640
essentially the go-ahead that the plane

312
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,200
is good to go and alice is an amazing

313
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,720
project because it has suffered many

314
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,040
many many setbacks but it also just

315
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,160
shows how critical software is to the

316
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,880
successive deployment of uh combat

317
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,880
platforms so for example in 2016

318
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,720
ambiguity in ordinance loading technical

319
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,399
data one aircraft experienced major

320
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,680
damage to a weapons bay door essentially

321
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,440
it didn't that the software didn't tell

322
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,040
the operator how to correctly load the

323
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,640
bomb it caused an error causing

324
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,200
explosion and some damage

325
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,680
so consider the weaponization of this in

326
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,079
an actual adversarial setup when an

327
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,320
adversary has access to alice and is

328
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,760
able to do things with it

329
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,480
in other cases just the sheer notion of

330
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,120
deploying alice forced the operators to

331
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,279
reduce the network security of the

332
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,519
entire base network just to get it to

333
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,959
work because of conflicting permissions

334
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,200
requirements

335
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,760
so again systemic major issues um

336
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,120
and then in

337
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,959
2017

338
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,360
major vulnerabilities still not remedied

339
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,519
okay but we're four years back

340
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,720
surely things are better now

341
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,519
in 2017 we actually had an issue

342
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,440
specific that a corrupted software

343
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,320
update error in alice grounded an entire

344
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,800
unit of f-35s again this was ruled to

345
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,040
not have been malicious but corrupting a

346
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,959
software update uh and the critical

347
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,279
dependencies that that endures uh just

348
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,639
goes to show you just how mission

349
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,320
critical these pieces of software are

350
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,160
and how systematically vulnerable they

351
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,160
are to having their processes tampered

352
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,399
with

353
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,360
fast forward two years

354
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,320
the auditors now know what we all know

355
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,079
alice is really problematic it hasn't

356
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,920
been updated in years it has numerous

357
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,920
security vulnerabilities it's better if

358
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,880
we completely redid it and i have to

359
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,040
give them credit that

360
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,120
they did declare

361
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,399
an alternative program called odin

362
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,240
operational data and tech integrated

363
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,800
network they do love their acronyms

364
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,200
that is meant to replace alice and fix

365
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,800
all of its inherent vulnerabilities

366
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,240
that's really awesome except a year

367
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,079
later they completely froze that program

368
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,800
so that's still not happening

369
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,079
so essentially what we're talking about

370
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,480
here is issues from 2019 that reflect

371
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,959
issues from 2017 that have not been

372
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,040
fixed as of 2021

373
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,360
and represent a major systematic

374
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,760
deficiency in the ability of getting the

375
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,000
f35 in the air

376
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,360
so

377
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,079
not ideal

378
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,360
okay

379
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,720
moving on to another example i want to

380
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,040
talk about satellites um not civilian

381
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,040
satellites though those definitely do

382
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,839
have uh a military use

383
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,200
case when we're talking about satellites

384
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,160
we traditionally have um

385
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,000
three components to them or three

386
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,360
segments as it often appears in the

387
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,720
literature there's the space segment

388
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,440
which is the actual satellites uh which

389
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,480
usually when we're talking about

390
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,000
vulnerabilities in that space we talk

391
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,360
about

392
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,760
electronic warfare and it's kind of more

393
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,639
data-driven cyber operational aspects

394
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,959
there's the control or link segment and

395
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,399
specifically in that something called

396
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,199
ttc or telemetry tracking and control

397
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,000
this is the equivalent of uh c2 just for

398
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,480
satellites and it's how you both control

399
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,920
the actual satellite give it

400
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,279
instructions you can fire its boosters

401
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,480
if it needs to move a little bit you can

402
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,279
do various interesting things with it

403
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,199
and then of course the terminals which

404
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,839
are the users

405
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:18,959
so

406
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,199
there's this helpful graphic from ncc

407
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,079
group

408
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,320
on which i added a few entries as well

409
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,000
about some of the many many ways in

410
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,839
which these could be targeted so it's

411
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,720
anything from compromising um from

412
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,160
jamming attacks against the actual

413
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,720
satellite that's fine um of course if

414
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,160
it's a satellite and it's wide beam you

415
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,360
should be able to intercept it in some

416
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,199
cases and it's not always properly or

417
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,199
fully or wholly encrypted

418
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,639
but there's also and this is something

419
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,560
that happens the most often compromises

420
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,480
against the ground stations that do the

421
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,639
telemetry tracking and in fact most of

422
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,079
the compromises that we've seen in that

423
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,880
sector go after this because not only is

424
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,720
it on the ground and therefore easily

425
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,680
accessible it also tends to be the most

426
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,279
um

427
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,120
the most impactful in what it allows you

428
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,440
to do because it both gives you a view

429
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,440
of the ground station but it also gives

430
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,800
you command and control over the

431
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,120
satellite and potential and these are

432
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,639
things that are segmented across

433
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,040
multiple operators multiple defense

434
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,639
contractors over the course of many

435
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,680
years um and those are a vulnerability

436
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,959
by themselves but they're not the only

437
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,440
one i actually also want to talk about

438
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,680
the terminal and this gives you a view

439
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,440
into how the department of defense talks

440
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,040
about acquisition and why it's so

441
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,720
difficult to make things that work as

442
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,360
intended it takes an average of just

443
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,600
over seven years from the design of a

444
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,040
satellite to the deployment of the first

445
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,160
one that's actually not that bad

446
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,519
it takes a few more years to get it to

447
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,519
full operational capacity which is

448
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,040
launching as many satellites as you need

449
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,279
to have a proper working constellation

450
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,759
um but

451
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,440
all of that doesn't matter

452
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,519
unless you actually have terminals

453
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,600
specific terminals that know how to work

454
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,120
with that specific satellite because

455
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,639
they are not backwards compatible in the

456
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,560
vast majority of cases which means you

457
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,440
need to go to every user in that

458
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,839
intended network and upgrade them and

459
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,399
that could be a ship that's deployed

460
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,519
that can be

461
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,480
a unit that's deployed that could be an

462
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,240
aircraft that can be a uni like an

463
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,120
actual

464
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,800
people on the ground or a base somewhere

465
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,480
those are very difficult to do and

466
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,120
actually takes up to five years to do

467
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,440
scheduled maintenance on

468
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,839
a deployed asset that would not reduce

469
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,839
its current operational capacity in a

470
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:26,959
way that would allow you to replace

471
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,040
their terminal

472
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,959
now repeat that

473
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,560
across 17 17 000 terminals representing

474
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,440
600 different programs and 135 different

475
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,920
current designs for terminals

476
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,079
so working at dod speed that can take

477
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,120
many many many many years which

478
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,000
it absolutely does

479
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,079
so if you look for example at one of the

480
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,000
satellite constellations

481
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,279
they had intended to have um

482
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,320
in 2009 one satellite in orbit and 20 of

483
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
the terminals fielded and then they had

484
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,440
a bit of a delay but then in 2019 with

485
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,760
five satellites in orbit they still just

486
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,520
have ten percent

487
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,039
of the terminals that they need to make

488
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,359
use of that so they fielded an entire

489
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,919
array an entire constellation of new

490
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,679
state-of-the-art military satellites and

491
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,000
are completely unable to use them in the

492
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,119
context

493
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,959
of

494
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,039
their operational use

495
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,760
so that means reliance on legacy systems

496
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,839
that have since been at least partially

497
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,840
defunded because there's a new system in

498
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,720
place

499
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,840
they're still supported and there's

500
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,000
still things going on there but again

501
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,480
recall the costs of maintaining and

502
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,520
upgrading

503
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,720
especially outdated terminals

504
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,440
another amazing chart which i love

505
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,039
the global broadcast service is one

506
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,400
example of this

507
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,000
it's a critical piece of the dod's

508
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
intelligence network it provides

509
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,720
essentially wideband service to a lot of

510
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,280
tactical military users around the world

511
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,320
it's great but as you can see it is not

512
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,960
survivable against internal or external

513
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,720
cybersecurity threats

514
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,720
which is which is great considering this

515
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,480
is the network that's still in large

516
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,120
parts active

517
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,960
and it's very difficult as we know to

518
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,840
upgrade and patch as

519
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,120
needed if we look at the next one the

520
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,360
wideband global satellite network is

521
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,960
essentially the newer sibling for gbs

522
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,480
um they're still launching satellites

523
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,919
for that but they have enough for it to

524
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,520
be operational

525
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,240
so again this is having learned from the

526
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,919
lessons of the past they still have

527
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,280
designed it

528
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,280
never to provide protection against some

529
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,400
of the things that we expect our

530
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,840
adversaries to do in the near future

531
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,240
specifically relating to cyber security

532
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,960
concerns so even as we design new

533
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,960
hardware and software today and

534
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,799
continues to be systematically

535
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,320
vulnerable

536
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,240
and lacking that agility and software

537
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,840
updates because of the limited

538
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,760
constraints of resources that are put on

539
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,840
the table for this as the auditor says

540
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,799
in their own words

541
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,120
third satellite program the multi-user

542
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,039
objective system which is uh

543
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,919
specifically meant for navy use

544
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,919
and upgrading naval vessels is difficult

545
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,320
because you have to run ashore for this

546
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,000
it is quite difficult to schedule this

547
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,440
it has to rip them out of their

548
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,760
operational schedule that's fine uh in

549
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,600
2016 the system is not survivable

550
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,039
against cyber attacks they discovered

551
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,200
over 1 000 vulnerabilities in the ground

552
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,880
system and just in the ground system

553
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,320
in 2019 they still had significant cyber

554
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,400
security concerns obviously it takes a

555
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,760
long time to

556
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,600
patch all that

557
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,520
but and this is again the most important

558
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,360
not only are there severe cyber security

559
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,320
concerns in 2021 it's still not actually

560
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,720
being used in the vast majority of cases

561
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,559
so they're still relying on the old

562
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,880
systems the older uh

563
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,360
lesser uh secure systems because they

564
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,360
don't have a choice

565
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,080
so

566
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,760
both the news bad the old is bad it's

567
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,280
really difficult to reconcile all these

568
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:57,919
ah

569
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,520
this was meant to be

570
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,159
the like significant brainchild of uh

571
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,080
of dod planners and their respective

572
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,679
defense contracts to make a ship that's

573
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,919
modular it was meant to have swappable

574
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,240
mod modules they dropped all that uh it

575
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,000
was meant to be flexible and do a bunch

576
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,280
of different things

577
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,520
and it was critically designed to

578
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,960
designed by design to be not survivable

579
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,159
for any kind of combat contact

580
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,039
so

581
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,080
but one of the interesting things that

582
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,520
they're doing in this program that was

583
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,320
novel is that they actually

584
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,559
reduced the amount of staff on the craft

585
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,720
and instead relying on shore based

586
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,360
contractors for anything relating to

587
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,679
maintenance of the ship software systems

588
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,000
again shore based contractors imagine

589
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,760
the vulnerabilities both in the process

590
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,200
and the ability to actually patch

591
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,320
anything

592
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,320
but just the amount of of

593
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,799
supply chain and actual vulnerabilities

594
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,240
that that introduces into the process

595
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,960
that's not going very well uh the lcs is

596
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,559
not a very popular project they're still

597
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,080
finding things to do with it it has

598
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,240
significant cyber security deficiencies

599
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,440
uh it has no survivability

600
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,320
and

601
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,480
multiple issues

602
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,440
so these are just a sampling of various

603
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,600
dod programs i can assure you they're

604
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,240
quite representative though some are

605
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,000
more egregious than most and i'm not

606
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
necessarily saying this as an indictment

607
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,320
of dod it actually is increasingly

608
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,480
throwing money at the pro at the problem

609
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,400
uh and resources and it's gradually

610
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,240
getting better but they're essentially

611
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,880
chasing a circumstance that is entirely

612
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,400
difficult to navigate

613
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,760
from the get-go

614
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,919
having an agile cyber security solution

615
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,440
for major combat

616
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,840
programs when agility is the order of

617
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,000
the day and that's completely nearly

618
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,520
impossible to facilitate when you have

619
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,080
battleships uh cruisers and such

620
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,440
petroleum cs that's very difficult

621
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,600
so really there are many many challenges

622
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,360
in this process i love this diagram

623
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,320
because it makes absolutely no sense

624
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,320
information assurance is a cube but it's

625
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,200
a cube in a one-dimensional graph

626
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,760
it's amazing but um

627
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,760
essentially they're trying to do many

628
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,280
things at once they're trying to make

629
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,960
platforms to do everything and anything

630
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,840
they're by

631
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,600
increasing their own complexity where in

632
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,760
fact they should be simplifying things

633
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,200
they try to adopt commercial over the um

634
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,360
over-the-shelf solutions but that again

635
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,400
incurs

636
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,640
more vulnerabilities especially if you

637
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,120
do not have the patching cycles to uh

638
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,960
identify things and mitigate them as

639
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,440
they come up the life cycle of military

640
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,880
hardware and software despite best

641
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,039
attempts is still too rigid i think they

642
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,919
said that the average um

643
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,640
time to patch anything even in the best

644
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,799
of circumstances is at least seven

645
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,480
months which is

646
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,919
not great

647
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:42,960
and this is again just for the

648
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,559
circumstances where they know something

649
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,400
is up so for things that have been

650
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,640
caught by either internal vulnerability

651
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,880
assessment or published as a cve

652
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,720
somewhere and again resourcing is

653
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,880
improving but the more programs that

654
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,880
exist the more difficult that it becomes

655
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,930
so i will just say to wrap up that um

656
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,159
[Music]

657
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,360
this is

658
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,760
not necessarily meant to dig on the dod

659
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,440
um there are many challenges to the

660
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,120
circumstance and also it's important to

661
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,280
say one of the reasons why i was able to

662
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,520
have this talk is because the dod in its

663
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,880
various offices gives you a lot of

664
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,400
transparency into the audits there are

665
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,919
obviously um

666
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,760
classified annexes to all of these that

667
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,600
explain what the vulnerabilities are and

668
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,520
provide more thorough assessments at the

669
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,600
survivability of the program and so on

670
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,760
and so forth but this is this is great

671
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,600
visibility that you can get that is

672
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,760
fairly unique to the us so it is

673
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,679
something to call out and appreciate and

674
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,360
also that this is just a small sliver

675
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,039
and i will shamelessly plug my own book

676
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,720
here um

677
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,400
i look at offensive cyber operations

678
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,840
from the military angle in my upcoming

679
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,679
book and a lot of it covers some of the

680
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,200
inherent vulnerabilities that different

681
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,320
countries bring to the table and the u.s

682
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,159
over complicated and difficult approach

683
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:52,960
to

684
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,559
software and hardware development is one

685
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,640
such example so with that i'll stop

686
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,240
thanks danny and all the programs that

687
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,320
you've looked at

688
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,679
have you come across any good news

689
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,400
stories where the phases have crunched

690
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,880
down and become more efficient

691
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,720
um

692
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,960
there were a few of them that were

693
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,279
declared survivable

694
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,880
they tend to be

695
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,960
limited and they always have uh

696
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,720
asterisks in the sense that it was

697
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,960
survival as of x and under these limited

698
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,600
circumstances so

699
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,080
let's be honest for people here who have

700
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,480
done red teaming or pen testing just the

701
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,520
fact that we found something and

702
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,679
remediated it doesn't mean that it's

703
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:34,640
safe

704
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,840
so even the most well-resourced dod

705
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,080
programs and the best remediated uh

706
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,840
issues that they find

707
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,440
you know take survivability with a grain

708
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,039
of salt um but yes there are some some

709
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,320
some programs that come out better than

710
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,039
others let's see

711
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,559
good morning um so

712
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,200
other than trying to appropriately price

713
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,240
and take into consideration qa and

714
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,200
security during your like responses to

715
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,279
rfps as a contractor or the people

716
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,440
building these systems what other things

717
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,520
um should be done as like the initial

718
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,200
first steps of hey it's not gonna fix

719
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,200
everything but like we need to start

720
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,200
with this one two or three things and

721
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,640
we're going to get a lot better and on

722
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,559
that path to getting better

723
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,400
so that that's a great question and the

724
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,919
answer would have

725
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,360
essentially splits depending on where

726
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,080
you are in the program's life cycle

727
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,799
if this program is now initiating as

728
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,559
said it needs to have cyber security

729
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,799
concerns baked into the very design

730
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,200
aspects so creating secure platforms

731
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,600
that essentially uh don't trust each

732
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,000
other that have fail safes that have

733
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,600
mechanical and human overrides were

734
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,159
possible that also allow the operators

735
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,159
to implement a truly agile software

736
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,840
management process where they can update

737
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,159
things if they're needed uh but in doing

738
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,240
that not creating additional constraints

739
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,919
and vulnerabilities as a result of a

740
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,919
centralized patching system that's one

741
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,600
thing that's hard enough

742
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,080
for things that are already

743
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,600
that are already live i think it

744
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,440
requires a massive increase in the

745
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,120
budget for testing

746
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,279
to truly identify

747
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,080
where vulnerabilities are and not just

748
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,159
abstractly what's vulnerable what's

749
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,720
vulnerable in alignment to the expected

750
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,640
adversaries that you would encounter in

751
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,640
the field so there needs to be a

752
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,159
holistic approach that looks at

753
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,600
adversary intelligence and

754
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,520
cross-references that with the systemic

755
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,039
vulnerabilities of the combat platform

756
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,679
as it says considering that we view this

757
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,320
to be the most realistic uh

758
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,880
scenario essentially a a more thorough

759
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,559
investment in red teaming in order to

760
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,400
aggressively prioritize when needs to be

761
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,400
resolved first

762
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,840
uh one final question over here to your

763
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,679
right

764
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,320
so um if you're you know civilians

765
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,080
trying to you know understand the

766
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,159
problem and understand the issue how

767
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,600
intractable is the issue of the

768
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,200
clearances a lot of stuff is classified

769
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,880
how can we how can we provide help how

770
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,640
can we do what we need to do to support

771
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,360
the

772
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,799
the efforts if uh that's a barrier

773
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,720
yeah that's that's a difficult question

774
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,039
because a lot of uh the

775
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,720
actual work on the software and hardware

776
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,640
is done by a very specific set of

777
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,360
cleared military contractors so in that

778
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,200
sense there's not much that we can

779
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,000
directly do but i think

780
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,600
a lot of folks here have associations to

781
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,120
various elements of decision making

782
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,679
circles and if we can influence policy

783
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,279
in a way that would uh realign

784
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,720
priorities to focus more thoroughly on

785
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,080
this rather than creating the next

786
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,799
lethal platform i think that's where our

787
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,279
impact is and i think you know chris was

788
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,520
on earlier and discussed a lot about uh

789
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,880
priorities and how do we know what to

790
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,880
defend and how to defend it it's not

791
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,640
just about critical infrastructure as a

792
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,240
concept that needs to be defended and

793
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,480
absolutely does but it's also putting

794
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,520
pressure on dod through expert opinions

795
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,120
that this is something that we can

796
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,799
provide through this type of visibility

797
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,720
and say you need to focus on this rather

798
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,240
than that so

799
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,960
it's we have limited reach uh but we can

800
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,159
try and influence
