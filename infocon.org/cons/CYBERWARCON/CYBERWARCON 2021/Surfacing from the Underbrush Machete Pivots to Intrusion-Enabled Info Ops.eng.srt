1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,000
my name is blake javiharian i'm an

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,840
analyst for crowdstrike intelligence

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,240
where i monitor hacktivists as well as

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,400
state nexus threats primarily those

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,719
originating in south and southeast asia

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,080
the middle east and as i'm going to be

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,120
talking about today latin america

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,279
this discussion centers around uh an

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,199
interesting discovery that my team and i

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,520
made uh pretty recently regarding

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,000
connections between a

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,880
june intrusion operation and

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,800
information operations using recycled

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,960
material materials stolen and intrusion

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,520
operations recycled toward information

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,600
operations targeting at least one

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,520
government and civil society in latin

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,280
america

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,160
cool

20
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,800
so for those who aren't familiar with

21
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,600
the

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,840
threat actor machete is a latin america

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,360
focused threat actor that has been

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,360
active for a long period of time since

25
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,440
at least 2010. during this period of

26
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,480
time they've used primarily one

27
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,640
core malware family known alternately as

28
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,760
ragwa rat and of course machete

29
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,760
this is a highly modular

30
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,159
malware there's written in python

31
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,320
it's heavily obfuscated all the time can

32
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,600
be kind of a pain to reverse

33
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,799
and

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,840
they have incorporated new uh

35
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,000
new functions into it over time as well

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
as taking out capabilities depending on

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,560
the mission scope at any given time

38
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,360
uh

39
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,920
they tend to deliver this malware

40
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,040
alongside decoy and lore content

41
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,960
that is highly targeted

42
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,799
nearly always related to latin american

43
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,560
issues or organizations

44
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,079
for example they've tended to use

45
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,920
very good spoofs of government

46
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,439
correspondents uh acting as if it's uh

47
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,920
from government organizations or

48
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,119
in the direction toward government

49
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,320
organizations um as well as likely

50
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,439
stolen documents taken from uh

51
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,439
legitimate latin american organizations

52
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,000
especially in the previous two years

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,159
the venezuelan armed forces

54
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,600
so they have very

55
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,399
very convincing decoy content all of

56
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,479
these factors have

57
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,679
lent itself to an assessed target scope

58
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,520
uh primarily including latin america

59
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,080
with special emphasis on

60
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,560
ecuador venezuela

61
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,800
some nicaragua cuba

62
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,959
other countries in the region as well as

63
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,400
some uh groups internal to colombia most

64
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
notably the farc

65
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,160
the rebel group that i believe

66
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,519
originally

67
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,360
started up in like 64 or so and in 2016

68
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,120
negotiated a ceasefire with the

69
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,560
colombian government

70
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,800
since then we haven't really noticed any

71
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,760
targeting of that group since then

72
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,519
now to jump into the incident that we

73
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,360
observed in 2021

74
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,760
we found one microsoft office document

75
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,480
that had malicious macros it had generic

76
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,040
decoy content that said enable me in

77
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,959
spanish i won't speak any spanish i

78
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,879
don't want to butcher an accent

79
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,959
based this document was submitted to a

80
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,879
public mail repository from an ip

81
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,879
address based in ecuador

82
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,080
based on this document we were able to

83
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,840
find one that was nearly identical that

84
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,000
also had a spanish language file name

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
made the same network request

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,360
and

87
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,239
the file name was directly related to

88
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,879
the february 2021 general elections in

89
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,680
ecuador of this year um so it's very

90
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,920
timely we identified it uh pretty

91
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,319
recently after this um

92
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,080
and it had to do with ecuadorian current

93
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,239
events and both make the identical

94
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,799
network request to this adversary

95
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,959
control domain the dark knight rises

96
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,159
number number dot online um

97
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,440
for the retrieval of uh an instance of

98
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,720
machete malware disguised as a

99
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,480
was an installer for google chrome

100
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,720
pardon me

101
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,519
now

102
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,799
based on this

103
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,439
domain we identified using passive dns

104
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,040
data uh

105
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,080
the ip address that it has uh resolved

106
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,920
to for the majority of 2021.

107
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,480
looking into this ip address which has

108
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,640
had comparatively low traffic low

109
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,040
resolution traffic during this time

110
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,599
we're able to identify a solid number of

111
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,360
additional domains

112
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,238
primarily those that have to do or that

113
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,440
have names associated with uh

114
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,680
legislative issues including one that

115
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,080
was spoofing the ecuadorian general

116
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,199
assembly

117
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,199
their legislative body

118
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,759
as well as other spanish language themes

119
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,720
some like legal copyright dot whatever

120
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,160
and then there was one domain that

121
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,320
really caught my eye as i was analyzing

122
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,560
this which is the justiciamorada.org

123
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,080
domain

124
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,880
now

125
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,800
this domain if you were to visit it

126
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,360
throughout most of 2021 you would

127
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,400
encounter

128
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,560
a good amount of information on the page

129
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,400
being hosted uh

130
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,960
alleging uh corruption on the part of

131
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,360
ecuadorian political officials uh people

132
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,800
that were still in power as well as the

133
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,639
former president moreno

134
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,080
who's a

135
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,840
subject of some controversy as we'll get

136
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,400
into later in the in the discussion

137
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,039
but was also hosted

138
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,000
on this website was documents

139
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,400
that were allegedly and this was claimed

140
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,479
on the website itself stolen directly

141
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,039
from the ecuadorian judiciary the

142
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,759
federal judiciary at that

143
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,160
so on the left here we have one of the

144
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,759
documents as well as on the right we

145
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,120
have screenshots

146
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,240
from the website trying to corroborate

147
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,960
these claims so it has just screenshots

148
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,160
of an outlook

149
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,720
allegedly belonging to a current

150
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,080
ecuadorian judicial official

151
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,520
so based on these network and thematic

152
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,280
connections we

153
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,479
uh

154
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,800
we assessed that machete

155
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,479
and the malware deployment that we that

156
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,639
i previously talked about had a common

157
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,400
nexus or connection with whoever was uh

158
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,440
stealing and dropping uh these documents

159
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,919
that were uh pretty clearly meant to

160
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,960
have an impact on uh the political and

161
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,039
public views of individuals within

162
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,199
ecuador um especially in connection to

163
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,240
how they view certain public officials

164
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,759
now

165
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,080
based on that domain we were able to

166
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,840
find a little bit more

167
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,360
um

168
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,280
through a unique combination of four

169
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,440
name.com name servers how these how

170
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,720
these domains were registered we were

171
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,800
able to identify a slew of additional

172
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,039
domains many that have to do with

173
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,600
generic login type stuff a lot that also

174
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,440
had spanish language themes some that

175
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,120
had to do with ecuador specifically as

176
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,360
well

177
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,479
one of these innopapers.com

178
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,520
uh

179
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,520
doesn't really seem that interesting it

180
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,000
resembles another domain enterprise.org

181
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,280
whatever

182
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,199
and that both of the domains share the

183
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,240
same

184
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,880
combination of cloudflare uh name

185
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,880
servers so it's based on that it was

186
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,080
pretty likely that they were

187
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,560
administered under the same um

188
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,960
cloudflare administrator

189
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,639
we found these connections

190
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,440
but

191
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,720
who cares

192
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,840
well

193
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,599
in early 2019 ecuador underwent the

194
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,680
inner papers scandal in which a

195
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,000
threat actor or just a leaking entity

196
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,440
using that domain that i previously

197
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,400
mentioned in papers.org released a slew

198
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,000
of papers um and documents taken from

199
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
the ecuadorian government specifically

200
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,759
smearing the

201
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,639
president lenin moreno for

202
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,840
his offshore tax haven

203
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,360
ina uh enterprises or something like

204
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,080
that um named very tastefully for his

205
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,440
three daughters all three of them their

206
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,240
names and ena

207
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,840
the impacts of this

208
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,960
were

209
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,840
pretty interesting it didn't really it

210
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,479
tarnished president moreno's reputation

211
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,240
it didn't take him out of office he was

212
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,360
able to

213
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,280
take it down pretty quickly not the

214
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,199
website but to take down the allegations

215
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,639
and try to distance himself from it

216
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,879
also interesting though julian assange

217
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,039
at one point or at least wikileaks

218
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,919
shared a link to the same innopapers.org

219
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,520
thing just as a

220
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,400
sign of leaking support um

221
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,720
immediately following that the

222
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,479
ecuadorian government expelled him from

223
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,240
their embassy in london

224
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,160
subsequently he was arrested by western

225
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,400
authorities and he is still in prison

226
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,800
today so

227
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,360
what we have here is what we believe to

228
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,560
be a very concerted intrusion enabled

229
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,720
information operation connected to the

230
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,599
activity previously described

231
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,839
while it definitely probably went a long

232
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,440
way toward tarnishing moreno's

233
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,320
reputation i would say julian kind of

234
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,479
got screwed the most but that's just an

235
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,240
immediate impact

236
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,440
now

237
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,880
in terms of attribution for this

238
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,399
activity

239
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,880
as i stated previously there's some very

240
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,560
interesting things about machete in

241
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,680
general

242
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,680
the target scope is

243
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,680
very pertinent to

244
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,720
um

245
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,040
to the likely intelligence collection

246
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,839
priorities of the colombian government

247
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,920
uh including contractors and

248
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,279
subcontractors that might work for the

249
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,720
colombian government doing this sort of

250
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,880
activity we haven't identified anything

251
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,040
that would um

252
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,760
uh that would indicate a sort of broader

253
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,399
target scope it's very pertinent to

254
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,800
that regional interest and

255
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,640
as well as the sector level interest in

256
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,040
military and government entities in the

257
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,320
region

258
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,480
as we've also identified historical

259
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,200
network infrastructure registration pass

260
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,480
patterns

261
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,240
hosting providers being used

262
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,519
historically that were based in colombia

263
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,440
and aspects such as this that make it

264
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,120
pretty clear that previously they had

265
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,680
some operational security issues um that

266
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,519
pin them down to a

267
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,519
certain geographical origin

268
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,440
as well as historical malware artifacts

269
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,399
that we

270
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,839
previously identified we haven't seen

271
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,040
recently

272
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,440
but more operational security issues

273
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,240
where uh malware strings would mention

274
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,120
uh

275
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,920
specific colombian bans uh physical

276
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,760
landmarks things like that

277
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,720
um that made it really clear that uh at

278
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,480
the very least the malware developers

279
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,120
behind it likely had some sort of nexus

280
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,600
to colombia

281
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
so as a result of this crowdstrike

282
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,839
intelligence attributes this activity to

283
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,760
the machete threat actor which we

284
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,519
attribute to

285
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,680
the colombian government in

286
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,239
some sense

287
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,920
anyway thank you very much for hearing

288
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,079
my skill
