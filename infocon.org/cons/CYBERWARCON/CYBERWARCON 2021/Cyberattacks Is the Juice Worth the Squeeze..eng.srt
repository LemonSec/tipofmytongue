1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,520
all right so john reached out to me a

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,639
few months ago and said you got to

3
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,640
really do talk on cyber attacks no one's

4
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,000
talking about cyber attacks and i

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,080
thought about

6
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,000
doing a talk on cyber attacks but

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,080
looking at it from a perspective of are

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,599
they actually worth it are they actually

9
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,280
accomplishing anything

10
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,199
and a few caveats i won't be talking

11
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,560
about all the cyber attacks because i

12
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,720
only have 10 minutes i'll think of this

13
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,800
as sort of the immemorial memorial

14
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,439
section of the oscars uh it's going to

15
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,599
be the biggest hits i won't cover some

16
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,640
of the latest iran israel stuff oh

17
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,159
because i know jag will cover some of

18
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,079
that but let's go through

19
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,440
a few of the major ones now i know

20
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,000
everyone loves

21
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,200
giving quotes of sun tzu i figured that

22
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,320
it would be good to introduce some

23
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,480
variety into cyber talks now so i have a

24
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,320
quote from george cannon who i think is

25
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,320
much better than sun tzu and

26
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,360
of course the

27
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,680
head strategist of uh the cold war and

28
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,199
containment

29
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,600
talking about coercion and its tendency

30
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,280
to find their own natural masters the

31
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,199
instruments of coercion

32
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,960
all right as gabby said learn your flags

33
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,879
so we'll go through this really quickly

34
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,479
major attacks the first one that i was

35
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,960
thinking about that was really big and i

36
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,479
ended up working on at the time were the

37
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,720
ddos attacks that north koreans had

38
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,640
launched against south korea

39
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,560
and the u.s some of the major sites in

40
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,799
the u.s like ebay and others they may

41
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,640
recall back from that time

42
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,119
in 2009 actually coin signing with july

43
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,040
4th holiday

44
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,720
and not only was it a

45
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,720
disruptive attacks from ddos perspective

46
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,560
but it had a wiper element associated

47
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,240
with it as well because the botnet that

48
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,400
they had built a lot of it consisted of

49
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,079
machines based in south korea were then

50
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,640
wiped a few days after the attack

51
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,640
so let's look at the geopolitical

52
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,280
context around it um so these attacks

53
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,840
did not emanate out of nowhere you had

54
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,000
dramatic escalations between north korea

55
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,159
and south korea and the us taking place

56
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,280
at the time you had the breakdown in the

57
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,640
nuclear talks

58
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,360
which was followed in july in may by

59
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,520
nuclear test and then in july by missile

60
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,920
tests and the u.n condemnation happening

61
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,600
on june 12th right a few weeks before

62
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,000
the cyber attacks taking place

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,600
and when you look at the effects it was

64
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,960
pretty clear that this was a tamper

65
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,800
tantrum on behalf of the north koreans

66
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,440
it was retaliation for the u.s

67
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,520
condemnation and driving the u.n

68
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,879
condemnations but it didn't really

69
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,640
achieve anything the escalations

70
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,319
continued if they thought that the us

71
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,000
would back down or the south koreans

72
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,319
would back down didn't happen in fact

73
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,319
this led uh later on through the chun on

74
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,480
um incident of of the

75
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,200
uh uh south korean boat that was um sunk

76
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,440
in 2010 and a variety of different other

77
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,080
escalations authority firings and so

78
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,760
forth later that year

79
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,760
stuxnet everyone knows about stuxnet

80
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,360
won't cover that much in detail the most

81
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,599
interesting thing that i found looking

82
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,360
back at stuxnet which was i think a

83
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,200
story not well covered is how little

84
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,959
effect it actually had they only

85
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,640
destroyed a thousand out of 9000

86
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,160
centrifuges most of them were actually

87
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,000
destroyed by iranians themselves that

88
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,640
were carted them out not by the worm but

89
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,680
the

90
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,000
low enrichment uranium production

91
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,159
actually increased during the period of

92
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,159
succulent that was something that i did

93
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,560
not realize at the time was all taking

94
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,560
place and looking back it actually

95
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,920
didn't delay the iranian nuclear

96
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,920
enrichment program by much maybe a few

97
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,599
months at best

98
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,400
and

99
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,080
of course it led to iranians actually

100
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,760
investing heavily in their own offensive

101
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,560
capabilities which we're now seeing um

102
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,400
out there play out in the real world

103
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,720
against israel and the us

104
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,920
and speaking of that shimoon 2012

105
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,519
didn't again

106
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,400
come out of nowhere you had saudi arabia

107
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,720
suggesting right prior to shimoon in

108
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,040
january and then in june of 2012 shimon

109
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,280
taking place later that august that it

110
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,319
was going to offset iranian oil that was

111
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,239
going to be impacted by u.s sanctions in

112
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,080
fact saudi arabia was lobbying for more

113
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,760
sanctions against iran

114
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,720
and

115
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,840
the saudis were saying we're going to

116
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,599
offset that oil go ahead and sanction

117
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,159
them iranians responding

118
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,000
as you might imagine very angrily to

119
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,319
that suggestion um and hitting saudi

120
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,720
aramco literally just a month later

121
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,319
and trying to impact their own oil

122
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,519
production

123
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,400
but didn't lead anywhere saudis did not

124
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,920
abandon their aggressive line against

125
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,879
iran in fact the proxy war continued uh

126
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,200
over the course of the war in yemen

127
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,519
and syria and elsewhere throughout the

128
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,879
region

129
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,000
sony pictures everyone knows that um the

130
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,600
cause was of course the interview the

131
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,079
movie that um attempted to assassinate

132
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,000
or showed the attempted assassination of

133
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,759
kim jong-un

134
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,360
and the interview was still released

135
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,840
over christmas so even that where it was

136
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,840
a very target operation trying to

137
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,600
achieve very specific effect against a

138
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
commercial entity did not ultimately

139
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,280
succeed in stopping the movie that they

140
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,000
were so uh objecting to

141
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,360
ukrainian great attacks so there were

142
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,600
two great attacks in ukraine by russia

143
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,000
in 2000 um

144
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,040
in 2015 and 2016.

145
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,040
what a lot of people don't realize is

146
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,240
that there were geopolitical

147
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,560
consequences leading to those attacks as

148
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,240
well they were broader than just the

149
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,919
overall conflict between ukraine and

150
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,560
russia in fact in november just a month

151
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,199
prior to the december 2015 attacks there

152
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,720
was sabotage

153
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,280
explosion that was done in

154
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,560
her song

155
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,400
a city in ukraine that's right across

156
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,800
the peninsula from crimea that shut off

157
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,840
power to all of crimea so uh two million

158
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,479
people in crimea were left without power

159
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,160
as a result of that sabotage the

160
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,680
russians of course accused the

161
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,680
ukrainians ukrainians denied any

162
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,520
involvement but blamed it on some

163
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,160
volunteers but as a result

164
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,479
the russians got very angry and

165
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,919
literally a month later shut off the

166
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,280
power to eastern ukraine um southeastern

167
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,479
ukraine

168
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,280
to 800 thousand people um but if they

169
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,199
wanted to avoid conflict if they wanted

170
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,960
to get the power turned back on to

171
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,039
crimea it did not happen in fact there

172
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,680
were continued outages throughout uh

173
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,960
early 2016 post that attack they try to

174
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,880
ship a lot of generators to crimea to

175
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,360
restore power at least for a few hours a

176
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,919
day in major cities in crimea until

177
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,919
later in 2016 and may they finally

178
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,960
managed to put an energy bridge across

179
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,680
the

180
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,199
um uh

181
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,720
the straits um

182
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,880
um the carrich straits and and i'll

183
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,400
actually provide reliable power to

184
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,600
ukraine so

185
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,280
even though that was a direct response

186
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,120
to what they saw as ukrainian aggression

187
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,680
against crimea shutting off power trying

188
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,840
to get that power turned on did not work

189
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,000
with their retaliation

190
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,680
not petya

191
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,840
again did not come out of nowhere you

192
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,840
had escalations and fighting between the

193
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,360
ukrainians and the russians which had

194
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,080
been frozen for actually

195
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,280
much of 2016 in 2016 you had the

196
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,759
resumption of fighting in the don bass

197
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,800
um you had a truce agreement that was

198
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,400
established in june of 24 uh 24th four

199
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,479
days prior to napatia that agreement

200
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,039
collapses later that same day um the

201
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,880
russians get pretty annoyed and on

202
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,240
constitution day in ukraine they'll

203
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,680
launch not petya

204
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,520
did not accomplish anything if they

205
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,039
thought that they were gonna

206
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,759
get ukraine to um

207
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,440
de-escalate if they were gonna

208
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,000
get this them to back off the fight did

209
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,919
not happen the fighting resumed uh

210
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,400
viciously later in august and throughout

211
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,479
the the following year

212
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,360
the bad rabbit attacks um uh were a

213
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,960
continuation of that they thought well

214
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,160
we tried once let's try again um sbu

215
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,759
actually had advanced warning that the

216
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,000
attacks were going to come on ukrainian

217
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,280
defender day which was going to be

218
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,680
october 14th ultimately it was delayed

219
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,599
till october 24th

220
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,880
the irony is that there was huge

221
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,120
blowback in russia itself with major

222
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,280
russian firms and airports being shut

223
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,440
down as a result of the attack spreading

224
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,120
to to lots of companies within russia

225
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,360
and by the way i did not uh

226
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,360
select all of these targets on purpose i

227
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,639
was literally thinking of the biggest

228
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,800
attacks we had seen last five years

229
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
and it just so happens that russia has

230
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,840
been very busy in those last five years

231
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,199
olympic destroyer really quickly

232
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,879
everyone is aware russia was suspended

233
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,080
from the olympics on december 5th 2017 a

234
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,400
few months before the olympics um the

235
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,560
attacks did not achieve anything in

236
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,840
terms of getting them reinstated

237
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,520
certainly not throughout the games in

238
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,440
2018 or even in the games of 2020 um uh

239
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,879
where they were still not allowed to

240
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,520
show their flag now the triton attacks

241
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,160
are the only ones that i found really

242
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,919
interesting and

243
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,000
not aligned with the norms that you're

244
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,440
seeing established here where you

245
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,080
actually have geopolitical conflict

246
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,400
leading directly to cyber aggression

247
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,560
because in the case of triton which was

248
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,599
an attack on a saudi oil refinery uh

249
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,640
from june to august 2017 which has now

250
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,719
been attributed to russia

251
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,559
officially by us government

252
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,000
you did not have a straining of

253
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,839
relations between russia and saudi

254
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,800
arabia in fact quite the opposite in may

255
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,360
just prior to those attacks you had mbs

256
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,360
visiting moscow vladimir putin saying

257
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,040
the state of relations between saudi

258
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,800
arabia and russia was the best that it's

259
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,760
ever been

260
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,120
and they were planning on the king

261
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,440
salman visit later that summer which

262
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,519
ultimately got too late to october uh

263
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,200
but nevertheless still happened king

264
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,399
salman brought over 1500 people to the

265
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,160
uh with his delegation red carpet

266
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,240
treatment really interesting case not

267
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,000
quite sure what was the reason behind

268
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,080
that attack perhaps it was a test case

269
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,000
they simply didn't have enough equipment

270
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,519
to buy for the lab so they decided to

271
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,959
use a saudi arabian refinery uh instead

272
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,240
uh but that was the only one that did

273
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,839
not fit the

274
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,560
context and lastly georgia attacks

275
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,120
also related to protests there final

276
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,160
point

277
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,000
all of these geopolitical concerns lead

278
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,760
directly to cyber attacks but don't

279
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,279
actually accomplish any objectives

280
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,440
strategically for these states they

281
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,839
ultimately end up using them as stamper

282
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,880
tantrums as a way to lash out and show

283
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,880
that they're doing something but not

284
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,800
actually changing the behavior of the um

285
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,880
target victims in some ways in may and

286
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,200
in fact in many ways uh in which the us

287
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,519
uses sanctioned power when we want to

288
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,440
express our displeasure other states use

289
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,040
cyber attacks thank you very much
