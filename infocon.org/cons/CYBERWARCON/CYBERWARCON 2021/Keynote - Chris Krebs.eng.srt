1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,000
so i mean look here's the trick though

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,279
right uh i think that there's probably

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,040
a third of the people in this room that

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,720
i reached out to at some point over the

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,160
last four years going what do you think

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,000
is going on out there i mean whole quest

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,200
i would

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,160
ping

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,079
uh particularly if it was iran related

10
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,840
it's like what are you guys seeing uh

11
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,680
you know there are so many people in

12
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,080
this room that actually contributed to a

13
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,279
lot of the efforts particularly around

14
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,119
the election work last year

15
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,760
um i i am simply a physical

16
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,279
manifestation of this conference

17
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,880
it was in a position of leadership that

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,239
was able to channel a lot of the

19
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,920
concepts the ideas the things y'all were

20
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,200
worried about the things that we needed

21
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,000
to do so that was a that was a

22
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,480
complete honor to be in that job

23
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,239
i do think that this is an incredibly

24
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,480
important uh conference just because

25
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,680
it's different

26
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,800
it's not a vendor-shilling experience

27
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,879
it's people coming in and sharing

28
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,320
research really good understanding of

29
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,760
the things that you're seeing out there

30
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,719
and helping inform what is a woefully

31
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,840
inadequate tech policy space here in in

32
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,880
this city um i had dinner to go to uh i

33
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,080
had the opportunity to go to dinner with

34
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,920
a member of congress last night he's

35
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,280
probably going to get censured by his

36
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,479
own party today

37
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,280
but the it's the people like that that

38
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,439
will listen that will take conversations

39
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,119
and meetings and input and help guide

40
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,040
policy now whether that actually lands

41
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,080
in anything because you can't get

42
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,680
legislation done in this this town

43
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,360
that's a whole different story

44
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,360
nonetheless big conference it's a big

45
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,320
week though so yesterday i

46
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,479
had the opportunity

47
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,799
to release a report with the aspen

48
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,240
institute on

49
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,240
the commission on information disorder

50
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,680
it's a set of about 15 different

51
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,040
recommendations that i worked on with a

52
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,360
really diverse group of people that you

53
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,560
wouldn't necessarily think about in

54
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,240
disinformation but they come from

55
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,200
academia from media former government

56
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,200
officials like me and will hurd who was

57
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,640
a congressman uh in the last congress uh

58
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,040
you had kate starboard from uw you had

59
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,119
alex thomas my business partner also at

60
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,759
stanford uh we had contributions from a

61
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,000
couple of folks in the room tom i saw

62
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,040
you

63
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,560
around here so there you are

64
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,038
um you know it it's a i think it's a

65
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,040
unique it's a different approach and how

66
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,640
to address the the current

67
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,800
disinformation problem so it's exciting

68
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,480
to get that out it's one of those first

69
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,760
things that i jumped into after leaving

70
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,760
government last year

71
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,160
uh second thing is today in addition to

72
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,200
this conference it's sis third birthday

73
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,280
and i had the

74
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,360
honor of leading that and the privilege

75
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,120
of leading that organization and really

76
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,000
pushing getting the the agency stood up

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,519
uh and put in a position to make a what

78
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,239
i think was a meaningful uh impact on on

79
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,840
cyber security and democracy in this

80
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,400
country it's good to finally see it have

81
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,480
competent leadership in jen easterly

82
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,319
she's done a great job

83
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,000
relatedly tomorrow is the one year

84
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,599
anniversary of me being fired for doing

85
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,720
my job so

86
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,330
[Applause]

87
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,080
and i i'm treating myself by uh flying

88
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,599
to las vegas this afternoon doing a

89
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,640
conference in the morning and then

90
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,319
flying back so i'll have a lot of

91
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,000
playing time to watch

92
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,959
um

93
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,040
but you know it a lot's happened over

94
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,680
the last year for me uh i've like i said

95
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,959
i've had the opportunity to stand up a

96
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,200
consulting practice couple the the folks

97
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,159
between bella and gavin are here

98
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,239
uh i did the aspen thing but i'm also

99
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,920
traveling around a lot and talking to

100
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,920
folks um to kind of hear what they're

101
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,080
worried about and as i've you know been

102
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,840
traveling in the wilderness

103
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,560
uh both here in the u.s but also last

104
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,400
week i was in in brussels and in paris

105
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,239
talking with nato and then then some

106
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,799
clients uh i get i get three main

107
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,440
questions like the first is why is it so

108
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,480
bad

109
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,000
the second

110
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,040
the second is what the hell is the

111
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,440
government doing about it and the third

112
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,519
is kind of like what do we do about

113
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,400
it

114
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,000
um so what i'm going to do is give you a

115
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,640
little bit of a twist on

116
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,640
those three questions my answers but

117
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,239
really kind of thinking about the themes

118
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,640
that kind of worry me the most right now

119
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,159
what those actually mean and then and

120
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,480
then rounding about back off to what do

121
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,840
we do about it and there's not a shot

122
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,599
clock here john so i'm just going to

123
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,000
talk and then start waving give me the

124
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,439
five minute warning

125
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,079
um so i so

126
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,759
i i'm not going to do the normal thing i

127
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,639
do when you talk to um

128
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,280
you know non-cyber security folks

129
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,440
uh where it's like so i'm gonna tell you

130
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,440
about china and russia y'all know more

131
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,040
about actually what they're doing on a

132
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,360
day-to-day basis than i do so i'll just

133
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,680
say that it's it's a really scary

134
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,919
environment when every single country

135
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,160
has the ability to develop

136
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,759
certainly intelligence collection

137
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,919
capabilities but also domestic

138
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,520
surveillance capabilities you have

139
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,720
criminals that are monetizing

140
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,639
vulnerabilities and misconfigurations on

141
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,000
a regular basis

142
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
and ultimately everybody's aspiring

143
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,240
towards some sort of cyber disruptive

144
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,360
capability actually hitting

145
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,520
infrastructure and taking it offline

146
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,639
that's what's going to overcome the

147
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,759
force

148
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,400
asymmetry that the us enjoys right now

149
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,360
that we have

150
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,039
a significant advantage over almost

151
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,680
every adversary so how do they they they

152
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,680
uh compensate for that and that's that's

153
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,600
ones and zeros

154
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,840
um and one of the kind of rhetorical

155
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,680
tricks i'll do in these in these rooms

156
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,120
when i'm talking to folks i'll say close

157
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,960
your eyes put yourself three four five

158
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,880
years in the future and think about

159
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,240
everything around you think about the

160
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,000
connected devices in your home on your

161
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,840
person in your person in your office in

162
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,280
your car are there going to be more

163
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,560
they're going to be fewer i think the

164
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,800
obvious answer is is there's more and

165
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,320
the biggest challenge is the incentive

166
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,840
structures as they're set up right now

167
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,600
there's actually not a whole lot of

168
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
incentives for those devices to be

169
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,919
secure by design and deployment

170
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,360
so we can continue to hold these

171
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,520
conferences and scare people and and

172
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,680
actually see some changes in the bigs

173
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,520
right i mean we have big technology

174
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,960
companies represented here that are

175
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,759
doing good things uh but the install

176
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,919
base is still a really permissive

177
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,360
environment

178
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,000
and so as i as i sit back and and think

179
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,680
through what are the maybe over the last

180
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,000
year year and a half some of the trends

181
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,720
that were the me the most the first is

182
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,800
is solar winds and it's not solar winds

183
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,039
right i mean that was just the kind of

184
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,120
scratching the surface the manifestation

185
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,680
of a broader campaign

186
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,600
there were multiple other companies that

187
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,199
were similarly targeted by svr nobelium

188
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,960
holiday bear i'm not holiday bear i'm

189
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,360
not sure if dimitri's here yet but um

190
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,120
that that seemed i haven't heard that

191
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,319
that in a while but um it's it's the

192
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,960
it's capable adversaries like the svr

193
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,080
like the mss that are developing global

194
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,560
surveillance infrastructure real-time

195
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,039
on-demand access

196
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,720
and it's kind of the willy sutton trick

197
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,639
so willie sutton famous bank robber when

198
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,400
they asked him why are you robbing banks

199
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,080
because that's where the money is same

200
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,400
thing here why are they going after

201
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,560
critical software systemically important

202
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,919
software is because that's where the

203
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,759
access is that's where the data is

204
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,120
rather than going knocking on the front

205
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,360
door of the ministry of foreign affairs

206
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,919
or the big banks they go in through the

207
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,599
third party dependencies and so we're

208
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,160
going to continue to see that play out

209
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,800
for the foreseeable future and i think

210
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,400
that in part what the with the

211
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,639
administration did by identifying

212
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,720
critical software and saying you must be

213
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,720
this tall to ride now i think that was a

214
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,720
good thing i think that should if done

215
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,680
right

216
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,280
should have some cascading effects to

217
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,360
the rest of

218
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,960
the rest of

219
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,319
the private sector not just the

220
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,360
government

221
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,199
so the second thing and this was kind of

222
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,199
part of as i was transitioning out you

223
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,080
always hear about people that have um

224
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,440
have an opportunity to leave like a

225
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,599
letter in the desk for their successor

226
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,919
like what was left undone

227
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,639
um well lots but the two things that

228
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,759
that i

229
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,120
had hoped to

230
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,960
put a lot more pressure on and a lot

231
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,199
more focus on at cisa and then handed

232
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,080
off into kind of a strategic memo

233
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,360
uh the two things one was ransomware uh

234
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,720
and you know

235
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,000
we all know how that turned out over the

236
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
last 11 months

237
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,039
um

238
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,080
and the second was disinformation and on

239
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,840
the disinformation front i won't dig too

240
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,160
much deeper here but i do think

241
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,440
that if you continue to uh

242
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,120
tap

243
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,440
government officials with rants with

244
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,440
disinformation duties otherwise assigned

245
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,960
when cyber security is their primary

246
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,879
focus it's going to get the outcome you

247
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,479
expect right you actually have to put

248
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,120
someone in a leadership position with

249
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,560
thinking through a disinformation

250
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,160
strategy a counter disinformation

251
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,399
strategy and it's not just offense but

252
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,360
it's thinking through what are the

253
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,039
capabilities we have we don't have in

254
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,320
proposing

255
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,760
recommendations for additional

256
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,599
authorities congress you know you're

257
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,240
just going to continue to see

258
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,120
kind of

259
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,480
chipping around the edges here so we

260
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,160
need a much more strategic approach i

261
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,519
think the accounting disinfo but back to

262
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,040
the ransomware piece

263
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,959
i mean this was it's like thanos it was

264
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,000
inevitable right it's that install base

265
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,959
that's um now it that cuts both ways

266
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,480
right on the inevitable piece because we

267
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,519
know how in game finished up but the the

268
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,120
point here is that

269
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,040
it's such a permissive and permissive

270
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,839
environment with

271
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,640
misconfigurations

272
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,920
vulnerabilities to be exploited that's

273
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,080
that's all this is right it's it's the

274
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,200
ult it's just eventual

275
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,600
monetizing of those vulnerabilities and

276
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,480
configurations enabled by

277
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,080
cryptocurrencies where they can

278
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,760
transition money out

279
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,000
as well as a safe harbor so i think the

280
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,839
last several months we've seen a change

281
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,080
in strategy which i think is helpful

282
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,720
where we start we've you know as patrick

283
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
gray would say release the hounds we've

284
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,880
gone after them we've uh in part

285
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,560
docstone but you've seen law enforcement

286
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,120
action you've seen reported

287
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,160
i think nakasone's even talked about it

288
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,200
you know

289
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,440
degradation attacks sand and friction

290
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,440
against some of the affiliates at least

291
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,600
but also maybe some of the the

292
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,040
devs themselves

293
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,279
uh imposing costs i mean that's got to

294
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,680
be the answer here but you're not going

295
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,959
to

296
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,560
take away all the attack surface um just

297
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,640
by going after the bad guys

298
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,839
we're gonna have to continue to up level

299
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,040
um our security capabilities the third

300
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,040
the third thing i'm worried about is

301
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,480
pipelines and not that pipeline not

302
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,839
colonial um

303
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,680
it's it's the the fbi sisa joint alert

304
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,079
from this summer it was in june they

305
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,079
talked about the chinese state-sponsored

306
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,000
actors going after targeting 23

307
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,399
different natural gas pipeline operators

308
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,200
with

309
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,920
successful compromises of 13 and another

310
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,880
seven with unknown uh compromise this

311
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,600
there's one line in that alert from this

312
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,640
summer

313
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,920
that should scare the hell out of

314
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,680
everybody and it's they're going after

315
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,440
the pipelines to hold our infrastructure

316
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,600
at risk and so this goes back to that

317
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,640
how people are going to compensate for

318
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,640
force projection mismatches and

319
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,600
asymmetry that's a first strike package

320
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,240
and no i'm not talking about like cyber

321
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,040
911s and cyber pearl harbors and all

322
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,120
that but this is how you win a war you

323
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,800
never fight the war you make the

324
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,519
adversary change their decision calculus

325
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,360
and you don't put them in you put in a

326
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,880
position where they don't want to fight

327
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,560
that battle and this is partly what

328
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,000
they're doing here and it's not just the

329
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
chinese it's the russians as well and

330
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,440
this is where i think the iranians and

331
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,279
everywhere else is going to go they're

332
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,200
going to put

333
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,959
you know put us in a position where the

334
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,040
homeland is no longer a sanctuary this

335
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,600
is just like 1957

336
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,200
when you had mutually assured

337
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,640
destruction

338
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,120
we are in we're approaching that sort of

339
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,240
uh uh you know that that capability they

340
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,200
have

341
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,240
um and then and and so when i think

342
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,640
about the themes so if those are the

343
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,240
adversary activities that i'm worried

344
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,399
about there are three kind of pieces

345
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,480
that fall out of that that also concern

346
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,600
me

347
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,279
the first is just we are we are

348
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,040
operating in a contested environment i

349
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,079
mean that's it you know our networks our

350
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,600
contestant environments our businesses

351
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,760
our governments they all operate in a

352
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,600
space where we do not have information

353
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,920
dominance and that

354
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,959
has to change our decision calculus on

355
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,040
how we engage how we work with partners

356
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,800
in government no single organization

357
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,000
right is going to be able to defend

358
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,360
themselves

359
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,399
the second piece is is dilution and

360
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,680
distraction

361
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,839
so as i think back to the beginning of

362
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,440
2020

363
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,360
really started that year off with a bang

364
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,160
right the strike against uh suleimani

365
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,000
and that's where i picked up the phone

366
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,079
and called holdquest and said what do

367
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,000
you think happens here uh called a

368
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,320
number of other folks in this room and

369
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
the idea is that

370
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,399
that set everybody on edge

371
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,800
and then at the same time the fsb center

372
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,800
16 was doing a whole bunch of different

373
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,639
uh brute force attacks throughout the

374
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,320
country on critical infrastructure state

375
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,000
and local governments then you had

376
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,480
ransomware and so every single like if

377
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,720
any of you do ir or you know probably

378
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,040
all of you in some way i mean it's

379
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,560
exhausting

380
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,440
and one of the kind of our fears my

381
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,120
fears and this goes to the dilution

382
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,160
piece

383
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,880
is

384
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,480
is that there was

385
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,800
in the run-up to the 2020 election is

386
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,320
that we were facing kind of a government

387
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,920
denial of service

388
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,240
and that our ir teams by the time

389
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,639
october ran around or came around we

390
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,279
were going to be worn out we would have

391
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,120
lost kind of the signal-to-noise ratio

392
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,399
and didn't really understand what was

393
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,440
important

394
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,839
um that continues we continue to see day

395
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,760
in day out activity that keeps our we

396
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,440
just don't have enough ir people and

397
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,680
burnout is a real thing

398
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,600
uh so we continue to worry about that on

399
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,240
the distraction piece

400
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,279
by

401
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,519
providing or you know giving out such a

402
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,800
permissive environment for the

403
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,440
ransomware actors to come in and create

404
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,440
havoc

405
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,959
what we've had to do

406
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,360
is shift the focus

407
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,519
of our intelligence community and

408
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,040
department of defense

409
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,360
to other things like so you know i don't

410
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,760
know what the trade-offs have been

411
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,519
but there's a set

412
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,399
set of finite set of resources in the ic

413
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,320
and so when you say okay now ransomware

414
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,760
is a priority go figure out what the

415
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,199
connections are here

416
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,480
they're not doing something they were

417
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,399
doing the day before and i think that

418
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,720
puts us in a much more precarious

419
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,760
position

420
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,680
that we have to we have to think through

421
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,120
and it's we're not going to just throw

422
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,279
more money at the problem

423
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,040
the the tail is too long on this we've

424
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,160
got to

425
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,839
continue to implore

426
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,000
the private sector to to uplift you know

427
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,519
bootstrap a little bit to uplift your

428
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,360
security but but that's

429
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,360
that's impossible i mean i think about

430
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,959
bryson you had a

431
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,639
you keep throwing up the slides about 32

432
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,160
million private sector organizations in

433
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,480
the u.s 16 of them have a security

434
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,440
function

435
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,639
less than 2

436
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,360
2 000 of them might have a red team

437
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,360
capability so what's that

438
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,480
where does that leave us from an

439
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,279
exposure perspective

440
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,160
um

441
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,519
and the

442
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,199
the the third theme we have is is just

443
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,560
kind of rounding it back to that contest

444
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,560
environment it's too permissive of an

445
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,680
environment right the william gibson

446
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,959
neuromancer unthinkable complexity

447
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,720
it's incredibly difficult right now to

448
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,399
particularly in large estates the

449
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,320
federal government for example 101

450
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,000
civilian agencies

451
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
in just the federal

452
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,760
the the civilian side of the federal

453
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,240
government incredibly complex legacy

454
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,120
infrastructure three-year uh budget

455
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,279
cycles or three years in advance plan

456
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,240
out your budget i mean the human brain

457
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,120
struggles to think about how complex

458
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,360
this is

459
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,320
so what do we do about all this

460
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,519
um i you know again

461
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,639
thanos inevitable lines uh i think

462
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,880
regulations inevitable

463
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,720
i think what's also inevitable is that

464
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,720
we'll get it wrong

465
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,440
uh again unthinkable complexities so i

466
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,120
think what we have to do is come into an

467
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,399
approach here

468
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,519
where we focus on what's important first

469
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,040
we have to really distill down the

470
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,759
critical functions that we

471
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,880
prioritize we put first at at the top of

472
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,839
the list now the challenge here is that

473
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,320
what's critical today

474
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,920
might not be as critical tomorrow or

475
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,279
there's some maybe something more

476
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,360
critical so roll you back again march

477
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,680
2020

478
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,519
and with covet

479
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,680
and then all of a sudden vaccine supply

480
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,480
chain

481
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,759
was probably one of the most critical

482
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,480
national functions in the united states

483
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,240
and we did not have a full understanding

484
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,480
of visibility along that supply chain in

485
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,720
that value chain cold chain ended up

486
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,240
being the most critical part for the

487
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,800
mrna

488
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,079
vaccines

489
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,000
so we have to have a dynamic assessment

490
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,079
real time dynamic assessment of what's

491
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,000
critical and continue to put

492
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,519
put the appropriate investments in there

493
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,560
but again i think we have to change the

494
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,360
decision calculus across

495
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,040
our private sector partners and karen

496
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,680
martin wrote a great op-ed uh over the

497
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,199
weekend about this uh in the

498
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,000
privatization of cyber security

499
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,319
and i'm not advocating at all for the

500
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,679
federal government to come in because i

501
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,520
know the people in this room

502
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,199
um

503
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,640
are in a better position than the

504
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,480
federal government most

505
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,119
from a security and ir perspective but

506
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,480
you've got to have a more transparent

507
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,480
open conversation

508
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,720
um i think uh

509
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,959
the

510
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,119
you know the things i usually say here

511
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,640
when i'm talking to private sector

512
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,160
organizations is like oh it starts at

513
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,919
the top it's leadership you know

514
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,200
everybody's going to be part of the

515
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,520
security team but we know again we've

516
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,480
got to have a more discreet focus on

517
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,840
the things that matter so there's

518
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,440
critical technologies and services that

519
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,440
matter we've got to make it easier to

520
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,039
secure deploy

521
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,400
and manage

522
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,400
for uh the defenders for the for the

523
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,919
network owners and operators it's the

524
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,200
only way we're going to get out of this

525
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,600
but but again it is going to be the rest

526
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,120
of human history

527
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,799
that we have

528
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,000
a complex digital world that is going to

529
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,720
be part of the battle space

530
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,200
and you know this is the point

531
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,280
of of holdquist and in his patches

532
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,840
of the cyber war

533
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,280
veterans i mean this is it this is the

534
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,480
team

535
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,919
that will make a difference going

536
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,120
forward so

537
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,960
uh i look forward to

538
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,799
listening in to the the rest of the day

539
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,480
appreciate everybody coming in and doing

540
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,880
what you're doing on a daily basis and

541
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,280
um i would continue to

542
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,120
what's that

543
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,360
oh sure yeah that's always better than a

544
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,799
stupid kicker at the end of the speech

545
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,000
anyway

546
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,679
all right yeah

547
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,760
all right uh we've got some time for

548
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,400
some q a if anybody like here

549
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,360
hi chris um you mentioned the fsb center

550
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,240
16 activity from 2020. uh i know there's

551
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,000
been some i remember the sisa alert from

552
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,360
that time period

553
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,360
in your kind of retrospective opinion

554
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,360
was that really about

555
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,280
draining resources and creating anxiety

556
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,710
or was it something else

557
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,520
[Music]

558
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,080
uh yes i think that's

559
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,480
an appropriate answer i think you know i

560
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,280
i

561
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,120
i don't know if there's any intelligence

562
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,000
or you know the support that

563
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,039
they were they're actually trying to

564
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,240
harry us

565
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,760
in some rearguard actions here but i

566
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,960
think it was

567
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,000
um

568
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,440
also just the

569
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,960
constant

570
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,280
scanning spray and prey

571
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,480
where they see were there i mean there

572
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,720
were a couple cases where they landed in

573
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,400
infrastructure adjacent or election

574
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,480
infrastructure json stuff but they

575
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,080
didn't know what it was it wasn't

576
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,600
important infrastructure but it

577
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,320
you know that it still is enough to make

578
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,840
you

579
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,440
ask questions and you know when you're

580
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,840
paranoid like i am you see you know

581
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,840
ghosts behind every corner

582
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,440
it it it was not a comfortable time 2020

583
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,120
was for many reasons was not a

584
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,840
comfortable time

585
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,840
the funniest thing about

586
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,799
about the the election security work is

587
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,400
is um

588
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,520
i mean it came out of left field with

589
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,880
the iranians

590
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,880
the whole proud boys email and then the

591
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,080
uh

592
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,919
um

593
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,240
inner sandman video and all that and it

594
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,320
was just

595
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,840
from a tradecraft perspective i'm not

596
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,440
sure if anybody's talking about that but

597
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,240
it was it was like impressive but yet

598
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,000
sloppy and

599
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,240
the video was too fast it was too loud

600
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,520
you couldn't really tell what they were

601
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,480
type

602
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,240
so it was pretty cool but then you're

603
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,480
like you screwed up it was too long too

604
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,880
yes yeah

605
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,960
and what pissed me off the most

606
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,440
was that i did a tweet the next day

607
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,440
that and you may see this in a memo i

608
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,720
think it's always released tomorrow but

609
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,400
it was uh

610
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,360
um

611
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,760
i did i did a tweet you know hashtag sad

612
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,120
but true

613
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,640
no there are bad guys still out there

614
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,080
trying to do bad things and i was like

615
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,159
come on somebody pick up on the

616
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,520
metallica

617
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,919
hashtag come on

618
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,559
yes where are we yeah so on that topic

619
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,200
of burnout you mentioned that

620
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,039
a lot of the ir forking in government

621
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,960
are getting burnt out some of the

622
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,240
comments i've been hearing from other

623
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,679
government focus

624
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,360
the salary isn't matched it's just

625
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,120
easier to go from get the training in

626
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,440
government than leave and not working

627
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,039
government because you get better

628
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,240
benefits

629
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,880
and less stress of the kind of the

630
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,880
mission of the work that that government

631
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,840
does

632
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,520
i guess do you see in the future the

633
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,159
government kind of trying to match the

634
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,640
benefits and pay of corporate salaries

635
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,039
at all and if not what do you think the

636
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,799
strategy will be to retain talent and

637
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,039
not have people work in government learn

638
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,280
the skills and then leave

639
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,799
so first off i don't think it's a bad

640
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,200
thing when there's a revolving door

641
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,880
from a cyber operational perspective

642
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,520
because it it keeps refreshing talent

643
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,600
perspectives

644
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,039
tool sets

645
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,080
um

646
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,120
i

647
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,080
i don't

648
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,760
i would not well all right so they just

649
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,280
announced at least it says to the cyber

650
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,200
talent management system which is gonna

651
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,799
at the at least the higher end really

652
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,000
put you in a position where you can make

653
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,840
you know mid 200s even into the 300s

654
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,320
which is you know that's good money uh

655
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,799
but i i wouldn't undersell the mission

656
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,520
piece and there are some private sector

657
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,080
companies that have a lot of

658
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,559
really interesting telemetry and access

659
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,320
um and then there's the us government

660
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,640
that has really interesting telemetry

661
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,200
and access and i you know i just lost

662
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,360
someone from our consulting group that

663
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,640
wanted to go back into government

664
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,320
because they just missed that public

665
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,840
service mission and i think there are

666
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,919
people that are just drawn to it

667
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,400
it's a lot of fun it's a lot of fun and

668
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,880
and yes the stress can be high i think

669
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,960
what government needs to focus on

670
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,760
and

671
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,760
neil jenkins i'm sure has some opinions

672
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,840
here is cutting out the crap the

673
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,640
bureaucracy it just it's too hard

674
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,159
to work to get into the jobs and it

675
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,559
takes a year to go through the security

676
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,559
clearance process and for a lot of this

677
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,159
work frankly when you think about just

678
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,840
the broader information economy

679
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,919
exploding where the smaller piece of

680
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,440
it's even classified anyway why do you

681
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,240
need top secret sci clearances i mean

682
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,840
there are plenty of people need to be

683
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,799
sitting in you know secret at best with

684
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,080
you know doing open source and

685
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,000
collaboration with private sector

686
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,200
partners you know

687
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,039
whether it's tlp or what

688
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,640
so i i just think we need to make it

689
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,480
easier to come in i think we need you

690
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,880
know the the uh

691
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,520
the uk has some interesting models

692
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,240
with uh their industry 100 where they

693
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,720
can bring folks in so i we just have to

694
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,799
be more innovative and and you know as a

695
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,480
lawyer i'll say this a lot of the you

696
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,679
know lawyers are sometimes the problem

697
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,440
just need to need to make it easier

698
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:44,960
um

699
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,520
so over the last year we've seen 16 law

700
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,039
enforcement actions taken against

701
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,720
ransomware groups which is more than in

702
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,760
the previous three years combined

703
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,000
do you think this kind of sustained law

704
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,520
enforcement action will have a

705
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,679
debilitating effect on ransomware

706
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,400
eventually if we keep it up

707
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,240
i think it'll clear out some of the

708
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,960
chuckleheads

709
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,559
i mean look i so

710
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,440
so you know as i've been thinking about

711
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,600
ransomware like why

712
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,679
why we are where we are i mean we talked

713
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,039
about the permissive environment piece

714
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,039
but you know first off it's it's in the

715
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,120
strategic objectives of of the kremlin

716
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,720
to continue to promote this whether

717
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,720
they're they're you know directing fire

718
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,480
or not it doesn't matter i mean one is

719
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,159
that it develops a strategic cyber

720
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,400
reserve at least you know within russia

721
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,320
they can draw on down the road second

722
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,240
actually brings money into the country i

723
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,320
mean things aren't great right and so if

724
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,400
you can bring money in and if it's truly

725
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,720
billions of dollars like there was a i

726
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,919
can't remember who asked this question

727
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,679
over the weekend but it was somewhere on

728
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,760
twitter um it was like really looking at

729
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,520
the economics of ransomware and that

730
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,400
train that transfer of funds from the

731
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,159
western world into russia what is that

732
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,159
actually what's the impact there

733
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,799
uh because look when you know

734
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,320
when the dude looks across the street

735
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,760
and sees a lamborghini in the parking

736
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,200
lot like or in the driveway that's

737
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,120
that's kind of cool i kind of want that

738
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,960
um but then third and finally like again

739
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,120
it contributes to the broader strategic

740
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,520
objectives of the kremlin to destabilize

741
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,320
the west undermine confidence in uh the

742
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,960
populations of their ability to protect

743
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,159
uh you know the national security

744
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,600
apparatus to protect critical

745
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,760
infrastructure and critical services

746
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,000
um so what do i think longer term i

747
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,159
think it'll it'll get kind of the the

748
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,320
more recent entrants that aren't the

749
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,480
skilled ones it's the ones that are kind

750
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,480
of in the as a service

751
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,559
space that have provided commodity tools

752
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,000
and scripts to run

753
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,880
um

754
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,640
and i think what that leaves you is the

755
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,039
more advanced capable actors that will

756
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,159
evolve their techniques they'll

757
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,520
constantly evolve their techniques so

758
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,559
what does that look like and we were

759
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,159
just talking about in the hall

760
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,320
um you know is it are they going to move

761
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,559
away from encrypting networks and just

762
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,880
data exfiltration and you know that's

763
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,039
the extortion game i don't know look i

764
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:57,760
mean

765
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,080
they will monetize it somehow

766
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,840
um and until the uh i see demetrius here

767
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,080
so until the the kremlin actually does

768
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,919
anything about it

769
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,559
we all know his opinion um you know it's

770
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,640
it it's gonna be hard to change and and

771
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,080
again i don't

772
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,840
i think it is a it's dilutive to the

773
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,760
intelligence community and

774
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,240
dod and law enforcement when they're

775
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,279
focusing on basically just wear out

776
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,320
there

777
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,320
we've got to change those dynamics or

778
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,360
we're going to lose i think the edge
