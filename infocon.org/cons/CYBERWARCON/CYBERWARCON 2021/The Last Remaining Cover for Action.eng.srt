1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,720
last talk so i've only got 150 slides

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,279
and we'll go to drinks in a little bit

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,240
i'm not kidding but yes

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,960
so that was my intent right i submitted

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,160
this talk and i was like this is going

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,880
to be awesome nobody's seen this before

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,759
but

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:16,960
you know

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,480
i'll get to kind of do a little bit of

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,680
attention whoring which is what i like

11
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,039
to do on stage

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,000
uh but no john holdquist had other plans

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,920
for me john holdquist

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,800
was not having this this plan of mine

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,960
he insists that this is about cyber war

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,719
and that we need to talk about you know

17
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,160
this sort of cyber war theme that

18
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,000
there's not enough things you know

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,320
blowing up in the stage and that makes

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,079
all of us uncomfortable

21
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,239
so we're gonna go for a different

22
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,800
uh kind of talk today i'm afraid it's a

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,640
lot more boring than it would have been

24
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,320
but you know that's what john holdquist

25
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,440
wants

26
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,480
um

27
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,480
in all honesty not giving john you know

28
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,719
that hard a time uh it was actually

29
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,559
pretty perfect to put me in the last

30
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,960
slot because there are elements of at

31
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,399
least five different talks that were

32
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,799
mentioned today um that i'm gonna try to

33
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,439
kind of breeze over and and discuss so

34
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,080
it all kind of ties in together nicely

35
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,920
so we're gonna talk about this boring

36
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,880
thing called hacktivism um the reason

37
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,040
we're going to talk about it is

38
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,720
that it's i feel like it's rolling

39
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,240
counter threat until sorry and cyber

40
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,920
throat intelligence has kind of been

41
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,680
misunderstood

42
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,680
there's a lot of ways in which we're

43
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,479
still trying to map normal intelligence

44
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,040
concepts to this new paradigm of cyber

45
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,600
threat intel

46
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,960
we have our deficiencies you know this

47
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,040
is kind of an unexpected transition into

48
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,479
dealing with intelligence stuff when in

49
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,840
reality we're just a bunch of nerds

50
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,840
doing malware analysis

51
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,320
we're still struggling right so

52
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,079
i'm sure in a dc audience something like

53
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,920
cover for status is fairly well known

54
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,960
you know

55
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,240
alex and katie were here and they were

56
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,360
talking about cover for action so

57
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,479
simple heuristic uh cover for status

58
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,560
right an identity someone pretending to

59
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,920
be an affable lovely professor uh who is

60
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,920
interested in these sorts of things

61
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,600
cover for action being more of the

62
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,080
justification for you know why you're

63
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,840
doing what you're doing and how you fit

64
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,599
in more naturally into the space that

65
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,360
you're supposed to be in so why are you

66
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,160
here

67
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,280
um

68
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,840
why should we not think you an odd duck

69
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,280
in this space

70
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,360
so the reason i want to talk about that

71
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,720
is i think hacktivism has kind of become

72
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,280
this attempt to

73
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,720
given give a sense of kind of grass root

74
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,680
um

75
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,680
fervor coming out of the you know the

76
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,920
masses that that just justifies what it

77
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,239
is that we're seeing right so

78
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,920
think about the

79
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,000
the arab spring right it was this

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,920
beautiful romantic notion that the

81
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,080
people had had enough and they rose up

82
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,920
and it was it wasn't a

83
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,720
uh you know a foreign thing but rather

84
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,480
this sort of fervor that spreads through

85
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,160
the masses and decides that it's time to

86
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,319
do something and hacktivism is starting

87
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,400
to become that or has been treated as

88
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,480
that um in a lot of these sort of

89
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,000
operations and a lot of the things that

90
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,640
were discussed today and i'm kind of

91
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,000
hoping that we can treat it a little

92
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,480
differently so going back to the before

93
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,519
time right 2008 um when we were still

94
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,840
enamored with this idea of anonymous and

95
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,080
it was you know still in its crunchy

96
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,560
4channy kind of incarnation and there

97
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,319
might have even still been some hacking

98
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,560
skills involved

99
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,760
this kind of became the gateway uh

100
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,599
the gateway drug for a lot of this sort

101
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,440
of hacktivism as a cover for stuff

102
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,280
obviously that isn't really the case for

103
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,040
anonymous anymore and it's sort of

104
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,319
bastardized a bunch of ways uh but what

105
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,640
remained was the notion of abusing that

106
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,560
cover you know whether it is anonymous

107
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,799
in many cases it's still anonymous in

108
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,599
some way uh but the notion of sort of

109
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,360
having a hacktivism front allows you to

110
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,879
clear some stuff

111
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,920
so

112
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,280
the other thing i really want to avail

113
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,760
myself of is the benefit of hindsight

114
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,799
so

115
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,000
any of you that are familiar with my

116
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,439
research you know that i like looking

117
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,480
backwards and sort of being able to see

118
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,239
you know what we can find out now about

119
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,920
operations from 10 years ago and some

120
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,840
folks think it's pointless but the

121
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,760
benefit of hindsight is fantastic it's

122
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,680
amazing how many things we put together

123
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,599
over the years and you know be good for

124
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,280
us to go and reassess

125
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,120
uh what we figured out then what we know

126
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,720
now so

127
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,079
i'm going to run through a few things a

128
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,839
little quickly

129
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,680
mostly because there are great resources

130
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,120
already and some of the folks that

131
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,960
actually did that work are in this room

132
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,040
whether it's the eyesight mafia that

133
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,960
then became the fire eye mafia which is

134
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,040
now the mandiat mafia um or you know

135
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,960
a bunch of other great folks like the

136
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,720
eset researchers and so on that worked

137
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,160
on these sorts of things so you'll have

138
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,759
folks to discuss them with if you want

139
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,600
and you can always ask questions

140
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,360
uh but let's let's run through kind of a

141
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,360
whirlwind tour of hacktivism being

142
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,560
abused

143
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,560
and what i want to focus on is how we

144
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,400
then became aware

145
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,520
that it wasn't a real activism from that

146
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,639
it was a front that it really wasn't a

147
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,800
hacktivism uh type of activity so 2012

148
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,560
this should set off some alarms already

149
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,039
saudi aramco and rass gas you know in

150
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,520
response to the wonderful stars wiper we

151
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,639
get this sort of conceptual

152
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,720
proliferation of the notion of wiper

153
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,639
sort of in the region

154
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,639
you get these two

155
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,240
industry

156
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,720
giants getting hit with a wiper if you

157
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,600
remember correctly

158
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,919
simmons brought this up at the time they

159
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,520
were claiming that it was you know the

160
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,440
the cutting sword of justice right this

161
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,600
group uh coming out of nowhere to kind

162
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,560
of retaliate for god knows what um and

163
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,039
the thing that immediately busted that

164
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,960
cover for a lot of folks is first and

165
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,639
foremost there was no pedigree right

166
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,160
we'd never seen this group before

167
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,680
they've never existed in forums before

168
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,720
we've never seen them involved with

169
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,240
other hacks before

170
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,600
uh and

171
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,440
the persona was relatively quickly

172
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,440
discarded right it was used for a couple

173
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,880
of other things and just kind of left

174
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,400
there to languish

175
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,639
except maybe to email dave i tell from

176
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,639
time to time

177
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,560
and more importantly there's now in the

178
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,319
benefit of hindsight we've got this code

179
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,319
reuse with other nation state operations

180
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,919
that weren't veiled in the same way

181
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,000
shamoon comes back at some point shaman

182
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,759
2 it connects to stone drill connects to

183
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,160
other iranian operations so yes at the

184
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,080
time we couldn't have possibly known

185
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,520
maybe we could have

186
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,280
but you give it three four more years

187
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,960
and they get sloppier and sloppier than

188
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,479
they were in the past so interesting

189
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,840
there you go

190
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,080
uh 2014 things start getting a little

191
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,080
spicier other folks got the same ideas

192
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,639
right they have the infamous sony

193
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,960
pictures entertainment hack uh if you

194
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,120
remember in the beginning this was all

195
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,039
done under the cover of the guardians of

196
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,639
peace

197
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,000
you know there's been some fantastic

198
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,720
t-shirts made of this graphic

199
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,319
and what was interesting about the

200
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,919
guardians of peace

201
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,919
was that they didn't exist we hadn't

202
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,520
seen them before

203
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,759
you know there's no pedigree once again

204
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,360
the persona was discarded right away

205
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,520
they weren't even used in other hacks

206
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,520
they weren't even used for the exposure

207
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,759
of the data like it was just this flash

208
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,599
in the pan kind of cover

209
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,919
um the qui bono was fairly

210
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,520
straightforward i mean jd might throw

211
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,680
something at me for saying that but

212
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,120
who the hell cares about a stoner comedy

213
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,840
uh except under the circumstances right

214
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,520
um and there was a really inconsistent

215
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,520
objective like in the beginning it was

216
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,840
supposedly a ransom thing then it was

217
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,440
you know attempting to stop this sort of

218
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,120
extortion with the data that they had

219
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,039
then it was you know don't publish the

220
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,800
movie then we're gonna bomb the movie

221
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,080
theaters you know you could just see the

222
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,840
whole thing kind of unraveling as a very

223
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,039
poorly thought out operation

224
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,960
more importantly and jaime velasco is

225
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,800
not here

226
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,479
we did a lot of research at the time to

227
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,919
say well where the hell did this group

228
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,960
come from and this is the thread that

229
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,639
starts to connect

230
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,879
what we then came to know as the lazarus

231
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,960
group at the time we didn't have that in

232
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,479
our vocabulary we just had a ton of

233
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,240
disparate operations whether it's dark

234
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,240
soul or you know dust over and all these

235
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,440
different things and it turns out that

236
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,520
there was a shared code base of

237
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,680
operations going back to 2008 all of

238
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,440
which were related to north korea go

239
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,199
figure

240
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,800
so that

241
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,240
then you get cyber coup and this is the

242
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,599
beginning kind of the russia section in

243
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,199
a lot of ways and a lot of you i expect

244
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,479
are fairly familiar with what happened

245
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,160
here in like the summer of election

246
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,720
hacks and so on um but it's worth

247
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,400
mentioning because i think the russians

248
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,479
kind of tend to do this a bit better you

249
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,878
have a

250
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,120
you have a proper practice of active

251
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,120
measures as you may have read

252
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,800
and a lot of experience

253
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,080
as to how to conduct these sorts of

254
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,560
operations and it shows uh in that they

255
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,680
know how to develop them a little

256
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,879
further how to carry them a little

257
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:31,840
further how to be a little more

258
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,159
consistent right so cyber burkett came

259
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,719
along tons of hacks uh in the ukraine it

260
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,399
was supposed to be sort of the cyber

261
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,039
component of this police force that had

262
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,679
been disbanded

263
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,040
kind of interesting

264
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,680
a lot of the stuff was very

265
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,760
niche focused on ukraine and i think in

266
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,959
the beginning it kind of flew under the

267
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,360
radar in a lot of ways false pedigree

268
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,040
not really related to burkut um

269
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,720
there was overlap with nation state

270
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,399
operations we start to see this is going

271
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,000
to be a theme in a lot of sort of the

272
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,680
russian related hacktivism right you've

273
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,279
got this great hacktivism front but it

274
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,560
doesn't count on the fact that

275
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,720
researchers are actual and incident

276
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,240
responders are getting involved with the

277
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,560
actual hacks where the data comes from

278
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,240
so even though you've got this great

279
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,880
cohesively put together hacktivism front

280
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,240
we're sitting there like we just saw

281
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,080
sofa see roll through here like you want

282
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,600
to tell us that it's someone else it's

283
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,920
kind of hard right um

284
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,279
so of course you know that got

285
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,519
publicized and you can read a a

286
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,720
relatively

287
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,959
wonderful paper by brian bartholomew and

288
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,399
i uh on all the stuff right the next one

289
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,839
saudi and saudi league so you can see

290
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,839
why i really was very invested in

291
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,399
simmons talk apart from being great um

292
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,360
it's just that you know you had yca or

293
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,200
the yemeni cyber army as yet another one

294
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,440
of these fronts that at the time

295
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,880
we have a lot of reasons to suspect

296
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,959
we're the russians

297
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,120
i much prefer simmons treatment in the

298
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,240
sense that

299
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,600
you have a much more nuanced way of

300
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,120
looking at this just because you stole

301
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,320
the data doesn't mean that you're the

302
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,000
one doing the amplification and taking

303
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,399
advantage of what it is but

304
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,160
at the time at least for a lot of us we

305
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,320
believe that yca

306
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,800
was again fake front no pedigree was

307
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,480
discarded overlapped with other nation

308
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,760
state operations for how they sourced

309
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,600
some of the data as was mentioned in the

310
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,360
last talk you know

311
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,120
they were in certain

312
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,720
saudi institutions

313
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,480
uh predating this and i'll leave it at

314
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,600
that

315
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,399
so

316
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,880
then you have tv sangmond and you know

317
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,519
john holdquist around here might uh

318
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,920
throw something at me but

319
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,360
you know they had this devastating

320
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,480
attack in in this news channel in france

321
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,839
um

322
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,279
again overlap with nation state

323
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,120
operations you see sofisi toolkit in

324
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,360
there whether it's uh i believe from the

325
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,120
eyesight the researchers at the time or

326
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,120
even ansi that responded to this and you

327
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,640
know was kind enough to provide us with

328
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,399
some indicators

329
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,200
and this is all done under the guise of

330
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,680
the cyber caliphate

331
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,279
the cyber caliphate this being sort of

332
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,839
this russian hacktivism

333
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,880
operation or this russian front uh they

334
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,360
didn't think of it as being burned

335
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,279
with tv sank bond which is interesting

336
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,560
because then they went on to do other

337
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,720
things like

338
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,680
hacking the us centcom twitter account

339
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,200
you know i love isis and whatever

340
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,480
nonsense defacements using this wboc

341
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,680
maryland

342
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,160
texting system to spread some some fun

343
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,279
to

344
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,279
folks in the maryland area

345
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,000
about you know how isis was coming

346
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,079
but interestingly enough you know we if

347
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,640
you already know that tv snack monday's

348
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,200
done by the russians and it's claimed by

349
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,360
cyber caliphate then everything else

350
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,880
claimed by cyber caliphate to that

351
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,680
extent um kind of fits in that mold

352
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,480
whether you like it or not right so

353
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,440
2016. uh guccifer 2.0 this was kind of

354
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,519
the most ridiculous one right

355
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,600
as much as we might appreciate them you

356
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,079
know taking a stab at crowdstrike

357
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,079
beyond that being funny for about 30

358
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,279
seconds

359
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,600
it actually began this sort of

360
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,959
ridiculous thing of um

361
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,800
blatant denial of things that we were

362
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
all fairly familiar with as far as ops

363
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,279
go again false pedigree if any of you

364
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,279
know who guccifer was in the beginning

365
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,120
it's this romanian taxi driver who at

366
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,360
the time was in prison and he

367
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,279
had dumped some you know

368
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,279
clinton emails in the past and it was

369
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,440
just sort of this ridiculous figure but

370
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,800
it's obvious that it has nothing to do

371
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,279
with him you're trying to borrow the

372
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,440
pedigree of a different

373
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,320
hacker that's relatively well known

374
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,000
and then you start making these like

375
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,079
inconsistent claims right like lorenzo

376
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,839
was in the crowd he had the chance to

377
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,600
talk this guy realize he doesn't speak

378
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,519
romanian

379
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,959
you know he's sort of google translating

380
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,360
the romanian as well as we are

381
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,600
um and you have overlapped with nation

382
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,240
state ops uh for a variety of reasons i

383
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,560
think at the time also uh upon all the

384
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,240
things matt tate did some great work

385
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,519
sort of looking at some of the original

386
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,440
stuff that had been released and how it

387
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,800
had some sort of inconsistent metadata

388
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,560
so we'll leave it up in the russia stack

389
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,959
as well obviously dc leaks podesta

390
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,399
emails you're talking about the same

391
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,480
hack that we all know came from sofa c

392
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,000
toolkit it's being released under other

393
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,880
domains so no pedigree overlap with

394
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,880
nation state ops russia

395
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,519
um this one was particularly fun we had

396
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,839
just seen sofa c roll through wada and

397
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,720
task cass and then all of a sudden this

398
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,440
uh

399
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,800
you know we get this bizarre thing with

400
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
anonymous poland and i like this picture

401
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,560
in particular because i guess i was

402
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,000
enough of a loudmouth on twitter where

403
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,600
they were tweeting out to me as if i

404
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,760
would care um about the fact that they

405
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,000
were releasing documents from wada they

406
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,279
did this to other journalists and

407
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,880
researchers as well

408
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,040
which is the beginning of the real theme

409
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,880
of this talk which is the notion of

410
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,600
amplification and what role we end up

411
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,440
playing in secondary and tertiary

412
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,000
effects for these things

413
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
so straightforward krimono i mean who

414
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,120
the hell cared about the doping in the

415
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,279
olympics to this extent well the only

416
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,800
folks that have been kept out because of

417
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,800
systematic doping

418
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,320
overlap with nation state ops we

419
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,920
literally saw them rolling through those

420
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,320
networks like weeks before

421
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,880
um put it in the russia bin and this is

422
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,880
kind of where you lose me right like at

423
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,639
this point they're just trolling us

424
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,880
right so at some point they just pick up

425
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,800
the fancy bear's name and like you know

426
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,320
they roll with fancy bears hack team

427
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,399
twitter and website and it's like we're

428
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,560
not even going to pretend anymore um i

429
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,399
suppose it you know falls into this sort

430
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,160
of trolling that has become part of our

431
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,320
political milieu now but at the time it

432
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,199
was

433
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,519
it was kind of a facepalm moment and you

434
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,880
know that was it

435
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,920
so

436
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,839
after seeing all that for years and

437
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,639
years and years um i did get to a point

438
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,000
where it's like

439
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,800
is there even real hacktivism anymore is

440
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,760
that a thing that even exists

441
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,199
and i think that's just sort of being a

442
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,959
little too jaded or maybe the real

443
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,560
effect of being dunked in a tank of

444
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,920
active measures that you start to think

445
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,839
that nothing is real

446
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,839
so i wanted to kind of say like what

447
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,079
might examples modern examples of that

448
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,240
look like for us so i think the hacking

449
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,120
team might be a really good example um i

450
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,000
don't want to be or sound naive about

451
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,600
any of these all of them i have

452
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,120
reservations about but if we're going to

453
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,480
approximate something that might look

454
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,880
like real hacktivism

455
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,240
if any of you missed this it was a

456
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,800
fantastic popcorn moment um

457
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,720
and it was done by this wonderful figure

458
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,519
phineas fisher um i i wish i'd had the

459
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,120
foresight bruno was kind enough to get

460
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,440
me my own version of the sock puppet but

461
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,720
i didn't bring it

462
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,000
the whole sock puppet thing if you

463
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,079
didn't see there was an episode of vices

464
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,320
cyber war where phineas fisher insisted

465
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,560
that they would be interviewed that they

466
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,079
would give answers but they had to be

467
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,720
represented by a sock puppet so that is

468
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,399
what phineas fischer looks like in the

469
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,120
collective consciousness um

470
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,839
so what was interesting about this is

471
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,680
that it's not the only hack right you've

472
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,160
got first the gamma groups and fisher

473
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,920
hack where he you know they get their

474
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,079
name then comes the hacking team one

475
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,320
then there's like the uh guardian

476
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,160
nacional like uh

477
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,320
the police in barcelona and there's a

478
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,920
bunch of other sort of interesting hacks

479
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,279
that are related to

480
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,440
phineas fisher in one way or another

481
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,920
so let's do the same kind of analysis to

482
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,600
me the reason i would say this is it

483
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,519
looks a lot more like hacktivism is

484
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,560
frankly the qui bono is complex like who

485
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,040
actually benefits from the hacking team

486
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,680
dump uh is questionable right you have

487
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,040
just about

488
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,440
30 40 governments that are rolled up in

489
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,600
that people's emails are in that you've

490
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,440
got competitors like one of the reasons

491
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,720
we became aware of the existence of

492
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,639
candiru for example was the mention in

493
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,000
one of those emails about the

494
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,560
competition who the hell are these guys

495
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,480
um there's a lot that happens in there

496
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,800
that isn't really straightforward as to

497
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,480
why you would drop this unredacted

498
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,720
nuclear bomb on the industry

499
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,800
um it's a really irresponsible dump in a

500
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,000
lot of ways

501
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,600
not only did you have all the source

502
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,959
code put out there and all these things

503
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,720
that folks could reuse

504
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,519
but there are literal live odays in

505
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,480
there uh that several groups including

506
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,759
some of the chinese apts uh sofa sea and

507
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,880
dark hotel as well were used within days

508
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,639
so you know it's not like it wasn't

509
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,439
without some fallout

510
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,039
and there's a consistent motif for all

511
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,480
these things i mean as much as we might

512
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,640
want to be skeptical of it

513
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,559
if there is such a thing as an

514
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,400
anarcho-marxist

515
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,119
hacker out there that really commits to

516
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,720
this idea of like sticking it to

517
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,640
capitalist institutions and using cyber

518
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,880
as a great equalizer well that seems to

519
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,439
be what phineas fischer is consistently

520
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,959
leaning into

521
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,559
the other example that i would point to

522
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,640
is the panama papers and now the pandora

523
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,720
papers this sort of saga that continues

524
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,840
about the release of

525
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,080
a glimpse into how folks hide their

526
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,039
money and avoid paying taxes and how bad

527
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,280
all that is

528
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,559
what folks

529
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,799
miss about this story myself included at

530
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,400
first is that there's supposedly a

531
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,039
hacker behind all this called john doe

532
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,320
and there's you know some short

533
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,320
manifesto about it but we really don't

534
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,400
know anything about who john doe might

535
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,280
be

536
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,480
um

537
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,039
so hacktivism or non-hacktivism some

538
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,600
folks are really uh passionate about the

539
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,720
idea that it isn't that it's a

540
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,720
nation-state thing uh but if we do the

541
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,799
same kind of idea there is a certain

542
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,880
amount of suspicious coordination right

543
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,000
like going to the icij and having every

544
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,919
journalist from every country take their

545
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,000
piece and responsibly write something

546
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,919
over a year and releasing this in a very

547
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,679
coordinated fashion

548
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,039
is suspicious

549
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,960
it's interesting i if any of us

550
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,400
conducted this operation and got this

551
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,160
material i think we'd be at a loss for

552
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,320
how to do that kind of dissemination

553
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,480
quite so perfectly

554
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,960
there is a complex quivono i mean

555
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,919
sure

556
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,760
you could say that you stuck it to the

557
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,600
russians or you stuck it to the saudis

558
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,600
but in the process you rolled up david

559
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,520
cameron and the you know prime minister

560
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,039
of iceland and a bunch of other folks

561
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,640
that presumably you wouldn't have an

562
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,120
issue with so you know how do you weigh

563
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,520
the fallout of something like this

564
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,919
and then there's angry putin and angry

565
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,480
putin is you know the one who is most

566
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,880
fervently saying oh this is clearly the

567
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,960
cia trying to mess with me which is

568
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,240
interesting because he's not mentioned

569
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,440
in there so i don't know whose money

570
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,679
he's really concerned about

571
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,840
so what have we learned

572
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,440
i think after all this time we really

573
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,559
learned nothing um

574
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,559
because after years and tons of

575
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,039
operations we're still thinking about

576
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,120
this the same way somebody comes out and

577
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,799
says we're hacked to this and we're like

578
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,280
yes you are what have you got for us

579
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,400
um

580
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,400
so i was kind of hoping that you know we

581
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,000
could at least take a minute to assess

582
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,520
and say what could we have learned from

583
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,120
all these things right

584
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,400
so i think there's a series of metrics

585
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,200
or coordinates that keep popping up in

586
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,679
our assessments of these previous uh

587
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,160
abuses of hacktivism right there's the

588
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,760
notion of does this group have a

589
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,160
pedigree is there a continuity to their

590
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,240
operations uh is there a coordination

591
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,679
about their releases or are they doing

592
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,440
them willy-nilly uh is there a

593
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,679
consistency to those operations

594
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,600
how is the material being sourced is it

595
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,520
a nation state op that collects the

596
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,360
material and then releases it through a

597
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,120
hacktivism front or are they doing it

598
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,039
themselves you know who benefits from

599
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,880
these things and more importantly

600
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,640
secondary effects and targeting i think

601
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,919
that's something we haven't talked about

602
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,840
as much but is actually really really

603
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,960
important

604
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,240
how's my time anybody

605
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,159
13 minutes oh perfect that's almost too

606
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,080
much um

607
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,000
so take-home exercises and some of these

608
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,280
are going to be familiar if you all want

609
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,919
to play at home uh well you know

610
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,240
intrusion truth right we saw it today

611
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,640
interesting uh little shop are they

612
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,679
clearing

613
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,240
classified data for doj indictments are

614
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,320
they just sick of watching the chinese

615
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,480
do whatever they want who knows

616
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,360
um

617
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,760
you also have lab ducta gun

618
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,120
really interesting right somebody

619
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,559
suddenly comes out and starts dropping

620
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,480
iranian tools and source code and all

621
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,600
this stuff

622
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,880
what the hell

623
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,559
and then green leakers which i think

624
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,840
we've kind of forgotten about maybe

625
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,919
they're not as active anymore but uh

626
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,600
this is sort of relevant to us right

627
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,919
this is where folks are leaking things

628
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,840
that i think we're meant to pay

629
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,679
attention to we are meant to sift

630
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,240
through figure out you know why like

631
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,000
where these tools came from and how they

632
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,880
were being used and to kind of um give

633
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,960
it substance the same way that

634
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,880
journalists give substance to you know

635
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,559
email troves that were dropped from the

636
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,320
bradley foundation for wherever else

637
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,080
like nobody in the public is going to go

638
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,760
read through 20 gigs of emails but some

639
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,919
art investigative journalists might make

640
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,360
hay out of it

641
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,000
these operations are in some ways meant

642
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,360
for us i think intrusion truth and

643
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,880
reality is in a lot of ways meant for

644
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,640
the doj

645
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,520
but

646
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,158
interesting right

647
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,559
so what's why is this relevant today why

648
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:37,919
are we still having this conversation

649
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,039
right all these examples that i

650
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,120
mentioned for the most part 2012 2014

651
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,000
2016 we're pretty far ahead the reason i

652
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,120
said we haven't learned anything is we

653
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,799
have some ongoing examples right now and

654
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,039
i'd love to do the same kind of analysis

655
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,640
about some of them and in some cases you

656
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,159
know maybe i'll be naive and others

657
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,159
maybe i'm paranoid but you know we can

658
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,080
talk about it over drinks

659
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,600
in a little bit

660
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,760
and a little bit um

661
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,000
so the first one is the bill of russian

662
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,280
cyber partisans i don't know how

663
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,600
familiar some of you are uh with this

664
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
group they are actually quite charming

665
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,159
in their kind of pluck and seal and

666
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,720
attempt to deal with such a

667
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,559
horrendous regime

668
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,720
um so what makes these guys interesting

669
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,400
well i mean the quimono is kind of clear

670
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,760
they're sort of part of a larger

671
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,039
operation

672
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,600
that's trying to

673
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,200
sort of cease back

674
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,760
uh belarus from this horrible regime and

675
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,520
try to they're they're trying all sorts

676
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,120
of different things right you know one

677
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,200
day you're trying to drop data to see if

678
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,240
that's what journalists are going to

679
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,679
pick up and the next one you're talking

680
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,600
about well what if we encrypt all the

681
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,520
machines with ransomware until the you

682
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,600
know the government's out and they're

683
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,080
trying uh desperately to kind of figure

684
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,720
out what's going to have an impact uh i

685
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,919
think they also have understandable

686
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,600
capabilities like they're talking about

687
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,840
how like oh you know it's a group of i.t

688
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,600
administrators and other folks in the in

689
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,760
the industry who are unhappy with what's

690
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,039
going on and they're trying their

691
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,520
darndest to get to some of these targets

692
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,360
even though they can't reach all of them

693
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,720
they don't necessarily know how to

694
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,960
amplify all the stuff that they get

695
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,000
um

696
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,919
the targeting is actually really

697
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,840
important here

698
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,960
they don't necessarily know what to hit

699
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,240
and i think that's something that we

700
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,480
really need to remember here because we

701
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,799
forget it every time we're talking about

702
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,080
hacktivists

703
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,799
if this if folks in one of these tables

704
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,159
decided that tomorrow they're going to

705
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,840
start a hacktivism collective and maybe

706
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,320
they're super elite hackers that doesn't

707
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,679
imbue you

708
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:30,960
with the

709
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,960
knowledge of how a government is

710
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,320
structured where its stuff is kept what

711
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,880
actually matters to that government what

712
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,480
is going to have an actual crippling

713
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,600
effect where um some of the real

714
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,720
material uh conditions and mechanisms of

715
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,600
that government lie you might stumble a

716
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,080
bit you'll do some stupid defacements or

717
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,919
get at some stupid databases or make

718
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,000
some mistakes here and there as you like

719
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,159
figure out what your stride is gonna be

720
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,520
and with some of these groups we never

721
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,200
see that right they just show up and out

722
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,720
the box they know exactly what they're

723
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,240
supposed to be doing and i find that to

724
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,320
be some of the most suspicious stuff so

725
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,840
on the part of the belarusian cyber

726
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,520
partisans what's really interesting is

727
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,039
that they admit that they didn't know

728
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,120
what to hit so what did they do well

729
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,520
they partnered with bipol which is this

730
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,000
group of like security officers who have

731
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,600
left the government and you know sort of

732
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,760
conscientiously you know are against the

733
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,000
regime and they tell them what to hit

734
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,360
right if you just left the place you can

735
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,039
go uh there's a database there you might

736
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,039
want to look at um

737
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,279
it at least gives us a cohesive story of

738
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,360
how this stuff is happening

739
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,880
and i think it's important to say that

740
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,520
they're a small part of a larger effort

741
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,000
right they are the hacktivism arm

742
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,880
of

743
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,640
several groups including the kind of

744
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,840
students who

745
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,760
have the balls of steel to go throw

746
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,279
rocks on the street and fight with the

747
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,120
police and still you know try to mount

748
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,039
some kind of offensive and that's how

749
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,960
you see an actual

750
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,520
grassroots movement that's fumbling and

751
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,640
trying and failing and trying and

752
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,799
failing and trying to figure out what's

753
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,440
going to work that's more organic so

754
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,520
again maybe i'm being naive

755
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,480
i'll take that but in this case um

756
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,760
there's another thing that really hits

757
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,279
me which is they were kind enough to

758
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,520
provide us with samples like they they

759
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,760
keep getting sent really shitty malware

760
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,440
uh trying to collect all their telegram

761
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,840
stuff and whatever um maybe we should

762
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,200
talk about ghost rider and see if

763
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,960
there's anything shared there it's

764
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,600
really not good um but

765
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,039
you know for me

766
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,880
you know they get sort of a facebook

767
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,200
like of approval

768
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,720
but we'll see

769
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,400
um how about a better one and this is

770
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,760
one that i've been obsessing over

771
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,600
recently

772
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,360
so if anybody was paying attention to

773
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,159
iran not just what the iranians do to

774
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,840
the rest of the world but actually

775
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,760
what's happening in iran

776
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,799
um you might have noticed uh in july

777
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,400
9th

778
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,440
there was a hack of the iranian railway

779
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,520
system and it was actually kind of

780
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,400
hilarious

781
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,760
because

782
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,120
somebody wiped the machines at this

783
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,679
at the iranian railway system and put up

784
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,159
a bunch of screens that just said uh

785
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,840
trains delayed due to cyber attack call

786
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,679
64411 which is the office of the supreme

787
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,039
leader

788
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,440
which is pretty funny uh and you know we

789
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,000
all kind of laughed about it for a bit

790
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,279
uh and i was kind of hoping that we

791
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,799
would kind of stop laughing about it and

792
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,120
take a look at what had just happened

793
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,600
because if somebody had pulled this [ __ ]

794
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,360
in chicago we would have lost our

795
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,840
goddamn minds so just keep in mind that

796
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,520
like it's easy to throw rocks at like

797
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,840
north korea and iran but as far as

798
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,000
precedent goes there's a lot more there

799
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,960
that we should probably discuss so

800
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,919
when digging and um with some guidance

801
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,520
from pardas which is kind of their local

802
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,799
security vendor

803
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,279
for lack of a better one

804
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,799
we're able to kind of rebuild a lot of

805
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,559
this toolkit it is a pretty interesting

806
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,360
toolkit we call the meteor express based

807
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,720
on some strings there and what they were

808
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,760
doing

809
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,279
and you can find the blog post online if

810
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,559
you want to take a look at this full

811
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,240
hashes and all this stuff really

812
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,039
interesting toolkit

813
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,279
the way that i would describe it is like

814
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,400
a really smart toy that was given to a

815
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,000
very dumb child

816
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,799
like the operators clearly don't know

817
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,799
like what the functionality is and like

818
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,240
they're throwing things in ways that

819
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,080
like are packaged in ways that you know

820
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,360
i don't think somebody was experienced

821
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,880
would know how to use it and like it's

822
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,559
externally configurable but then they

823
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,559
don't remove the debug strings so you

824
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,320
can see every it's just

825
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,600
okay you can read the blog post don't

826
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,200
worry about it so

827
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,960
okay well that's interesting right this

828
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,480
looks like a nation stayed up maybe not

829
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,840
the best nation state but somebody's

830
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,120
kind of involved somebody's making a

831
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,880
message um

832
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,520
what jd work notices and actually a

833
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,360
great piece about

834
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,039
sort of what it takes to be more of a

835
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,039
measured actor you might want to check

836
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,600
out is that there's this group called

837
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,440
kojanjika dharan

838
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,880
sorry

839
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,840
predatory sparrow that claims credit for

840
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,919
this attack

841
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,760
okay

842
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,840
the persona appears to be discarded

843
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,000
immediately it didn't have any pedigree

844
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,080
as we're used to at this point but it

845
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,279
turns out that there were previous

846
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,120
attacks when you roll back from the

847
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,080
toolkit that we found in meteor express

848
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,200
um

849
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,159
ty cohen figures out that oh scott sorry

850
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,279
um

851
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,080
that

852
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,600
there's a previous toolkit previous

853
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,640
versions uh called stardust and comet

854
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,880
that have a string that refers to indra

855
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,799
indra the god of war indra the god of

856
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,120
war who has a facebook page

857
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,120
and in that facebook page they were

858
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,720
actually taking credit for a series of

859
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,320
attacks in syria that none of us in the

860
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,679
west seem to have noticed um so

861
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,760
another group with no pedigree with

862
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,679
pinpoint targeting

863
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,000
i mean these guys the the whole point of

864
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,320
the attacks in syria were like this is a

865
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,919
company that launders money for the irgc

866
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,080
and this is an airline that flies

867
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,799
soleimani and other people from the irbc

868
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,080
and it's like how the hell do you know

869
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,000
this like where did the sudden leg

870
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,240
how did you know precisely what to hit

871
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,120
they get hit with a similar

872
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,080
functionality wiper uh it code base is

873
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,240
almost exactly the same

874
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,679
but

875
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,320
that persona gets discarded if you look

876
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,799
at the facebook profile indra claims all

877
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,159
these attacks all this stuff is going on

878
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,520
and then november comes around and they

879
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,399
stop like the whole thing just goes dark

880
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,159
around the same time they modify the

881
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,720
toolkit to go from stardust to meteor

882
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,159
remove all the references to it and then

883
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,440
all of a sudden it's predatory sparrow

884
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,039
then we get this which if any of you

885
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,640
recognize that video the evan prison

886
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,919
hack um

887
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,520
i mean i was fascinated by this

888
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,440
evan prison is one of the darkest places

889
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,039
on earth i don't have a problem with

890
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,200
people hacking into it and

891
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,600
showing how awful it is

892
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,520
but if i'm if you're going to let me

893
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,279
watch what the cyber attack looks like

894
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,440
unfolding on the machines i'm at least

895
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,039
going to note that like this looks an

896
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,559
awful lot like the malware we're just

897
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,840
dealing with which is externally

898
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,520
configurable you just change the picture

899
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,120
on the screens i'm not going to claim

900
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,559
it's the same because i don't know i

901
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,000
didn't do the ir i don't have any

902
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,120
samples i have no idea um but we're like

903
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,600
okay so indra right like what how many

904
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,080
groups are out there attacking uh iran

905
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,720
with wipers at any given moment uh no

906
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,679
not indra predatory sparrow no

907
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:16,640
um

908
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,080
ali whole new group awesome so

909
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,000
you know you look at it no pedigree

910
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,679
immediately discard it we never see them

911
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,200
again they never they just tweet out a

912
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,000
couple of things and they're gone so

913
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,520
this is where

914
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,960
you know i'm running out of time there's

915
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,399
too many slides

916
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,720
um and hocus doesn't like it so we're

917
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,760
not done not yet but we're almost done

918
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,679
so then there's this if anybody was

919
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,600
paying attention two weeks ago

920
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,679
um the

921
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,440
subsidized

922
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:51,120
gas uh system in iran was taken down

923
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,200
just to kind of explain the context i

924
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,279
had to figure this out thanks to mostly

925
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,600
hameed kashvi who's helped me a lot

926
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,880
understands the country a lot better

927
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,039
than i do

928
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,559
basically no one in iran can actually

929
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,559
afford gas at normal gas prices so

930
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,080
there's this little card system and you

931
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,840
go and they give you subsidized gas and

932
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,200
the government keeps track of all of it

933
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,440
and that's how most people in iran buy

934
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,640
gas so that system was taken down

935
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,799
country-wide and when you look at the

936
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,960
little pos system it said cyber attack

937
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,480
call six four four one one cute um

938
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,120
and uh actually having with hamid we've

939
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,159
been able to kind of at least

940
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,720
reconstruct what that system looks like

941
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,320
i can tell you it's basically swiss

942
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,679
cheese like we haven't published

943
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,919
anything on this yet but it

944
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,320
it's a garbage stack of just

945
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,760
the worst possible system you could

946
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,440
imagine to manage something for a whole

947
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,480
country

948
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,080
it doesn't mean that the attack is any

949
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,840
less pointed but you know it's not like

950
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,960
we have to deal with the most

951
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,600
sophisticated attacker ever um we'll get

952
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,559
into this later so adelaide ali

953
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:51,600
no

954
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,399
predatory sparrow you know gojunki duran

955
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,880
um and we're like okay fine familiar

956
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,200
face we're back to these guys but wait

957
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,799
it's not even the same gojek duran from

958
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,799
the first attack they didn't keep the

959
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,200
account they lost access to it i don't

960
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,240
know what the hell happened but it's

961
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,840
misspelled differently

962
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,760
credit to jd work for noticing that in

963
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,080
the first place so

964
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,360
let's talk about the fact that you can't

965
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,360
even keep a single account rolling for

966
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,480
the whole thing

967
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,960
um so

968
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,120
why why does this matter to this

969
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,039
audience beyond the fact that we're you

970
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,640
know kind of analyzing these things all

971
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,039
the time well you can have this sort of

972
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,480
simple attribution right if you ask the

973
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,159
iranians you know oh the big devil the

974
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,600
americans and the little devil were

975
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,039
involved in all this and everything's

976
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,240
their fault

977
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,679
and that's not really what matters here

978
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,919
the attribution isn't actually the issue

979
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:40,840
that we're

980
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,399
discussing cyber attacks are discreet by

981
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,559
default when for the most part when you

982
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,279
design an attack um it doesn't present

983
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,360
itself to your victim the way that like

984
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,919
i don't know blowing up a hotel does

985
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,360
right so

986
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,000
when you make a cyber attack overt

987
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,679
that's the only time that i think we can

988
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,440
have a legitimate argument about

989
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,200
signaling the fact that the attack

990
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,080
itself isn't necessarily the end goal

991
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,840
but rather secondary and possibly

992
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,640
tertiary effects so we have to ask

993
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,760
ourselves you know what's the signal

994
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,200
what are you trying you know maybe

995
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,559
you're destabilizing the government

996
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,960
you're making the regime look uh weak

997
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,679
you're trying to upset people sure um

998
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,519
what's the intent of the attackers the

999
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,919
intent is different right it's it's one

1000
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,399
thing to upset folks uh because they

1001
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,640
can't get gas it's different to say well

1002
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,080
to what end

1003
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,039
do we want these people to be upset

1004
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,880
um and to what extent are we the

1005
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,279
audience and that's not sort of getting

1006
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,360
all self-centered and like oh security

1007
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,799
researchers and journalists are the

1008
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,960
end-all be-all but when you look at

1009
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,120
their posts they're tagging some of our

1010
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,640
best and brightest you know you see

1011
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,840
kinzetter and lorenzo and chris they

1012
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,760
want them to pay attention they're

1013
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,440
translating their own messages and

1014
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,880
they're actually misleading us with how

1015
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,399
they did the hack because that ingenico

1016
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,440
breach is not not how they did it

1017
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,200
so i think we have to have a different

1018
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,120
conversation

1019
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,519
that we're at least partially the

1020
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,519
audience and we're at least partially

1021
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,440
the mechanism of amplification for these

1022
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,520
things

1023
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,960
which means that we're the vessel for

1024
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,599
secondary effects

1025
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,199
and i know that

1026
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,879
that makes people uncomfortable we

1027
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,800
usually have a hard time as an industry

1028
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,520
accepting that we have some active

1029
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,399
ethical role in what's happening um in

1030
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,639
this industry and in this sort of cyber

1031
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,800
war space pulquist

1032
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,960
um but we're gonna have to have some

1033
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,520
tough conversations about this so

1034
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,239
on that note i think

1035
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,480
that's it thank you guys

1036
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,639
thank you for the talk jax um

1037
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,879
i'm surprised you left out ddos secrets

1038
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,079
one of the most

1039
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,320
successful hacktivist groups like right

1040
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,719
now especially in this country but um my

1041
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,480
question is actually simple uh what's

1042
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,639
your take on donk and b

1043
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,520
on

1044
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,079
don't talk nb

1045
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:58,960
um

1046
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,000
i mean it i think it's right by this

1047
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,480
generation standards it's cool to be gay

1048
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,240
and do crimes and

1049
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,720
it's a good time to like you know have a

1050
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,400
certain amount of resistance

1051
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,280
um

1052
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,200
i don't know i don't judge it i think

1053
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,960
there's a lot of complex conversations

1054
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,520
to be had about those drops about the

1055
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,880
epic hack which you might want to

1056
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,839
discuss

1057
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,000
with silas who knows it better than i do

1058
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,280
um

1059
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,359
i don't know how to morally

1060
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,119
gauge these ops

1061
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,680
right like the hacking team hack was six

1062
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,280
years ago and lorenzo and i have

1063
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,520
discussed it nonstop for months

1064
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,359
and to this day

1065
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,960
i don't know where the moral equities

1066
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,520
process puts me on it right there's a

1067
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,680
indefinite amount of fallout it's

1068
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,359
incredibly unpredictable uh hacks that i

1069
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,040
think the hardest part is seeing a full

1070
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,960
dump out there right you really don't

1071
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,160
know who you're putting out there for

1072
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,520
whatever right like

1073
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,359
some of these things are easy for us to

1074
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,280
stomach but then you look at like in

1075
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,880
israel right now like

1076
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,200
you can dump a database of like

1077
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,760
lgbtq folks in a dating app

1078
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,960
and it's not as cute right those moments

1079
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,200
are like i understand that these are uh

1080
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,880
sort of nation states playing tit for

1081
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,040
tat but

1082
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,680
it's not a database dump as a database

1083
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,280
as a database dump there's obviously a

1084
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,880
lot more going on there

1085
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,480
i don't judge it i think the lulls are

1086
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,040
great uh i'm all for folks messing with

1087
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,880
you know the alt-right

1088
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,119
but if i take a step back like the whole

1089
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,320
iranian thing right it it's funny to see

1090
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,000
somebody take down the trains but i have

1091
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,680
to remind myself that if somebody

1092
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,880
carried out an attack like that

1093
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,640
somewhere western with white people we'd

1094
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,119
be pretty pissed so

1095
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,040
yeah

1096
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,359
what

1097
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,119
i don't know i have an entertaining

1098
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,640
twitter account

1099
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,560
like it's as much as i can say and i

1100
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,440
think that's part of sort of the

1101
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,200
take-home test right i definitely don't

1102
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,880
have eyes everywhere i

1103
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,280
barely have eyes anywhere so

1104
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,640
to some extent i'm just hoping that

1105
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,240
we'll be a little more circumspect about

1106
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,839
this because what happened with meteor

1107
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,240
express is we found the attack

1108
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,680
and other folks came rushed to say oh

1109
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,440
look activist group and there's their

1110
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,119
facebook page and we figured it out it's

1111
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,599
like no we didn't this is way more

1112
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:14,960
complicated than what we're talking

1113
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,839
about

1114
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,680
um and we kind of have to like close one

1115
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,200
eye and squint the other to believe that

1116
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,480
it's real

1117
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,760
okay time for one more

1118
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,800
hey jags so uh just comments uh and

1119
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,480
questions so

1120
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,680
what you're kind of talking about is

1121
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,359
like content moderation for like

1122
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,040
hacktivists like is this a government

1123
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,400
behind it or is it like actually

1124
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,520
hacktivist

1125
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,200
the only organization that i'm aware of

1126
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,640
that actually like

1127
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,880
cleans through like leaked data to make

1128
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,400
sure it's not government tied is like

1129
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,640
ddos secrets but they don't really talk

1130
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,359
about like how they discern whether

1131
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,599
something is an apt or government or

1132
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,760
like actual hacktivist do you have any

1133
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,200
thoughts on like how organizations like

1134
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,640
that could better

1135
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,440
be more transparent or like at like

1136
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,920
differentiate between the the data that

1137
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,560
they do release through ddos secrets

1138
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,040
um yeah thank you so i mean

1139
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,720
i'll take mild objection in saying that

1140
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,839
they're not the only one right like

1141
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,680
belly cat does great stuff in that front

1142
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,760
i hope they'll do more of it but yes the

1143
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,800
ddos secrets does good work on this

1144
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,640
look i don't even have much judgment

1145
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,960
towards them because when you look at

1146
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,640
organizations like that they're giving

1147
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,920
themselves a time frame to understand

1148
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,520
what they're looking at

1149
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,680
the issue we're dealing with is between

1150
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,920
the rat race of being the first security

1151
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,960
vendor to call something out and

1152
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,800
you know trying to cover things in the

1153
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,880
space as a journalist before anybody

1154
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,480
else scoops you

1155
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,079
we really aren't giving ourselves a

1156
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,760
space to properly understand the data

1157
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,200
that's being dumped on us i mean you

1158
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,640
don't

1159
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,240
people were covering the hacking team

1160
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,920
hack

1161
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,040
way faster than they could have

1162
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,960
downloaded 400 gigs you know like

1163
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,400
there's no way you had downloaded the

1164
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,320
whole thing but people wanted the scoops

1165
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,240
everybody wanted to jump on it

1166
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,320
and i think that's where

1167
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,800
the worst of the amplification happens

1168
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,800
right trite saying about like you know a

1169
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,320
lie travels twice around the world

1170
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,640
before the truth puts depends on

1171
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,560
applies here because you know it takes

1172
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,880
almost no time for us to come out with a

1173
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,640
a hot take and a nice tweet and maybe

1174
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,200
write a cool blog and say oh my god but

1175
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,880
we've already seen the russians

1176
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,640
manipulate the data that gets dropped

1177
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,160
and we've already seen how some of these

1178
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,560
things are intentionally sifted to make

1179
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,160
things look worse than they are and

1180
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,839
there's no way that you're going to

1181
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:28,640
assess that in three hours so

1182
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,920
i'm sure those folks are doing great

1183
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,040
work they're probably doing it better

1184
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,040
than i would i think the biggest issue

1185
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,480
here is saying you know give yourself a

1186
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,760
little time to understand what you're

1187
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,119
looking at and have some healthy

1188
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,640
skepticism before you buy the story

1189
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,640
if we're honest the reason the story's

1190
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,320
so appealing is because it takes the

1191
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,800
moral quandary out of our hands it's

1192
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,800
activism somebody just dropped this on

1193
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,720
my lap i'm not working

1194
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,720
as part of an operation from a foreign

1195
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,839
country

1196
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,720
and it's convenient so we like it but

1197
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,439
it's not true

1198
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,400
on that positive note

1199
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,870
thanks everybody

1200
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:06,460
[Applause]
