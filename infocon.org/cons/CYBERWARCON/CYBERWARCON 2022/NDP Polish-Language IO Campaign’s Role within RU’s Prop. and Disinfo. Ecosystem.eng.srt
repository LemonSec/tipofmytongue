1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,120
um so today um as Lee said I'm Sam

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,180
Riddell I'm an analyst at mandiant and

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,560
I'm going to present on the campaign we

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,660
refer to as NDP I know there's at least

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,920
one polish speaker in the audience so

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,740
I'm not going to butcher that name here

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,660
um but uh what NDP is it's a um

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,760
pro-russian Polish language influence

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,920
campaign centered around the NDP outlet

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,180
that I had the pleasure of

11
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,100
co-investigating with my colleague David

12
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,380
Maynor David was actually uh supposed to

13
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,760
present this it was really his main

14
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,380
investigation uh he wasn't able to be

15
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,820
here today but just want to say a huge

16
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,820
shout out and thanks to David slide

17
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:33,899
all right I'm gonna really try to put

18
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,219
the lightning and lightning talk and

19
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:36,960
just go through a lot of content quickly

20
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,899
here so quick campaign overview I will

21
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:41,520
discuss that overlaps with the ghost

22
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,899
writer Campaign which many of you are

23
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,640
familiar with uh talk about the

24
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,680
campaigns up two in the present day and

25
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,280
then touch on a few takeaways slide

26
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,480
slide

27
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,820
so our understanding first of all of NDP

28
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,320
has greatly benefited from the work of a

29
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,480
lot of other organizations so firstly

30
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,879
some of the original polish journalists

31
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,039
and in-country investigators did great

32
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,019
work on this in addition to uh entities

33
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,960
like Stanford i o researchers across the

34
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,460
board NATO and others so we want to

35
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,539
thank them slide

36
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,439
all right so what is NDP first let's

37
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,479
start with what NDP claims to be NDP

38
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,360
claims to be an independent uh political

39
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,280
Journal uh that is based in Poland

40
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,680
however what we and others have assessed

41
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,360
is that in fact this is an inauthentic

42
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,979
news outlet that operates in support of

43
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,659
Russian political interests

44
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,340
um we've also identified a broader

45
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,020
influence campaign surrounding the

46
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,759
journal so the journal is just one asset

47
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,799
in this Ledger campaign we refer to this

48
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,659
campaign as NDP as well I'm sorry I know

49
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,060
it's a little confusing a key asset and

50
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,740
it's also a key asset in the pro-russian

51
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,540
information space and as I've said it's

52
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,860
linked to The Ghost Writer campaign

53
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,200
slide

54
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,920
so um NEP formerly was best defined by

55
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,200
what it was against so it is heavily

56
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,479
anti-nato

57
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:57,420
anti-eu anti-us they're very against the

58
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,939
uh the right wing Law And Justice party

59
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,159
in Poland and against immigration and

60
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,020
most of the themes they touched on have

61
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,759
to do with Poland specifically or the

62
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,038
theme of military Affairs after the

63
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:09,598
Russian invasion they've had a renewed

64
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,819
Vigor and focus on life and become

65
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,220
overtly uh pro-russian just across the

66
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,379
board slide

67
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,120
so how do they do this what uh

68
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,319
infrastructure they have at their

69
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,720
disposal so the primary Vector that I

70
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,680
think a lot of people are familiar with

71
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,599
are the is the outlet itself which has

72
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,400
been hosted on at least eight domains

73
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,319
over its history but in addition to this

74
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,200
NDP has a wide variety of social media

75
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,360
accounts on both Western social media

76
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,000
platforms at certain times and uh or

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,520
Niche Outlets such as telegram

78
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,319
um there we've also identified at least

79
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,599
28 inauthentic personas that are

80
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,940
affiliated with this campaign so they do

81
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,280
anything from posing as editors to the

82
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,739
uh of the outlet to author personas and

83
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:51,300
actually authoring content for the

84
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,760
website to engaging in dissemination or

85
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,860
CIB

86
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,720
um this campaign just like um

87
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,760
Ghostwriter is augmented by offensive

88
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,920
cyber capabilities so I'll touch on how

89
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,019
that works here in a moment and there is

90
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:05,519
an additional linked news outlet that we

91
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,019
believe is links to both NDP and

92
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,099
Ghostwriter that we're going to reveal

93
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:11,280
today for the first time slide

94
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,620
slide so blow through a few case studies

95
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,560
here um the first being this operation

96
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,319
in which a fabrication was posted to at

97
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,420
least three compromised local polish

98
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,540
websites so this post uh this operation

99
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,180
promoted the claim essentially that

100
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,159
um land that had belonged to Germany

101
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,019
pre-World War II was going to be

102
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,720
returned to Germany from polish citizens

103
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,000
to German citizens so clearly seeking to

104
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,680
stoke the Divide between polish and

105
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,440
German citizens especially along the

106
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,379
border uh so such that we observed the

107
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,180
targeting of these websites to be highly

108
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,580
geographically specific they all aligned

109
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,159
with municipalities or localities right

110
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,680
up against the Poland German border next

111
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,959
day we saw NDP Persona dissemination by

112
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,120
these inauthentic accounts and it's

113
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,459
notable that they directly linked to the

114
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,799
live compromises or in some cases to

115
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,220
archived versions of the URLs on sites

116
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,200
like Wayback machine which we believe

117
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,799
was done in order to maintain preemptive

118
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:12,060
persistence anticipate essentially that

119
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,260
the websites would catch on and remove

120
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,440
these articles slide

121
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,320
um this next one um is pretty Brazen and

122
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,699
um I think failed pretty horrifically

123
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:22,620
but um the worth talking about

124
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,479
um so this operation

125
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,759
um publicly reported that dozens of

126
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:29,040
sites were defaced and they were defaced

127
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,300
with this image

128
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,460
um of a quote suicide bomber and an

129
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,860
Arabic language warning that read Jihad

130
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,479
has no borders stop the American

131
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,100
soldiers or we will come to your homes

132
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,020
so this stuck out a little odd to us

133
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,960
just highly specific anti-us uh military

134
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,880
narrative here and then sure enough the

135
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,460
day after these enfacements we saw the

136
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,440
whole variety of the NDP apparatus

137
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,360
basically promote this narrative that

138
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,699
the Islamic State or Isis was planning

139
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,860
an attack on Poland citing these

140
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,820
defacements as evidence for those claims

141
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,139
then a second wave of dissemination

142
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,720
followed up upon this in which an

143
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,300
article published by an author of NDP to

144
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,540
the NDP domain was injected into very

145
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,780
highly micro-targeted online communities

146
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,780
affiliated with uh U.S military

147
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,520
decisions and units that were stationed

148
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,160
in Poland so groups on social media or

149
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,639
specific blogs slide

150
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,500
um so in addition to the CIB we observed

151
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,639
there were some pretty obvious

152
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,259
indicators that also pointed the fact

153
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:29,940
that we think that this is a false flag

154
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,120
uh the first being that the so so-called

155
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,280
jihadist in the photo

156
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,259
um it appears was actually just a

157
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:39,479
Palestinian activist we tracked this

158
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:41,520
based on reverse image search and the

159
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,259
even the suicide vest is just full of

160
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,360
fake charges so they didn't even pull a

161
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,300
fake photo of a real uh terrorist in

162
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,919
addition to that the word Jihad was

163
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,380
spelled wrong in Arabic so

164
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,900
if I was a quote cyber terrorist I think

165
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,280
I would know how to spell at least that

166
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,039
word slide

167
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,660
and the third I'm not going to go

168
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,340
through just for time but I do want to

169
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,780
highlight it as a good segue into the

170
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,340
overlaps with Ghost Rider because of its

171
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,680
thematic similarity so this operation

172
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,080
involving website compromise promoted

173
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,759
The Narrative that U.S soldiers driving

174
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,979
by their base in Poland had caused a

175
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:16,259
fatal car accident uh fatally wounding

176
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,840
multiple polish citizens just uh two to

177
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,460
three months later we saw an operation

178
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,380
that we associated with The Ghost Writer

179
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,720
campaign claimed that a NATO Striker

180
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,580
vehicle driving around by its base had

181
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,100
run over a local child on its bicycle so

182
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,419
they don't get very creative in

183
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:33,600
Reinventing these operations slide

184
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,660
slide uh so to just to briefly back up

185
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,160
if you're not familiar with Ghostwriter

186
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,860
Ghostwriter is a predominantly anti-nato

187
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,259
pro-russian Pro Belarusian

188
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:45,120
um influence campaign that we and others

189
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,520
have reported on for some time

190
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,860
um and we have observed what we believe

191
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,419
to become pretty strong indicators

192
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:52,740
suggesting that the bare minimum

193
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,840
coordination or at least shared planning

194
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,639
between the NDP and Ghost Rider

195
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,560
operations so everything from the

196
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,000
Thematic overlapped like I just

197
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,979
discussed to ttps and even direct

198
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:04,080
Persona interaction so liking each

199
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,600
other's content on Facebook or other

200
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,300
sites and um a few others that I'll go

201
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,500
through here briefly

202
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,539
slide

203
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:14,759
content overlap another example of this

204
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,580
would be this fairly unique death Ender

205
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,860
graphic and phrase that they've coined

206
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,539
and both campaigns promoted this as a

207
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:22,680
play on words

208
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,900
um playing with the defender 2020

209
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,240
exercises name and then here on the

210
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,280
right we have two videos one promoted by

211
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,440
a Ghostwriter Persona the other promoted

212
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,620
by a the official NDP account it's the

213
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,539
exact same video that we saw nowhere

214
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,280
else the only difference is one was

215
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,199
dubbed in English and one was dubbed in

216
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,180
Poland so they're apparently using these

217
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,979
two different campaigns to Target two

218
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:48,120
different uh Target audiences slide

219
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,160
uh even down at aesthetic similarities

220
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,900
between the inauthentic news outlets

221
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,940
associated with the both uh both the

222
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,440
campaign so on the left we have Baltic

223
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,300
word which we have linked to

224
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,220
um Ghostwriter and then NDP on the right

225
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,800
slide

226
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,599
and just quickly what I mean by

227
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,220
operational overlap I want to give one

228
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,720
example of that and something we've seen

229
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,340
so we've seen multiple Ghost Writer

230
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,919
operations that were directly promoted

231
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,680
by NDP personas in real time as they

232
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,819
happened

233
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:17,099
um and this was again direct links to

234
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,080
the URLs of those compromised domains

235
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,419
that hadn't appeared elsewhere before

236
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,400
slide

237
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,440
slide oh great

238
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,660
um so what's NEP up to today

239
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,039
um so first of all they seem to really

240
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,840
tone down the cyber-enabled activity we

241
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,399
haven't seen much of that recently but

242
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,260
we have seen continued activity from

243
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,020
Legacy NDP assets and the website itself

244
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,899
continued authoring of Articles and a

245
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:41,880
very strong and sudden shift to telegram

246
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,640
around the um beginning of the Russian

247
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,380
invasion of Ukraine

248
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,640
slide

249
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,260
so as you can see here right around

250
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,660
February of this year both their

251
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,220
subscribers and their reach went up

252
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,440
dramatically this is partially I believe

253
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,019
because of the The Invasion but

254
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:00,300
partially also because of

255
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,220
um deep platforming actions taken by

256
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,779
Western social media companies around

257
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:07,040
this time slide

258
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,459
um here's an example of some of the

259
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,440
pro-russian uh content that they

260
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,959
abruptly pivoted to the left uh being a

261
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,519
famous pro-russian talking point that

262
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,320
the missile strike and the Crematory

263
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,180
train station was actually conducted by

264
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,100
Ukrainian forces rather than Russian

265
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,260
forces which is of course not the case

266
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,880
um and then on the right this Trojan

267
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,920
Horus narrative that if Ukrainian

268
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,899
refugees were allowed into the country

269
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,700
of Poland they would be a threat to

270
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,200
Poland from the inside sled

271
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,420
so to sum up basically they did a decent

272
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,459
job or at least they tried for some time

273
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,620
to hold up the facade of being a

274
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,540
nominally independent uh Polish language

275
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,940
outlet but that kind of all changed

276
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,940
after the The Invasion and now it's um

277
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,200
just to the degree that they're

278
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,300
literally reposting Russian Ministry of

279
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,920
Defense briefings

280
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,680
slide

281
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,000
so the last thing I want to highlight is

282
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,380
Polska news this is the outlet I

283
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,519
referenced earlier this is something

284
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,160
we've recently identified and we believe

285
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,019
it's another suspected inauthentic news

286
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:06,720
outlet that is linked to both NDP uh and

287
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,540
Ghost Writer so very strong overlaps in

288
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,220
multiple ways even down to the fact that

289
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,959
they both sites use uh inauthentic

290
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,260
editors and author personas and we have

291
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,120
seen some limited specific operational

292
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,220
overlap between the campaigns as well

293
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,779
slide

294
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:24,060
so takeaways

295
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,380
um I think that the one of the big ones

296
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,180
is just that as these campaigns that

297
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,220
we're all investigating get more nuanced

298
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,779
and more quote sophisticated over time

299
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:32,880
that it can take years or quite a long

300
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,160
time to uncover the full scope of what

301
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,540
we're looking at

302
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,100
um and then another is the effects of

303
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,560
de-platforming and actor persistence in

304
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,320
the i o domain so you know while I think

305
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,000
it's certainly a net positive that

306
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,860
action by Western social media companies

307
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,079
are able to drastically reduce the reach

308
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:51,240
of these operations there's often a

309
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,680
second order effect of them these

310
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,899
campaigns that are well resourced moving

311
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:57,180
elsewhere uh and sometimes enjoying

312
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,100
somewhat of a success on places like

313
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,500
telegram so they're reaching far less of

314
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,120
an audience but maybe one that's more

315
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,339
radicalized or primed to receive their

316
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:07,140
their messaging and then the third is

317
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,760
just kind of a question a research

318
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,899
question that we wanted to leave you

319
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:12,120
with and it's that we saw not only NDP

320
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,279
but other pro-russian assets we tracked

321
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,380
like really dramatically turned to

322
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,000
supporting the war in Russia right

323
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,620
around February and so there's kind of

324
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,180
an open question of was this just an

325
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,640
organic patriotic rally around the flag

326
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,920
effect that can best explain this or is

327
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,720
there perhaps something more formal a

328
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,760
top-down shared directive that can

329
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,519
explain this so without humans I don't

330
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,260
think we can know but if any of you have

331
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,399
any ideas I'd love to chat with you

332
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,740
further slide if you have any other

333
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,720
further questions for uh either David or

334
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,160
myself please feel free to reach out to

335
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,680
us on Twitter or uh email or find me
