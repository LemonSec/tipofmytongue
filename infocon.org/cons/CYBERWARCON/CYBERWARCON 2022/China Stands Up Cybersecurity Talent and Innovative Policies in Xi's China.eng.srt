1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
my name is Dakota I'm with Craig Stamos

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,440
group where I'm a China consultant I'm

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,120
also a non-resident fellow with the

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,919
United Council and I'm the first talk

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,559
after lunch so you're awake you're full

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,059
and you're paying attention and I'm

7
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:13,860
going to talk about China's cyber

8
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,179
security policies that bolster its

9
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,160
Talent Pipeline and its capability

10
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,699
development

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,840
so I'm going to paint the picture of

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,820
when Xi Jinping comes into office in

13
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,060
2013. at this point we know that code

14
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,480
can slow down Iranian centrifuges

15
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,300
Snowden has leaked a bunch of secrets to

16
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,800
the press That's influenced how people

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,559
think about this issue and China's own

18
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,660
Security Services have dismantled a

19
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,480
network of U.S informants who are using

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,600
website websites to communicate with

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,120
their handlers Xi Jinping comes into

22
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,680
office in 2013 and sets cyber security

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,420
policy as one of his top priorities he

24
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,300
stands up a leading small group in 2014.

25
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,719
this is promoted to a committee of the

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,980
Chinese Communist Party Central

27
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,580
Committee one of about 28 committees at

28
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,920
this level within the organization it

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,360
signals that it's a very significant

30
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,119
issue and that the provincial and

31
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:13,799
Municipal governments and party leaders

32
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,680
should respond to this political demand

33
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,340
signal at the same time in 2016 that

34
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,380
this leading small group is elevated to

35
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,259
a committee he stands up the cyberspace

36
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:28,140
administration of China this is a

37
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,420
public-facing government bureaucracy

38
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,659
that matches the Chinese Communist Party

39
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,520
Central Committee for cyber security and

40
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,920
informatization both in address and

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,079
personnel and in actual offices and so

42
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,479
when we hear about

43
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:43,500
investigations against tech companies

44
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,900
from the CAC it is actually the same

45
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,360
political body as a committee within the

46
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,960
Chinese Communist party next slide

47
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,540
so they start to focus on Talent

48
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,960
policies in 2015. uh this is after the

49
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,280
committee's been stood up and people

50
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,500
start to focus on this issue and China

51
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,659
has recognized that the United States

52
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,360
has done very well in its cyber power up

53
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,818
until this point owing to a focus on

54
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:12,900
education so in 2015 China begins a

55
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,580
review of cyber security degree

56
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,739
curriculums this is based on the United

57
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:19,379
States's National Initiative for cyber

58
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:22,080
security education in 2016 they begin

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,400
building a national cyber security

60
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,940
talent and Innovation base in Wuhan and

61
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,860
then in 2017 they launched a program

62
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,440
that mirrors the United States is

63
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,420
centers of academic excellence and cyber

64
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,940
operations in 2017 they've certified

65
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,700
nine schools as these world-class cyber

66
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,560
security schools and then two years

67
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,480
later they certify four more bringing

68
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,819
that total up to 11. and then in the

69
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:47,519
same time in 2017 they've stood up uh

70
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,860
this like academic infrastructure for

71
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,480
degree curriculums the ones that are the

72
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,180
best but they need students to attend

73
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,560
these institutions and they need people

74
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,120
to be attracted to the cyber security

75
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,420
field and so this dual-handed approach

76
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,280
to making this happen occurs through

77
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,920
this very impressive you can't go abroad

78
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,019
and you can't do International software

79
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:09,180
vulnerability competitions anymore next

80
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,739
slide

81
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:14,159
so Xi Jinping is trying to change this

82
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,260
attitude of

83
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,540
um seeing hackers as flowers in this

84
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,860
field of wheat that are meant to be

85
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,200
found by policy makers and then later

86
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,140
utilize her purposes uh for for a

87
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,300
hacking Target so like if we look at the

88
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,480
apt-40 group and the doj indictment and

89
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,680
the intrusion truth information around

90
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,060
that or we look at the anthem Insurance

91
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,340
hack and its overlap with Southeast

92
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,500
University there are actually students

93
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,360
competing in cyber security competitions

94
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,580
who are later drafted into hacking

95
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,860
operations of the state they are meant

96
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,140
to find software vulnerabilities for use

97
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,420
by the state it's very haphazard it's

98
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,280
not how a mature bureaucracy functions

99
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,900
particularly when considering

100
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,580
intelligence collection and so changing

101
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,680
this attitude is a critical part of this

102
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,379
Talent pipeline in order to do that they

103
00:03:58,379 --> 00:03:59,760
need to get students and people

104
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,040
interested in this job they hold back

105
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,540
their best security researchers from

106
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,180
traveling abroad they launch a program

107
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,700
called the uh let's see infosec

108
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,640
Triathlon it's a joint I jointly

109
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,040
operated I capture the flag program that

110
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,079
runs across China it's run by the

111
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,120
ministry of State Securities 13th Bureau

112
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,738
the China Information Technology

113
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,839
security and evaluation center and the

114
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,580
Ministry of Education and the goal is

115
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,680
specifically to promote people's

116
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,840
interest in pursuing this as a career

117
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,900
field and then in 2018 tianfu cup gets

118
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,400
stood up as kind of this replacement for

119
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,560
you can't go to pone to own but we're

120
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,699
still going to compensate you for these

121
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:38,460
vulnerabilities and of course charges of

122
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,960
these vulnerabilities being used in

123
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,240
internal hacking campaigns emerge a

124
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,620
couple years later thanks for reporting

125
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,080
from MIT technology review next slide

126
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,120
but that's not to ignore the fact that

127
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,160
they are interested in the software

128
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,500
vulnerabilities that are created by

129
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,320
researchers and then you know released

130
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,540
to the public at these competitions so

131
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,380
in 2017 there's a quote from the head of

132
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,900
chihu 360 where he can pairs software

133
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,699
vulnerabilities to a national resource

134
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:07,860
on par with things like coal and Timber

135
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,860
and this attitude typifies one of the

136
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,600
two reasons that these security

137
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,160
researchers are not allowed to travel

138
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,620
abroad you can see the same interest in

139
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,419
in harvesting collecting and utilizing

140
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,940
software vulnerabilities and the 2017

141
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,220
robot hacking games which is replication

142
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,100
of darpa's 2016 cyber Grand Challenge to

143
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,960
promote Research into automated software

144
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,300
vulnerability Discovery exploitation and

145
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,639
patching those competitions the robot

146
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,259
hacking games still run in China they've

147
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:36,419
held at least seven as part of my last

148
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,759
look and they're run by the People's

149
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,500
liberations Army equipment Development

150
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,900
Department so this is the branch of the

151
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,880
military specifically responsible for

152
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,100
procuring and finding capabilities that

153
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,259
are necessary for military operations

154
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:51,900
and then in 2021 they codify their

155
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,660
interest in tapping into this software

156
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,180
security pipeline by making it a rule

157
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,979
that you have to disclose software

158
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:01,199
vulnerabilities uh found conducting

159
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,600
research within 48 hours to the ministry

160
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
of industry and information technology

161
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,880
and this is a recreation of an operation

162
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,460
that we saw in 2017 thanks to research

163
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,680
at recorded future that showed the

164
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,240
Chinese intelligence Services were

165
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,860
collecting vulnerabilities that were

166
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,660
reported to their National Database

167
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,400
using these vulnerabilities and

168
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,380
operations and then only reporting them

169
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,960
publicly after those operations had been

170
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,199
busted by folks in this room and so that

171
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,360
lends itself to a policy environment

172
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,639
where we get to the 2022 Microsoft

173
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,560
defense report where guess what they're

174
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,240
using a bunch of zero days and they have

175
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,740
them because they've invested in the

176
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,300
capabilities to create them they've

177
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,039
withheld Talent from traveling abroad

178
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,199
and they facilitated an ecosystem within

179
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,060
China That's focused on doing this

180
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,300
research and they've started basically

181
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,740
this Pipeline and they're not allowed it

182
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,500
to go overseas next slide

183
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,960
so all along the way they are creating

184
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,780
physical infrastructure to support uh

185
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,460
the the research that's being conducted

186
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,340
on attacking both regular computer

187
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,960
networks and then operational technology

188
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,240
networks uh and so China builds its

189
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,360
first cyber range in 2010 uh it's

190
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,280
mentioned in a couple places and then I

191
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,080
can't find any record of it and then a

192
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,900
couple years later in 2015 uh one gets

193
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,940
stood up in guayong the national

194
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,620
government likes what it does and what

195
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,000
it's doing they commend it for

196
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,400
supporting uh offensive and defensive

197
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,099
National exercises and it's got a bunch

198
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,620
of uh ICS and operational technology

199
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,780
equipment and soar they do the same

200
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,300
thing and with chengdu's Peak geek

201
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,039
competition in 2019 which is meant to

202
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,800
create NATO's

203
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,680
NATO cyber defense exercise

204
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,720
in Guangdong Province there's pongchang

205
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,580
Labs where they're putting a bunch of

206
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,680
computational power into determine

207
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,120
whether or not reinforcement learning

208
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,940
can improve how cyber operations are run

209
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,460
specifically looking at a track yes and

210
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,060
then state-owned Enterprises also run

211
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,160
cyber ranges in this case Kasich which

212
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,440
does military missile development and

213
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,900
satellite operations has their own cyber

214
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,240
range focused specifically on these

215
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,280
assets next slide

216
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,860
so uh like all good researchers I find

217
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,780
the best stuff before I'm supposed to

218
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,400
come up and talk on stage within about

219
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,800
36 hours of doing so

220
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,319
um so I find this document online it's

221
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,360
the cyber security Talent actual combat

222
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,280
abilities white paper attack and defense

223
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,120
capabilities Edition very cool name very

224
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,300
mundane report it's 85 pages long and a

225
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,880
lot of it is demographic information uh

226
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,860
just like scissogen came up on stage and

227
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,779
talked about an interest in promoting

228
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:39,958
diversity within the U.S ecosystem the

229
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,179
first graph in this report from China is

230
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:44,580
a breakdown by gender uh it's 85 percent

231
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,980
male and the remainder is women it's not

232
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,540
great

233
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,740
um next slide

234
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,600
what I like most about this report is

235
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,120
they basically said I was right that the

236
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,980
world-class cyber security schools are

237
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,399
meant to copy the NSA DHS programs for

238
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,200
centers of academic Excellence next

239
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,760
slide

240
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,380
but what I found most interesting about

241
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,720
this report uh and it's 85 Pages which

242
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,779
to be clear I have skimmed okay there is

243
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:11,339
a translation coming out from the center

244
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:13,019
of security and information technology

245
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,760
at Georgetown

246
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,220
but the three needs that they found and

247
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,800
most president in these focus groups was

248
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,480
the need for people who are competent

249
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,459
penetration testers people who are good

250
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:25,140
reverse engineers and people who

251
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,519
specialize in software vulnerability

252
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,680
Discovery and exploitation last slide

253
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,720
but the real point of the report is to

254
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,519
summarize basically what I presented to

255
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,980
you today they have a development model

256
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,440
for their China hacking capabilities

257
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,019
pipeline uh both from a talent

258
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:41,279
development and a capabilities

259
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,600
development and they call it the four

260
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,399
plus three model and they think that

261
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,019
people who are coming out of this town

262
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,580
pipeline should be competent in the four

263
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,140
abilities and they should demonstrate

264
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,640
them in the three ways that they've

265
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,440
articulated here

266
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,880
this is an issue we're all going to have

267
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,100
to deal with China has gone from finding

268
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,480
flowers in a field of wheat to

269
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,459
cultivating an entire Harvest of people

270
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:00,899
who go to work in those bureaucracies

271
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:02,760
and that we all have to deal with thank

272
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,880
you
