1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,280
so uh my name is John Bateman I'm with

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,540
the Carnegie Endowment for International

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,700
Peace formerly in the U.S intelligence

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,799
community in the Pentagon I want to talk

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,320
to you today about whether Russia's

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,580
cyber operations in Ukraine were

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,799
actually militarily effective we already

8
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,179
had a great talk about some of the

9
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,640
technical pieces of these operations but

10
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,560
what has actually been accomplished in

11
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,240
terms of the war as a whole a lot of

12
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,439
people are trying to get after this

13
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,300
question and I have a forthcoming paper

14
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,340
that attempts to Analyze This now I

15
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,080
could spend my entire allotted time

16
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,180
talking about all the caveats about our

17
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,059
limited data the conceptual problems I'm

18
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:34,860
just going to say that this talk is kind

19
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,559
of a rough first order approximation

20
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,079
that I think can still be useful now if

21
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,399
you were to try to answer this question

22
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,739
how militarily effective has Russia been

23
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,239
in its cyber operations you might want

24
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:46,739
to break it down further you might want

25
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,140
to make some sub questions out of that

26
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,879
so the first thing that you might do is

27
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,379
you might try to make a one-for-one

28
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:54,180
comparison between cyber effects

29
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,280
operations or what the US military might

30
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,980
call fires and kinetic operations

31
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,199
envisioning cyber as a weapon system

32
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,940
what have been the comparative effects

33
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,960
of each next slide

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,220
uh Nick yeah thanks

35
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,260
um so this chart tries to go through

36
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,180
different categories of Ukrainian

37
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,400
targets of interest to Russia and

38
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,439
Compares some publicly available data

39
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,000
about what we know of the effects of

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,280
each so let's just start at the top uh

41
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,080
dog that didn't mark here is that

42
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,820
there's no known information that any

43
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,340
Russian cyber operation has compromised

44
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,259
or destroyed any piece of Ukrainian

45
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,119
military equipment whether Western

46
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,280
provided or otherwise well what about

47
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,020
military Communications what about the

48
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,060
Via snap hack is this still a very

49
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,280
debated event and I think the best that

50
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,140
you could say about the Via sat hack

51
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,180
from Russia's perspective is that it

52
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,220
plausibly contributed to some of the

53
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,500
communication problems that Ukraine had

54
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,540
in the earliest days of the war but

55
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,520
really the true cause of those problems

56
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,040
was very effective jam and electronic

57
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,259
warfare that Russia was doing and Russia

58
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,060
has continued to do that throughout the

59
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,100
war whereas the ViaSat hack was a

60
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,200
one-time event you could continue on

61
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,820
going down the line here

62
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,240
um no known actual takedown of uh

63
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,699
Ukrainian electricity via cyber means

64
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,800
meanwhile right now there are actually

65
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,840
millions of ukrainians that lack power

66
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,480
due to kinetic strikes uh I think this

67
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,099
final row is actually my favorite

68
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,379
because if you want to think about the

69
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,120
general purpose cyber weapons that

70
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,040
Russia has this would be destructive

71
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,379
cyber attacks and we saw a historically

72
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,900
unprecedented Spate of these Microsoft

73
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,700
counted about 50 in the first four

74
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,680
months of the war well during that same

75
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,140
period Russia launched over 3 000

76
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,480
missile strikes and at one point was uh

77
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,060
using uh 20 000 artillery rounds a day

78
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,739
so I think it's very clear that on a

79
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:43,440
one-to-one basis cyber has been far less

80
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,940
consequential than anything on the

81
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,860
battlefield now you might be saying John

82
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,900
okay but this is very simplistic cyber

83
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,700
weapons are not like kinetic weapons

84
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,440
they can have tailored reversible

85
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,300
effects they can have cascading effects

86
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,879
okay let's look at that next slide

87
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,160
so my argument is that the unique

88
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,959
benefits of cyber really haven't been

89
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,819
leveraged by Russia either

90
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,440
um so Russia really has never had a

91
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,900
strategy in Ukraine maybe other than the

92
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,360
first few weeks of the war for limiting

93
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,819
the actual effects so the idea of having

94
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:14,340
tailored effects that limit permanent or

95
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,680
collateral damage really is not part of

96
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,840
Russia's strategy

97
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,420
um the same thing about geographic reach

98
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,159
deniability these have really been kind

99
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,200
of beside the point for Russia Russia is

100
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,940
able to reach anywhere it needs within

101
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,140
Ukraine

102
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,540
um and uh deniability is not worth that

103
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,280
much when much of the world thinks of

104
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,200
you as kind of the modern face of evil

105
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,260
now so hiding behind some apt Persona is

106
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,659
kind of pointless a lot of people look

107
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,700
at Cyber operations as cost effective

108
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,739
and that's true to an extent but once

109
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:45,420
you're in a wartime environment there

110
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,400
are tremendous fixed costs on the

111
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,860
kinetic side and so for example Russia

112
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,680
has huge stalks of ammunition and it can

113
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,720
launch thousands of missiles and

114
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,099
hundreds of thousands of artillery

115
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:57,900
rounds it actually actually hasn't been

116
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,819
able to scale its cyber effects

117
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,319
operations to anywhere near the same

118
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,959
degree next slide now you might be

119
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:05,220
saying yourself okay but what about all

120
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,379
the intelligence operations hasn't that

121
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,599
been effective well there's really two

122
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,519
problems with the use of cyber as an

123
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,400
intelligence operation in Wartime uh one

124
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,900
problem is that you need to generate

125
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,940
intelligence That's Unique that can't be

126
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,160
gotten from other sources so if you want

127
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,899
to think about Russia's kinetic strikes

128
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,419
satellite imagery can tell you a lot of

129
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,100
what you need to know in order to Define

130
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,040
that airport find the aim points confirm

131
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,740
its importance really the idea of using

132
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,020
a cyber penetration on that airport to

133
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,080
somehow refine your targeting of that it

134
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,880
doesn't really make a lot of sense

135
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,680
the other thing that is really a

136
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,900
limitation is that Russian institutions

137
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,479
actually need to be limber and objective

138
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:47,699
and coherent and honest enough to

139
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:50,100
actually ingest and use any cyber

140
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,900
operations intelligence that they get

141
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,580
and we've seen throughout the world that

142
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,960
uh throughout the war that the Russia

143
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,900
way of war is very very crude very

144
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,300
brutal very violent very indiscriminate

145
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,460
it's not the type of person Precision

146
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,580
Warfare that really benefits from a

147
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,320
cyber intelligence

148
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,360
um so I'm going to hand it over to my

149
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,100
colleague Gavin now who will talk about

150
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,620
a few more pieces of this yeah so uh

151
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,400
next slide and one more first slide

152
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,620
so one of the questions we had is okay

153
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,500
so how would Russia Marshal its cyber

154
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,139
capabilities towards a military end next

155
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:26,160
slide

156
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,520
let's rewind to 2008. in Moscow there

157
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,840
was a lot of consternation in the

158
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,880
aftermath of the Russo Georgian War

159
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,340
about the fact that Georgia proved so

160
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,900
resilient to cyber and information

161
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,820
operations during the course of that war

162
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,039
and the idea started percolating that we

163
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,320
need to somehow consolidate some of our

164
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,660
uh capacities

165
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,120
in 2012 then Deputy Prime Minister

166
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,699
Dimitri ragozan who oversaw the defense

167
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:53,340
industrial base raised the idea of a

168
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,440
unified command to shape the information

169

170
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:02,940
he beat the drum that social media was a

171
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,060
key element of cyber warfare in this new

172
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,460
era that we find ourselves and

173
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,280
incidentally by early 2015 the general

174
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,320
staff 8th directorate which is in charge

175
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,600
of cryptography and and protecting

176
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,460
information and communication networks

177
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,500
for the military

178
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,500
uh issued a 26 million dollar tender for

179
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,180
Network defense services

180
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,100
next slide

181
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,759
so by the end of 2015 a command called

182
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,160
the information operations troop so the

183
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,919
Vio was stood up and bear in mind as

184
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,300
Gabby outlined before information

185
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,479
operations in the Russian conception

186
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:44,940
entails both Technical and psychological

187
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,740
um and its initial focus seems to have

188
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,319
been information assurance but

189
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,300
subsequent leaks and then U.S sanctions

190
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,979
later on indicate that they were heavily

191
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,020
involved in cyber opera or psychological

192
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,360
operations as well and in fact the

193
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,340
Russian defense minister in his very

194
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,259
limited public commentary about this new

195
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:05,100
unit mentioned their remit to match or

196
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,139
exceed

197
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:10,440
soviet-era counterpropaganda next slide

198
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,539
now recently we've learned a little bit

199
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:15,180
more about this unit the Vio number one

200
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,740
the gru unit 5477 which ran the info

201
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,259
Ross and other fake Outlets is

202
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,900
subordinate to Vio we learned that its

203
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:29,520
director was formerly detailed to GRU

204
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,940
unit 26165 otherwise known as fancy

205
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,580
Bearer apt-28 and the deputy director

206
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,759
had been made a an advisor to the

207
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,979
security Council now bear in mind the

208
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:43,500
Security Council is where some experts

209
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,440
such as Irina borgon and Andre soldotov

210
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,199
assess that major Russian cyber

211
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,319
campaigns are coordinated primarily at

212
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,580
that level

213
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,259
next slide

214
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:57,660
so what does all this mean the core

215
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,699
competencies of the Vio the information

216
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:03,240
operations troops uh appear thus far

217
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,280
based on available public information to

218
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,220
be primarily more dedicated to defensive

219
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,460
information information assurance

220
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,020
psychological operations but there's

221
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,819
precious little to indicate that they're

222
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:17,160
engaged in or have any capability to

223
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,000
perform offensive cyber operations and

224
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,979
what this also conjures is a lot of

225
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:24,539
questions about the degree to which the

226
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,419
Vio is separate and distinct from the

227
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:30,180
gru or whether it is merely a

228
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,820
alternative command structure that is

229
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,640
called upon during periods of War as

230
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,380
some of these slides noted they have

231
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,080
exercised with the Russian military in

232
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,719
particular in 2016 in the kafka's

233
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,839
exercises reportedly but we don't really

234
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,240
understand how they operate

235
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,080
independently of Gru capacities and as

236
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,839
you'll also note on the U.S side up

237
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,700
until 2 2016 we kind of conceptualized

238
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,980
cyber command's role as primarily a

239
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,680
defensive one it wasn't until after 2016

240
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,380
there was really a push for offensive

241
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,899
capacity so in a lot of ways Russia

242
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,899
appears to be struggling with the same

243
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:14,760
uh issues that the United States and

244
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,860
other West Western Nations do in putting

245
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,860
together a command unit that is coherent

246
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,740
enough and has the capacity to Surge

247
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,500
towards military objectives uh when

248
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,420
called upon and that's something as

249
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,420
author Max Smith recently wrote most

250
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,220
countries with sophisticated cyber

251
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,839
capabilities are currently struggling

252
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,820
with and will continue to struggle with

253
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,140
so

254
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,540
um it remains to be seen whether Vio is

255
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,300
a wartime command structure or merely an

256
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,779
amalgam of extant Gru capacity but

257
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:47,880
that's open-ended question for everyone

258
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,160
here we'd certainly be pleased to talk

259
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,899
with you more about all of these issues

260
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:55,200
and with that that's our time

261
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,500
foreign
