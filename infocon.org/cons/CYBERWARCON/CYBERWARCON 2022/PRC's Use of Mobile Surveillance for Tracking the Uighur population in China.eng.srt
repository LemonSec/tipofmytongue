1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,460
um hi my name is Christina I'm a

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,840
researcher with lookout's threat

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,940
intelligence team and I'm really excited

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,259
to be here today at my favorite

5
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:08,220
conference

6
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,080
conference um to talk about the

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,400
surveillance campaigns that we've

8
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,040
encountered at Lookout spanning roughly

9
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,500
eight years targeting uyghurs within

10
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,320
China as well as abroad next slide

11
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,699
please

12
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,140
one more

13
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,240
thank you so I want to start off by

14
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,920
talking about these five groups that you

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,140
see on the screen

16
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,080
they are collectively called the the

17
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,180
five poisons and these groups are

18
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,739
considered by the Chinese Communist

19
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:37,800
party to uh basically threaten the

20
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,140
stability of the state and of the regime

21
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,840
they include practitioners of falun gong

22
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,960
Chinese Democracy supporters advocates

23
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,820
for taiwan's Independence and then

24
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,059
Tibetan and uyghur separatists and as

25
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:52,559
I've researched these groups as part of

26
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,960
our threat hunting activities there's

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,640
kind of the same statement that comes up

28
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,199
again and again and again from different

29
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,800
Scholars and that is that the reason why

30
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,660
these groups are content are considered

31
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,360
such a threat is because they don't just

32
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,240
have political activism presence in

33
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,580
China but also significant presence

34
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,260
outside of China

35
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,020
and presumably because of this reason a

36
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,060
number of individuals tied to these

37
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,740
groups even if they themselves are not

38
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,900
political activists have been targeted

39
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,780
by pretty extensive CCP intelligence

40
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,060
operations and

41
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,100
um next slide please

42
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,960
this takes us to our discussion

43
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,939
specifically about uyghurs and the

44
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,159
campaigns that we have seen

45
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,780
so the reason why I'm specifically

46
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,119
talking about the uyghur population is

47
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,700
because uh uyghur surveillance campaigns

48
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,340
are by far the most prolific campaigns

49
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,140
that we've encountered at Lookout

50
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,840
and specifically what makes these

51
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,520
interesting is that we're seeing uyghurs

52
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,320
targeted not just within China but

53
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,360
extensive targeting outside the region

54
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,180
especially in turkey and this actually

55
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,799
overlaps with some of the testimony

56
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,799
we've seen from uh people living outside

57
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,259
of China who have moved from xinjiang to

58
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,799
Turkey and the broader uyghur diaspora

59
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,500
in Turkey who have been targeted by

60
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,500
extensive PRC operations in an attempt

61
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,260
to suppress political activism this

62
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,959
often takes the form of blackmail so

63
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,900
usually intimidation or sometimes even

64
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,180
cases where family members have been

65
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,000
detained and held hostage back in

66
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,599
xinjiang next slide please

67
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,520
and so the kind of the bulk of the

68
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,500
context for our story around the uyghur

69
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,840
surveillance issue is is based centered

70
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,640
in xinjiang

71
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,379
um the official name is the uyghur

72
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,840
autonomous region of xinjiang it's a

73
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,000
region in the Northwestern most part of

74
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,280
China just north of Tibet and it's

75
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,540
actually quite large

76
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,640
um it's it's larger than Alaska and for

77
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,440
those of us who are Canadian it's larger

78
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,780
than the province of Quebec and it is

79
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,239
home to over 56 different ethnic groups

80
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:59,879
the largest being uyghurs Han Kazakh and

81
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,080
whey

82
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,599
uh what makes this area particularly

83
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,400
interesting and I think what provides a

84
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,560
lot of context into the actions from the

85
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,940
government is the fact that it is

86
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,459
responsible for producing 20 of China's

87
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:14,400
oil and gas as well as a significant

88
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,980
portion of coal production and it

89
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,599
produces a quarter of the world's

90
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,620
tomatoes and cotton next slide please

91
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,480
and so presumably because of this

92
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,120
because of the the impact it has on

93
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,040
China's overall energy production as

94
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,260
well as the other resources that make it

95
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,480
economically important over the past few

96
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,099
decades the government has really

97
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,200
attempted to exert its control on this

98
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,959
region now not surprisingly this has led

99
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,260
to political unrest in the area and the

100
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,819
subsequent creation of what the

101
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,159
government calls re-education camps as

102
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,500
part of a campaign to curb religious

103
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,500
extremism and terrorism

104
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,540
um but what we've learned from the work

105
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,299
of numerous Scholars as well as leaked

106
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:00,000
documents and on testimony from former

107
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,360
detainees is that uyghurs and other

108
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,099
predominantly Muslim minority groups

109
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:07,140
within xinjiang have been sent to these

110
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,780
camps on Mass

111
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,000
experts estimate this began in 2014 and

112
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,480
then intensified in 2017 and since 2017

113
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,699
there have been roughly 1.5 million

114
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,798
people detained in these camps the

115
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:22,260
majority being uyghur it's often

116
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,440
described by Scholars as the largest

117
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,500
um

118
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,040
attainment of a of a population based on

119
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,580
ethnicity or religion since World War II

120
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,740
and despite the fact that the government

121
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,120
is sort of trying to position these

122
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,740
camps as glorified boarding schools

123
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,900
there have been significant reports of

124
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,740
abuse of forced sterilization as part of

125
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,240
a campaign that's been called the no

126
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,880
illegal births policy in xinjiang as

127
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,280
well as reports of forced labor

128
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,220
next slide please

129
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,080
now there are also some really

130
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,639
interesting documents that were leaked

131
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,139
that are now collectively called the

132
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,180
xinjiang police files that really

133
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,860
highlight the ways that people might

134
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,080
lead to being sent to one of these camps

135
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,180
and they kind of also highlight how

136
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,800
little you might do in order to actually

137
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,020
be sent to a re-education camp next

138
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,419
slide please

139
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:18,080
a lot of these activities are are coined

140
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,220
pre-criminal activities and this is

141
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,840
basically a way of saying that you've

142
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,300
done something that either makes the

143
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,500
government think that you are prone to

144
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,300
religious extremism or that you might

145
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,340
One Day become a problem for State

146
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,400
stability and uh these are things that I

147
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,720
think most of us do

148
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,060
um things like using a VPN

149
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,699
um in in many cases attending a mafia on

150
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:41,220
a Friday uh attending a mosque a certain

151
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,320
number of times the the number I usually

152
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,259
see is over 200 times using third party

153
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:48,840
messaging applications

154
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,699
um receiving a message from somebody who

155
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,800
might be on a watch list or receiving

156
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,840
religious texts from somebody on a watch

157
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,060
list looking at religious texts on your

158
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,639
mobile device uh there was one woman who

159
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,080
was sent to the camps for the

160
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,820
combination of at one point wearing a

161
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,759
hijab even if she didn't still wear it

162
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:07,139
using Whatsapp at some point and

163
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,240
visiting Kazakhstan at one point

164
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,199
next slide please

165
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,039
and so this takes us to our discussion

166
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:15,960
about mobile surveillance in particular

167
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,300
because you know quite frankly with

168
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,680
everything that we do on our phones and

169
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,180
especially with how important

170
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,460
smartphones and WeChat have become in

171
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,139
China if you want to know what somebody

172
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:26,639
is doing and you want to see whether

173
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,960
they're engaging in any of these

174
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,360
so-called pre-criminal activities one of

175
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,160
the best ways to do this is to

176
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,840
compromise their smartphone right you

177
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,160
can you can see everything pretty much

178
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,080
you can see what apps they're using you

179
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,120
can see who they're talking to you can

180
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,979
see what content they viewed what

181
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:43,319
content they've downloaded and you can

182
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,139
access a lot of other you know kind of

183
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,300
potentially damning uh information that

184
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,460
the government might be able to use to

185
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,100
to justify sending somebody to one of

186
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,319
these detention centers next slide

187
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,819
please

188
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:58,500
and one more

189
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,060
thank you

190
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,919
so at Lookout we've been tracking these

191
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,960
campaigns for like I said roughly eight

192
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,699
years and as you can see from this

193
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:07,919
timeline there is a lot of weaker

194
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,479
targeted surveillance floating around on

195
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:11,340
the internet now

196
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,800
um the the numbers that you're like the

197
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,819
dates that you're seeing these

198
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:16,979
correspond to when we first saw a sample

199
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,780
of this particular family and then there

200
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,220
has been a lot of work from other

201
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,199
research teams doing phenomenal

202
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,880
disclosures about different uyghur

203
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,440
surveillance families that they've seen

204
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,020
targeting mobile devices as well and I

205
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,340
have a whole list of these in one of the

206
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,680
last slides but you can see the uh the

207
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,080
teams with their corresponding malware

208
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,539
family on on this timeline as well

209
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,240
but but what we've seen really is that

210
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,039
the earliest sample of uyghur

211
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,220
surveillance dates back to 2011 and this

212
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,620
is a family called Golden Eagle we wrote

213
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,000
about this in a white paper that was

214
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,400
released in 2020.

215
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,639
um but you know basically from 2011 all

216
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,979
the way to today we're seeing a

217
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:57,720
significant development in the number of

218
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,460
new surveillance applications that are

219
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,979
being used to Target this population and

220
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:03,960
if if you look at the Timeline pretty

221
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,340
much every year there are new samples

222
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,419
popping up

223
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,759
now you'll see a couple of samples here

224
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,880
mobile Hunter and netguard I've included

225
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,020
these because they are surveillance

226
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,280
applications but these are actually

227
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,380
State developed so they don't

228
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,759
necessarily fall into the campaigns

229
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,919
we've seen where you have trojanized

230
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,960
applications being distributed in an

231
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,460
attempt to compromise someone's device

232
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,620
without knowing many of these

233
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,000
applications are used at various

234
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,580
checkpoints in xinjiang to essentially

235
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,560
do forensics on someone's phone and see

236
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,059
what they've been doing

237
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:36,020
next slide please

238
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:39,000
uh next slide thank you

239
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,039
so today the two we're going to focus on

240
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,080
are two malware families that we have

241
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,180
seen extensively distributed through

242
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,920
various social media platforms and

243
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,680
forums uh the first is moonshine and

244
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,839
this is a surveillance kit that was

245
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,140
discovered by a citizen lab in 2019 in

246
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,600
that context it was used as part of a

247
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,339
spearfishing attack against Tibetan

248
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,140
activists somebody would receive a text

249
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,459
message saying hey look at this great

250
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,459
article uh and and an exploit would be

251
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:07,440
delivered to their device and then the

252
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,480
Moonshine surveillance kit would be

253
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,519
downloaded and run you know in the

254
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,660
background without them realizing

255
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,060
collecting a whole bunch of information

256
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,800
how we're seeing it now is actually

257
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,899
embedded within various Android

258
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:20,700
applications and then being distributed

259
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,620
through social media platforms

260
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,000
the other family we're going to look at

261
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,760
is a new one this is a family called bad

262
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,399
Bazaar that we've called bad Bazaar and

263
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,880
this family is uh literally on every

264
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,620
single uyghur language telegram channel

265
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,600
that I've come across it's quite

266
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,940
prolific in its distribution

267
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,640
next slide please

268
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,839
so how are these apps getting

269
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:44,100
distributed

270
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,540
um there are a few ways so as I

271
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,339
mentioned from the citizen lab report

272
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:48,899
there was the spear phishing attack

273
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:50,700
against Tibetan activists so

274
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,440
spearfishing is certainly one very

275
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,760
effective way that these apps are being

276
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,959
delivered

277
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,120
um where I've particularly been seeing

278
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,339
these apps show up is through two main

279
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:01,620
vectors the first being extensive social

280
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,420
engineering on uyer language social

281
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,519
media platforms a lot of various

282
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,620
telegram channels of people asking for

283
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,940
different apps that they can't access

284
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,560
because they're behind the great

285
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,480
firewall and you know need to be able to

286
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,220
reach family through telegram or

287
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,019
Whatsapp or whatever

288
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:19,200
um and so somebody you know might post a

289
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,420
request saying hey I'm looking for a

290
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,860
cracked version of WhatsApp that I can

291
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,779
use and you'll have a few people that

292
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:28,380
will respond uh that have sort of

293
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,959
I guess gained the trust and the support

294
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,760
of people within the community by by

295
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,500
engaging with people over a course of

296
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,360
sometimes several months they'll respond

297
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,740
and say hey this is the version that I

298
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,060
use it's great

299
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,800
and of course we look at it and it's bad

300
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,860
bizarre and or it's moonshine and and so

301
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,360
there are these pretty extensive and

302
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,680
long-running social engineering

303
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,300
campaigns on some of these different

304
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,519
platforms the other way we're seeing

305
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,019
these apps distributed specifically in

306
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,180
the case of bad Bazaar is through either

307
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,100
fake app stores where the thread actor

308
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,079
has created an App Store just to

309
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,600
download uyghur language applications to

310
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,279
someone's device claiming that they're

311
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:04,440
all benign but they actually are all

312
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,880
Distributing different variants of the

313
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,920
bad Bazaar surveillance wear or

314
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,500
sometimes through unofficial uh but the

315
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,600
quote-unquote legitimate third-party app

316
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,700
stores like APK pure

317
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,399
next slide please

318
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,800
so we've been looking at a number of

319
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,360
applications that we've seen through

320
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,160
various social media platforms and

321
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,800
forums that are used by weird language

322
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,740
um netizens I guess relax a better word

323
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,880
and of these samples that we've

324
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,940
collected from July of this year 30 of

325
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,820
them were surveillance wear of those 62

326
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,740
percent are this new family bad Bazaar

327
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,920
25 were moonshine and the remainder were

328
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,800
some older families that we've talked

329
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,079
about kind of in the past that have been

330
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,360
tied to weaker surveillance campaigns uh

331
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,040
one of them double agent is part of that

332
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,839
white paper from 2020 and that comes

333
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:52,980
back when we talk a little bit about

334
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,740
attribution on bad Bazaar and then the

335
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,480
other two that we've seen specifically

336
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,640
targeting the uyghur population are hen

337
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,860
box and plug-in Phantom and both of

338
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,200
these are pretty old families that were

339
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,560
discovered by unit 42 a few years ago

340
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,000
the 5.5 uh number there is related to

341
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,680
commercial surveillance where that's not

342
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,200
specifically used in every case to

343
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,180
Target uyghurs but has been repurposed

344
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,279
for the sake of these uyghur campaigns

345
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,920
next slide please

346
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,260
next slide thank you

347
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,660
so starting off with bad Bazaar uh we

348
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,000
came across a sample of bad Bazaar from

349
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,880
a Twitter handle called malware Hunter

350
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,320
team they tend to share a lot of

351
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,779
interesting samples on Twitter and this

352
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:39,240
had been flagged by virustotal as a

353
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,700
family called Bahamut and when we looked

354
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,680
at it it was pretty clear that this is

355
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,120
was not the same threat actor not the

356
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,920
same malware family it was actually tied

357
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,500
to a weaker targeting campaign and we

358
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,300
inevitably found out that it was related

359
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,360
to an apt group called apt 15.

360
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,519
and what we found was that there was

361
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,320
targeting with this malware family not

362
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,240
just of uyghurs in China but also abroad

363
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,160
there was a device in turkey that had

364
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,620
been compromised as well as any

365
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,779
countries that had significant Muslim

366
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:09,660
populations Afghanistan was another one

367
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,279
now these applications typically take

368
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,639
the form of either being custom fake app

369
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,440
stores like I mentioned that are you

370
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,940
know attempting to download additional

371
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,620
bad bizarre samples to someone's device

372
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,019
or they're using legitimate applications

373
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:24,720
like Tick Tock and trojanizing them with

374
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,060
the bad bizarre malware

375
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,040
of these samples of bad Bazaar that we

376
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,139
have in our data set 70 of them came

377
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:33,120
from social media and specifically your

378
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,040
language social media platforms next

379
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,440
slide please

380
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,660
so the way that bad bizarre works is the

381
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,800
actual application doesn't really

382
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,360
contain much malicious functionality

383
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,459
what it does is it reaches out to its C2

384
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:46,740
grabs a payload that actually contains

385
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,660
the surveillance capabilities and then

386
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,240
runs it dynamically on the device there

387
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,100
were some early variants that bundle the

388
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,800
surveillance capability within a file

389
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,320
called update.jar but they quickly

390
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,880
pivoted away from that because that's a

391
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,980
very easy way to be caught especially if

392
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,779
you have you know some kind of antivirus

393
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:05,579
software running on your phone you know

394
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,019
assets that's where everyone hides the

395
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:08,940
scary good stuff so they could have

396
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,740
pivoted away from that and now they are

397
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,839
specifically pulling down the the

398
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:14,639
payload from their C2

399
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,600
next slide please

400
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,339
and the malware is actually pretty full

401
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:22,260
featured it can collect almost

402
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,860
everything about your device uh location

403
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,480
installed applications call logs

404
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,480
including geocoded data for those calls

405
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,440
SMS messages information tied to certain

406
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,000
third-party applications that can be

407
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
specified by the C2 it can look for say

408
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,980
Word documents or PowerPoint files that

409
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,500
are stored on your device it can record

410
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,180
your phone calls it can take pictures it

411
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,620
can basically see everything that you're

412
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,480
doing with your phone at all times

413
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,440
next slide please

414
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,360
so the infrastructure for bad Bazaar is

415
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,639
actually pretty recognizable and it's

416
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,019
very consistent across all of the

417
00:14:58,019 --> 00:14:59,519
variants that we've looked at

418
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,019
unlike some of the other malware

419
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:02,940
families we see that are a little bit

420
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,560
less for lack of a better word

421
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,839
sophisticated uh they're using SSL

422
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,279
pinning to try and prevent man in the

423
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,920
middle attacks however they are using at

424
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,540
least in the most recent variants the

425
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,660
same certificates across

426
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,000
and they're all included in the

427
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,620
resources there's a directory called raw

428
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,500
within the APK package they also all

429
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,199
have the same common name my server but

430
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:30,240
you know because they're reusing these

431
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,220
certificates we have seen them across

432
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,380
various c2s

433
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,760
but the actual infrastructure

434
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,740
fingerprint looks like this they have a

435
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,779
domain where they use a subdomain that

436
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:41,220
is three or four characters typically

437
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,839
corresponding to the application that

438
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:44,820
they've trojanized so let's say if you

439
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,260
have telegram it could be something like

440
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,940
Tel dot a series of random letters.com

441
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,100
those domains are always registered with

442
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,180
enom and the newest variants for the

443
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,639
actual C2 Communications are using only

444
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,040
two ports two zero one two one or two

445
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,139
zero one two two and all of the

446
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:05,820
infrastructure has been hosted by head

447
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,420
Center next slide please

448
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,459
so what do we know so far about who

449
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:13,980
might be behind this this threat in

450
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,940
particular

451
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,920
so I mentioned double agent a little

452
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,420
while ago and again this was a family

453
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,339
that we talked about in a 2020 white

454
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:22,860
paper and one of the bad bizarre samples

455
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,899
that we have actually overlaps with

456
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:26,399
infrastructure during the same time

457
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,980
frame as a double agent sample that we

458
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,380
have so we know that the threat actor

459
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,779
tied to bad Bazaar is likely also uh

460
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:35,760
responsible for at least part of the

461
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,279
distribution of the double agent malware

462
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,680
we've also seen the use of what appears

463
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,720
to be a digital quartermaster for

464
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,720
registering and you know basically

465
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,060
Distributing the C2 infrastructure one

466
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,540
in particular is this email address

467
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,759
gmail.com and they have been tied to

468
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,920
other long-running Chinese surveillance

469
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,500
campaigns in particular those attributed

470
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,560
to apt-15 who we connected the double

471
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,500
agent malware to in 2020. next slide

472
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,480
please

473
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,459
one more slide thank you

474
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,619
so now on to Moonshine

475
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,119
um as I mentioned what we're seeing now

476
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,439
with moonshine are these kind of like

477
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,720
application based uh distributed

478
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,260
versions of the surveillance wear and

479
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,660
how this application works it's quite

480
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,040
interesting early variants they

481
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,780
basically just bundled uh moonshine

482
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,480
within a trojanized app asked for every

483
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,860
permission Under the Sun and sent it out

484
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,660
into the world uh they've gotten

485
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,220
cleverer now because they know that most

486
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,780
people are a little bit wary about you

487
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,400
know a dictionary that asks to be able

488
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,740
to read your call logs so they've

489
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,260
changed things wherein they use uh kind

490
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,760
of like a vulnerability score for a

491
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,220
device so let's say that you get an

492
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,780
application

493
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,580
um you think it's WhatsApp but it's

494
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,020
actually a trojanized version of

495
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,760
WhatsApp with moonshine and because

496
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,620
WhatsApp asks for a number of different

497
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,059
legitimate permissions that it needs to

498
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:55,440
let you interact with the application

499
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,140
you grant it permission to your your

500
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,140
photos your videos your contacts you

501
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,200
know basically everything under the sun

502
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,820
uh what moonshine does is it goes

503
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,900
through and it looks at all of the

504
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,340
permissions that you have granted and

505
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,020
based on the permissions that has it has

506
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,299
access to it creates a score for your

507
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,820
device sends that score to the C2 and

508
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,340
based on that information the the C2

509
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,140
decides what commands it will send to

510
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,880
your device and what data it will try to

511
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,960
exfiltrate

512
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,660
next slide please

513
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,880
the actual Moon Shine surveillance kit

514
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,620
operates pretty similarly to what we saw

515
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,860
in 2019 from citizen Labs report it uses

516
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,600
a native Library file that used to be

517
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,059
called liverben.so and is now called lib

518
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:38,039
out and this is responsible for

519
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,740
extracting a payload called Scotch and

520
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,260
setting the C2 information that gets

521
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,140
passed to the scotch module then what

522
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,760
Scotch does is it takes the C2

523
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,679
information and downloads at this point

524
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,660
for additional modules initially it was

525
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,340
I believe only two we're at a point

526
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,200
where we have four now and those

527
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,059
additional modules in combination with

528
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:58,620
Scotch all perform the surveillance

529
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,720
capabilities used by the the application

530
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,520
on the device

531
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,559
and all of these details as well as the

532
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,320
C2 information is encrypted and stored

533
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,260
in a file with this file name

534
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,100
exclusively this file name they really

535
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,000
like to reuse it next slide

536
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,679
so you know like any good surveillance

537
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:18,419
where moonshine is quite full featured

538
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:20,700
as well it allows you to do call

539
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,400
recording on the device collect contact

540
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,140
information getting files that are

541
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,600
specified by the C2 accessing photos

542
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,780
accessing specific folders microphone

543
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,340
recording and what's also really

544
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,080
interesting is in one of the most recent

545
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,299
packages or the recent modules that

546
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:37,679
we've seen that we hadn't previously

547
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,539
seen until about October of this year

548
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:42,000
they're now starting to collect WeChat

549
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,940
databases from the device next slide

550
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,320
so where this also gets kind of

551
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,419
interesting is that the infrastructure

552
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:53,580
that's used by the Moonshine moonshine

553
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,380
campaign is very similar again to what

554
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,020
we saw in 2019 uh they have these

555
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,120
administrative panels that presumably if

556
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,500
you could log in would actually collect

557
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,000
all of the device information and

558
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,580
display it to whoever has access and

559
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,860
they all have the same title uh Scotch

560
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,200
admin in 2019 sometimes you'd see a

561
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,480
whiskey admin or a bourbon admin but now

562
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,120
they're sticking with scotch and we were

563
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,559
able to see some victim device

564
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,840
information by a misconfigured API

565
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,960
endpoint at the various c2s that we had

566
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,580
access to you couldn't really see

567
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,140
anything about identifying who these

568
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,760
victims were but you could see an alias

569
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,679
of the device you could see when they

570
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:30,900
were compromised how recently they've

571
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,720
been compromised and the whiskey ID that

572
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,059
was used to basically identify the

573
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:38,460
device so from that we know that there

574
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,220
are over 635 applications or devices

575
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,679
that have been compromised by this

576
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,780
surveillance where next slide please

577
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:50,640
uh in terms of attribution moonshine has

578
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,500
been attributed to the threat actor

579
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,539
group poison Carp from what we've seen

580
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:56,520
on these samples we're pretty certain at

581
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,740
this point that they're a Chinese threat

582
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,260
actor based on a few indicators the

583
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,840
first being that uh within the source

584
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,640
code they do a couple of checks to to

585
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,799
see if you have network connectivity and

586
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,360
the first thing they look for is whether

587
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,820
you can connect to Baidu basically the

588
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,799
the Google of China and the second thing

589
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,000
they do is try and connect it to a

590
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,919
Chinese IP address so this wouldn't

591
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:18,720
necessarily be definitive for us to say

592
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,860
for certain that these are Chinese

593
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,500
threat actors but then we were able to

594
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,200
access API documentation for their

595
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,059
administrative web app and all of this

596
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:29,100
is written in simplified Chinese

597
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,140
the fingerprint for this infrastructure

598
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,200
again is pretty consistent they're using

599
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,900
free ddns services to host their domains

600
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,780
uh all of the infrastructure is hosted

601
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,059
in Singapore and most are hosted by

602
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:43,679
hostinger International

603
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,460
next slide please

604
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,960
one more slide thank you so what do we

605
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,640
know about threat actors tied to all of

606
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,020
these various uyghur surveillance

607
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,220
campaigns

608
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,020
um I think all of us know in this room

609
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,720
attribution is really hard so we do know

610
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,460
a few things about some of the companies

611
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,020
that have been tied to some of the

612
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,400
previous malware families that we've

613
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,380
encountered and I'm just referencing

614
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,760
this slide because I think it's a handy

615
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,860
way of understanding the convention for

616
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,080
for naming Chinese businesses so

617
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,280
basically how it works is you have your

618
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,960
registered location you have a chosen

619
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,880
name you have what the company does and

620
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,159
the company type and this first example

621
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:18,299
is the company we're going to talk about

622
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:20,460
Beijing best United Technology Company

623
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:24,059
Limited next slide please

624
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:26,039
so this company was attributed to

625
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:29,340
plug-in Phantom by meta and it's a

626
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,900
really interesting company in that it is

627
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,299
very small they only have three insured

628
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:35,760
employees and they're also quite proud

629
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,100
of their connections to various

630
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,159
surveillance of of the xinjiang region

631
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,620
in particular in China they regularly

632
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,120
post contracts that they've won

633
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,880
especially for forensics tools that are

634
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,500
used by the xinjiang prosecutor's office

635
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,260
and they even have a particular page on

636
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,820
their site that details what the

637
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,460
surveillance wear does so they are an

638
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,340
ocent researchers dream next slide

639
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,140
please

640
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,299
the next company we know about uh was

641
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,980
tied to Golden Eagle and again this is

642
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,900
an older family from our 2020 white

643
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,980
paper

644
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,679
and this this company is actually a

645
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:12,720
large defense contractor based in Xi'an

646
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,480
that we were able to connect to this

647
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,480
malware family based on an open uh admin

648
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,820
panel that contained a bunch of GPS data

649
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,340
for various test devices and all of the

650
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,679
GPS data for these test devices were

651
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,299
kind of concentrated in the Xi'an area

652
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:29,700
and especially in the location for the

653
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,620
Xi'an tienho defense Technology Company

654
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,179
Limited

655
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,640
kind of like best the company that we

656
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,440
just talked about they're quite Keen on

657
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,059
sharing the awards they've won for their

658
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:41,640
contribution to surveillance operations

659
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,640
in xinjiang and their website is also

660
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,679
full of very interesting information

661
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:49,260
next slide please

662
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,580
and then finally we have one other

663
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,260
company that has been tied to this

664
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,080
Golden Eagle family in the same area

665
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,360
they're also in Xi'an and they're called

666
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,100
astronomical Point Network Technology

667
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,799
Company and we were able to connect them

668
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,659
to Golden Eagle because they actually

669
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:05,340
registered a couple of the domains that

670
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,580
were used for c2s if you look at the

671
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,200
image here at the very very top of the

672
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,299
screenshot that is their name and pinion

673
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:15,840
as well as a variation of their of their

674
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,760
address and they're actually just

675
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,320
located down the road from the defense

676
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,080
contractor and they also have employees

677
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,360
that are quite Keen to share screenshots

678
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,039
of the work they've done on surveillance

679
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,380
tooling while working at the company

680
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,120
what I think makes this company really

681
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,200
interesting and something that's worth

682
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,880
noting is that while they don't

683
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,580
necessarily share as much content on

684
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,080
their website or you know talk about the

685
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,700
contracts they've won they have

686
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,100
published a few tools that they um that

687
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,299
they describe as kind of software

688
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:44,820
developments and Innovation and one of

689
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,440
them is called a minority language

690
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,659
intelligent recognition and translation

691
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:51,000
system and I think this is noteworthy

692
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,220
because in kind of the early days of

693
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,500
smartphone use in xinjiang it was pretty

694
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,900
common for uyghurs to share voice memos

695
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,179
and other audio or video recordings

696
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:01,740
rather than typing in uyghur because

697
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,120
there wasn't a lot of support for the

698
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,039
script and it was also a good way to

699
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,960
kind of circumvent the government's

700
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,360
censorship laws and so having a service

701
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,799
like this that would you know allow you

702
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,960
to detect certain languages of minority

703
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,840
groups uh was pretty instrumental in in

704
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,159
changing the ways that the government

705
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:19,320
implemented censorship laws in the

706
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,679
region next slide please

707
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:24,779
one more time thank you so where does

708
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:26,159
this leave us now what are we seeing

709
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,500
with these newer campaigns uh we're

710
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,120
seeing a few things the the first being

711
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,760
that again for lack of a better word um

712
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,559
these campaigns and the malware that are

713
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,820
connected to them seem to be a bit more

714
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,320
sophisticated than what we've seen

715
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,020
previously sometimes we'll come across

716
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,000
mobile surveillance where that is not

717
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,860
really operational they haven't kept a

718
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,380
lot of the the real functionality of the

719
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,700
application they're pretending to be

720
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,679
intact so you'll load something on your

721
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,059
device it won't really do much or it'll

722
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:52,620
say sorry your phone's too old we need

723
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,659
to uninstall this and it's pretty clear

724
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:55,559
at that point that you've been

725
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,299
compromised so we're not really seeing

726
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:58,919
that here we're seeing fully functional

727
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:01,140
tools uh you know real working

728
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,820
dictionaries real versions of telegram

729
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,039
or Whatsapp that have been modified to

730
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,500
download the surveillance Ware we're

731
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,760
also seeing these extensive social

732
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,980
engineering campaigns with people uh

733
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,360
representing the threat actors who are

734
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,679
very entrenched in these communities and

735
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,240
gaining trust and then pretty

736
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,799
effectively sharing the applications

737
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,100
that that are this malicious content so

738
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,200
there's one case where you know somebody

739
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,299
shares a mapping application that has

740
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:26,039
bad Bazaar in it and the person replies

741
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,600
and says oh thanks so much but you know

742
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,760
what uh for some reason I it's not

743
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,900
loading on my phone can you send me

744
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,279
something else and the person sends

745
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:34,080
three other different applications that

746
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,580
are all bad Bazaar

747
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,779
um so there has been a lot of trust

748
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:38,640
that's been gained by you know basically

749
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,620
infiltrating these communities for

750
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,779
longer periods of time and then we're

751
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:43,679
just seeing better secured

752
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,600
infrastructure with the exception of you

753
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,919
know that endpoint we were able to

754
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:48,480
access the infrastructure that we've

755
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,279
seen for bad Bazaar and moonshine is is

756
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:52,200
quite well secured

757
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,840
what we pretty much expect at this point

758
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,299
to see in the future is the level of

759
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:58,980
sophistication around these campaigns to

760
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,120
grow

761
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,580
um especially you know with a lot of

762
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,740
international pressure around the issue

763
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,980
of weyer surveillance in xinjiang and uh

764
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,380
the software vulnerability disclosure

765
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,480
law uh which you know has already led to

766
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,760
the use of more zero Days by the state

767
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,440
we anticipate that we're going to be

768
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,179
seeing progressively more sophisticated

769
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:19,880
campaigns targeting these populations

770
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,860
next slide please

771
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,299
so I just want to leave us with this

772
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:25,620
quote this is a quote from a really

773
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,480
phenomenal book called in the camps by

774
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,760
Darren Byler and it's something that

775
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,080
kind of struck me while I've been

776
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,900
working on this research for roughly a

777
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,039
year

778
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,080
um and I it's sort of a nice reminder

779
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,120
about the work that we're doing having a

780
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,720
real impact on people and uh

781
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,580
just leave that with you next slide

782
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,760
please

783
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:49,380
I also want to give a huge shout out to

784
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,480
a number of researchers who are either

785
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,520
still at Lookout or have left and moved

786
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,100
elsewhere who are part of the research

787
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,500
across you know the various campaigns

788
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,659
that we've investigated as well as some

789
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:01,980
of the research into moonshine and bad

790
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,000
Bazaar

791
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,760
next slide please

792
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,799
and I'm going to share these slides on

793
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:12,419
Twitter or Mastodon um wherever so if

794
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:13,860
anybody is interested in learning more

795
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,140
about the various disclosures uh one

796
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,520
more slide please

797
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,500
as well as a bunch of references to some

798
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,940
of the the things that I've talked about

799
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,220
please take a look at those one more

800
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,419
slide

801
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:26,400
and for anyone interested in learning

802
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,919
more about this these issues I highly

803
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:31,140
recommend these books as well as a few

804
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,279
links here that can kind of give you

805
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:33,779
some insight into what's happening in

806
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:37,460
the region thank you so much

807
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,440
uh so question for you when it comes to

808
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,900
the religious aspect of the uyghurs who

809
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,860
are being

810
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,779
um detained and everything what's the

811
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:47,700
dip what's the reason behind that

812
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,020
because I was looking up and everything

813
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,760
at much of the religions that they

814
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,320
participate in are more peaceful

815
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,600
religions so it was just didn't totally

816
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,600
make sense why they were doing that

817
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,200
so um I'm not a scholar on this issue I

818
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,460
think there's probably much more than

819
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,200
what I can explain

820
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,500
um but from my understanding the the

821
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,080
rationale that's been given for the the

822
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,700
religious minorities that have been kind

823
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,620
of rounded up and sent off to these

824
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,640
camps

825
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,400
um has been tied to

826
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,940
mostly Muslims that um aren't themselves

827
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,740
actually extremists or involved in

828
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,020
political activism but because of you

829
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,960
know the climate Post 9 11

830
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,940
there has just been this

831
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,980
kind of in

832
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,740
surgents of islamophobia in the region

833
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,500
and because the majority of people

834
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,260
living in xinjiang who are part of these

835
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,120
ethnic minority groups are practicing

836
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,760
Muslims or at least their their culture

837
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,419
is closely tied to Islam it's um

838
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:51,539
that's I think sort of why the the CCP

839
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,179
has particularly cracked down on this on

840
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:56,220
this region or sorry on on this

841
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,480
population

842
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,760
um and then also because kind of in the

843
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,700
early days of of the CCP trying to exert

844
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,399
their control over xinjiang and you know

845
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:07,559
perhaps ensure that they had control

846
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:09,799
over the resources that were being

847
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:13,200
extracted from the region uh there were

848
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,700
a fair number of political

849
00:30:17,179 --> 00:30:19,799
another word there were some terrorist

850
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:21,480
attacks and so a lot of that has been

851
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,399
used as a justification for these camps

852
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:26,279
that answers your question

853
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:29,520
all right one more over here

854
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,140
thank you

855
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,840
um I just had a brief question I think

856
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,559
um

857
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,179
when you mentioned the trojanized

858
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:38,039
applications did you see any

859
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,779
applications that they were trojanized

860
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:42,179
that maybe of interest to the users that

861
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:45,919
prayer applications or applications

862
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,419
their native language

863
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:50,100
oh yes

864
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,440
um the vast majority I should say so

865
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,419
there are um you know a lot of popular

866
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:55,980
third-party tools that have been

867
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,500
trojanized but the bulk of what we see

868
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,840
are either weaker language dictionaries

869
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,059
prayer applications

870
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:04,860
um sometimes very specific mapping

871
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,440
applications tied to Turkey that are all

872
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,659
written in uyghur and those have been

873
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,460
extensively trojanized and redistributed

874
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,159
with the malware

875
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,020
all right thank you very much thank you
