back you can get an album

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,000
um I'm Adam ronsley I'm a reporter at

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,320
Rolling Stone

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,420
um yes rolling stone does Cyber no I

8
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,480
cannot get you Harry Styles tickets

9
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,440
um so what I'm going to talk to you

10
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,900
today about is an interesting spin on

11
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,580
fish

12
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,340
fishing trying to uh collect

13
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,519
Intelligence on an adversary uh what I

14
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,619
don't see that much of um

15
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:31,199
trying to collect Intelligence on your

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,200
own team and that's what I found here

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,399
um and I'm just going to set the scene

18
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:36,719
for you a little bit

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:37,500
um

20
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,260
Iran has been taking a series of else

21
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,360
for the

22
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,920
um if you look at their encounter

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,120
intelligence

24
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,860
um

25
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,960
uh failures they are many and they are

26
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,940
particularly public

27
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,059
um in I'd say the most uh my profile of

28
00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:00,300
them would be in 2020 obviously we uh

29
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,820
the US assassinated cost and solomoni

30
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,159
U.S assassinated him after being able to

31
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,140
track his movements that's a big No-No

32
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,000
in 2018

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,920
um the Israelis managed to lift a

34
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,900
gigantic Archive of nuclear secrets with

35
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,580
about a hundred thousand documents right

36
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,939
outside their noses in Tehran

37
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,280
um and you've had the assassination of

38
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,920
Mr fakazati who was the uh leader of

39
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,680
their uh nuclear program so what you

40
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,140
basically have is a giant series of

41
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,119
counterintelligence else

42
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,939
um and this is what I would argue

43
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,619
how they've been one of the ways they've

44
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,960
been trying to deal with it

45
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,840
uh so this story starts with a tweet

46
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,180
um and lahav is a reporter at the

47
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,700
Jerusalem Post and one day I got a note

48
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,259
saying hey

49
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,020
um have you seen this it's pretty weird

50
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,780
um and it's uh lahob saying there is a

51
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,600
very transparently fake

52
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,259
um uh website impersonating her

53
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,360
um and a little bit of confirmation bias

54
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,860
on my part I pay attention to a lot of

55
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,600
Iranian influence operations so my

56
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,399
assumption at this point was that it was

57
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:06,659
going to be

58
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:07,920
another

59
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,538
um you know influence operation where

60
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,520
they'd created a fake Jerusalem Post

61
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,900
website they were going to host a fake

62
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,000
story everybody would have a laugh it

63
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,020
would be over next slide

64
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,780
uh oh boy

65
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,860
um there we go

66
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,260
um but what I found when I looked at it

67
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,120
um was that it was connected to a couple

68
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,800
of sites there was also a fake College

69
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,220
times but um what I decided to do was a

70
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,260
little bit of infrastructure profiling

71
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,580
um which I'm sure everybody in this

72
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,020
audience who's technical

73
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,840
um can school me on but um for the

74
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,060
non-technical dummies like me uh at home

75
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,760
uh what it basically is is I guess the

76
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,319
way I would explain it is you know you

77
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,940
can put a website together like you can

78
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,640
put an outfit together I'm basic so I've

79
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,560
got a J crew jacket on

80
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,959
um I've got a J crew shirt I've got uh

81
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,760
Gap jeans millions and millions and

82
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,860
millions of people have each and every

83
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,060
one of these

84
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,580
um uh bits of clothing uh what

85
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,040
infrastructure profiling does is

86
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,959
um you look at okay who's wearing all

87
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,340
this combination and you make that

88
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,560
Haystack smaller and basically what

89
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,440
we're able to do is find a series of

90
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,140
behaviorally related websites

91
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,780
um within this mix because essentially

92
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,000
what they were doing was wearing the you

93
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,459
know website equivalent of a tuxedo with

94
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:24,840
Crocs

95
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,480
um so if you look at that combination of

96
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,140
uh name Silo registrar

97
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,099
I believe Zoho is the mail server uh

98
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,140
Cloud DNS is the name server you get it

99
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,060
down from you know a potential each and

100
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,280
every one of those uh uh you know little

101
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,780
bits of infrastructure have millions of

102
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,879
customers you get it down to a pile of

103
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,640
68. and within the 68

104
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,440
um you see a much smaller pile of

105
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,180
websites and as you can see these all

106
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,159
look like very much fishy kind of

107
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:56,298
websites next slide please

108
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,560
next slide

109
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,340
next slide

110
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,060
um

111
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,340
it's live

112
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,519
um as you can see next slide

113
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,819
these are all fairly fishy and they look

114
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,400
like they're impersonating a a typical

115
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,139
series of targets of what um uh uh next

116
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:20,519
slide

117
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,440
next slide

118
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,120
uh here we go

119
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,759
um you know this doesn't look like

120
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,199
um this information this doesn't look

121
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,120
like you know endless mayfly is one of

122
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,460
their uh influence operations

123
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,979
um and uh they impersonate fake they

124
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:36,540
impersonate websites put up fake stories

125
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,740
stuff like that

126
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,419
um this is a little bit of method acting

127
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:41,520
you don't create fake VPN logins you

128
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,259
don't create fake jira logins for this

129
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:45,840
type of stuff on a phishing website and

130
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,040
I managed to get in touch with some of

131
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,940
the people

132
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,220
um who uh Opera who were the targets of

133
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,259
these things and it very quickly became

134
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,540
clear that this looked at least to my

135
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,180
mind like it was another instance of

136
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,220
what mandiant calls distinguished uh

137
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,160
impersonator which is the Iranians will

138
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,680
use a uh fake website

139
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,940
um and say we want to have an interview

140
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,139
with you

141
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,479
um uh I'm a reporter I'm an academic I'm

142
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,940
a think tanker uh and someone picks up

143
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,100
the phone builds trust with you instead

144
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,540
of like the normal sort of fishing stuff

145
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,979
of just an email

146
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:18,600
um and they try to set up a video

147
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,220
conference with you you end up clicking

148
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,720
on something they own your computer yada

149
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,060
yada so yeah

150
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,800
um next slide please

151
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,580
next slide

152
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,020
um so the way we were able to get a hint

153
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,600
that this was Iranian aside from the you

154
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,039
know Vibes Inc

155
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,300
um was the fact that some of these

156
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,699
domains had overlapped with previously

157
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:40,740
attributed websites um in the

158
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,960
distinguished impersonator uh Activity

159
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,160
Set

160
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,960
um as you can see there uh have been

161
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,340
attributed by certified Community

162
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,320
computer Emergency Response Team in

163
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,440
Farsi uh to app 35

164
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,139
um and lots of uh normal very Iranian

165
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:57,060
targets there next slide

166
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,840
next slide

167
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,740
but this cluster was a little bit

168
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,759
different than the ordinary

169
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,800
distinguished impersonator uh in that a

170
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,680
few months after our story on this ran

171
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,199
um uh Shin Bet came out and said one of

172
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,639
the websites in that cluster the fake

173
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,620
Gatestone Institute

174
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,139
uh had been part of a series of uh

175
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:18,960
websites that weren't just meant to

176
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,960
um you know uh steal your login steal

177
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,819
your emails and steal all your docs but

178
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:26,340
to lure people abroad for kidnap and

179
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,780
kill operations which is a little bit

180
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,580
more serious next slide

181
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,860
next slide

182
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,380
um and so we got a sense that we were on

183
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,120
to something in terms of this sort of

184
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,819
website behavioral uh pattern

185
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,220
um uh from those phishing sites but then

186
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,419
we got into something a little bit more

187
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:45,539
interesting which is uh was

188
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:46,800
um and this was one of the websites that

189
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,139
matches that pattern as you can see

190
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:52,620
um you know uh this is an Arabic version

191
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,000
um and what it's basically saying is

192
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,919
it's presenting itself very heavily as a

193
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,300
massage

194
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,759
saying if you have experience working

195
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,400
for Hezbollah uh working for the Assad

196
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,800
regime intelligence or security we want

197
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,500
to hire you the nice big geocity style

198
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,720
flag in the middle uh leaves very little

199
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,060
doubt we're going to pay you great we'll

200
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,520
help you with Consulting

201
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,080
um and this seemed really weird to me um

202
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,960
so I talked to a few CIA folks

203
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,880
um I was like is this how the massage

204
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,319
does business

205
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,900
um pretty much know the answer and uh

206
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,460
the answer as you might expect was hell

207
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,479
no

208
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,460
this is pretty sloppy

209
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,520
um uh the massage does not ask you to uh

210
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,900
the thought generally speaking doesn't

211
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,699
need to find you this way they'll come

212
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,319
you know if they want you they'll find

213
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,280
you

214
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,319
um and uh generally speaking they also

215
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,560
don't use telegram for operational

216
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,819
Communications as this one directed

217
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:46,139
YouTube

218
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:50,280
um and so I uh I called up that uh uh

219
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,180
that telegram link and uh I found an

220
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,400
interesting logo in there VIP Human

221
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,460
Solutions next slide

222
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,639
the VIP Human Solutions brand shall we

223
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,780
say um

224
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,080
had been used

225
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,199
had been in use since at least 2017.

226
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,479
um and it had been in use across a

227
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,759
series of different websites this one is

228
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,460
uh VIP jobs Global which had its own

229
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,440
Facebook page

230
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,860
um uh this one is catered to Persian

231
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,960
speaking audiences in Iran it's looking

232
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,160
for

233
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,940
um Iranian um intelligence veterans and

234
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,318
making the same pitch next slide

235
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,479
there's uh there's a good example of

236
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,880
what it looks like in Persian saying you

237
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,919
know information uh employees or any

238
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,659
other cyber employees needed next slide

239
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,000
uh next slide

240
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,320
and one of the ways that they get this

241
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,940
website in front of people

242
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,519
um is through the magic of Google ads

243
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,260
um uh one of the things I found while

244
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,700
looking through all these different

245
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,320
websites was

246
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,980
um uh uh Iranians often being shocked

247
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,420
surprised and a little bit horrified

248
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,120
that this was being advertised

249
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,399
um and it would be advertised to them in

250
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,220
a series of you know there's a series of

251
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,660
sort of Behavioral texts that would tend

252
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,279
to show up when people reported these

253
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,300
things because they would tweet out

254
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,920
saying hey I just got this weird ad what

255
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,720
the hell is this about

256
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,920
um and generally speaking when they're

257
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,740
using vpns when they were browsing sort

258
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,540
of foreign news websites like foreign

259
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,640
policy the New York Times when they were

260
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,100
looking for games apps um that kind of

261
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,959
stuff they would get served some of

262
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,660
these websites uh via Google ads

263
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,339
um saying hey uh do you want to make a

264
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:36,660
few bucks are you an intelligence

265
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,760
veteran come talk to

266
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,040
uh next slide

267
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,920
uh and the thing about these websites is

268
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,440
that um and what leads me to even though

269
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,300
the you know the web the evidence

270
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,459
linking these two Iran is is pretty much

271
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:51,959
behavioral at this point but what's

272
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,480
interesting is that the Iranian

273
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,740
government is well aware of these

274
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,260
websites and um for those who have spent

275
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,580
more than a minute paying attention to

276
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,500
how the internet works in Iran

277
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,420
um it's very filtered

278
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,580
um and you can't just go to any website

279
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,720
you like

280
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,399
um and yet the Iranian government is

281
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,959
very well aware of these websites how do

282
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,040
we know they're well aware of these

283
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,600
websites because they keep telling

284
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,160
people about them Sharif University

285
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,959
which is one of the uh technically

286
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:18,600
inclined universities in Iran has a web

287
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,980
page saying hey these things are going

288
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,019
around be careful

289
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:25,380
um uh news outlets have said uh uh hey

290
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,779
this is you know uh this is the Mossad

291
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:30,060
trying to recruit you be careful

292
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,440
um this gentleman here

293
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,560
um appeared after my story ran um in a

294
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,279
young journalist Club video segment

295
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,560
he claims to have been arrested while

296
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,660
responding to one of these websites

297
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,440
um

298
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,660
I'm not sure how reliable

299
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,959
um uh his testimony is one thing I can

300
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,519
tell you is that you know as I was going

301
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,380
through all these websites again you

302
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,459
know this is not how I'm going to start

303
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:55,200
those business to someone like me and I

304
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,579
would assume to another intelligence

305
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:57,899
veteran

306
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:00,540
um or to to an intelligence veteran

307
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,519
um uh that this would be transparently

308
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,540
you know fake and and silly but

309
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,800
um you know I didn't include these in

310
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,060
the slides because I don't want to add

311
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,339
insult to injury but uh a lot of these

312
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,440
websites had YouTube Pages social media

313
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,839
pages and you would be surprised at how

314
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,700
many people responded in the comments of

315
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,560
that saying hey I sent you a resume can

316
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,600
you get in touch with me hey um you know

317
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,279
what does this pay this type of stuff

318
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,320
and I I asked a lot of my uh Iranian

319
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,300
American friends and they said that um

320
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,880
you know Visa fraud is fairly common a

321
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,140
lot of people

322
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,420
um uh want to leave

323
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,700
um and if you dangle a carrot large

324
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,320
enough a lot of people will take it up

325
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,899
this guy claims to have been

326
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,560
um recruited through it uh I prisoner

327
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,060
testimonies um especially in

328
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,440
authoritarian countries I wouldn't

329
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,720
necessarily take face value

330
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,160
um as you can see he's got a pretty big

331
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,339
neck tattoo that says revenge in Farsi

332
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:54,899
um I'm not sure what the irgc tattoo

333
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,360
regs are I know in the U.S this would be

334
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,760
a little bit verboten so

335
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,440
um I can't really comment on the

336
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,200
underlying validity of

337
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,360
um uh his testimony but what I think

338
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,760
this episode does tell us a little bit

339
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,980
about is that the Iranian government is

340
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,019
very well aware of these websites wants

341
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:14,880
people to know about these websites and

342
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,519
is not cracking down on these websites

343
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,899
um and we can tell they're not cracking

344
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:22,279
down because next slide

345
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,079
they're still being advertised um you

346
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:26,279
can see

347
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,800
um uh that's the Waze if one with the

348
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,899
logo they still all use the same logo

349
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:33,420
they still use a lot of the same

350
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,860
branding and the thing is they're very

351
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,740
much interconnected next slide

352
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,140
I made a handy little spaghetti Matrix

353
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,019
in in true cyber War can uh cyber work

354
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:45,899
Con uh Charlie It's Always Sunny fashion

355
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,839
um but this is um a few of the websites

356
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:50,579
that I found and you can see there's a

357
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:52,560
lot of overlap between the uh phone

358
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,240
numbers that they provided and the

359
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,320
telegram

360
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,380
um uh accounts that they provided they

361
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,260
also uh about half of them were on one

362
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,940
Google analytics account that looks like

363
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,440
it was just copied from an Israeli

364
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,760
website

365
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,700
um another uh cluster of them I think

366
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,560
the bottom cluster there

367
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,240
um next slide

368
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,160
yeah there we go

369
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,320
um and so it's very clear that and you

370
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,620
know it's a mix it's a mixture of uh uh

371
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,200
Iranian or excuse me Persian and Arabic

372
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,880
language ones you know going after Assad

373
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,040
raising folks going after uh Hezbollah

374
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,360
Military Intelligence folks and going

375
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,860
after Iranian folks and they're all

376
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,019
using you know sort of the shared same

377
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,279
share infrastructure next slide

378
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,779
um

379
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:39,120
and yeah here you can see people

380
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,639
um uh saying what the hell is

381
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:44,420
next slide

382
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,700
uh next slide

383
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,220
uh next slide

384
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,920
uh and so I decided to do the Dopey

385
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,120
reporter thing

386
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,060
um I made a fake uh resume

387
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,980
um I put a canary token in it and I sent

388
00:13:58,980 --> 00:13:59,940
it to him

389
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,339
um they are at least smart enough not to

390
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:04,440
have either opened it or have opened it

391
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,339
on something that wasn't Internet

392
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:06,540
connected because you never got to come

393
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,420
back from that after my story ran

394
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,000
um I decided to you know take off my hat

395
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,980
and say okay

396
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,380
um who the hell are you

397
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,139
um and as you can see in the last bit um

398
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:21,420
I want that on my Tombstone uh I have an

399
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,820
after writing

400
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,860
next slide

401
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,540
uh and they're still at it as you can

402
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,060
see here uh the newest Incarnation is

403
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,300
Optima HR this this came up after

404
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,019
um

405
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:36,899

journalist Club

409
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,160
um uh News segment and the thing to

410
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,360
remember about that new segment is

411
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,920
there's not a lot of Independent Media

412
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,600
in Iran and young journalist Club is

413
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,279
very much state news so that's very much

414
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,779
the Iranian government saying hey

415
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:54,060
everyone pay attention to this

416
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,779
next slide

417
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,279
yeah these are these are something we're

418
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,000

424
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,440
uh this one's my favorite

425
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,420
um so in addition to the sort of boring

426
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,100
hey do you want a consulting job we'll

427
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,240
give you lots of money and give you a

428
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,000
job in Israel uh they also created a

429
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,920
fake Film Studio

430
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,260
um and I'm sure all of you are familiar

431
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,639
with the um uh uh uh TV show on Apple

432
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,220
Turin

433
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:37,079
and so what they did was as I was going

434
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:39,360
through some of the uh Google analytics

435
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,300
hits on these fake jobs websites I came

436
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,260
across hatcast

437
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,040
next slide

438
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,620
well that's what hatcast is

439
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,959
um the ruse here it's

440
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:53,339
using the same infrastructure as the

441
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:57,300
fake job sites we are a network uh we

442
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,180
are a film studio we're casting you know

443
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,480
um for uh spy Thrillers and around

444
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,339
um and wouldn't we love it if all of you

445
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,019
and there's a it's not just in English

446
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:08,100
there's a person speaking version

447
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,779
wouldn't we love it if all of you

448
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:11,639
Persian speaking Iranian intelligence

449
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,420
vets would come work for us in Hollywood

450
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,740
and be Consultants on our film because

451
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,420
apparently there's just huge demand for

452
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,040
them

453
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,220
um and I was like why Tran

454
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,920
like a movie studio what's the hook here

455
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,779
next slide

456
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,279
uh as you can see they're they're

457
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,139
they're advertising them by Google ads

458
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:33,060
as well next slide

459
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,160
I was like why are they advertising like

460
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,320
what's the fixation with Terran I

461
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,959
started getting into it um and the one

462
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,759
thing I've learned from reporting on

463
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,459
authoritarian countries is

464
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:46,440
um as ridiculous as the propaganda

465
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,199
believes a lot or a lot of ridiculous as

466
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,000
the propaganda is a lot of people

467
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,360
believe and get high on their own Supply

468
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,579
um and the Iranian uh intelligence

469
00:16:56,579 --> 00:17:00,060
apparatus is very much convinced that

470
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,839
Tehran the TV show is Asian bedblock

471
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,819
um and how do we know about that

472
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,400
um uh that's

473
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,679
um that's a fake name uh the guy on the

474
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:13,319
right there uh is uh I don't know if he

475
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,880
actually exists or if he's just that's

476
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,520
just a fetching uh uh picture of

477
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,520
it but um a few years ago

478
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,660
um the uh Shin Bet arrested four Israeli

479
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,540
women of Iranian extraction who had been

480
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,220
working for this irgc intelligence

481
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,020
officer Persona

482
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,760
um and what they had

483
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,620
um what this guy had uh these women

484
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,539
doing is you know trying to take

485
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:38,039
pictures of the American Consulate in

486
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,600
Israel

487
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,700
um trying to take pictures of the

488
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,380
ministry of Defense

489
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,539
um trying to wean their way into members

490
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,880
of the knesset get their kids in IDF

491
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,840
intelligence jobs and also

492
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,640
um audition for bit roles in uh Turan

493
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,460
and spy on its

494
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,240
um uh filming in Athens so you know it's

495
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,460
very clear that they've you know devoted

496
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,039
a valuable intelligence asset

497
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:10,980
um to spying on this TV show

498
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,720
um and so from that I think it's a fair

499
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,120
assumption to say that may have informed

500
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,160
why they used film studios as a Lord for

501
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,320
this next slide

502
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,700
that's my dog Bruce do you have any

503
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,880
questions

504
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:27,250
[Applause]

505
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,240
I mean morbid curiosity is the only

506
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,440
thing that gets me out of bed in the

507
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,940
morning so

508
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,640
um yeah I mean like I I don't yeah it

509
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,440
seems like I originally thought this was

510
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,120
going to come back as the umpteenth

511
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,120
boring Iranian influence operation

512
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,860
um website with one fake article that

513
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,600
nobody believed

514
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,380
um and they're still at it

515
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,950
is

516
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,039
[Music]

517
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:14,460
[Music]

518
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,039
um I'm I'm willing to say uh you know

519
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,840
based on vibezint

520
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,760
um that this is probably the Iranian

521
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,660
government

522
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:26,220
um uh anything more narrow than that

523
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,020
maybe irgc intelligence just because

524
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,400
they tend to be fairly active in this

525
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,640
stuff but I I would hesitate to make a

526
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,260
guess in in full of a room full of

527
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,340
people that know way more about this

528
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,860
than us

529
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:41,000
it seems odd to me

530
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,200
[Music]

531
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,600
and then say nuclear scientists

532
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,700
so is this really about

533
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,340
responding to those counterintelligence

534
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,740
just about some you know

535
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,600
little natural

536
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,959
grocery

537
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,559
[Music]

538
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,179
that's a very good question and so I

539
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:16,740
would say you know there's a number of

540
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,000
possibilities of what this could be

541
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,160
serving as like number one um obviously

542
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,720
like trying to arrest people you know

543
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,919
have this be your one-way ticket to

544
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:24,480
Heaven prison

545
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,340
um number two could just be you know

546
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,020
maybe they are into trying to sensitize

547
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,179
the population to um you know

548
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:32,280
counterintelligence threats but as

549
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,400
clumsy as it is and if I'm allowed to

550
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,860
minorly curse um ronsley's rule uh that

551
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,900
I've used for analysis uh over and over

552
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,980
again is um

553
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,200
um and as whatever the smart thing you

554
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,140
think uh would be I have constantly been

555
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:53,299
humbled by people doing dumb [ __ ]

556
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,678
thanks very much Adam
