1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,879
thank you Olga thank you everybody it is

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,680
great and kind of weird to be in a room

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,960
with so many people again

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,340
um particularly having such a tough act

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,920
to follow uh Ben Nemo for those of you

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,480
who don't know me I haven't learned yet

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,219
not to slap my chest when I'm wearing a

8
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,859
mic so apologies if you just went there

9
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,240
um I am the global lead for threat

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,279
intelligence at meta

11
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,080
um formerly from the ocean Community my

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,939
background is in exposing influence

13
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,980
operations and now I'm at meta and we

14
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,779
kind of work on all kinds of weird stuff

15
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,760
on the internet which which still hasn't

16
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,019
gone away

17
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,120
and good morning I'm Eric Hutchins I'm a

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,860
security engineer investigator on our

19
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,020
influence operations team at Meadow and

20
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,700
like then it's a delight to be here to

21
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,860
see all of you in person and connect

22
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,239
with some old friends and make some new

23
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,079
ones

24
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,120
and to share the stage with so many

25
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,379
other great presenters so thank you to

26
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,719
the Cyber work on uh for inviting us

27
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,500
here

28
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,200
our team on at meta has a responsibility

29
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,420
for a number of online harm types not

30
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,579
only covert influence operations but

31
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,820
also Espionage scams and brigading and

32
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,039
many many other types our responsibility

33
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,440
is to detect disrupt and expose these

34
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,739
operations

35
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,720
now when the team started this work the

36
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,280
first job was obvious just to understand

37
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,659
what was going on and what the Bad

38
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,580
actors were doing so it was really about

39
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,920
analyze break them down and then take

40
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,140
them down and we started off working in

41
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,939
these lots of different areas

42
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:22,560
um but what we saw increasingly was

43
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,299
there were the more we understood these

44
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:25,500
threat actors the more there were

45
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,360
commonalities between them there would

46
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,619
be commonalities between different

47
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,840
operations of the same type but there

48
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,340
would also be common analysis between

49
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,979
very very different operations and so

50
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,079
over the last 18 months what we've been

51
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,820
doing is we've come up with a framework

52
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,220
that really allows us to break down and

53
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,159
tabulate analyze those commonalities

54
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,960
across all type all the different types

55
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,659
of operation that we deal with

56
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,340
so it's our pleasure today to present

57
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,540
this framework that we're using in

58
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,579
method to analyze these operations

59
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,380
next chart please

60
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,200
so those who know me might know that I

61
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,640
am a sucker for a good analytical

62
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,939
framework this morning when Jen used

63
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,259
really kicked us off and was talking

64
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,380
about 2007. one I was angry to realize

65
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,199
that was 15 years ago but two that is

66
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,879
coincidentally the time frame which my

67
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,620
colleagues at Lockheed Martin and I were

68
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,300
first generating the ideas around the

69
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,400
intrusion kill chain it was through that

70
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,860
collaboration uh at the time of the Air

71
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,840
Force that sparked the ideas and The

72
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,480
Crucible of the APT era uh for how to

73
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,760
think differently about these compromise

74
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,459
and so one I am the the Twitter handle

75
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,560
kill chain but I'm also on Mastodon so

76
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,000
you can follow me there too where I'm

77
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,040
doing most of my commenting today

78
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,020
uh so after 19 years the infosec world

79
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,099
and getting a chance to work with so

80
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,360
many brilliant people I made the switch

81
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,099
to thinking I'm doing something totally

82
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,500
different in IO but you know the more

83
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,940
things change the more they stay the

84
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,180
same and uh in that fashion as well the

85
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,319
chance to work with so many billion

86
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,640
people many are in the audience today

87
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,040
and here on stage with me as well

88
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,080
thank you um and yeah so so my

89
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,280
background is I come from the open

90
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,480
source World

91
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,980
um my main specialty was always

92
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,379
analyzing influence operations I moved

93
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:04,319
to meta just under two years ago

94
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,300
um and one of the fascinating things of

95
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,760
being an i o nerd was talking with all

96
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,900
the different colleagues many of whom

97
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,760
are here I'm sorry I can't shout you all

98
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,260
out but I'm a little short-sighted so I

99
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,940
can't actually see you

100
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:15,959
um but it was talking with the

101
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,580
colleagues and saying wait what your bad

102
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,860
guys do the same thing and this kept on

103
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,239
happening in more and more areas right

104
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,019
Espionage uh fraud scams brigading we

105
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:26,099
were all seeing the same kind of things

106
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:28,200
and so about a year and a half ago we

107
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,519
started saying right we should be able

108
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,739
to tabulize tabulate this right break

109
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:33,840
them down and take him down and so we

110
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,599
started working on a kill chain

111
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,060
um Hutch joined us and you know the guy

112
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,080
who got there first on the Twitter

113
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,540
handle I am not jealous at all

114
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,920
um but we started building up a kill

115
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,080
chain to allow us to to analyze all

116
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,180
these different operations and we and

117
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,879
it's been fascinating to learn from so

118
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,680
many experts in so many different fields

119
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,260
and think we really are all seeing the

120
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,700
same behaviors time and again here so

121
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,700
first off huge thanks to all the experts

122
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,440
here who've actually made this possible

123
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,080
next slide please we also have thanks to

124
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,580
a gentleman who can't be here today

125
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,780
because you've been dead for a thousand

126
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,180
years called William the Conqueror and

127
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,920
we will be illustrating the kill chain

128
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,540
with the help of William the Conqueror

129
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,220
and the Bayer tapestry because I used to

130
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,780
be a medievalist and some things you

131
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,100
just can't quite shake off

132
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,699
next slides

133
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,160
so why are we actually here why are we

134
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,199
talking we all know largely thanks to

135
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,580
Hutch there are many Kill chains out

136
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,780
there there are many ways to understand

137
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,240
and analyze cyber intrusion right it's

138
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,919
kill chain miter attack Diamond model

139
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:36,960
pyramid of pain same thing's happening

140
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,340
in the i o space there are different

141
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,660
kill chains out there there are

142
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,000
Frameworks like Amit and Rich data there

143
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,380
are kill chains out there for scams and

144
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,900
frauds and account takeovers what we

145
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,020
don't have as Olga said is one chain to

146
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,360
rule them all we don't have one

147
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,520
intellectual framework which is designed

148
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,580
in the first instance to describe

149
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,979
analyze and break down all those

150
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:01,680
different sorts of operation equally and

151
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,540
so what we've been working on for the

152
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,460
last 18 months is that one chain to bind

153
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,840
them all I will not quote too much

154
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,040
Tolkien because then I'll be going on

155
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,380
forever but it is that idea of having

156
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,780
one kill chain which we can apply

157
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,639
equally to lots of different operations

158
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,979
and therefore compare them speaking the

159
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:18,960
same language and breaking us all out of

160
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,320
silos

161
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,539
the big part of that challenge that the

162
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:26,280
operations that we see are very improved

163
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,139
we might align ourselves into particular

164
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:30,600
teams of focusing on Espionage versus IO

165
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,940
the actors in the course don't adhere to

166
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,820
our terms of the rules right so a great

167
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,800
example here of a blended operation is

168
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,660
the Ghost Rider campaign an operation

169
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,820
that uses both account takeovers and

170
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,100
compromises but once those accounts are

171
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,199
compromised use them to conduct an

172
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,520
influence operation

173
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,620
and so a classic intrusion kill chain

174
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,479
might describe part of the corporation

175
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:52,979
but might miss some of the aspects of

176
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,340
the other department

177
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,120
s

178
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,400
and taking away compromises all together

179
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,259
and talking about authentic accounts

180
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:02,960
another aspect that we deal with

181
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,880
significantly and here we can think of

182
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,340
the the operation VV which was an

183
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,759
extremist anti-vaccination group based

184
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,699
in Italy France we took them down last

185
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:16,740
year and so they coupled two different

186
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,960
Farm types the first was print gaming so

187
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,699
they were coordinating coordinating on

188
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,400
Telegram and and organizing these Mass

189
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,680
online harassments they were also

190
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,360
training people on how to disrupt things

191
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,300
like vaccination scheduling systems

192
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,340
these accounts were also then using

193
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,740
spreading harmful helpless information

194
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,620
and so again we have two different arm

195
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,419
types that we would deal with no

196
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,639
compromises here whatsoever but another

197
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,560
example one in types of adversaries

198
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,860
next slide please

199
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,960
so we design the online operations kill

200
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,539
chain to bridge that Gap we've designed

201
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,940
it for any kind of operation where if

202
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,440
you like there's a human at both ends of

203
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,660
the chain there's an actor who is trying

204
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,280
to achieve an effect and there is some

205
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,360
kind of human being that they are

206
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,860
targeting

207
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,720
um and so we've designed it as widely as

208
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,280
possible right we can use it for we can

209
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,720
use it for Espionage particularly in

210
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,460
sort of the the spear fishing and social

211
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,740
engineering side influence operations

212
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,500
brigading Nigerian scams right the good

213
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,300
old-fashioned email scam we have

214
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,380
designed a kill chain that it would

215
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,020
actually be applicable to that as well

216
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,560
we use it at meta to systematize and

217
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,479
analyze our understanding and compare it

218
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:28,740
across all the different teams we have

219
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,440
dealing with different arms but because

220
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,940
we both believe in open source that's

221
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,800
where we come from is where our hearts

222
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,539
are we've designed it with the open

223
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,759
source community in mind and as we're

224
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,740
talking through the examples everything

225
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,419
we're quoting today is stuff that has

226
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:44,699
been reported by open source and it is

227
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,099
amazing and again shout out to everybody

228
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,259
here it's amazing how much stuff you can

229
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:51,660
actually see through open source and

230
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,400
we're trying to leverage that in the

231
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,620
kill chain to be able to describe all

232
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,000
the different steps that an actor will

233
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,139
go through

234
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,680
it is inspired by by Hutch as we all are

235
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,720
um and it's based on the principle that

236
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,099
fundamentally if you're running an

237
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:07,139
online operation doesn't matter what

238
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:08,400
you're planning to do with it some

239
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,199
commonalities are going to apply like

240
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,840
you need to be able to get online if

241
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,979
you're going to be operating on social

242
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:15,900
media you probably need social media

243
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,699
accounts if you're smart you're probably

244
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:19,199
going to disguise them

245
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,000
regardless of what you're then planning

246
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,259
to do with them

247
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:24,120
there are going to be commonalities that

248
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,319
we can see detect share describe deal

249
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,479
with and so that is the basis of this

250
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,620
approach it's looking for those common

251
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,059
analysis and trying to make them into a

252
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,799
single framework

253
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,320
next slide please

254
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,059
[Music]

255
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,620
and so how we use the kill chain is the

256
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,360
same you know mindset that we've always

257
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,120
had first and foremost it's a way to

258
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,220
organize your analysis to break down an

259
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,220
operation into a sequence of phases

260
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,420
identify detection opportunities and

261
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,220
disruption opportunities early as

262
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,180
possible

263
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,860
second we can use it to compare multiple

264
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,720
applications we can take an adversary

265
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,040
look at them over time and see how

266
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,600
they've changed see their TTP shifts

267
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,760
over time we can take two operations of

268
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,200
completely different harm types and find

269
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,000
those commonalities and realize that

270
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,560
they can prioritize investment

271
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,720
disruptions and capabilities because it

272
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,180
covers all of these operations and third

273
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,160
I've been just pointing out the power of

274
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,600
the element we share

275
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,779
looking back on what really took the

276
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:21,120
intrusion cyber kill chain from just an

277
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,519
idea into this incredible thing Beyond

278
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,620
anybody's imagination was that it was

279
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,899
used as a community to share and I think

280
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,160
that's the really important thing that

281
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,260
we can across our own teams and as we're

282
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,120
advocating across the community be able

283
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,540
to collaborate

284
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,240
and so allow us to present the 10 phases

285
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,399
of the online operations kill shape or

286
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,800
the double kill

287
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,839
uh we'll get into each of the 10 phases

288
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,000
uh momentarily but I also want to point

289
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,500
out the other premise that That Remains

290
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,760
the Same two other premises everything

291
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,100
the same first we want to be left that's

292
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,839
the idea that the earliest that we can

293
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,459
detect and disrupt an operation the more

294
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:57,899
effective we can have the more friction

295
00:09:57,899 --> 00:09:59,700
we can throw at the adversaries

296
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,040
second as an analyst we want to be

297
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,140
complete as much as possible we want to

298
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,480
identify these uh as many phases of

299
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,360
these of this campaign and bringing that

300
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,880
Defender mindset that anytime these

301
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,740
adversaries are coming online they are

302
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,060
revealing themselves and they are

303
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,220
revealing some of their ttps to the

304
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,720
extent that we can take everything they

305
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,459
reveal and turn it into a countermeasure

306
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:23,279
we are most effective against them

307
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,920
and a brief comment about you know 10

308
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,440
phases and the the size of it I do want

309
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,540
to point out that the majority of the

310
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,339
online operations that we're dealing

311
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:34,980
with are meant to be seen they are not

312
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,140
meant to be hidden and so there's a lot

313
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,060
of emphasis on how these accounts and

314
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,640
operations are set up to be seen

315
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,440
and I also point out that I think these

316
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,640
phases are really important to us

317
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,019
because these are the ones in which we

318
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,120
see the adversaries focusing their time

319
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,800
and their ttps and so that's my workflow

320
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,839
next slide please

321
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:56,399
so we're not going to talk you through

322
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,680
the 10 phases of the kale chain just

323
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,540
describing briefly what you see in each

324
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,640
one all the examples we're going to give

325
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,620
are come from come from uh public

326
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,380
reporting most of it's open source and

327
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,339
if you think at the start we talked

328
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:09,720
about the common analysis right if you

329
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,519
want to do an online operation you've

330
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,959
got to get online there's only a number

331
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,459
of ways you can do that so the kind of

332
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:15,839
things that an operation is going to

333
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,399
need they're going to have to start by

334
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,380
acquiring assets that could be getting

335
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,240
hold of an IP address email addresses

336
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,560
phone numbers it could be if they're

337
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,120
going to be operating on social media

338
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,940
social media accounts

339
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,160
we're applying this to a large range of

340
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,540
operations right so they might be

341
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,760
getting hold of crypto wallets we saw a

342
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,200
wonderful Russian operation earlier this

343
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,459
year where they appear to have bought a

344
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,260
whole lot of bean bag chairs for their

345
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,180
operators to slump on and if you think

346
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,040
our lives are hard imagine being a troll

347
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,200
sitting like this for 12 hours a day on

348
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,579
your phone it's almost like being a

349
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,200
teenager again

350
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,579
um so

351
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:49,200
most of the examples we'll be talking

352
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,899
about are from the i o and and the the

353
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:52,980
intrusion worlds because those are the

354
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,360
ones we know best those are the ones who

355
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,399
are best documented but always please

356
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,260
bear in mind we have tried to design

357
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,240
this to be as widely applicable as

358
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,519
possible and to prove it we are also

359
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,440
going to apply it to not exactly online

360
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,940
operation but but if we can have the

361
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,680
next slide

362
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,899
uh the Norman conquest of England in the

363
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,300
year 1066. believe it or not this is a

364
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,980
really really good template for using

365
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,980
the online operations kill chain uh here

366
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,300
is stage one for example you can see

367
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,459
this is the Norman Army acquiring all

368
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,019
their assets before they're going on

369
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:23,459
board to go and try and find England and

370
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:25,380
invade it so here we have guys with like

371
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,300
suits of armor they've got spheres

372
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,040
they've got helmets and if we can just

373
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,779
click again please

374
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:33,000
they're even bringing a barrel of wine

375
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,100
because they're French

376
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,500
next slide please

377
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,000
and so now you know what it's like to

378
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,180
work with Ben Nema step two uh phase two

379
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,500
of the kill chain is disguising the

380
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,360
assets how they are making them look

381
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,120
real provide that authenticity aspect of

382
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,260
them you know this is a really important

383
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,000
step as I said because these operations

384
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,680
are meant to be seen

385
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,680
how they are masquerading as different

386
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,480
organizations how they're creating their

387
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,360
fake personas a lot of emphasis on this

388
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,700
my first experience my first case of

389
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,220
working in an i o operation we announced

390
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,899
earlier this year was taking down one in

391
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:09,060
Brazil it was individuals associated

392
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,920
with the Brazilian military who are

393
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,079
conducting an environmentally themed

394
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:14,820
information operation the first time

395
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,519
we've encountered that and these

396
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,940
individuals were masquerading as ngos

397
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,959
copying legitimate content from

398
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:24,060
Greenpeace and other environmental

399
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,740
entities

400
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,560
they were also using Gan faces a classic

401
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,899
TTP the very first TTP that Ben taught

402
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:32,639
me and the i o space was how to

403
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,639
recognize a game face this is and we see

404
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,000
across across many harm types is a very

405
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,040
common one still today I do want to

406
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,240
shout out since I know they're both here

407
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,519
to people to give thanks to Louise

408
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:47,040
Alonso for setting up this i o case for

409
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,660
me on the silver platter and Matt

410
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,200
Richard MJR former metamate who's doing

411
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,240
some amazing analysis on detecting the

412
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,800
end faces and we've been following that

413
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,450
with the key interest so thank you both

414
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,599
[Applause]

415
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,920
mixture

416
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,920
and my attempt to be a medievalist so

417
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,959
here's the classic camouflage put on the

418
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:11,880
armor put on the uniform of an adversary

419
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,980
disguise

420
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,360
you go then absolutely right and in fact

421
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,920
if you think about it you know romance

422
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,720
scams today are still doing this pretend

423
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,000
to be a soldier get money off people uh

424
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,040
next slide please

425
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,920
so the next stage in the kill chain is

426
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,839
gathering information this is the Recon

427
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,860
phase

428
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,660
um probably more familiar term we think

429
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,160
about this as anything the operation is

430
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,260
doing to get information about the

431
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,000
environment that it's working in or

432
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,440
about the target the targets that it's

433
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,420
working on and there's a really good

434
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,519
detailed description of this in the

435
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,860
Department of Justice indictment of the

436
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,440
gru operation from 2016. because this is

437
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,940
an area where

438
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,980
almost by definition lots of different

439
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,180
people are going to have lots of little

440
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,160
nuggets of insights it's a very very

441
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,600
large jigsaw and we all have small

442
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,639
puzzle pieces so this is the kind of

443
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,500
archetype of where it's really important

444
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,060
to be able to share what we're seeing to

445
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,920
put together a bigger picture for

446
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,899
example if you look at the um the gru

447
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:05,519
indictment they were searching for their

448
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,139
targets on social media they were then

449
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,360
searching for vulnerabilities in the

450
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,220
servers that they were using

451
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,600
um they were doing a whole range of

452
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,399
search activity to try and pinpoint not

453
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,920
just who but how and where and when lots

454
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,199
of different platforms and so getting

455
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,959
information that Recon phase is probably

456
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,339
I would think the most important where

457
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,139
if we can systematize our sharing and

458
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:26,399
actually talk the same language on what

459
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,260
we're seeing and where that would really

460
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,760
be a benefit to try and understand what

461
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,699
the heck is going on back in 1066 it was

462
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:33,899
a little bit easier right the challenges

463
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,160
were a bit different so if we can see

464
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,959
the next slide

465
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,100
um if you're trying to invade England

466
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,480
the first Challenge from France is

467
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,699
finding England so what do you do you

468
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:43,139
want to research the environment you

469
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:45,180
climb the Mast and you look around this

470
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,980
is what the Normans did back in 1066

471
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,320
full color imagery to prove it next

472
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,240
slide please

473
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,860
step four is the coordination and

474
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,940
planning

475
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,399
in our field in the i o field the first

476
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,720
term I learned is coordinated

477
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,440
inauthentic Behavior key term of art to

478
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,760
describe what we're trying to identify

479
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,920
inauthentic we just described about the

480
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,959
disguise in the assets the coordination

481
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,540
is also key to show the the network that

482
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,300
there exists and so how do these assets

483
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,279
direct and organize themselves

484
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:17,940
uh in the vbe case we had organization

485
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,760
along telegram they were using uh to to

486
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,800
organize and like a

487
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,079
more public to get as many

488
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:27,300
uh first while allies to harass uh

489
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,399
individuals but of course that

490
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:31,139
coordination very much could happen in

491
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:32,880
private off-platform places where we

492
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,740
might not be able to see that and where

493
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,240
we have to might use our imagination to

494
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,519
see what signals might apply what

495
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:40,019
signals might we see I always like to

496
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:41,040
think about what it's like in those

497
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,480
troll Farms of how they're measuring

498
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,579
their effectiveness what's the

499
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:45,660
management how do they do the

500
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,040
performance assessment to see whose

501
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,320
trolls are doing the best what signals

502
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,399
that might look like when they're

503
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,019
collecting those stats

504
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,560
if we look back a thousand years into

505
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,940
Williams leadership style and his

506
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,440
performance management next chart please

507
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,019
he's a lead from the back with a big

508
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:03,319
stick yelling at people

509
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:06,000
just for the real medieval nerds in the

510
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,859
room which is probably me

511
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,720
um if you read the Icelandic sagas he's

512
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,400
not known as William the Conqueror he's

513
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,980
known as villamarin bastardi

514
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,559
which means William the bastard

515
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,760
um looking at that picture you can

516
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,260
probably understand why

517
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,599
next slide please

518
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,339
so next up we're halfway through the

519
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,260
kill chain so don't panic um testing

520
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,540
defenses a b testing right if you're a

521
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,980
sophisticated adversary you're not just

522
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,419
going to throw everything out there and

523
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:32,160
see what happens you're probably going

524
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,600
to try and work out what's going to

525
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,280
happen so this is where all the a b

526
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,720
testing all the penetration testing

527
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,640
comes into play this is the phase where

528
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,440
an operation is just I'm going to try

529
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,480
this and this see what happens we know

530
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,280
the gru were doing this in 2016 for

531
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,299
example they were testing different

532
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:46,679
exfiltration

533
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:48,360
um methods they were testing access to

534
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,820
servers but you might also see it in in

535
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,340
the influence operations world or in the

536
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,320
um in the harassment world right post

537
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,220
the same thing on two different

538
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,900
platforms does it go down on Facebook

539
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,179
and stay up on telegram

540
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,340
um it's anything where you've got that

541
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,039
that slightly trial test phase on the

542
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,539
next slide

543
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:08,400
again we can see the medieval equivalent

544
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,960
right your whole Army is attacking a

545
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,520
wooden Castle two guys run up with what

546
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,440
look like torches on the end of Spears

547
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,600
try and set fire to the castle testing

548
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,880
the defenses see if it works

549
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,160
next slide please

550
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,320
step 6 is beating detection

551
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,600
so this is a dynamic action that the

552
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,660
adversaries are doing to evade detection

553
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,720
or sort of sort of the visual

554
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,980
recognition of these campaigns as well

555
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,799
as our our pivots to find them so this

556
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,620
thinking that this is not so much

557
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,940
changing the the paint Scheme on an

558
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,740
airplane or changing its tail number but

559
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,360
this is literally flying below the radar

560
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,100
kind of aspect

561
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,360
and

562
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,919
two examples that come to mind here

563
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,280
going back to the VV case uh they were

564
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,120
constantly changing their their sort of

565
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,460
symbology of using VV to using emojis to

566
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,500
using different Unicode characters

567
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,480
Etc and so thinking about if we're just

568
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,160
doing naive searches for keywords we're

569
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,840
going to miss some of that activity you

570
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,160
think you're finding the whole operation

571
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,600
you're missing something that's one

572
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,559
aspect

573
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:10,140
and credit to Graphica for recording

574
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,419
that that aspect of that operation

575
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,940
another example is geofencing websites

576
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,400
so just in September this year we took

577
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,960
down an announcement operation

578
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,820
russian-based Operation that is making

579
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,039
these doppelganger websites to look like

580
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,200
German news websites hundreds and

581
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,320
hundreds of these domains

582
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,780
pointed out that some of these domains

583
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,700
were geofenced that depending on where

584
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,140
you browse them from you would get

585
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,720
different content again if it can make

586
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,460
you look at something and say is this in

587
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,260
or is this out of the campaign or the

588
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,080
operation that's the idea when we use

589
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,940
the term covert influence operation I

590
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,620
think the covertness is what really is

591
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,600
coming into play here

592
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,720
next chart and here the the live to

593
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,460
fight another day kind of aspect is

594
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,260
simply to swing around and obey the back

595
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,679
side of the castle

596
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,840
next slide please

597
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,820
next up indiscriminate engagement

598
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,500
originally when we were working on this

599
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,000
on this kill chain we just had

600
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,400
engagement as a pillar on its own and it

601
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,559
just just got too big right there's so

602
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,240
many different ways to engage so we

603
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,799
divide this into two we'll talk about

604
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:16,020
targeted engagement but before that you

605
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,700
get indiscriminate engagement that's the

606
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,200
classic just throw it at the wall and

607
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,299
see if it sticks um a lot of spam

608
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:23,039
campaigns tend to do this it's generally

609
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,360
the less sophisticated end of the

610
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,100
spectrum but this is anything where

611
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,660
you're throwing out content and just

612
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,419
hoping that somebody will pick up on it

613
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:31,919
spamouflage that Wonderful Chinese

614
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,500
network of which is like frankly it's a

615
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,940
gift to investigators when you feel you

616
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,799
can't find anything else at all you can

617
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:39,120
still find spamouflage it's really

618
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,200
relief

619
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,940
um but spamouflage does this a lot right

620
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,200
they'll post stuff on three different

621
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,600
platforms no hashtags no kind of attempt

622
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,980
to engage people and then they use fake

623
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,419
accounts to like make it look like

624
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:49,980
people are engaging

625
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,480
um operation secondary infection which

626
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,799
is the Russian operation that was

627
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,480
planting forgeries all over the Internet

628
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,580
did the same thing right they'd create a

629
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,320
forgery in Swedish about the Swedish

630
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,419
prime minister they drop it on a forum

631
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:02,039
for the Pakistan civil service in

632
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:04,919
Islamabad and they'd leave it there like

633
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:06,539
how are you expecting people to pick up

634
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:07,860
on that

635
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,960
um in the case of 1066 if we can see the

636
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,940
next slide look at these archers here

637
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,260
they're not even aiming right this guy

638
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,820
on the left is going to shoot his own

639
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,100
man in the back it's just

640
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,600
don't even point and shoot just just

641
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,400
like pointed or wave it around and then

642
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,200
let go that is the indiscriminate

643
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,720
engagement side very unsophisticated by

644
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,919
contrast

645
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,900
we have the targeted engagement so

646
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,940
coming again from the infostatic

647
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,679
intrusions world this one very much you

648
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,960
know feels familiar to uh to us in terms

649
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,179
of how individuals can be targeted I

650
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:37,799
think we can think about this also not

651
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:40,080
only in a one-to-one situation of one

652
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,700
actor or one operation targeting one

653
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,940
individual we can also think of of a

654
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,760
one-to-many so the the Z team that we've

655
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,760
been alluded to earlier would comment on

656
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,400
on German politician Facebook pages and

657
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,380
Twitter pages with their Z iconography

658
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,900
and his Linsky messages it was turned

659
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,460
into a specific audience but it was it

660
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,740
was vast in terms of the audience

661
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,659
let's also think though about the many

662
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:05,340
to one and that's where the brigading

663
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,380
comes into play that online harassment

664
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,440
again many people to flood vile comments

665
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,600
and things to one individual is a really

666
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,059
important part about Target engagement

667
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:16,740
I also want to take the opportunity to

668
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,840
remind all of us here in this room that

669
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,700
we are not only just reporters and

670
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,620
researchers of this activity we may well

671
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,720
be a Target sometime I think it's very

672
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,100
important to keep in mind

673
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,100
whether it's a journalist being on the

674
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,419
receiving end of influence campaign

675
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:32,400
trying to launder sort of that influence

676
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,340
through a legitimate media or as our

677
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,720
friends at Google pointed out a few

678
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,700
years ago of North Korean actors

679
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,200
infiltrating vulnerability research

680
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,039
community

681
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,240
so I think it's very important to

682
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,620
remember we're not just in an ivory

683
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,720
Tower researchers but may well be

684
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,500
targets of this from time to time

685
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,780
next slide these yeah uh and so while

686
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,880
we're at uh step eight of ten of our

687
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,860
kill chain this is the end of the kill

688
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,140
chain for poor King Herald and his

689
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,059
targeted engagement

690
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:01,799
next slide please

691
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:04,320
so we're nearly there nine out of ten is

692
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,020
compromising assets for for the Cyber

693
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,159
intrusion part this is when it gets

694
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,080
really serious right

695
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,440
you to take over assets that the target

696
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,720
is using a lot of this will fall into

697
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,980
the cyberspace so if you think about

698
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,900
using malware using social engineering

699
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,159
phishing trying to get hold of

700
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,440
somebody's account credentials and but

701
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,179
you might also see this in the influence

702
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:25,919
operations space or in brigading right

703
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,260
if you socially engineer somebody to

704
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,840
give you access if the threat actor does

705
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,159
it to get access to somebody else's

706
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,140
social media account or website and then

707
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,820
locks out the original owner changes the

708
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,679
password that is the same kind of thing

709
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,539
compromising assets is getting anything

710
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:42,000
that an operation does to get the keys

711
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,700
to somebody else's Treasure Chest

712
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,380
um which is an opposite phrase not that

713
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,640
I was planning that for ages because if

714
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,380
we have the next slide

715
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,240
this is one of my favorite images from

716
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,860
the Bayer tapestry how do you surrender

717
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,900
a castle you put the keys on a spear

718
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,580
wave it over the wall and you wait for

719
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,200
the other guy to pick it up compromising

720
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,720
Assets in 1066.

721
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,500
next slide

722
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:06,480
yeah and then finally we have enabling

723
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,020
persistence this is uh when the when the

724
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,820
adversary first encounters disruption

725
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,340
what do they do to respond to that you

726
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,640
know no good plan can respond uh to uh

727
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,020
it's first encounter with the Enemy this

728
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,520
is the operations first encounter with

729
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,659
us as Defenders

730
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:25,919
so what do they do to to last the uh the

731
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,299
Russian operation with the German news

732
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,860
websites I mentioned they just keep

733
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,659
cranking these websites out so they're

734
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:32,220
learning the same Playbook over and over

735
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,740
again and and trying to make us find

736
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,679
them the most durable way to block them

737
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,840
looking back on the on the gru activity

738
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,919
I think there's some really interesting

739
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:42,000
examples

740
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,340
one is the Persona Alice Donovan which

741
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,919
was being used as an author to publish

742
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:50,700
uh various uh content and would switch

743
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,440
to Hillary themed content just before

744
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,760
the election

745
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,520
and what happened was once that

746
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,340
operation was revealed they removed the

747
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,020
byline from

748
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,000
so then the content kind of Remains the

749
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,780
Same

750
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:07,140
but maybe the linkage to connected

751
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,480
that's the idea for how they can do

752
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,100
and of course the other key thing is

753
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,960
moving to different platforms

754
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,600
which next chart would be our view of an

755
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,760
ideal day when we do such a good job of

756
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,200
disrupting it they all fled to telegram

757
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,559
to do it

758
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,760
[Music]

759
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,220
over the next turn

760
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,380
so there you have it the online

761
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,539
operations coaching and some caveats

762
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:32,940
again coming from the experience of

763
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,039
these types of mindsets and sharing

764
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,779
those types of Frameworks over the years

765
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:39,240
first and foremost it is modular not all

766
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,799
operations are going to use All Phases

767
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,299
in the same way you're going to have a

768
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:44,220
mix and match and that's okay

769
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,520
I often use the phrase the quotation all

770
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,340
models are wrong but some are useful and

771
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,559
the idea is to be useful and when it's

772
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,480
not useful we have to change

773
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,039
second and then this is what really

774
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:57,779
convinced me that this was the right

775
00:25:57,779 --> 00:25:59,460
kind of approach is that these

776
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,779
operations that we're dealing with are

777
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:02,820
focused at a human to human level we're

778
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,520
not looking so much at the exploits of a

779
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,220
browser or an email server or the

780
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,860
behaviors of a malware implant but

781
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,659
rather on the behaviors of people both

782
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:14,279
on the targeting side as well as in the

783
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:16,440
receiving side of an operation

784
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,600
and then as we mentioned from the outset

785
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,400
on our team we deal with a whole variety

786
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,539
of harm types

787
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:23,880
and while certain Frameworks will be

788
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,559
more precise with given harm types and

789
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:27,720
within that one domain we see so much

790
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,820
blending and overlaps across our

791
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,919
organization that having the generality

792
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,299
and that commonality has been really

793
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:34,919
important to identify

794
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:36,779
opportunities where we can share both

795
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:38,940
analytical tradecraft as well as build

796
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,779
better detection

797
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,480
please but I used to be a journalist and

798
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,159
the question for a journalist is always

799
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:48,360
so what

800
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,460
as such said we designed this to be

801
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,500
useful and there's a couple of ways that

802
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,419
we can see this being useful both

803
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:57,779
internally and externally internally it

804
00:26:57,779 --> 00:26:59,039
allows us to compare lots of different

805
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,779
sorts of operation according to a common

806
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:02,940
language in a common framework so let's

807
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,860
imagine for example that you're an

808
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,059
organization which has three different

809
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:09,059
teams focused on Espionage i o and the

810
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:11,279
scams and frauds if each of those is

811
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,840
using a different framework maybe three

812
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,460
different kill chains or ones using

813
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,140
Mitra attack one's using a kill chain

814
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,419
one's using something else

815
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:21,240
what happens if threat actors are all

816
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,220
doing the same thing let's say they're

817
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,539
all downloading faces from this person

818
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:26,220
does not exist which is what I did for

819
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,480
this slide

820
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,679
what are the chances that they're

821
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:29,880
actually going to sit down and say hey

822
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,500
we're all saying the same thing and

823
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,419
that's disguising assets the second link

824
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:34,799
out of 10 in the kill chain that's a

825
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,200
really early phase maybe we should be

826
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,120
working together actually to detect this

827
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,100
and disrupt it whereas if they're all

828
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,799
using the same framework it's going to

829
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:45,720
be much easier to compare notes and say

830
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,400
across all these different violation

831
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,440
types Bad actors are doing the same

832
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,120
thing so maybe we should be getting

833
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,100
ahead of them so that's the internal use

834
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,860
and then next slide please

835
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,559
externally this is a screenshot from one

836
00:27:58,559 --> 00:27:59,940
of my favorite operations ever which is

837
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,919
secondary infection Uh Russian operation

838
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,299
planted fakes all across the internet

839
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:05,520
tried to interfere in the UK general

840
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,919
election in 2019.

841
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,580
the exposure of secondary infection is

842
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,200
all about sharing there's folks here

843
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,299
from dfr Lab there's Adam ronsley's here

844
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:17,400
I know the Graphica team are here and

845
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,600
the guys from meta who originally

846
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,100
discovered this damn thing are here the

847
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,779
way secondary infection got exposed

848
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:24,419
Facebook found 16 accounts they shared

849
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:26,520
it with dfr lab dfr Lab built it out to

850
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,260
about 200 accounts over 40 different

851
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,120
platforms they shared that with the

852
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,679
platform s Graphica went further found

853
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,120
about two and a half thousand accounts

854
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,520
on 326 different platforms shared

855
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,500
information Reddit found the same stuff

856
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,120
it shared it back this was all about

857
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,740
info sharing I remember being at the

858
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,539
heart of that we had calls with like 20

859
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:43,980
different teams

860
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,900
every team had its own way of

861
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,919
understanding they had their own

862
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:48,240
questions and it took a while to work at

863
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,799
hand you're asking the same thing as the

864
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:51,000
question that a guy got asked yesterday

865
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,200
you're just using completely different

866
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,159
words

867
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:55,620
if we had had a single framework that we

868
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,779
all recognized to be able to say here's

869
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:59,400
how we break down this operation here's

870
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,840
how they're creating their single-use

871
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,539
burner accounts it would have been so

872
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:04,799
much easier

873
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,240
to share information and let everybody

874
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,460
know here's what we're seeing and it

875
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,980
would have made it easier to share back

876
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,940
next slide please

877
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,200
in the name where we started same

878
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,840
mindset identify the complete phases of

879
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,820
the kill chain understand opportunities

880
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,159
to detect and disrupt at the earliest as

881
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:24,899
possible use it as a framework to

882
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:26,460
measure your effectiveness of moving

883
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,620
earlier in the kill chain identifying

884
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,179
those commonalities of seeing the end

885
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:31,740
phases across the entire organization

886
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,779
training the entire team building new

887
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:35,760
detections to find them and disrupt them

888
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,559
ourselves and then share as a community

889
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,659
provide that context

890
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:43,020
and uh and the the the means of which to

891
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,000
use the same language to share and put

892
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,899
together those pieces too

893
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,220
it's been an honor thank you very much

894
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,140
and if we have time we'd love to take a

895
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,620
question too

896
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,360
thank you for the uh presentation I was

897
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,799
just curious if there's anywhere we can

898
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,140
read like a white paper on the specific

899
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,960
kill chain yep we're working on a paper

900
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,380
on this

901
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,539
if we can quote you to like the internal

902
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:10,679
teams to say hey there's interest for

903
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:12,059
this externally that would make life a

904
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:14,120
lot

905
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,720
recognizing that this is ultimately uh

906
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,120
an information sharing kill chain intent

907
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,100
I was wondering if you could tell us any

908
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,799
steps that you're taking to socialize

909
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,860
this new kill chain not only amongst

910
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,860
threat intelligence teams but also with

911
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,760
Executives who will be then trying to

912
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,580
put forward the idea of this

913
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,460
boosting the information sharing not

914
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,380
only within the Tactical level but also

915
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,720
at the Strategic level so any any

916
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,760
information on your socialization of

917
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,799
cherry with what was the other audience

918
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,080
that you mentioned so you have how are

919
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,899
you socializing this not only among CTI

920
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:00,480
teams but also Executives I was

921
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,880
wondering if you could speak

922
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,159
speak well I'll say from historically

923
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:08,640
that was a crucial aspect for the

924
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,620
intrusion kill chain was that we did at

925
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,779
Lockheed Martin use it to guide the

926
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:15,179
executive notifications team further

927
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:17,159
down the kill chain you did a notify

928
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:20,100
increasing higher executive so from that

929
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,000
standpoint I think from a

930
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,039
decision-making aspect it is very much

931
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,740
in there we're using it one we talked

932
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,360
about prioritizing investment for

933
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,740
detections that's one way in which we're

934
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,960
looking to an organizational level say

935
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,399
this is what we got to focus on because

936
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:33,720
here's all the things that's going to

937
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,940
detect

938
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,740
and then secondly we do very much

939
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,020
measure how much we share with our

940
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,880
partners and how much we are relying our

941
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,860
detections from leads from our trusted

942
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,600
communities both amongst the big tech

943
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,640
companies but also from researchers open

944
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,580
source and other communities as well so

945
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,320
being able to measure that sharing

946
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,880
Community is another key metric that we

947
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,000
use

948
00:31:57,899 --> 00:31:59,940
um thanks very much for what seems like

949
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,100
a very clear explanation of the model

950
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,840
I'm curious it seems like part of this

951
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,340
isn't simply descriptive but also

952
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,899
anticipatory

953
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:08,460
um the last example you had was a bunch

954
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,080
of stuff being shown across a number of

955
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,520
different items but I'm curious if

956
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,640
you've had any examples of a tactic or a

957
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,740
movement between stages that you've only

958
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,480
seen for let's say fraud or Espionage

959
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,279
but that has anticipated something that

960
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:21,720
then gets seen across one of the other

961
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,140
items

962
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:26,460
so so the way we're thinking about this

963
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,960
is

964
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,000
um initially this this is this is a

965
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,919
post-hoc system right you you have to

966
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,240
have the operation before you can break

967
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,559
it down before you can understand what

968
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,059
it's doing

969
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:38,279
um but the way we think of it is once

970
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:39,960
you can identify

971
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,120
what the threat actors are doing in one

972
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,679
area you can actually start to look

973
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,539
ahead and say okay well if they're doing

974
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:47,520
that here then we want to be building

975
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,840
detection here here and here to get

976
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,919
ahead of them the next time they're

977
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,419
doing that

978
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:53,460
um a really interesting example is

979
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,440
actually again you know again faces and

980
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,080
shout out to MJR here that I from off

981
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,299
the top of my head late December 20 late

982
00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:02,100
2019 was the first time we saw an

983
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,020
influence operation that was using a lot

984
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,500
of faces created by stylegan too and at

985
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,820
that point those of us who are a

986
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,679
Graphica and dfr Labs spent just days

987
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:12,659
looking at these these Profile Pics onto

988
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,399
our eyeballs watered but there was no

989
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,620
kind of scale detection going on

990
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,659
but what happened was then the whole

991
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:20,159
Community started working on this I mean

992
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,440
again shout out to MJR shout out to some

993
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,880
of the early ocean Specialists who are

994
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,679
doing this and working out just by

995
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,419
eyeball what are the ways that you can

996
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:29,340
identify these and then increasingly

997
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,960
what we'll see is folks are going to

998
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,820
build scale detection which allows you

999
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,039
to do that and so it goes from this

1000
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,039
individual detection through to working

1001
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:40,080
out okay that is how we can identify

1002
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,760
this and once you can once you can

1003
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,380
systematize your identification of it

1004
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,419
then you can move on to the to the

1005
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:47,580
anticipatory model and the more we can

1006
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,320
share information about that the more we

1007
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,880
can do it anywhere in the system right

1008
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,679
so Gan faces came into the public eye

1009
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:54,720
through influence operations but again

1010
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,399
faces again face it doesn't matter what

1011
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:57,360
the threat actor is going to be doing

1012
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,700
with it if you can detect that thing you

1013
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,200
can apply it to any of the threat spaces

1014
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,679
we're working on

1015
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,840
thank you very much thank you

1016
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,558
thank you
