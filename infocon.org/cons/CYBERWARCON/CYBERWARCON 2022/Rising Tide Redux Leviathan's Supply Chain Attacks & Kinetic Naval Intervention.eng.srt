1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,159
thank you everybody for sticking with us

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,200
through uh distributed denial of

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,480
PowerPoint attack I think we all did all

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,460
right we made it through I'm up here

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,740
today to present Rising tide Redux

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,960
Leviathan supply chain attacks and

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,299
kineto kinetic Naval intervention in the

8
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:18,300
South China Sea next slide

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,400
so here's the glamor shot that's a big

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,020
picture of my face my name is Michael

11
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,180
Raji I am the staff threat research

12
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,160
engineer at proofpoint and for anybody

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,480
who's interested in some pretty good

14
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,519
takes on nation state activity feel free

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,098
to follow me on Twitter at artaji next

16
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,480
slide

17
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,180
so before I dive in today I want to

18
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,500
acknowledge some people that made this

19
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,540
possible so the proof Point threat

20
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,520
Insight team and the incredibly talented

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,620
analysts I work with are a gift to work

22
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,660
with every day I want to acknowledge

23
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,960
sveda centaurelli at PWC for being my

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,719
pic in publishing some research on this

25
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,760
group earlier this year and then finally

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,800
some key members of the threat research

27
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,199
community that have been mentors and

28
00:00:58,199 --> 00:00:59,820
sounding boards for me and being able to

29
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,440
get this particular research to the

30
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,719
stage next slide

31
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,900
okay so I'm a sucker for a poll quote

32
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,760
and seeing as I'm the guy with the

33
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,200
microphone today I hope you guys will

34
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,400
indulge me

35
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,280
two ships in the open sea without wind

36
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,220
or tide at last will come together two

37
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,500
enemies will inevitably meet it is a

38
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,299
question of time

39
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,880
right now this is the story in the South

40
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,400
China Sea as the People's Republic of

41
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,659
China expands their influence navally

42
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:32,340
economically and influence wise in the

43
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,700
region increasingly Gray Zone conflicts

44
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,100
are being more and more common as

45
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,920
sovereignty claims are competing in that

46
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,920
area gray zone is meant to mean the

47
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,759
space between peace and Hot War

48
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:49,920
basically proxy activity that advances

49
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,439
national interests without rising to the

50
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,079
level of Nation on Nation or military on

51
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,820
Military conflict

52
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,460
and what I'm here to present today is

53
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,680
what proofpoint believes is an

54
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,020
indication that Leviathan is supporting

55
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,500
kinetic

56
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,940
Maritime intercession in the South China

57
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,099
Sea region with Leviathan acting as a

58
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,800
supporting actor in fishing campaigns so

59
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,720
next slide

60
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,220
so our agenda today I'm going to cover

61
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,800
who is leviathan I'm going to give you a

62
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,680
brief uh history of sovereignty claims

63
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,300
in the South China Sea and then I'm

64
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,280
going to provide a timeline of the

65
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,420
phishing attacks that we're talking

66
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,400
about specifically targeting the supply

67
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,800
chains of offshore energy in Malaysia

68
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,800
and Taiwan and this is my promise to you

69
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,660
by the end of this presentation we will

70
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,120
attempt to unmask what we believe to be

71
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,000
the end intelligence customer that

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,760
Leviathan is conducting these Espionage

73
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,280
campaigns on behalf so that is not to

74
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,959
say the MSS don't worry they show up

75
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,700
prominently in this story but really

76
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,560
we're focusing on the end intelligence

77
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,739
customers based on the Collision of real

78
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:57,900
world kinetic events and cyber Espionage

79
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,599
events or cyber War if you will and then

80
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,760
finally we're going to cover uh why

81
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,440
Leviathan might be supporting these

82
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,260
types of kinetic maritime operations in

83
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,660
the region so next slide

84
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,800
so who is leviathan next slide

85
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,780
so Leviathan has been publicly

86
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,480
attributed to the Chinese State when I

87
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,640
say publicly attributed I'm referring to

88
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,920
the U.S Department of Justice indictment

89
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,019
from July of 2021 that was made public

90
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,540
as well as some work by citizen hackers

91
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,700
like intrusion truth

92
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,379
um and this is a group that's been known

93
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,180
as a number of different names by a lot

94
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,319
of the different vendors in this room

95
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,680
they've been known as ta-423 apt-40 red

96
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,379
Ladon gadolinium a lot of other names on

97
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:43,680
the board as well the usdoj indictment

98
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,620
interestingly attributed this group to

99
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,959
the Hainan regional office of the

100
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,599
ministry of State security that is the

101
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,299
procurement entity that was procuring an

102
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,220
Information Technology based in Hainan

103
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,040
China called the Hainan zandu technology

104
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,680
development company that's all in the

105
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,200
indictment interestingly that indictment

106
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,140
details at length their operations from

107
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,500
2011 but really 2015 to 2019 largely

108
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,180
targeting the South China Sea region

109
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,939
Malaysia Taiwan a little bit of Oceania

110
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,918
Australia a lot of other countries that

111
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:18,779
didn't make the slide primarily

112
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,820
conducting Espionage and intellectual

113
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,639
property theft next slide

114
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,620
so here are four of the handsome

115
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,180
gentlemen that were indicted as part of

116
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,040
the usdoj indictment you'll notice

117
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,660
Leviathan was one of the monikers

118
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,759
included by the usdoj in the indictment

119
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,919
as well as the Hainan zandoon technology

120
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:37,440
development company uh interestingly

121
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,479
they outed a number of The Operators

122
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,340
responsible for the computer network

123
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,280
intrusions as well as the MSS officer

124
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,380
and Handler that was working with the

125
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,780
Hainan Office of the NSS which is ding

126
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,720
Zao Yang that gent in the glasses next

127
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,040
slide

128
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,500
so drilling down on the indictment it

129
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,300
becomes apparent really quickly what

130
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,340
their focus is if you control F for

131
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,380
maritime research and development you

132
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,580
get a lot of highlighting really really

133
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,639
fast this particular Group stock and

134
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,120
trade was the targeting of global uh

135
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,520
entities in the US and Elsewhere for

136
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,820
Naval and Maritime research as well as

137
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,040
intellectual property theft around Naval

138
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,080
technology that might give them a

139
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,820
battlefield or technology Advantage

140
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,639
eventually next slide

141
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,460
so why are they so obsessed with boats

142
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,220
next slide

143
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,440
so specifically uh the answer there

144
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,320
might be Geographic we've covered that

145
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,680
the Leviathan group is operating in

146
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,020
tandem with the Hainan Ministry of State

147
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,220
security

148
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,680
the ministry of State security has

149
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,020
different offices that are set up based

150
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,180
on Province so there are many provinces

151
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,560
in China like there are states in the

152
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,620
United States and many of those have

153
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,660
offices regionally of the MSS

154
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,180
additionally they serve Regional needs

155
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,280
that exist within Hainan Province So

156
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,800
based on the doj indictment and the

157
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,539
address included for the Heinen Sand

158
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:05,820
Dune technology development company we

159
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,560
are aware that they are operating out of

160
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,720
haikau the central dot on that map

161
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,300
operating in the north side of Hainan

162
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,139
Island

163
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:18,780
to the north of uh haikau is zanjang and

164
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,940
specifically the port of zanjang which

165
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,340
is where the pla Navy South Fleet is

166
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,319
docked so think all of the above water

167
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,539
boats are going to be operating in the

168
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:29,100
South China Sea in docking in the port

169
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,979
of zhenjang to the south of this uh

170
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:34,919
contractor is the suburb of Sanya and

171
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:37,139
insania exists the yuenland Naval Base

172
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:38,940
which is where all the submarines below

173
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,340
the water are docking so they are

174
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,440
particularly geographically well placed

175
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,020
to serve the naval needs of the MSS in

176
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,460
the province of Hainan

177
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,800
next slide

178
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,360
so now we're going to do a brief history

179
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,639
of sovereignty claims in the South China

180
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,680
Sea next slide

181
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,580
okay so since 2009 the Chinese Communist

182
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,460
Party made a very Broad and public claim

183
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,620
colloquially referred to as the Chinese

184
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,319
nine-dash line claim in which they

185
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,880
espoused Sovereign rights and

186
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,979
jurisdiction over the relevant Waters as

187
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:13,319
well as the seabed and subsoil thereof

188
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,479
so it's not just the water and the

189
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:17,280
islands they're interested in it's the

190
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,699
subsoil and what's in the subsoil

191
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:23,759
minerals hydrocarbon energy so they're

192
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,440
not only saying we own the water they're

193
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,479
saying we own the right to develop the

194
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,759
energy under the water and in the seabed

195
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,160
and you'll notice China is not the only

196
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,960
one with a sovereignty claim in the

197
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,639
South China Sea you'll notice that

198
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,620
Malaysia has a claim Vietnam has a claim

199
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,780
Brunei has acclaimed Philippines other

200
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,599
nations as well and often they are in

201
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:45,120
conflict with each other overlapping and

202
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,800
within those overlapping areas

203
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,740
especially the Chinese 9-line Gray Zone

204
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,740
conflict is becoming more common and

205
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,060
we're going to tell the story today

206
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,400
about one of those Gray Zone conflict

207
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,520
specifically off the shore of Malaysia

208
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,340
and then later in March 2022 in which we

209
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,560
observed the supply chain of a Taiwanese

210
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,259
offshore wind farm that was targeted as

211
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:09,479
well by the Leviathan threat actor next

212
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:10,740
slide

213
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,500
okay so now a timeline of Leviathan

214
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,720
fishing events next slide

215
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,880
so the primary period of activity that

216
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,979
we've observed Leviathan conducting

217
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,500
phishing campaigns is from June 2021

218
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,900
through June 2022 actually a little bit

219
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,720
after June 2022 as well uh from the

220
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,139
period of June 21 through April of 2022

221
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:33,599
we observed them utilizing uh fishing

222
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,839
attachments specifically RTF attachments

223
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:39,479
leveraging RTF template injection

224
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,260
subsequently in April 2022 they kind of

225
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,640
changed tactics instead referring to uh

226
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,500
URLs that ultimately redirected to

227
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,779
deliver uh the Java the scan box

228
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:53,519
JavaScript

229
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,800
Network profiling framework

230
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,560
interestingly I previously said that the

231
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,180
U.S Department of Justice released their

232
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,180
indictment in July 2021. you can look at

233
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,160
the Timeline the tempo and operational

234
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,160
Pace as well as the ttps did not change

235
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,140
as dramatically as you would think they

236
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,060
would have the operations kind of

237
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,680
persisted through that period regardless

238
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,300
of the public disclosure of that

239
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,580
indictment next slide

240
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,560
so today for the purposes of this

241
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,000
conversation we're really going to drill

242
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,399
down on two snapshots of campaigns in

243
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,200
which energy projects in the South China

244
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,060
Sea were targeted we're going to speak

245
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,100
about an operation that targeted an

246
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,540
offshore

247
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,120
um hydrocarbon entity off the coast of

248
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,540
Malaysia on June 2nd 2021 and uh the

249
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,459
targeting of the Taiwanese supply chain

250
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,440
when I say supply chain it's a

251
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,740
individual in Europe that is a key

252
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,839
vendor for an offshore wind farm in the

253
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,540
Strait of Taiwan uh in late March 2022

254
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,540
both using RTF template injection next

255
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,740
slide

256
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,920
so when I say RTF template injection I

257
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,660
find it incredibly helpful to visualize

258
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,700
these sorts of attacks what we observed

259
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,279
varied slightly between June through

260
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,500
March 2022 but this gives you a good

261
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,120
idea of approximately what they were

262
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,300
doing in that time period so it begins

263
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,100
with a phishing email that phishing

264
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,339
email contains an RTF attachment and

265
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:16,080
within that RTF attachment when you open

266
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,380
it in the file there is a template field

267
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,660
that contains a URL or a control word

268
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,459
group for any of the Nerds who are

269
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,320
obsessed with RTF files like me

270
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,500
within that RTF file that URL calls out

271
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,140
to an actor delivery server and that

272
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,959
actor delivery server has uh the request

273
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,120
specifically has a victim-specific ID

274
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,240
that is hard-coded which will give the

275
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,100
actor an indication of who specifically

276
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,399
clicked the URL after that time a

277
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,200
malicious zip archive will be returned

278
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,540
from a server response and written to

279
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,839
the host once executed that malicious

280
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,300
zip archive sorry once extracted

281
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,240
contains a legitimate PE file and a dll

282
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,360
malware Stager that dll malware Stager

283
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,060
is executed through dll search order

284
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,459
hijacking a very Chinese technique that

285
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:07,140
most of the people will recognize in

286
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,480
this room and then upon execution it

287
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,220
will call out to a command and control

288
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,160
server ultimately pulling down an xor

289
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,100
encoded Shell Code which once decrypted

290
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,260
and executed it's interpreter and you

291
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,880
have an infection on your machine

292
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,860
so next slide

293
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,720
so how do we know this is leviathan

294
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,220
rather than just asking you guys to

295
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,540
trust me on the stage because they gave

296
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,920
me a microphone we want to share a

297
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,060
little bit of our thoughts around

298
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,380
attribution how we came to the

299
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,480
conclusion so next slide

300
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,760
so firstly the RTF template injection

301
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,980
technique is kind of interesting and

302
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,360
unique the way that they're implementing

303
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,980
it there are other apt actors and

304
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,600
crimeware actors using RTF template

305
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,640
injection but the way in which they are

306
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,920
embedding their uh control word groups

307
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,420
are basically the template field you can

308
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,920
kind of put it anywhere in your file

309
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,560
they love to smush it in between uh font

310
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,300
families and included in the same word

311
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,680
group it's a weird thing that's

312
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,300
consistent I've only seen them doing it

313
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,680
and I think it's likely they have a

314
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,000
builder that just keeps stuffing it in

315
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,620
the same place the other Chinese group

316
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,820
I'm aware of does something very

317
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,160
different so that's the first thing next

318
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,480
slide

319
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,120
the use of hard-coded victim-specific

320
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,060
IDs as a means for deconflicting

321
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,100
infections of targets it's something we

322
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,779
see by many actors but in combination

323
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:17,399
with RTF template injection where

324
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,079
they're not specifying specific file

325
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:21,420
resources that's unique to Leviathan

326
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,100
next slide

327
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,459
this basket of ttps using RTF template

328
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,860
injection to pull down a xor encoded

329
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,500
Shell Code through a zip archive

330
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,260
containing a dll malware Stager that's

331
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,200
also very very Leviathan in its nature

332
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,779
specifically the legitimate PES and

333
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:41,459
other payloads that were loaded by that

334
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:43,380
PE in the past if you trace them back

335
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,180
through enough campaigns eventually

336
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,100
you'll land at the dad stash campaigns

337
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,680
that were publicly published in the past

338
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,959
by some really talented researchers that

339
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,760
I helped me along the way to this

340
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,920
conclusion and then next slide

341
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,200
finally the sector victimology and the

342
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,240
geographic Focus targeting Malaysia

343
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,519
targeting Oceania Australia Naval

344
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:05,100
defense and South China Sea issues is

345
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,680
very very well aligned with leviathan's

346
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,680
victimology in the past next slide

347
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,300
okay

348
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:16,160
so let me now deliver you guys the hook

349
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,079
never in my career have I observed a

350
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:21,180
cyber Espionage campaign

351
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,120
cyber Warfare campaign and the kinetic

352
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,639
operation coalescing in a way that

353
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,459
allowed me to make a broader conclusion

354
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:32,160
not only about attribution not only

355
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,680
about procurement in the MSS but about

356
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,260
who the end intelligence customer is

357
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,660
that is using the intelligence

358
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,579
and what I'm about to present this story

359
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:43,680
is largely what allowed us to come to

360
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,800
that conclusion overall next slide

361
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,279
so June 2nd 2021 we see a leviathan

362
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:51,779
fishing campaign the one I just

363
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:54,060
described to you it looks like Leviathan

364
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,800
we recognize it as Leviathan but it is

365
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,899
not immediately apparent to us what

366
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:00,420
they're doing and why these targets are

367
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,180
deviating from their usual Naval defense

368
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,300
type targets we saw natural gas targets

369
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,120
we saw construction banking subsea

370
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,339
engineering and conventional engineering

371
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:13,920
and it took us moments to really drill

372
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,480
down on the recipients and understand

373
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,060
what they all had in common

374
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,500
next slide

375
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,480
what they all had in common was the

376
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,100
cassowary gas field

377
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,660
for those not familiar with the

378
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,820
cassowary gas Fields it is one of the

379
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,620
largest offshore energy projects in the

380
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,940
world specifically in the South China

381
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,000
Sea off of the shore of Malaysia and

382
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,620
interestingly the project was supposed

383
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,160
to come online in 2023 but construction

384
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,740
began on the platform just one day

385
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,620
before this fishing campaign on June 1st

386
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,500
2021 so what we observed the day after

387
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,839
Construction in this contested Waters

388
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:53,160
within the Malaysian claim

389
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,560
was a fishing campaign going up and down

390
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,160
the supply chain of this gas project

391
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,959
specifically targeting entities that may

392
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,940
or may not have knowledge about who's

393
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,160
operating at that given site

394
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,779
next slide

395
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:10,740
so enhance I'm a big fan of maps here is

396
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,079
specifically where the Malaysian

397
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,180
cassowary gas field is located it's

398
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,980
right off of the shore of Sarawak in

399
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,860
Malaysia and I'm exposing as well the

400
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,600
same map I showed you earlier now with a

401
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,760
tiny golden box on it to show you where

402
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,339
it is within the sovereignty claim of

403
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:28,380
the Chinese nine dash line of the

404
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,000
Malaysian Sovereign claim and it's also

405
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,579
right but up against the bruneian claim

406
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:35,699
so one would imagine that if you are the

407
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:38,100
Chinese Communist Party who has asserted

408
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,899
your Sovereign rights to not only the

409
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:41,100
waters and the islands but everything

410
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,500
underneath it if a country within the

411
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,480
nine-dash line is developing energy

412
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,940
rights underneath what you believe to be

413
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,920
the Sovereign right of China you may

414
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,839
have an issue with it and you may take

415
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,880
some sort of action against it next

416
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,320
slide

417
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,459
so at the beginning I teased a fairly

418
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,779
big unveiling of not only

419
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:05,699
Leviathan and the MSS but who the End

420
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:09,180
customer is next slide

421
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,519
so bear with me for a second thinking

422
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,839
about again the U.S Department of

423
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,940
Justice indictments we've established

424
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,800
that the Hainan Ministry of State

425
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,680
security procured the Heinen Zen Dune

426
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,180
technology development company or

427
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,760
Leviathan to conduct Espionage on their

428
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,300
behalf targeting Naval intelligence and

429
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,540
research they stole designs and you

430
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,279
would think Leviathan steals the designs

431
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,079
and they pass it off to the MSS job well

432
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,399
done we did it

433
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,980
but the MSS doesn't employ Engineers

434
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,660
they don't have guys with AutoCAD

435
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,060
software and wrenches they need to then

436
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,980
redistribute that intelligence through

437
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,440
other Chinese State organs or

438
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,940
contractors that would be able to

439
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,940
reverse engineer a submarine plan that's

440
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,320
not based on any knowledge I'm just

441
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,259
making something up so in this case who

442
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:58,860
would benefit in real time from supply

443
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,040
chain and operational data from a

444
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,040
cassowary gas field days after it was

445
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,619
first constructed

446
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:10,140
here it is next slide

447
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,540
the Chinese Coast Guard and the reason

448
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,699
we know that is because two days after

449
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:16,679
the fishing campaign and three days

450
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:19,140
after construction began on the site the

451
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,459
Chinese Coast Guard showed up on site

452
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:23,640
and began harassing pipeling barges and

453
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,439
private vessels responsible for the

454
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,260
construction of the initial gas pipeline

455
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,600
project next slide

456
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,580
so expanding on this timeline of

457
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,980
Maritime intercession June 1st project

458
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,860
begins Chinese Air Force buzzes the site

459
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,780
because we're not happy about it we're

460
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,220
going to let you know and very publicly

461
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,620
broadcasted that this is something that

462
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,860
China will resist June 2nd the proof

463
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,600
Point campaign is identified targeting

464
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,700
up and down the supply chain June 4th

465
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,919
Chinese Coast Guard rats they remain

466
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:54,419
active in operating at the site

467
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:56,160
harassing private vessels through

468
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,440
quarter three and quarter four 2021

469
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,299
which is the first phase of construction

470
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:03,960
at that given site notably on July 3rd

471
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,360
the very definition of Gray Zone

472
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,120
conflict happened a second pipeline

473
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,100
barge was arriving at that site which

474
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,440
would significantly expedite the process

475
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,419
of construction as well as a number of

476
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:18,120
different Supply barges so interestingly

477
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,039
on that day the Chinese Coast Guard

478
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:22,440
sailed within several hundred yards of

479
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,140
those boats not escalating to armed

480
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,419
conflict but directly degrading the

481
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:29,760
capability to operate on-site and

482
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,419
Advance the project and China in that

483
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:34,919
context was in advancing and National

484
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:36,919
interest was in The Gray Zone without

485
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:40,679
engaging in active art conflict next

486
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:42,179
slide

487
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:44,400
but here's the kicker this is not the

488
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,660
only time that the Chinese Coast Guard

489
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,179
has done this they do this a bunch on

490
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:49,980
the top left we see the article about

491
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,440
the cassowary gas site from Radio free

492
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,620
Asia underneath that on August 11th a

493
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,120
couple of months after what we observed

494
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,880
in June the same Chinese Coast Guard

495
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,160
ship shows up in Indonesia at the tuna

496
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,039
gas block harasses vessels there and

497
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,960
then most recently there was an article

498
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,539
published in June 2022 in which a

499
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:11,400
Taiwanese research ship carrying

500
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,740
Filipino researchers was harassed when I

501
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,140
say research here hydrocarbon

502
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,120
exploration they're looking for the next

503
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,820
cassowary gas field

504
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,679
next slide

505
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:26,160
so what we have here now is a pattern a

506
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,080
pattern in which we are observing the

507
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,940
Chinese Coast Guard harassing offshore

508
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,100
energy sites and enforcing sovereignty

509
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,440
within the South China Sea to take it

510
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,700
back to what proofpoint observes

511
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,580
specifically in late March 2022 we

512
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,679
observed another RTF template injection

513
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,080
campaign and it had a victim-specific ID

514
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,299
and it delivered interpreter this is

515
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:46,559
what we would expect to see from this

516
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,200
actor except this time it targeted a

517
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,120
European manufacturer of heavy equipment

518
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,160
specifically a very Niche piece of

519
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,720
equipment that was required for the

520
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,419
installation of offshore wind farms off

521
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:00,840
the coast of Taiwan interestingly at the

522
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,520
time period that this particular entity

523
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,740
was targeted it was a period of

524
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,539
uncertainty on the site they had

525
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,580
financing issues it wasn't sure when the

526
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,440
site would have the resumption of

527
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,539
construction but what we're seeing is

528
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:14,940
leviathan showing up in key development

529
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,059
life cycle periods of energy projects to

530
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:20,100
gather intelligence about operational

531
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,140
realities for construction at those

532
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,160
sites

533
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,780
next slide

534
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,179
so here's the visualization of the

535
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:29,760
entire Taiwanese offshore Wind Farm

536
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,039
ecosystem the yunlin wind farm is the

537
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:34,140
southernmost of that particular cluster

538
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,000
highlighted with the yellow arrow and

539
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,059
for context I've compared this against

540
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:41,520
the Chinese military drill sites around

541
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,320
the island of Taiwan which occurred in

542
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,419
August 2022 following the U.S House

543
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:48,419
speaker's visit to Taiwan for anyone

544
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:50,039
that is also familiar with the

545
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,200
prognosticated possible amphibious

546
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,940
Landing sites in the island of Taiwan

547
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,799
basically any of those sites on the

548
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:57,960
western side of Taiwan you've got to go

549
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,640
through the wind farm fields to get

550
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,820
there so it is well documented that both

551
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,280
the pla Navy and the Chinese Coast Guard

552
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,740
regularly Patrol the Strait of Taiwan as

553
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,780
it is a very high traffic area and

554
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,340
having intelligence about operational

555
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,620
realities of people constructing wind

556
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,880
turbines might be something that's

557
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,559
really useful to you

558
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,860
being the Chinese Coast Guard next slide

559
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,580
okay so wrapping this up we've answered

560
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,100
a lot of our questions a lot of the who

561
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,559
the what the when the how

562
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,120
but why

563
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,000
why Leviathan and why the Chinese Coast

564
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,020
Guard

565
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,480
next slide

566
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,380
foreign

567
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,080
so the answer as it often is in China is

568
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,940
it's the law

569
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,700
in January 2021 the Chinese Coast Guard

570
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,220
law was passed in China and this

571
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,380
emboldened and elevated the status of

572
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,000
the Chinese Coast Guard to be the

573
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,039
Sovereign enforcer of claims in the

574
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,600
South China Sea

575
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,460
not only were they responsible for

576
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,260
protecting the islands and the claims

577
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,840
they also were responsible now for the

578
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,240
exploration and development of marine

579
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,059
mineral resources further they were

580
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:07,740
empowered to supervise inspect

581
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,919
investigate and punish illegal acts by

582
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:12,720
Foreign related Marine scientific

583
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,280
research within the scope of their

584
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,980
duties that sounds a lot like

585
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,240
hydrocarbon exploration that sounds a

586
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,620
lot like we're building an oil platform

587
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,659
in the South China Sea

588
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:24,240
so that's why the Chinese Coast Guard

589
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,940
realistically they got a new mandate in

590
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,460
January they then needed to stand up the

591
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,080
capability to patrol in the South China

592
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,260
Sea they were referred I can't say for

593
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,179
sure possibly to the ministry of State

594
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:37,679
security and they said hey we need some

595
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,659
intelligence about boats and they said

596
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:41,580
oh we got guys who do boats we got

597
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,900
Leviathan

598
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,700
so next slide

599
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,159
Leviathan has a proven track record for

600
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:49,679
targeting Marine Maritime research and

601
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,200
development

602
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,100
interestingly in the takeaway that I

603
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,840
want to leave you with is they might not

604
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,000
be conducting this particular Espionage

605
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,840
research for Battlefield superiority I

606
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,240
think instead this might possibly be a

607
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,460
deconfliction activity where they are

608
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,020
interested in supporting Gray Zone

609
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,240
operations they are not interested in

610
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,400
Naval conflict they want to know who's

611
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,340
operating at the site and possibly

612
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,840
is the Malaysian Navy going to show up

613
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,000
today so I think by being able to

614
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,039
conduct this Espionage operation they

615
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:21,539
are capable of keeping it in the gray

616
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:24,179
Zone as well as advancing The Sovereign

617
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:26,419
claim of China in the South China Sea

618
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:29,340
without rising to the level of kinetic

619
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,700
conflict so this type of research is

620
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,679
challenging it takes a lot of people and

621
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,559
some really Incredible Minds to do a

622
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:39,480
year long of research and bring it

623
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,900
public and I believe that organizations

624
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,299
like ours and yours out there have the

625
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,400
ability to tell these long Arc stories

626
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,320
taking kinetic events and cyber warfare

627
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,539
and coming away with a larger conclusion

628
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:55,140
and if you do it publicly enough you too

629
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,480
next slide

630
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,340
can be told by the Chinese Communist

631
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,720
Party spokesperson that you have no

632
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,940
professionalism or credibility which is

633
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,559
what happened to me

634
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,150
on August 31st

635
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,320
[Applause]

636
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,059
when journalists asked the Chinese

637
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:13,559
Communist Party spokesperson what they

638
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:15,240
thought of our blog so don't worry guys

639
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,520
it has an impact

640
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,679
and with that next slide I'm happy to

641
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,460
take any questions we have left

642
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,020
[Applause]

643
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,059
you mentioned in your timeline that on

644
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:29,899
June 1st

645
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:34,740
person that the epla asked was involved

646
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,080
in buzzing this was a whole government

647
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,340
approach right there were multiple

648
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,220
agencies multiple parts of the Chinese

649
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,200
government that were involved is it

650
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,000
possible that a lot of that timeline

651
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,760
could be explained by coincidence over

652
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,980
at imagery is there anything that you've

653
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,260
seen from this cyber perspective that

654
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,299
more directly ties

655
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:56,220
something that they collected in the

656
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,679
supply chain since you can manifest that

657
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:00,179
directly informed something that

658
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:01,919
couldn't have come from

659
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,919
uh other sources so to speak is it

660
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:07,799
possible that the MSS was very active

661
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,240
but kind of just a distraction and

662
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,620
didn't really help that much even though

663
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,860
they were trying sure so structurally uh

664
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,380
traditionally pla units in China and NSS

665
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,840
support uh for cyber operations in China

666
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,700
support different organizations so the

667
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,860
expectation is likely that the pla

668
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,299
support for an operation would have come

669
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:26,400
from a more regionally tasked group that

670
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,380
has different apt names that don't

671
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,419
necessarily align with Leviathan as the

672
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:33,240
NSS specifically about what was we saw

673
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,000
being stolen nothing we stopped it so in

674
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,740
that particular case we did not have the

675
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,360
actions after to make an assessment

676
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,760
about what information might have been

677
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,760
correlated or taken largely a lot of

678
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,159
these conclusions are based on uh the

679
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:48,840
victimology and understanding the roles

680
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,820
of individuals that are targeted and

681
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,980
their professional realities that might

682
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,059
impact

683
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:55,679
intelligence that might be worth

684
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,320
extracting from their emails

685
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,299
Hi how are you able to rule out the

686
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:02,340
alternative hypothesis that Leviathan

687
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,600
the Coast Guard are just receiving

688
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,340
shared priorities and tasking from the

689
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,840
same Source rather than the Coast Guard

690
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,880
being the designated ultimate customer

691
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,980
of this collection I'm sorry I just had

692
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,720
a little trouble understanding you that

693
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,460
time so

694
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,279
as an alternative hypothesis how are you

695
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,679
able to rule out the possibility that

696
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,419
the Coast Guard isn't the intended

697
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:23,520
ultimate customer for the collect

698
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,440
but Leviathan the Coast Guard are

699
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,240
receiving tasking and priorities from

700
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,559
the same source

701
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:29,760
so

702
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,340
um that's interesting how was I able to

703
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,779
rule it out I said we probably weren't

704
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:36,539
able to exclusively rule that out I

705
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:37,799
think we have an understanding that the

706
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,600
ministry of State security is acting as

707
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,640
the procurement entity

708
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,980
um the operational realities and the

709
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,380
consistency of campaigns over time that

710
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,900
had impact on multiple projects allowed

711
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,720
us to make a conclusion about the

712
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,580
consistency of targeting and the

713
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,960
possible impact of what they were doing

714
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,580
so if we're speaking only of the June

715
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,440
campaign sure that's a very small data

716
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,539
set I highlighted two use cases today

717
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:02,820
but we have a year of data where we were

718
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,860
doing every other day notifications

719
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,960
about this particular adversary so we

720
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,400
have a very good understanding and

721
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,159
working definition of what was happening

722
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:12,720
operationally in the region correlated

723
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,840
to real-time cyber Espionage campaigns

724
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,360
overfishing so the larger picture over

725
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,360
time helped us build out this pattern

726
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,100
rather than just the kind of very

727
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,210
polished screenshots we presented today

728
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,740

all right thank you guys
