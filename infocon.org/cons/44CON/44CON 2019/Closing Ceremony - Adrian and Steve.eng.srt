1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,029
Oh

2
00:00:02,139 --> 00:00:09,410
by okay alright so obviously with

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,579
everybody being here you might not be up

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,410
to date on the latest that's been

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:31,039
happening hm geez

6
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:33,410
No Deal brexit planning alright so just

7
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,510
a quick update on on how we've been

8
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,459
tracking safety and stuff first of all I

9
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:40,330
think it's the third year in a row that

10
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:43,550
nobody has been to hospital and the

11
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:48,199
fifth year in a row that nobody has had

12
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:49,720
to go to hospital right right so yeah we

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,940
had one lost phone which was recovered

14
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,830
zero major incidents some minor aspects

15
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,530
of dickish ness but mostly within the

16
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:59,390
realms of sort of an you know general

17
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:02,660
sort you're a diversity type stuff

18
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:04,849
rather than anything else missing

19
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,330
deliberate do you want do the tractor

20
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:08,839
stats

21
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:12,770
oh now these are fun those 44 core for

22
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,450
Queen things 195 of them were not traded

23
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:17,090
for beer

24
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:19,850
hey and I think it's fair to say the

25
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:22,610
soldiering table was as busy as ever oh

26
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:27,729
there was yep rarely a seat free so the

27
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:30,830
team there really really well you had

28
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:32,240
1260 coffees and that is actually broken

29
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,679
down a bit have you got those stats

30
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,240
later I haven't got the broken down

31
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,120
south or wanted to get through it

32
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:42,050
quickly so very quickly then because

33
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:46,970
this is fun for coffee nerds we used

34
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:49,610
Missy 18 kilos of espresso beans 48

35
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:54,200
litres of full fat milk six litres of

36
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:57,710
oat milk and two kilos of that beautiful

37
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,750
Guatemalan filter so very very fine on

38
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:02,500
that stat I am afraid I do not and

39
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:06,570
cannot track the number of tea bags

40
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:09,930
ridiculous anyway

41
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:13,350
it 10 Bowser beer is I think a record I

42
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:18,450
think I think it's close I don't think

43
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:20,579
any of us can remember that's the

44
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,769
highest number of G and T's drunk since

45
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,200
2015

46
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:31,680
pretty good rum five bottles and locked

47
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:33,480
shift rubbish awesome okay so bring a

48
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,830
buy stall didn't do as well this year

49
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,630
but obviously we weren't pushing it as

50
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,700
heavily so we had about eight hundred

51
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:41,549
and seventy five quid in terms of

52
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,350
donation buckets and sales so for all

53
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,240
you donated thank you very much for all

54
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:46,470
of you who went bought something thank

55
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:50,040
you very much

56
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:51,870
check sec very kindly agreed to put in

57
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,790
three hundred pounds into the kitty so

58
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,830
thank you very much then that money will

59
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,880
go to feeding people at a time when

60
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:01,290
they're going to need it the most that

61
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:03,450
makes a subtotal of 1175 which if we

62
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:06,739
match brings us to two thousand three

63
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,738
hundred and fifty pounds

64
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:14,530
[Applause]

65
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,900
so you might want to know what this

66
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,250
actually means as a result of what we

67
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:22,000
did for the last year and many other

68
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:25,330
activities almost 12,000 people were fed

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,320
in this borough it's the equivalent of a

70
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:31,570
hundred and twenty thousand meals but

71
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,299
that's not just what they do they did

72
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:36,519
holiday camps for deprived children home

73
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,950
budgeting courses so people could learn

74
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,780
actually how to do finance and they also

75
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,250
did mental health projects and I think

76
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,230
the mental health village here shows

77
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,480
there was a massive interest now in

78
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:49,269
actually getting some knowledge around

79
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,250
that it's fair to say I don't know if

80
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:53,650
she's in the room but the lady on the

81
00:03:51,250 --> 00:04:03,430
table was delighted in fact she said she

82
00:03:53,650 --> 00:04:06,100
was thrilled so thank you all all right

83
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:08,050
so the December training dates are up on

84
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,630
the website we'll go and put the courses

85
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:12,070
up when we're handing out the prizes but

86
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,780
training is going to be 2nd to the 5th

87
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,200
and the hootenanny is going to be on the

88
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,320
6th

89
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,180
details are now on the website so I

90
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,849
think we can start with some some of the

91
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:25,300
competitions and prizes so we had a

92
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:26,770
smart card competition all right thank

93
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:31,300
you to Andy infusion who are in the

94
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:33,370
photo basically the idea was that you

95
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,770
had to create something using the smart

96
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,690
cards that we've got that it's a

97
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,000
security function that isn't made worse

98
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:50,020
by the world's most insecure smart cards

99
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:52,060
so we had one injury so and it was no

100
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,940
card authentication so the idea is that

101
00:04:52,060 --> 00:05:02,470
if the card is blank and inserted

102
00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:04,210
promote the user to root cause if you're

103
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:07,240
a hacker and you find a card on the

104
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:08,950
floor you'll look at the data on it so

105
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,580
there's no date on the card you'll think

106
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,490
aha

107
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:14,859
there's nothing happening here is there

108
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:17,740
so yeah so it's it's an anti hacker

109
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:20,290
mechanism and I would have fallen for it

110
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:31,810
so if you'd like to step up and pick up

111
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:35,860
your Atari portfolio David must be very

112
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:42,160
good how much you attacking one of paid

113
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:47,370
for that more than I would is all right

114
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:49,630
and then we have the 44 Con CTF yes so

115
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:51,280
Cody and the guys are still keeping it

116
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:54,430
running for a bit longer but there was a

117
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,099
very clear winner there were about ten

118
00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:01,930
teams on the leaderboard and the winner

119
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:03,880
was Thomas DX w so we should have

120
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:08,620
oh no Cody's got them so Cody can you

121

00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:52,699
we'll try and get to the prizes as

129
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:55,460
quickly as possible so December training

130

all details are in the training site and

133
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:04,430
I guess now we're gonna give away some

134
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,870
stuff for the drawers mmm boxes there

135

okay

136
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:11,360
so feedback forms we love we do actually

137
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,279
read every single one of them it all

138
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,759
goes into what do you think of

139
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:20,349
spreadsheet and we do actually pay

140
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:23,240
attention to what you say now of course

141
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:30,199
sometimes we miss design the box and he

142
