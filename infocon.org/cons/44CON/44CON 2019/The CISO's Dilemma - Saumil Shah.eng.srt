1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,029
Oh

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:11,120
this talk is not my original talk I mean

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:14,599
let me rephrase it this top does not

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,960
contain original content from me this

5
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:20,830
talk is a storytelling talk this talk is

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:25,099
what I've learned over the past 18 years

7
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:31,549
working as a vendor with a few really

8
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:33,620
really sharp teams and then I got to

9
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,230
wondering what brought these teams

10
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:39,260
together and what kept these teams

11
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:42,199
together and the answers came from the

12
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:44,120
leaders of these teams so because as

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,510
good friends with them I decided to call

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,879
them up ask them what their secrets were

15
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:51,320
and then when they finished narrating

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,820
everything I just asked them that can I

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:58,400
get up on stage and talk about this and

18
00:00:54,820 --> 00:01:02,780
yes they gladly agreed and this is why

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:06,400
we have this discussion over here so the

20
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,960
background of this talk begins with a

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:13,610
presentation I did in Singapore two

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:15,080
years ago before I begin I definitely

23
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:17,260
want to thank the people who have

24
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:20,720
contributed to the contents of this talk

25
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:23,270
dr. Igor Potter Brad Kelly white dear

26
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,780
friend of mine on obses tea quite a few

27
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:29,179
of you know him and my business partner

28
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:31,940
here in and Thomas Doolin better known

29
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:34,580
as halberd flake so this is just a remix

30
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:37,158
of their thoughts so the story began in

31
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:40,940
Singapore where however and I did two

32
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:44,690
keynotes two very depressing keynotes

33
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:47,000
and we both walked away thinking like oh

34
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:53,450
goodness is this what InfoSec has come

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,850
to be the I mean Thomas stated a very

36
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:58,520
very key point which brought me to

37
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:01,009
question the whole thing are we really

38
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:05,030
bringing we're really bringing the wrong

39
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:07,010
army to the fight over here the very

40
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:09,229
fact is that attacks are a technical

41
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:11,269
problem to solve

42
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,700
and defense is largely a political

43
00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:17,480
problem and we are trying to solve a

44
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:20,599
political problem with technology as our

45
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:23,510
main weapon and this is not working out

46
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:25,640
we we see that right now technology

47
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:28,910
doesn't help us but we really never need

48
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:32,480
to to tackle the problem in the right

49
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:34,340
space so this was a ski note titled why

50
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,220
we're not building a defendable internet

51
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:39,230
an excellent keynote and then I was

52
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:42,379
following him the next day like oh

53
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:45,140
it's a hard act to follow and then I I

54
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:47,750
had my own thesis that if you really

55
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:50,390
need to succeed in InfoSec my keynote

56
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:52,879
was titled the seven axioms of security

57
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:57,140
so I was preaching all about making

58
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:59,629
InfoSec from reactive to proactive and

59
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,518
while that is a good thing the thing I

60
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:03,828
realized while talking about this is

61
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,750
that it is just preaching it is very

62
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:09,349
hard to put this damn thing in practice

63
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:12,200
and the question that I asked kind of

64
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:15,018
formed the big dilemma that I have even

65
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:19,149
today and the question is who are you

66
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:21,889
more scared of attackers or auditors

67
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:25,549
this is the first question to ask right

68
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:29,510
and this is a dilemma that not many are

69
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:33,019
able to confront and few even are able

70
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:36,888
to you know give the correct answer to

71
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:39,049
themselves if it is the latter you know

72
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:41,870
end of talk let's just go out have a

73
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:44,959
beer and enjoy if it is the former then

74
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:47,150
I had a thesis that okay here are my

75
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,160
seven guidelines for defending an

76
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:51,739
organization and the first thing it

77
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,470
begins with the seesaw the task of the

78
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:58,579
seesaw as I said was to defend the

79
00:03:54,470 --> 00:04:02,120
organization from attackers not to

80
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:05,419
comply under the watchful eyes of the

81
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,579
auditor if we make that distinction then

82
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:10,000
the rest of this follow so yeah you

83
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:12,919
start by collecting analyzing

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,690
measurement and metrics treat your users

85
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:17,478
kindly don't you know treat them as one

86
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:21,149
size fits all and make defense visible

87
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:23,760
and all that stuff but then I saw that

88
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:28,669
in reality what happens is if you step

89
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:31,050
into like you you inherit a new role

90
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:33,180
here you're being called upon to defend

91
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,700
a new organization that you just walked

92
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:38,640
into so here we go let's Super Mario

93
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:42,030
show us the way what happens and now

94
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:45,570
it's actually with every year this role

95
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:47,520
is getting more and more relevant it's

96
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:50,580
actually the rule itself has become very

97
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,680
visible to a point that there was an

98
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,409
article on Bloomberg about a month ago

99
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,710
which states that the role which took

100
00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:02,040
about a $650,000 dollar salary and

101
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:04,890
budget to fill now takes about two point

102
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,750
two and a half million but then again

103
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,310
let's remember it's Bloomberg reporting

104
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,010
they also reported about the Super Micro

105
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:13,800
implant and all that stuff so let's take

106
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:17,219
it with a sack of salt what they say but

107
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:20,370
yeah it is it is a powerful role now so

108
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,370
as you join yeah you're you know slowly

109
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:25,860
working your way knowing your landscape

110
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:29,670
you gain visibility you gain a little

111
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:33,710
bit of action and then you get the all

112
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:35,910
powerful thing that we call budgets

113
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:38,669
now that you have budgets you've got

114
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:42,710
power and with power you got money and

115
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:46,410
then you go about spending it on several

116
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:50,760
boxes that you buy each of them bringing

117
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:53,280
questionable value and then pretty much

118
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:56,849
you maxing it out you reach the palace

119
00:05:53,280 --> 00:06:01,049
and life's a beach this is when your

120
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:02,970
defense goes into autopilot mode but

121
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,070
then you realize this is kind of like

122
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:08,550
Boy George you know everything's red

123
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:13,560
gold and green your whole damn world of

124
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:16,640
defense is high medium and low this is

125
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:20,730
what InfoSec defense has come out to be

126
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:22,849
every day I see several people battling

127
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:25,590
with all sorts of shapes and colors

128
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:28,080
either on a linear axis or on a

129
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:29,760
checkerboard axis or on whatever damn

130
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,919
visualization that you can think about

131
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,190
but there's only three colors red yellow

132
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,710
and green there's no blue there's no

133
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:41,450
violet you know is high medium and low

134
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:44,630
and your daily job ends up being how to

135
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:46,670
deescalate high to a medium and how to

136
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:50,390
deescalate a medium to a low and

137
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:53,030
everything's fine right but then you

138
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:54,710
kind of face yourself in a very Jurassic

139
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:57,020
Park situation you've got the park under

140
00:06:54,710 --> 00:07:00,219
control everything's great and the rides

141
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:03,789
are going on and well guess what

142
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:06,890
something goes horribly horribly wrong

143
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:08,360
all the dinosaurs start coming out you

144
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:11,270
never factored for them because you're

145
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,760
only focused on totaling up the number

146
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:15,140
of active dinosaurs and that total was

147
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,380
great inside Jurassic Park is a

148
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:21,140
brilliant story about the failure of

149
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,490
simple human assumption they say like

150
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,830
yeah we've got to have an X number of

151
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,760
dinosaurs in the path go ahead count for

152
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,450
them they're all there they're all

153
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,789
accounted for

154
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:30,920
they never did a total count on how many

155
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,660
living dinosaurs there were and they

156
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,880
were a lot more than what they estimated

157
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:39,680
them to be because the dinosaurs fish

158
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:41,390
DNA and replicated and suddenly new

159
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,600
threats have come to light you know and

160
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:46,099
all of a sudden these creatures pop up

161
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,490
where your products are doing your

162
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:52,220
blinky lights saying and things do not

163
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:54,860
look as as bright and beautiful as they

164
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,770
used to so while you're wondering like

165
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:59,620
how the hell did these things come about

166
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:02,930
you are now put into the hot seat and

167
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:05,030
sooner or later the board's gonna ask

168
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:07,190
you questions you gotta have to face

169
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:10,989
them and then what are you gonna do

170
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:13,100
you're like at this point of time you

171
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,080
really don't have time to think you're

172
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:19,130
just going from putting out one fire to

173
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:23,409
another until you decide like okay time

174
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:27,560
to move on and then a new world begins

175
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:29,540
you just go do it all over again but

176
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,780
then you realize that can I do something

177
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:35,690
different can I not cut this mobius

178
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:37,848
strip into two and you realize that we

179
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:39,740
will start cutting up a mobius strip the

180
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:41,780
strip actually doubles it says and that

181
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,370
is the beauty of a mobius strip it is

182
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,170
this kind of a dilemma that you can't

183
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:47,750
trying to cut into like how do I control

184
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:51,449
see this loop over here

185
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:55,230
now this is the this was the situation

186
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:58,769
that both however and I faced saying

187
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:00,240
okay Louise really just despair and call

188
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:02,420
it a day and forget it and just go back

189
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,620
to writing exploits and you know doing

190
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:07,139
IOT stuff and whatever it is

191
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,670
so however went on to doing cloud

192
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:10,829
optimization which is in fact a

193
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:13,709
fantastic thing his old game is to

194
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:15,930
reduce strain by optimizing code on the

195
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:19,380
cloud which is brilliant I still kept on

196
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:21,060
doing this thing but I decided let's

197
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,130
take a look at it like let's look at

198
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,959
everything boils down to relationships

199
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:28,259
right you want to succeed in something

200
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:30,000
let's analyze the relationships so your

201
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:33,899
seasons relationships there's there's

202
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,649
basically four camps that you working

203
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:39,810
with you have of course the policy and

204
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:42,029
the process type of relationships with

205
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,800
the board and the regulators and he was

206
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:47,600
a technical side of the relationships

207
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:50,099
with your IT vendors and your team and

208
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,860
the diagram which can best describe

209
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:56,370
these relationships has appeared in

210
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:59,459
ancient medieval texts and this is

211
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,990
what's going on and in here you're

212
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:06,599
trying to keep the whole show going and

213
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:08,339
still keep a heavy face so what's really

214
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:12,089
happened what has the current solution

215
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:15,750
been and Tom's key not also kind of nail

216
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:19,589
this really well that we've ended up

217
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:23,730
taking technical defenses to a political

218
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:28,440
problem and typically your you have like

219
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:29,790
a I would not even use a word buffet

220
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,339
because a buffet doesn't begin to

221
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:36,959
describe how many choices there are in

222
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:40,100
the InfoSec product landscape so most of

223
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:42,540
your defense decisions are made by

224
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:45,060
choosing from a market full of poor

225
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:47,610
products and the decision that ends up

226
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:51,149
being taken is that let's buy one of

227
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:56,930
each let's go for a portfolio purchased

228
00:10:51,149 --> 00:11:00,180
and you then end up with a lot of

229
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:02,640
security net on hand

230
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:05,099
and last year if you're here at 44 Khan

231
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,830
your effort shall van der Walt talk

232
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,990
about the accrual of security debt and

233
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,730
he actually put the numbers on what it

234
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:13,650
will take to pay off the interest or if

235
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:16,980
a debt goes toxic what happens to you

236
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:19,800
another fantastic train of thought but

237
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:23,310
we shall not get into that that topic in

238
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:25,260
fact it's it's only this year that I've

239
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:28,020
actually started seeing some meaningful

240
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,610
campaigns come about on LinkedIn one of

241
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,760
them campaigns is called say no to

242
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:35,130
another Pio the campaign to stop seesaws

243
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:38,670
from buying random vendor crack you know

244
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:41,100
it's it's it's actually funny but it you

245
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:43,469
can feel the frustration several

246
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,590
professionals feel that this is not

247
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:48,060
really solving the problem for us so if

248
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:50,670
you break down the problem and the

249
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:53,910
approach to the solutions we are also

250
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:58,319
noticing another pattern over here that

251
00:11:53,910 --> 00:12:01,500
in InfoSec we've built up a culture of

252
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:05,550
toil and there are two cultures over

253
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:08,160
here this was made very relevant with a

254
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:13,459
tweet that dino died so we sent out in

255
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:17,420
May and he said that today's today's

256
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:19,620
organizations in IT have scaled

257
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:22,530
extremely I mean you you now have the

258
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:24,780
fangs and you have like gigantic systems

259
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:28,790
these there's no concept of perimeter

260
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:32,939
left even like there's stuff all over

261
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:35,730
how do you start defending when code is

262
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,880
growing so rapidly and you're only

263
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:40,890
bringing toil to the defense but this is

264
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,660
also a matter of culture you know it's

265
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:45,630
it's a matter of thinking how we're

266
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:47,730
going to do our InfoSec defense and I

267
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:49,890
realized there was this diagram that was

268
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:51,720
floating around many years ago which I

269
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:54,150
have screenshotted in a lake and this is

270
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,120
the one I want to explain over here that

271
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:58,410
for any given task there's two

272
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,930
approaches to it there's the geek

273
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:03,420
approach and the non geek approach you

274
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:09,180
both start out manually to begin with

275
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:11,490
and of course with with the task size on

276
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,529
the x-axis the time taken is going to

277
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,759
scale sort of linearly

278
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:16,350
at some point the geek becomes

279
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:17,220
frustrated and say like this sucks I

280
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,889
don't want to keep on doing this

281
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:23,310
manually spends an inordinate amount of

282
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:25,769
time writing scripts and the non-key

283
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:28,138
keeps on working because they're winning

284
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:30,689
they're really achieving a lot more than

285
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:32,639
the geek is and they in fact in even

286
00:13:30,689 --> 00:13:34,649
make fun of the geeks complicated method

287
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:38,009
we've got stuff to do man waste is

288
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:40,980
sitting writing scripts but at a time of

289
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:43,439
inflection comes where you know you

290
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:46,170
suddenly start winning and the other

291
00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:49,469
dudes can't cope and this is the reality

292
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:52,680
this is what the toil culture has done

293
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:54,540
to paraphrase Dino's tweet is that the

294
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,430
problem with toil is that it's addictive

295
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:58,469
you feel like you're making progress

296
00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:01,680
because you're now busy fighting fires

297
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:04,019
and if your team is created from people

298
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,599
who prefer to toil you'll never be able

299
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:08,639
to scale with software so this is what

300
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,680
we're facing right now everything was

301
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,899
working great until a few years ago but

302
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:17,609
this is not what's gonna work for us in

303
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:19,980
the future so I didn't know like okay

304
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:22,199
what's the answers over here and at this

305
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:26,670
point I turned to three people that I've

306
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:29,519
worked with as a vendor as a part of

307
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:33,389
their core InfoSec team and as a very

308
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,430
good friend with with British Telecom

309
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:36,870
with Zions Bank and with Commerce Bank

310
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:39,779
and these are the lessons I've learned

311
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:41,730
from talking not only to several of the

312
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:44,279
team members but also to these leaders

313
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:49,259
directly and then we realize that okay

314
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:50,430
there is a way out of this so first I'm

315
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:53,309
going to share with you some thoughts

316
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:57,620
put together the first thought was that

317
00:14:53,309 --> 00:15:02,309
let us recognize what we call as the

318
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:06,449
cybersecurity asymmetry dilemma there is

319
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:09,829
a camp of halves and there is a camp of

320
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:14,748
have-nots in terms of cybersecurity

321
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:18,420
capabilities the haves are capable of

322
00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:20,639
custom stuff they're able to do custom

323
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:23,459
analytics custom threat detection and

324
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:26,519
custom response and they're able to rise

325
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:27,719
to meet the cybersecurity challenges on

326
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:30,390
their own

327
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:34,590
the have-nots are not capable of pulling

328
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:37,290
this thing off from within and this

329
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:42,300
begins by recognizing what cybersecurity

330
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:43,890
is do you own your own cybersecurity do

331
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,880
you treat it as an issue that is worth

332
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:47,340
fighting for

333
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:52,290
or do you treat it as a necessary evil

334
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:57,360
it goes back to the first dilemma the

335
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:59,969
camp of basically the camp of haves they

336
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,490
have in a way it appears that they have

337
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:04,470
sucked up all the talent and they're

338
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:07,890
able to pull things off and the talent

339
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:10,950
stays there and the others are purely

340
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:13,920
dependent upon commercial solutions now

341
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:17,880
how do you cross that bridge and this is

342
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:22,740
key and this was a very interesting

343
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:24,840
revelation that was pointed about by one

344
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:28,530
of the leaders themselves is the key in

345
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:31,530
succeeding is to figure out how to own

346
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:34,170
your own cybersecurity and how do you

347
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:37,199
get the talent to do custom stuff for

348
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:41,729
you and this can only happen when you

349
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:46,080
build swarm intelligence to understand

350
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:47,910
this it took me a while I had to embark

351
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,550
upon a journey which I never liked to do

352
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:53,100
that is read about management and

353
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:55,949
leadership I am NOT one of those guys I

354
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,720
mean I am a get your hands dirty suck

355
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:59,910
firmware of chips get kind of a guy

356
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:04,230
which I am learning from Barry by the

357
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:05,760
way he's sitting here so like how does a

358
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:08,099
guy like this start building up swarm

359
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,730
intelligence you all heard of the

360
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:15,089
Maslow's pyramid of needs and how human

361
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:16,860
needs drive human evolutions but there

362
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:19,770
is a better model than that and this

363
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:21,540
model I spent about a week learning this

364
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:24,599
model and I really like this model and

365
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:27,810
this model is Claire Graves's model of

366
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:31,919
spiral dynamics and this is a model

367
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:36,679
which essentially discusses evolution by

368
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:39,880
values and evolution by culture and

369
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:42,370
identifies several stages in the

370
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:45,730
you kind of going from survival mode to

371
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:48,668
tribal mode to ego trips and power trips

372
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:51,669
to conformity and everything being

373
00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:55,750
rule-based and dogmatic to being an

374
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:59,080
achiever and excellence driver to a

375
00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:01,480
community person and eventually what you

376
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,580
really want to do is as you go up the

377
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,309
spiral your getting into higher and

378
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:09,668
higher orbits where you now kind of

379
00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:11,350
cross doors from personal needs to trans

380
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:13,270
personal needs and this is when you

381
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:16,780
start achieving the yellow and the blue

382
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:19,240
spirals is when you really focus upon

383
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:23,080
creating what is called the hive mind

384
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:25,510
you are now no longer viewing yourself

385
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:29,710
as an individual but you're viewing

386
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:31,600
yourself as a part of the swarm working

387
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:34,539
with a swan depending upon the swamp

388
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,360
going with the swarm you are able to

389
00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:39,158
adapt to another person's need or the

390
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,729
team's need or the organizations need

391
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:46,090
and you take the whole view together

392
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:48,429
your your in a holistic mode so it's

393
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:52,120
basically up to the leader to

394
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:55,350
essentially grow the team into the hive

395
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:58,989
mind and the idea is you set the swarm

396
00:18:55,350 --> 00:19:01,418
to tackle any obstacle they will figure

397
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:02,830
out how to do this you don't have to

398
00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:04,360
tell them how to do it they'll figure it

399
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:06,480
out and they'll tackle it the best

400
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:09,908
because the swarm mind works way better

401
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:13,299
than a single individuals mind all you

402
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:15,730
have to do is become the catalyst start

403
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:18,610
identifying where your team members are

404
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:23,409
in various stages of evolution without

405
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:26,168
judgment and just spiral them up you

406
00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:29,740
essentially just select your goals which

407
00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:31,690
are just worth fighting for and the

408
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:35,830
swarm will happen the swarm will work

409
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:38,950
for you to me I like the I like a

410
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:41,530
slightly different analogy better is the

411
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:43,720
analogy of electrons and orbits the more

412
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:46,059
excited electron gets the higher orbit

413
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,830
is to achieve so if you start adding

414
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,480
energy to electrons they become more

415
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,840
excited and they start achieving higher

416
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,400
orbits and

417
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,970
have like really really high energy

418
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,460
levels at work over here there is a

419
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:59,930
danger to this whole thing it takes a

420
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:02,900
very long time to get up to the top

421
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:05,750
spirals but there's something called the

422
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:08,620
downward spiral which will like spiral

423
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:11,750
down down the toilet really quick and

424
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:14,570
deorbiting is a thing it does not take

425
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:17,740
much for something to fall out of place

426
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:20,360
and the whole swarm starts the orbiting

427
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:23,510
the Cascade effect is really really

428
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:26,419
quick I have seen teams fragment in a

429
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:28,010
matter of weeks what I've taken years to

430
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:32,800
build up good team so it doesn't really

431
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:38,750
take much to do it and this is where all

432
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:42,139
hinges upon the leader it's about you as

433
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:45,980
a leader keeping it together what does

434
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:48,920
it take to do that so your first focus

435
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:51,650
is on once you've built this spiral how

436
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:55,040
do you nurture the spiral and there's

437
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:57,550
four aspects to it the first is a

438
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:00,080
reflective aspect like who are you and

439
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:04,129
it's a very key thing to reflect upon

440
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:06,169
what you are and what you're doing the

441
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:11,180
next is all about protecting the swarm

442
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:14,900
there's a fragile system third it's all

443
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:17,960
about empowering the swarm unless you

444
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:20,780
see yourself as a part of it you're not

445
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,850
going to be able to empower it you as a

446
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:25,580
leader or not different than the swarm

447
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:29,360
you are the swarm there's an equal

448
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:32,659
footing and fourth is with external

449
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:36,469
entities you need to form really really

450
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:40,550
strong partnerships so let's look up on

451
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:45,110
each of these stages one by one let's

452
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:48,580
talk about reflection who do you see

453
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:53,959
yourself as and there are several

454
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:55,970
dimensions are you a catalyst you see

455
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:59,000
yourself separate you see yourselves

456
00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:01,160
superior than the team do you have a sky

457
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,010
is falling attitude are you more focused

458
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:06,650
upon capabilities are you pushing

459
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:12,100
with the business are you resisting are

460
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:15,770
you transparent do you listen you trust

461
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:18,500
do you bring about trust these are all

462
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:21,889
the questions you need to ask and figure

463
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:26,390
out where you are when it comes to your

464
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:31,520
swarm you need to define what the core

465
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:34,130
DNA of the swarm is and this is what I

466
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:37,100
wanna quote what uhnope said it best is

467
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:40,280
categorized as a skilled bunch of

468
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:43,629
anarchists this is not a homogeneous

469
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:47,570
group of InfoSec professions we are all

470
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:49,070
very different to one another we cannot

471
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:50,270
be more different than one another we

472
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:54,470
have different educational backgrounds

473
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:56,360
of different geographical backgrounds we

474
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:58,040
don't have degrees we just fear because

475
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:01,100
we like doing these things and we are

476
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:03,710
able to rise up to challenges and now

477
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:06,800
how do you keep this incredibly diverse

478
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:09,500
bunch together so when you're building

479
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:12,110
up your team what is the definition that

480
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:15,560
you're giving to your team in the eyes

481
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:18,290
of the larger corporate you're basically

482
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:21,159
working on building a center of

483
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:23,570
excellence for all of technical security

484
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,100
you're not building an InfoSec team

485
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:29,360
you're building a center of excellence

486
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:30,889
and as a leader your job that you're

487
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,949
going to the your job is to communicate

488
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:35,630
to the powers-that-be

489
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:37,340
about the shape of the thing that you're

490
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,620
building and you're not going to be able

491
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:44,659
to do it instantly you'll have to take

492
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:46,790
them from their view creatively keep you

493
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:48,590
know keeping a few things behind the

494
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:51,290
curtain keeping a few things in front of

495
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:52,760
the curtain keep managing the show until

496
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:54,950
you've built this thing up in the

497
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:59,570
background and then once you pull the

498
00:23:54,950 --> 00:24:02,800
curtain apart you open the curtain the

499
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:05,780
rest of the organization will become so

500
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:08,629
so dependent upon your expertise you

501
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:11,660
you'll be the InfoSec Oracle's make

502
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:14,240
people come to you for advice and how to

503
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:17,510
do things and they will view you as a

504
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,580
source of knowledge wisdom experience

505
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:22,250
and then you've got purchase you've got

506
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:24,080
you've got buy into all your ideas being

507
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:26,390
implemented you will not be pushed back

508
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,460
upon so it's going to take a little

509
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:30,520
while but what you've effectively done

510
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:33,440
is you've built an independent

511
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:35,540
consultancy within the organization

512
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:40,490
with the stress on independence you

513
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:44,990
cannot be biased when it comes to

514
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:47,240
protecting the sworn like I mentioned

515
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:50,510
earlier the first thing you have to do

516
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:53,690
is kind of like the swamp built let the

517
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:55,490
swamp build up by creatively insulating

518
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:57,530
it against forces that might initially

519
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:59,270
try to destroy it so as you're down on

520
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,200
the spiral ants growing up it's it's

521
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:02,929
very fragile

522
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:06,950
only when it becomes a real swarm will

523
00:25:02,929 --> 00:25:10,880
it be able to resist any any problems

524
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:15,490
that might face in the only way to

525
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:17,900
instill trust is by honesty and openness

526
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:20,780
you got to be totally honest with your

527
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:23,660
teammates cuz you're one of them if you

528
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:26,000
start you know showing different views

529
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:28,360
to different people it's gonna break the

530
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,590
honesty the spiral is gonna break and

531
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,549
it's all gonna crack it's all going to

532
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:34,309
start falling apart

533
00:25:31,549 --> 00:25:36,440
one fine day and the other thing that's

534
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:38,270
gonna happen which will not be of any of

535
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:41,750
your doing but it's just a reality of

536
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:44,210
what the InfoSec scene is today and we

537
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:46,220
all know we were playing a very very

538
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:49,850
dangerous game here right we're pen

539
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:52,400
testers or with defenders we're playing

540
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:54,260
with real things we're not playing with

541
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,890
you 80 systems mind you everything is in

542
00:25:54,260 --> 00:26:00,410
scope don't get me started on scope but

543
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:03,980
when you're playing with real stuff it's

544
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:05,929
a matter of when and not if that

545
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:13,400
something really really bad is going to

546
00:26:05,929 --> 00:26:16,370
happen you will take down like a bakery

547
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:26,150
machine that processes about 200

548
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:28,309
kilograms of bread every hour yes you

549
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:31,530
will take down some really really fancy

550
00:26:28,309 --> 00:26:34,260
stuff and people are not gonna be happy

551
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:40,260
and at that time you say that oh I just

552
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:42,480
ran an nmap scan and what went wrong so

553
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:45,629
you this little little boy who started

554
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,240
their InfoSec career and asking like I

555
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:51,660
didn't do anything man like the citizen

556
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:55,320
just broke I looked at it and what do

557
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:57,020
you do as an InfoSec leader yes don't

558
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,200
throw him under the bus this is when

559
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:02,790
your resilience your integrity your

560
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:05,790
moral ground is going to be tested quite

561
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:09,120
a lot this is when you have a face of

562
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:09,770
music keep your team insulated keep him

563
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,080
away

564
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:13,680
step up saying okay you know what

565
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,080
has happened

566
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,270
you're not going to downplay it I'm

567
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,800
going to sweep it under the rug

568
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:23,070
centrifuge have broken down you know all

569
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:24,780
that stuff hopefully your bosses are not

570
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:27,540
the kind who are gonna put you in front

571
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:30,240
of an anti-aircraft gun there will be a

572
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:32,370
voice of reason and eventually you're

573
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,430
gonna write this out cause time heals

574
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:37,800
you know mistakes will be made and

575
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:41,610
mistakes must be made for learning to

576
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:43,290
happen so the message that all these

577
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:44,879
three leaders told me that they let the

578
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:47,520
team make mistakes like you go ahead and

579
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,650
make mistakes make make many mistakes

580
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,110
make new mistakes but don't make the

581
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:55,380
same goddamn mistake again that's the

582
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:57,030
idea you can learn but this doesn't mean

583
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,260
that there are blank checks in the

584
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:00,389
industry there's this God will be a

585
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:02,430
little bit of checks and balance you

586
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:05,130
know not not everything can be a bunch

587
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:08,040
of reckless Cowboys going pulling things

588
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:12,930
down as they please but by and large

589
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:16,290
this thing works the other big danger to

590
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:19,200
your swarm is going to be the whole bad

591
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:22,440
apples right but this is best described

592
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:26,190
by a tweet I saw in August it's called

593
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,990
the blockchain of toxic it is the only

594
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:32,730
application of blockchain that I really

595
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:35,250
like once you get to toxic people that's

596
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:39,090
it game over everything's everything's

597
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:42,450
ruined so be very very watchful of

598
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:44,600
politics going on so I'm out when if

599
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:46,340
it's a larger organization there

600
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,659
several compliance level duties at

601
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,980
they're more cut out for and stay

602
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:52,880
commander an auditor and there will be

603
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:54,800
great the other thing you ought to do is

604
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,510
you better empower the swarm otherwise

605
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:59,930
you realize that the emperor has no

606
00:28:56,510 --> 00:29:01,700
clothes you know if your team isn't able

607
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:03,980
to call you out on the rubbish that

608
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,480
you're spewing if you can't just you

609
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:07,190
know go out for a coffee or go out for a

610
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,080
drink and see eye-to-eye with everyone

611
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:10,610
on the same footing and say you know

612
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,189
what Sami you're you're full of if

613
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:15,320
my teammates can't tell me this and I'm

614
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:17,090
doing something completely wrong and I

615
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:20,330
better be really really really scared

616
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:22,850
about it the last thing about

617
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:24,560
partnerships I don't need to tell you

618
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:28,070
folks more a lot of you are here in the

619
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:30,169
UK and I have been very fortunate to be

620
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:32,689
parts of events such as Snoop corn and

621
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:35,080
the Comets bank guys run something

622
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:38,090
called voodoo and the Garofalo village

623
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:40,370
this is a classic example where these

624
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:43,520
InfoSec teams have gone out and built

625
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:45,320
solid partnerships with vendors like how

626
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,570
do you keep the knowledge level high in

627
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,159
your swarm you can only teach them so

628
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:51,560
much but they can learn only so much on

629
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,820
the job but you have Google partnerships

630
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,220
you're working with a lot of vendors

631
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:57,950
you're working with a lot of you know

632
00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:00,440
events such as these learn from him

633
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:02,210
build synergies they'll bring a lot more

634
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,450
to the tables surround yourself with

635
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:08,480
smart people and this is how you grow

636
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:10,130
capabilities in the team and then my

637
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,530
next question was okay so like how do

638
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:14,330
you go about recruiting and all of them

639
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:17,000
said that you do all this the talents

640
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:18,830
going to come to you it's it's this the

641
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,570
swarm will bring more like-minded

642
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:25,490
individuals in and kind of automatically

643
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:27,350
not bring the people who are over who

644
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:30,500
who don't want to be a part of it and

645
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:32,810
their whole thing was that we all like

646
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:34,880
to work with people that we like you

647
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:37,340
know you you go in on a daily basis

648
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,020
you do your job you're working with your

649
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:43,820
teammates you're learning from them

650
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:45,560
you're supporting them like I was

651
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:47,210
talking about firmware extraction and

652
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,679
the tweet I got from one of the folks

653
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:51,440
who is doing the lock-picking thing is

654
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:54,020
like yeah I don't know how to do it but

655
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:58,080
but my colleague I just you know send

656
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:59,910
them the chip over over over mail

657
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,350
and then just send me a pendrive back

658
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:03,570
with the firmware extracted you know

659
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:05,669
it's like black box as a service this is

660
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:07,889
what teammates can do for you and this

661
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:09,030
is why you love working there and you

662
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:14,850
know you don't want to change this thing

663
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:17,940
up so this kind of brings me to the

664
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:22,590
title of the talk so really what is the

665
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:26,300
C source dilemma and at the core there's

666
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:29,879
only one choice that you have to make

667
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:36,530
you to pick a side and whose side you

668
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:36,530
pick your own side or your team side

669
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:43,050
there is there are there are roads ahead

670
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:46,139
for both of these if you pick your own

671
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:48,980
side it has a growth story no doubt

672
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:52,410
about it it's an individual growth story

673
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:55,170
you definitely will be facing the mario

674
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:58,200
mobius sure you will be like kind of

675
00:31:55,170 --> 00:32:00,480
grow in terms of your finances or powers

676
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:04,890
or organizational reach but you'll still

677
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:07,920
be within the same loop or you can

678
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:10,590
decide to take the team side build up

679
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:12,750
this one stand on shoulders of giants

680
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:14,129
and they'll take you to Heights which

681
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:16,080
you've never really dreamed about

682
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:22,920
dreamed about and it's all going to work

683
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:25,909
together the the thing with this seesaws

684
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:31,440
dilemma is you need to make this choice

685
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:33,240
very very early on in your careers which

686
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,310
side you're gonna take you can't you

687
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:37,110
can't hedge this you have to make a very

688
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:39,450
clear choice and there are trade-offs I

689
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:42,060
mean I am an entrepreneur I've had to

690
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:44,070
make a certain decision about whether I

691
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:46,679
just keep on doing my technical thing

692
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:48,300
which I really really like I mean who

693
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,770
doesn't like to get into the depths and

694
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:52,770
the nitty gritties and learn something

695
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:56,639
new right or should I give up my depths

696
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:58,950
and take on the breads drive a bigger

697
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:02,220
story see the forest as opposed to the

698
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:04,890
trees and let the swarm take on depth

699
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,600
more than I have imagined and we take we

700
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:07,200
be able to tackle every challenge

701
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:11,219
therein

702
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,000
so Who am I Who am I as a person am I

703
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,160
the person who

704
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,680
be able to take the bread dry the stat

705
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:19,710
strategy and that to also with my

706
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:21,480
technical expertise and background or do

707
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:24,570
I just stick in the depths you know it

708
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:27,360
there's no judgment here but we've seen

709
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:30,330
the team side what the team's can do for

710
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:33,679
you and lastly I want to say that okay

711
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:36,330
if you do choose to be on your own side

712
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:38,430
then again it's a matter of faith and

713
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:41,040
not if it's a matter of when and not if

714
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:43,710
that time is going to come very you're

715
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,790
on your own you want to be between a

716
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:49,650
rock and a hard place

717
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:52,500
and here the best advice is what

718
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:54,840
apparently Khrushchev gave to a

719
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:59,130
successor as he was stepping out you

720
00:33:54,840 --> 00:34:01,560
know yeah you you basically say that

721
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:04,470
okay man you're stepping up there's two

722
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:06,510
letters in my drawer if you get stuck

723
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:06,900
open the letters and they'll help you

724
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:10,560
out

725
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:13,110
so Brezhnev got stuck sure enough open

726
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,210
the letter first letter said blame it

727
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:17,419
all on me so you blame it all on the old

728
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:20,610
man and everything worked you know great

729
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:22,980
but then you get stuck again open the

730
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:29,120
second letter say sit down and write two

731
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:31,230
more letters so with this I conclude

732
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,888
thank you very much for your time and

733
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:35,280
attention

734
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:37,050
open for questions criticisms for

735
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,350
whatever else you may have thank you

736
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:39,350
very much

737
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:53,079
have at it I hate those days clearly

738
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:56,769
you've got a spiritual model of what I

739
00:34:53,079 --> 00:35:01,869
would perhaps call ethics yes and this

740
00:34:56,768 --> 00:35:05,788
is what David Lacey who originally wrote

741
00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:09,789
ISO 27001 s forebears

742
00:35:05,789 --> 00:35:11,799
calls the metaphysical model so you are

743
00:35:09,789 --> 00:35:15,809
building on the shoulders of giants

744
00:35:11,799 --> 00:35:19,210
thank you thank you very much yes it is

745
00:35:15,809 --> 00:35:22,569
yes the core word over here is is ethics

746
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:24,400
and values and I think at some point you

747
00:35:22,569 --> 00:35:28,779
realize that this is what all that

748
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:30,849
matters really you any others

749
00:35:28,779 --> 00:35:33,099
I'm sorry I'm not able to see through

750
00:35:30,849 --> 00:35:35,200
the lights to to the to the last rows

751
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:37,479
but if you have yeah wave your hands

752
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:43,439
like shout Elena's going to come with

753
00:35:37,479 --> 00:35:47,890
the mic and my god have done something

754
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:52,289
horribly wrong to get silence okay I

755
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:52,288
think there's a another yeah go for it

756
00:35:52,829 --> 00:36:00,759
or just a random question so if you face

757
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:02,170
in the dilemma of being the first CEO of

758
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:04,059
the organization you haven't to build

759
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:06,609
your team what's the guidance that you

760
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:08,799
offer on that I'm making sure as we said

761
00:36:06,609 --> 00:36:11,200
you don't get those bad apples when you

762
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:13,269
stand out you doing the first recruit

763
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,759
the first one to recruits the first kind

764
00:36:13,269 --> 00:36:19,209
of how do you ensure that you start off

765
00:36:15,759 --> 00:36:21,460
on the right foot so your question how

766
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:29,440
do you start your starting at level zero

767
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:31,450
like Kung Fu Panda right I mean starting

768
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,569
building the team yeah when when you

769
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:36,339
like okay I need to build a new team

770
00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:37,808
I've struggled with that question I will

771
00:36:36,339 --> 00:36:39,009
tell you my intrapreneur side of the

772
00:36:37,809 --> 00:36:42,430
story here

773
00:36:39,009 --> 00:36:45,279
I started in 2002 a running led square

774
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:47,649
we have three people it's a very very

775
00:36:45,279 --> 00:36:50,140
fragile situation when you're about less

776
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:51,599
than 10 people things keep on changing a

777
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:55,680
lot so

778
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:57,569
it's like try rinse repeat you gain a

779
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:01,078
few people you lose a few people you'll

780
00:36:57,569 --> 00:37:03,839
just have to hopefully get lucky with a

781
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:06,660
couple of core left tenants that you end

782
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:08,880
up and your job will be to very quickly

783
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:11,368
empower them as soon as possible and

784
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,440
start sharing the vision together the

785
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:15,779
moment you get individuals with shared

786
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,650
vision is that's when you win it took me

787
00:37:15,779 --> 00:37:21,449
11 years to pull that off but that's

788
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:24,089
because I am an incredibly hard person

789
00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:29,099
to work with so it's it's it's on me not

790
00:37:24,089 --> 00:37:30,749
I I have my flaws and weaknesses and

791
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:32,819
I've learned that over the years and

792
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:36,779
I've seen in the past sort of kind of

793
00:37:32,819 --> 00:37:38,839
undone to speed up the process but yeah

794
00:37:36,779 --> 00:37:41,640
the moment you get like two or three

795
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:43,558
individuals with shared vision that's

796
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,660
when things will start happening pretty

797
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:47,940
much an autopilot mode when it comes to

798
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:50,459
the growth until then you just have to

799
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:55,170
keep on playing playing the rounds and

800
00:37:50,459 --> 00:37:58,589
making it Meaghan go initially try and

801
00:37:55,170 --> 00:38:01,170
put interesting challenges for your team

802
00:37:58,589 --> 00:38:02,880
to solve like if you start building a

803
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:04,549
team and just start stacking them with

804
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,680
compliance jobs they're gonna run away

805
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:09,599
it's not gonna work say okay you know

806
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:13,499
let's build some open-source software to

807
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:15,719
you know identify all processes running

808
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:18,118
on every system in our organization

809
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:21,119
that's what Facebook did and came up

810
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:22,559
with os query open source list it's like

811
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,599
they said we want to have a sequel

812
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:26,759
Search possible on all processes running

813
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:29,039
on any system on any platform in our

814
00:38:26,759 --> 00:38:30,749
organization so start working on some

815
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:33,059
challenges start keeping the interest

816
00:38:30,749 --> 00:38:34,499
going and then you have okay you like

817
00:38:33,059 --> 00:38:36,089
building something you're doing your day

818
00:38:34,499 --> 00:38:37,979
job which may or may not be really

819
00:38:36,089 --> 00:38:39,479
