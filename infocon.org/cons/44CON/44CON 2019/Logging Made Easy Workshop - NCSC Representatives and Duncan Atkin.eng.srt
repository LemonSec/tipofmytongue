1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:06,670
you

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:09,549
oh hi I'm Martin I'm security architects

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,900
at the NC NC s ce I'm joined with Adam

4
00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:13,750
he's also a security architect and

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,780
Duncan from NCC group whose developer

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:22,390
that's been helping us on this project

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:26,500
so give you the plant the conference

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:28,539
guide had this as our photos as you can

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:34,539
see we're not Restless unfortunately but

10
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:36,519
still pretty big I'm a bit I'm like I'm

11
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:41,670
too young to really know who these guys

12
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:41,670
are but finally I Jim the anvil Neidhart

13
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:52,328
sergeant slaughter yeah so every day is

14
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:55,030
a school day cool so what we can do over

15
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:59,109
the next two hours give you a few

16
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,530
minutes of introduction to logging why

17
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:02,350
we do it

18
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:07,360
what logging made easy is Adams going to

19
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:09,310
run through the installation guide we've

20
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,929
got some videos to show you we won't get

21
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,160
you doing that bit because that's not

22
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,440
the interesting part

23
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,910
so we'll kind of breeze over that bit

24
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,179
and then you've got an hour and a half

25
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:21,330
we've got a lab environment that you can

26
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:24,520
access to get hands-on with some data

27
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,560
have play around with the helps that

28
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,060
we've got and then we'll have a bit of

29
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,770
time for a wrap-up but you and some

30
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:37,260
questions if you've got them so why does

31
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:40,750
long math why do we do it like a simple

32
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:42,400
kind of start place is for operation all

33
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:46,780
that health data so if you've got your

34
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,040
you've got an environment knowing when

35
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,800
things are alive when things have gone

36
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:53,200
down why your users can't access the

37
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,640
internet things like that if you've got

38
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,640
some logging capability that'll have

39
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,820
answer some of those questions in the

40
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:05,409
event of a cyber incident it gives you a

41
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:09,639
host more functionality so you can work

42
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:12,880
out or try and work out what happened

43
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:15,519
and it's logging is the first step on

44
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,269
the journey to security monitoring so if

45
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,950
you

46
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:20,500
if you think about it almost as a

47
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:23,679
maturity model where logging is the kind

48
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:30,870
of first step towards things like throw

49
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:33,010
hunting and more more capable stuff

50
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,770
logging made easy

51
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,410
so rather than a product it's more of an

52
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:40,810
architectural pattern and a series of

53
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:43,720
guys that we've created to show you how

54
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:45,490
to do host-based logging for your

55
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,670
enterprise environment so we're using

56
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:54,160
it's all open source freely available

57
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:57,970
tools like this one and elastic the aim

58
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,950
being this is for if you if you have no

59
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,770
capability at all so if you already have

60
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:06,250
a seam we're not saying throw it away

61
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:09,010
and use that this this is a something to

62
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:11,050
complement that or if you have if you

63
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:15,100
don't have anything this is a good place

64
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:16,630
to slice fairly cheap with basically all

65
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:21,700
you're paying for is a small amount of

66
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:23,320
computing storage to you know obviously

67
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,339
if you've got a huge environment you're

68
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,700
trying to run this on then it's gonna

69
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,410
cost you a little bit more which yep

70
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,810
you're trying to reduce the technical

71
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,760
barrier and we've got a bunch of scripts

72
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,430
and documentation that we can you can

73
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,709
access that also you how to how to set

74
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,910
this up how to install it and in the

75
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:45,010
future we're gonna look at a bit more

76
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:47,680
into throw hunting how to to do that so

77
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:50,290
I'm gonna pass on to Adam now who is

78
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:56,980
going to go through the installation

79
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:59,170
guys so quick quick show of hands before

80
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:02,170
we crack on with video um is anybody

81
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:06,429
looks at documentation before today one

82
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:08,019
a few hands issue so it's it all

83
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:10,080
documentation is in markdown on github

84
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:13,600
so it's freely available you go to the

85
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,940
github comm all slice you can see a c4

86
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,829
sus and LM a it's all available there

87
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,988
but we'll talk through the the first

88
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:22,330
three of the four chapters the fourth

89
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:24,900
chapter is download Jason file uploads

90
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:26,800
Jason file it's pretty boring but

91
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:30,008
essentially what we're trying to do is

92
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,960
use built in window components

93
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:36,009
built and download other Microsoft

94
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:38,349
services to enable event collection and

95
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:41,439
forwarding to a new server that you

96
00:04:38,349 --> 00:04:43,210
build yourself so then that then for is

97
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,770
it via a win log beat on to

98
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,508
elasticsearch especially what we're

99
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:49,808
trying to do here so the way I see

100
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:52,210
logger made easy I kind of think of it

101
00:04:49,809 --> 00:04:55,629
like a pizza so you could either spend a

102
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:57,039
lot of money phone up a pizza delivery

103
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:59,229
company of your choice and it'll be

104
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:00,308
there within 20 minutes or you can use

105
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:02,830
the things you already have in your

106
00:05:00,309 --> 00:05:06,430
house for very little money as long as

107
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:07,568
you willing to spend a day or so to and

108
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,149
they put all the ingredients together

109
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:12,279
proof need and all the rest of it so

110
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:14,080
that's kind of how I see a LeMay it's

111
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:18,210
it's your choice whether to spend 20

112
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:22,498
minutes or six hours essentially so

113
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:25,448
chapter one has a few steps so we talk

114
00:05:22,499 --> 00:05:27,639
there's three GPO policies we need to

115
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:30,610
apply so one of them is for the clients

116
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:32,979
or clients one of them for the server

117
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,330
and one of them's for the clients to do

118
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:39,008
a scheduled tasks to download and update

119
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:42,159
this one and the scheduled by the XML

120
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:42,849
file for the capability for sis mom so

121
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:44,800
what we're doing here

122
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:47,680
we're importing a GPO that you download

123
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:51,759
as part of their documentation this is a

124
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,039
GPO server I think I said this is

125
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,419
available these videos are slightly out

126
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:58,330
of date because we are updating it at

127
00:05:55,419 --> 00:06:02,229
the moment so don't if you are trying to

128
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:04,120
install it don't follow this video to

129
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:07,240
the letter proper videos will be coming

130
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,399
out a few weeks time don't quote me that

131
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:13,120
but yes there will be videos but before

132
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:14,830
there's a question so again we've now

133
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,129
important the client to that group

134
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:21,909
policy into that operational user that

135
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:24,519
domain so this particular video is five

136
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:26,620
minutes long with multiple different

137
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:29,050
stages the second videos around the same

138
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,909
time so you can if you know what you're

139
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:34,449
doing you know how to implement and work

140
00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:36,490
with group policy objects you kind of

141
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:38,649
saw enemy in about 20 minutes time but

142
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:39,579
it can be done the long time you're

143
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:41,409
really doing is waiting for the

144
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:43,919
scheduled tasks runs and the machines to

145
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:43,919
start beginning

146
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:50,770
yeah again this is for the server and

147
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:55,509
now if I try skip on a bit again so we

148
00:06:50,770 --> 00:07:00,940
have oh just pause it I finna boots or

149
00:06:55,509 --> 00:07:02,710
pausing practice so this point bhupati's

150
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,509
have imported I'm not using the active

151
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:07,388
directory to apply those machines

152
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:08,889
through WMI filtering so they apply them

153
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:13,630
to the actual policies that only

154
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:17,169
policies that I've created yeah you see

155
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:20,620
them here web client and web server and

156
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:31,930
I'm adding those clients into the that

157
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:33,970
oh you and we go on and one of the GPO

158
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:36,009
objects the client one you need to

159
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:38,349
update and edit it this is all

160
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:41,050
documented of course but you just need

161
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:44,080
to say where the events are going to be

162
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:46,840
sent to so your whack collector so it be

163
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,219
whack dot your domain or whatever you

164
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,849
want to call it but you just need to

165
00:07:48,220 --> 00:08:00,699
update it in the actual log or the

166
00:07:51,849 --> 00:08:01,990
policy so we're trying to make this

167
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:03,250
workshop as much about the data as

168
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,210
rather than the installation but you

169
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:07,810
can't really skip over the installation

170
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:09,219
unfortunately if anybody has tried to

171
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,240
install it or know somebody has tried to

172
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,919
install it and there's any sort of

173
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,289
specific problems you have had with it

174
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:21,039
come speak to us on during the the

175
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:23,590
hands-on point know so so so the actual

176
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:26,349
workshop hands-on part it'll be a web

177
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:28,750
URL that you'd be able to go to no you

178
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:30,460
don't need to do any installation this

179
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,780
is why we didn't do the actual

180
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,189
installation as part of the workshop

181
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,870
because everybody's domain is slightly

182
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:37,029
different takes different everybody's

183
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:40,020
got different capabilities etc if you

184
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:42,279
don't have any a laptop with you then

185
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,319
you may not get the most out of the

186
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:45,490
workshop however if you do want to see

187
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,890
what the data looks like

188
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:49,089
then I'm sure Duncan can talk through

189
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,770
some of the steps and what actually

190
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:53,650
looks like and what the dashboards are

191
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:56,949
pre-built so this is where actually

192
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:57,750
updating the configurations this is the

193
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:09,480
web testing

194
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:11,640
enemy song on this pit we are deploying

195
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:15,930
gpo's that configure looks like win RM

196
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:18,569
which is all the native forwarding this

197
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:20,520
is on the main controller yeah I mean so

198
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:22,230
the client speed configuration settings

199
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,790
say we're gonna send the loss - yeah

200
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,440
I'll just need Windows Firewall rules

201
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,449
and things like that so I will send it

202
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,620
and then the server horses have one win

203
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:33,270
RM service started the ventilation so it

204
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,430
started so they'll and lots of actually

205
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:37,710
be able to be received yes so that's

206
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:40,020
what these GPL is doing and this setting

207
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:52,140
here is one of the one of a few you've

208
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:54,360
got set the group policy the lobby

209
00:09:52,140 --> 00:10:04,530
either they will install that policy

210
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:08,730
yeah yeah so patent not in this release

211
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:10,589
is in release community yet I think

212
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,810
Lee's extensible so if you say oh I

213
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:14,100
don't see us via certain events by want

214
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:16,250
to have that included as well then you

215
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,720
can upgrade that then have that data

216
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,339
obviously the more date you add more

217
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,380
like to see more data flow you need to

218
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:26,580
think provide on your network so it

219
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,580
might be fine for on-site but if you

220
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,930
have lots of remote users Holly ever

221
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:33,089
they dollar maybe to download their

222
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,079
emails and that's it and you don't wanna

223
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:36,210
be slowing their Machine down because

224
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,460
then the user experiences them impacted

225
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,780
it obviously the the overheads that

226
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,080
we've tested with the the default

227
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:45,270
configuration overhead is pretty low

228
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:47,550
there's not much notables from a user

229
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:49,350
standpoint no overhead but if you then

230
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:52,729
start upping the data and that's going

231
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:57,900
to be problems so it's a risk cost based

232
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:58,800
decision again so yeah we've kind of

233
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,510
already talked about that so we've

234
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,120
imported the GPO is create the OU's with

235
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:04,319
each link link that's two together so as

236
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,770
I said early this is along the active

237
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,470
domain

238
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:11,569
stretchy sorry and then here we run in

239
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:16,160
the wacky tail

240
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:20,030
I see it was impossible to say actually

241
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,740
so this what you're talking about and

242
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:23,480
then some there's some verify steps as

243
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:26,180
well so end of each chapter say can you

244
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,100
see this can you see that so for example

245
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:31,010
for this one we want to make sure if you

246
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:33,020
go to the event viewer you can see you

247
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:34,400
for the events so normally it's empty

248
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,910
but when you start doing this kind of

249
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,910
behaviour

250
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,910
so chapter 2 this is all on the web

251
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:48,219
server that you just provision to built

252
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:48,219
and has previously defined within the

253
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,530
previous group policy of the clients you

254
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,210
need to tell miss this one we need

255
00:11:54,530 --> 00:12:01,430
stanwyk check we need to download an

256
00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:02,510
update file bash script and they they

257
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,310
actually need to go on the actors are

258
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:06,770
actually as part of assist for directory

259
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:09,800
structure so the this is to facilitate

260
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:10,760
the schedule tasks on the clients so as

261
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,560
the clients say it

262
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,740
I know twelve o'clock every day they run

263
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,900
the update script see check make sure

264
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,520
that the hashes are the latest version

265
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,800
it's not then it Bala is a lit and

266
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,020
reinstalls a new version of Cisco so we

267
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:28,040
found earlier in the year that when we

268
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:30,530
originally launched enemy this one was a

269
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,270
version eight I think it was and then

270
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:34,069
Mike Russell a bitch without any sort of

271
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:37,819
prior notice just went this this one 10

272
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:39,710
e so we have since spoken to Microsoft

273
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,760
and we've kind of gently asked them to

274
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:43,960
let us know if they can update that

275
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:46,100
system just so he could then start

276
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,330
thinking about that maybe a little bit

277
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,590
ahead of time or at least think about

278
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:53,330
what kind of new features this one

279
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:56,000
provides which is really good they've

280
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:57,710
say officially they are supported but as

281
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,230
you see that constant updating it and

282
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:02,270
the new features added it's really cool

283
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:03,590
and again Martin wrote rustle of it made

284
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:05,510
it the sysinternals way back when

285
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:09,950
Microsoft bots its internal so it's

286
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:12,610
again it's a Microsoft product there's

287
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:15,050
two ways of deploying this so there is a

288
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:16,490
the shed of task I'd mentioned earlier

289
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:18,890
and the SCCM

290
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:21,320
we generally tend to further GPO

291
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:25,840
schedule task version but if you are

292
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,840
using a CCM then you do so that as well

293
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:30,800
but Professor yeah it tends to be the

294
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,980
people who have got SCCM already got a

295
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:36,019
locking solution in place because the

296
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,670
complexity of s yes yet they it tends to

297
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:40,760
be the more mature clients and when we

298
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:45,439
first started we were aiming for less

299
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:47,990
than 250 devices to be small businesses

300
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,089
but then with our trial clients we went

301
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:51,620
to people at like 6 housing machines and

302
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:54,889
mountainy rolled out across the whole of

303
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:57,769
Thursday so that barriers kind of gone

304
00:13:54,889 --> 00:14:02,449
that yeah so if you skips on a little

305
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:06,199
bit further so I don't want to take too

306
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:08,089
much time on the insulation yeah this

307
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:12,260
definition of this shows a task so again

308
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:13,370
like I said I think chapter one you just

309
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,800
important to GPOs

310
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:19,389
and chaps to use report the third and

311
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,389
that's the third one is a shadow task

312
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,980
there from here this way to find where

313
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:33,619
the actual systolic volume basis is at

314
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:35,660
least this one they got back and I would

315
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:38,300
recommend from personal experience that

316
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:39,740
you follow the naming convention of your

317
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,649
folder structure because if you don't

318
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:45,019
you have to update that the the folders

319
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:46,519
in the script and that can all this

320
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:48,560
messy but there's lots place you need to

321
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:50,029
update it and you just want to break it

322
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,229
it's supposed to be logging made easy

323
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:54,019
it's not very posed to be logging made

324
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:56,149
complicated so yeah that's essentially

325
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:58,779
what it is again

326
00:14:56,149 --> 00:15:01,209
this is there's another another

327
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:07,490
validation of what the steps that you

328
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:11,119
you've taken at this point so you can

329
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:12,769
see within the event view that the

330
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,850
forwarded events start appearing from

331
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:20,720
your clients and then third chapter is

332
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:22,490
pretty boring and this one sped up this

333
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,199
two different virtual well they're the

334
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:26,899
new documentation so there's only one

335
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:29,930
version but you basically build a Linux

336
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:32,990
host to host your docker containers

337
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:35,839
which is where your app stacks sits and

338
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:38,680
what you do is download the update

339
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,240
deploy scripts run

340
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:43,030
go make self a cup of coffee and then

341
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,100
you're done there is a few more steps

342
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:48,189
afterwards and isn't with in this video

343
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:50,530
but if I briefly talk about that when

344
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:52,900
the script runs there's a zip file

345
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:56,470
that's created you then put that zip

346
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:59,380
file onto the wax server the lexer of

347
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:02,530
that basically configures what ships

348
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:04,840
your logs from the wax server to the LME

349
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:08,260
post that's through win log beats that's

350
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:09,250
of elasticsearch import tool and it's

351
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:12,819
all open source and more freely

352
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:13,930
available and yeah it's basically what

353
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,700
this video looks like it's just the

354
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:18,520
scrolling script it's doing things

355
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:22,420
cranking keys this is out of date now so

356
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:24,340
this is creating an engine X reverse

357
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,290
proxy to do authentication but not using

358
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,820
that anymore

359
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:30,520
we using the basic auth built in with

360
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,660
elasticsearch this is essentially what's

361
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,699
going on we're waiting for the last

362
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:36,189
search to come up script to carry on and

363
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:40,380
then we are done that's like I said

364
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:43,690
earlier the fourth chapter should say

365
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:46,870
yeah again there's a little verify but

366
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:49,090
you go to the host you do get a one-time

367
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:55,870
password generated for you if you go to

368
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:58,120
the host you go to the right right pause

369
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:02,850
and accept the self-signed cert then you

370
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:06,220
get come up and then you are that so

371
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:07,900
shorter send we just skip through a

372
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:10,510
whole day's worth of making pizza and

373
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:14,530
installing anime and you've just checked

374
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:18,010
your your host you've got cabana up if

375
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:20,050
you're able to go to that domain which

376
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:22,650
is not particularly helpful because the

377
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:28,149
shortened URL wasn't very nice was it

378
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:30,070
wasn't playing ball so this your our

379
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:33,880
only exists for the for the conference

380
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:36,159
so you can take photos but it'll be dead

381
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:42,750
it after lunch

382
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:45,010
fortunately yeah so the username 44 con

383
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:48,580
password is passive one two three with

384
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:50,320
capital P and you've got some data in

385
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:52,629
there I don't know what people's prior

386
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,059
knowledge about stuck is and the logging

387
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:56,980
so if you'd like us to maybe talk

388
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:59,230
through about how to generate build UI

389
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,490
visualizations and dashboards they were

390
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,630
more than happy to do so if you're more

391
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:04,210
than happy just to get on with it and

392
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:06,490
have a look in there is some data in

393
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:10,299
there seven days five days worth of data

394
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:12,669
with some activity it honorable indicate

395
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:17,110
anything but there's some information

396
00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:18,340
for you to find yeah if there's any

397
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:24,010
questions or if you want to just crack

398
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:25,299
on and charges sorry that Kim I'll let

399
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:28,350
you do that but Duncan you can read the

400
00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:29,889
challenges from that bit if you want

401
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:31,899
essentially you want to know how many

402
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:34,330
devices are running on the network who

403
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:36,120
has the administration rights case how

404
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:39,939
apps levels are on the machines

405
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:43,539
how many vulnerable to a PT 28 days of

406
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:44,799
compromised and you suspect that network

407
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:47,770
has been compromised can you describe

408
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:51,250
the anatomy of the attack which is

409
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:52,450
fairly complicated questions for if you

410
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,909
imagine you're a small medium enterprise

411
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:57,190
never done logging before to go from

412
00:18:54,909 --> 00:19:01,270
zero to actually need those kind of

413
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:03,850
questions is kind of I think very

414
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:10,650
difficult so this what long in a DS is

415
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:16,689
all about trying millibar see we've got

416
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:17,679
hired a half-time key to dig through key

417
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:25,470
through the logs build some

418
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:25,470
visualizations dashboards ask questions
