1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,029
Oh

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,309
because who doesn't want to win you a

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,349
vision right Oh everyone wants to win it

4
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:13,530
apparently the UK can't for some reason

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:17,519
but we can hopefully try and make the UK

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:21,060
win Eurovision so who are we I'm Tony G

7
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,229
so I'm an X Blue team of friends prov I

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,299
know you

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,939
predominantly speak for Pentos partners

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,349
so I just go around well talking about

11
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,539
cool stuff like some of the stuff that

12
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:33,180
Vangelis hacks a lot of stuff awareness

13
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,879
as well I also do deal with our

14
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,930
vulnerability disclosure which is

15
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:39,239
challenging when you're dealing with a

16
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,340
lot of IOT manufacturers and actually I

17
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,989
created the air drop-off calm and a lot

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,579
of you is still go your air drop on I

19
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:47,038
would probably suggest you turn that off

20
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,719
for a hacking conference especially for

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,129
everyone hopefully those of you who have

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,620
got it on you would have received the

23
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:59,248
message I just sent you my colleague

24
00:00:52,620 --> 00:01:01,920
Vangelis here do you wanna go yeah used

25
00:00:59,249 --> 00:01:04,519
to be a plenty for buttons new for 20

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,250
years and for the past year or so

27
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:11,490
breaking KPIs for vendors partners api's

28
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:15,600
that control anything from cars to boats

29
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:18,419
and locks and trackers and my internal

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,640
code name is Ventus partners is API

31
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,230
exist because I usually say that

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,320
syndication not equals with

33
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:29,880
authorization and if you don't know that

34
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:31,679
I'm going after you yeah he usually does

35
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,050
and you also create an amazing project

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,650
with with a colleague which we'll talk

37
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:40,350
about in a sec track mageddon and this

38
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,540
was actually kind of the basis for a lot

39
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,759
of lot of this presentation because what

40
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,110
we're gonna talk about is IOT trackers

41
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:50,430
and poor variety trackers is that

42
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:53,520
everybody wants them right the whole

43
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,560
world is going nuts for trackers the

44
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,720
market I don't know whether this is true

45
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,970
I find it on the internet but apparently

46
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,370
the market is going crazy there's a

47
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:05,520
massive amount of increase in GPS

48
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:07,350
trackers the people are using for

49
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,090
various reasons whether it is tracking

50
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,730
their spices whether it's tracking their

51
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:14,349
cars tracking their speed there are

52
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:16,420
loads you can try children we

53
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:18,719
multiple watches which we all now have

54
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:21,670
been trying to be horribly vulnerable

55
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,189
there's pet trackers as various car

56
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,988
trackers you got down there

57
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:28,989
commercial trackers as well ODB to the

58
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:32,349
might of people chucking ODB to trackers

59
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:34,870
into their cars is beyond me I have no

60
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:36,849
idea why people are doing this and but

61
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:40,329
then on the commercial side you've got

62
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:42,700
things like Viper and Pandora which we

63
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:45,159
talked about earlier on in the year

64
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,909
where these are car alarms that also

65
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:50,230
have a tracking capability or the more

66
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:52,719
expensive products which we've also

67
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:55,119
looked at their track traffic master and

68
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:58,239
smart track which we presented at Def

69
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,909
Con this year on and and so those

70
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,790
actually category six that Jim category

71
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:06,698
six approved trackers which Vangelis

72
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:09,040
destroyed yeah doesn't say much about

73
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:10,900
their Bachelor testing to say the least

74
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,760
and so some of the work we've done

75
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,699
previously selfs you've looked a gate or

76
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,918
gate or the world's most reputable GPS

77
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:20,259
watch for elders and trackers full

78
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:25,750
platform takeover just by changing

79
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:28,929
equals 1 2 equals zero it was that easy

80
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,370
it was really really bad so yeah we told

81
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,250
him about that they have fixed that

82
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,290
fortunately the kids watcher what an

83
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:38,319
awful name for a kids tracking watch

84
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,790
it's like pedophile City especially when

85
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,099
you realize the app that we created

86
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:46,540
where we can track every child in the

87
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:49,238
world yeah not so good the the Pandora

88
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:51,849
and the Viper products and both of those

89
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,790
we had full account takeover we could

90
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:57,578
select track and unlock to order cars

91
00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:01,780
that we wanted steal again not really

92
00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:03,639
ideal and then the latest research the

93
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:06,819
latest products we've looked at tracker

94
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:10,209
traffic master track star and and smart

95
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:12,250
track all of those pretty much the same

96
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:14,739
vulnerability we could track cars in

97
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,599
real time we could self geofencing

98
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:19,539
alerts we could disable geofencing

99
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:21,219
allows amusingly on a smart track 1 we

100
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:24,070
could brick thousands of cars every

101
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:26,520
single car we could brick in one go if

102
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:28,050
we wanted to one command and

103
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,198
obviously we didn't because that would

104
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:33,060
be quite bad yeah it was quite scary

105
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,460
when Vangelis famed this and realized

106
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,509
that he could from an unauthenticated

107
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:41,789
remote location brick every single car

108
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:44,729
yeah that wasn't very good and so the

109
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:47,430
problem with with a lot of trackers and

110
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:49,940
in general a lot of smart devices is

111
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:53,400
they share a lot of common api's and

112
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:55,770
api's are commonly used across multiple

113
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,799
different platforms and they're sold by

114
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:00,508
or managed by individual companies and

115
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,430
then effectively what they do is they

116
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:04,680
host different websites it's the same

117
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:06,659
API back-end and then they just sell

118
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,310
different things to different companies

119
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:10,319
so it might be a watch on one front it

120
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,970
might be a car track on another front it

121
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,490
might be something completely unrelated

122
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:16,860
on another front all of them are

123
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:20,220
basically exactly the same back-end they

124
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:23,280
usually rebranded Chinese iam type

125
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:25,349
products and so you know the cheaper end

126
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,698
of the market here but as we mentioned

127
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:28,740
you know the commercial end of the

128
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,020
market do exactly the same interestingly

129
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,659
when we look at tracker and Viper

130
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,460
for example viper clifford the other

131
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:38,550
land manufacturer looked at both of

132
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:41,370
those share the same talent back-end so

133
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:43,139
really interestingly when we look to to

134
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:46,440
find the vulnerabilities in the tracker

135
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:47,880
platform we realized that the same

136
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,550
vulnerabilities that we had already had

137
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,169
fixed in the viper platform were now

138
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,940
being rediscovered in the tracker

139
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:56,310
platform because they hadn't actually

140
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,620
fixed the underlying api so that's

141
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:01,080
pretty easy to then kind of make that

142
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,550
that really quick jump to then being

143
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,620
able to take over all of the tracker

144
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:11,130
devices and then this think race and

145
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:13,680
think race are everywhere most of the

146
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:16,530
tracking devices you can buy cheaply on

147
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,930
places like eBay and Amazon use the

148
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:23,698
think race back-end that's one telling

149
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:25,469
me that I've moved my ODB to ports so so

150
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:27,360
this is that this is the track macadam

151
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:29,340
work the Vangelis worked on with with

152
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,699
mitch you don't know his surname d

153
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:35,460
literally all online working which is

154
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:38,639
pretty cool and what Vangelis was able

155
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:40,020
to find is you know 20 million gps

156
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,690
devices the

157
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,490
had Bonner abilities in them across

158
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:47,820
multiple different platforms or

159
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:50,220
different device types 370 roughly types

160
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:52,460
so they say this could be a car tracker

161
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:55,260
could be a pet tracker charge tracker

162
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:58,760
anything pretty much anything across the

163
00:06:55,260 --> 00:07:01,620
board and they were all from this one

164
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:04,349
original device manufacturer think race

165
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,420
so who are think race well interestingly

166
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:08,430
if you go to their website think racer

167
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:10,860
apparently the SmartWatch supply for the

168
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,840
Olympics well that says that they must

169
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,870
be good right they must be secure except

170
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:18,539
them not secure at the top I mean this

171
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,310
is 101 right it's a bit of an

172
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,660
understatement as well and it comes the

173
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,730
think race because they are

174
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:26,760
fundamentally insecure they are

175
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:29,970
shockingly bad not a single one of their

176
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:34,230
api's will use HTTPS every single one

177
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:36,510
uses HTTP everyone across every site

178
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,430
everything that they do is HTTP it's

179
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:41,340
like they haven't realized that we now

180
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:43,740
use HTTPS anymore amusingly what they do

181
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:47,640
is they they provide their software as

182
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:50,610
well and it's open source by open source

183
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,680
for partners so what that means is you

184
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:55,170
pay the money and then they give you the

185
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,390
product that's not open source I know

186
00:07:55,170 --> 00:08:00,450
that's not how I understand open source

187
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:02,070
works and interestingly they say they've

188
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:04,349
got 10 million devices there well

189
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:06,000
Vangelis just had a quick look and he

190
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:08,460
reckons is probably a lot higher than

191
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,520
that probably nearer about 69 of the

192
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:14,609
different devices that they've got and

193
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,469
if you see this when you use your

194
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:21,720
tracker and when you've set it up if you

195
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:23,520
see that you're fucked pretty much so

196
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,660
yeah this is gonna talk a little bit now

197
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:31,380
if I about how think races is fucked

198
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:34,320
pretty much so I'm going to talk about

199
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:37,860
their monstrosity that the thing races

200
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:42,210
as Tony told you they are reselling gate

201
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:45,450
the eyes white label when we first saw

202
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:48,270
them on 2017 we were really frightened

203
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,610
because none of the API was requiring

204
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:52,760
any

205
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:56,540
any authentication at all and thus they

206
00:08:52,760 --> 00:09:00,230
were using some strange soap services

207
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:02,180
all the documentation was there freely

208
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:05,000
available so you just have to browse to

209
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:08,810
the actual subsurface at the WSDL and

210
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:14,150
get the WSDL file and interact with any

211
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:16,040
device of all the variables were just

212
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:18,050
incrementing integers and as you all

213
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,290
know in Rome when you see in the

214
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:23,750
remaining integer and you can access one

215
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:26,870
there then it's bad news because you can

216
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:29,720
easily brute-force everything or to make

217
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:31,070
the attack and get pretty much

218
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,130
everything because we were talking about

219
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:36,350
user IDs device IDs any idea was

220
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:39,800
incrementing integer and everything was

221
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:43,190
horizontally exploitable they also do

222
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:45,290
some vendor specific coding and please

223
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:47,060
go after them and if you see something

224
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:49,550
that says vendor specific next to it

225
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:52,280
it's probably really really funny so you

226
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:58,760
will get source code if you just change

227
00:09:52,280 --> 00:10:01,490
a 1 to a fare your tracker is easily

228
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:05,420
identifiable if it connects to open if

229
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:08,020
API v and the number if you see that on

230
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:10,040
your burp or your proxy you are probably

231
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:12,699
really bad in a really bad position

232
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,439
because you are using thin waves and

233
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:19,280
last but not least all users were using

234
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:22,430
1 2 3 4 5 6 as a default password and by

235
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:25,490
using link remanded in the juror issue

236
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:28,189
you could see that most of them did not

237
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:30,980
change it and some of them were admins

238
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:36,230
or resellers in the platform and they

239
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:36,830
were controlling million of devices now

240
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:42,110
you could do that

241
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:44,450
so syngress just brought up a zombie

242
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:47,450
attack because either was so nineties

243
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:50,150
and when we first saw it 2017 we were

244
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:53,360
like really you can access everything

245
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:55,100
without taking anything so yeah it is on

246
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,190
the attack it's an eider attack user

247
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:01,880
actually as you're googled or if you

248
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,740
feel like going after cigarettes please

249
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,750
do

250
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,520
really really I'm really happy to help

251
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:10,480
you go after fingers because I really

252
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:12,550
hate them I have like 126 individual

253
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,930
servers right now that I were able to

254
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:17,829
their interview that I'm going to show

255
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:20,890
you so because we're talking about

256
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:24,970
million of devices the one is sending

257
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:27,640
sms right now you would have to identify

258
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:30,100
where these devices there are two ways

259
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:34,030
that I found the first one is quite

260
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:36,880
obvious you just get the device info and

261
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:39,910
get the latitude and longitude and see

262
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,340
where this device is right now or you

263
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:45,310
can get the SS number or the family

264
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:47,470
number get the country code and see if

265
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:49,540
this is in the UK this is in Greece this

266
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:54,250
is in Italy or anyone else and then you

267
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:56,380
can leverage it to do a proper attack as

268
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:58,930
I told you the German guide is you can

269
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:01,420
see in here the device ID 15 you can

270
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:04,839
easily automate that attack from 1 to I

271
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:08,110
don't know whatever number you feel like

272
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:12,670
it will respond up to a couple millions

273
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:15,670
and it will response currently scheduled

274
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:18,969
because it's JSON inside an XML 1 and

275
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:23,020
this gives me the chills but it also

276
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:25,330
will depending on the server respond

277
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:29,530
with phone numbers locations in names

278
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:33,670
and this is a severe break of gdb are of

279
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:36,910
course this is a really scary part

280
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:40,000
so on some centers there is an admin on

281
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:43,900
point you can retrieve the existing

282
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,420
framework of all the devices and you can

283
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:49,990
upload a new framework for all the

284
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:51,760
devices so if you are confident enough

285
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:55,230
you can reverse the film where and

286
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,939
either break the device like me or

287
00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:00,820
backdoor it to do something really

288
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:07,060
really different from what the device

289
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:09,280
was supposed to be doing that's 370

290
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:11,589
devices that are known to be vulnerable

291
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,140
I'm pretty sure that there are sellers

292
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:15,710
that renamed it so it's going to be a

293
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:18,230
lot more

294
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:21,110
but that's all that I found and I was

295
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:24,260
really bored I believe at 370 devices

296
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:25,839
are more than enough to show that we

297
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:29,870
have an issue in here

298
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:32,390
now the not vulnerable domains I really

299
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:34,820
tried with Tony really hard to fit the

300
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:36,680
mean but really kind of you know they

301
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,720
cannot be fit it in a single slide so

302
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,930
our more than 80 domains that are

303
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:45,110
vulnerable to that attack right now on

304
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:48,109
40 different servers and if you are

305
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:52,630
confident enough go use the Google door

306
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:56,810
and find some server and place it so

307
00:13:52,630 --> 00:14:00,140
what can we do we can track anyone we

308
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:02,449
can change any in mail so that we can

309
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:04,640
take over the account we can change all

310
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:07,070
conducts including emails including

311
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:10,040
phone numbers so we can totally take

312
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:13,220
over the device we could say it's the

313
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:15,500
offenses and as we can see later this

314
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:18,920
could be used for the alert to be

315
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:20,690
triggered and how that would before we

316
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,569
can force a few more update and change

317
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:26,570
the framework with our own we can also

318
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:28,310
see that some devices some watches are

319
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:30,500
to answering your phone

320
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:38,209
so you can scare random people's

321
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:42,070
children like I live in Australia the

322
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:42,069
point is this is Troy hands daughter

323
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,450
[Applause]

324
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:08,600
so yeah was in Australia I was in Greece

325
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:12,079
and my accent is really strange and

326
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:14,810
really scary on it's gone but just

327
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:17,420
calling a random kid is also really

328
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:18,050
scary I hope that it's scarier than my

329
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:22,969
accent

330
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:25,640
so that's it for now we sing race I'm

331
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:27,790
also going to talk about a another

332
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:30,880
really ghost vendor

333
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:34,240
because this is GPS UI and you can also

334
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:37,120
see it on VM UI the net I have around a

335
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,520
million of devices which if you consider

336
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:43,480
that thing risk has over 50 million is

337
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:45,819
not a big but it's really really really

338
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:50,170
hard to talk with them I have been

339
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:54,390
trying since 2017 just for an answer

340
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:57,849
I have sent tens of emails I have called

341
00:15:54,390 --> 00:16:00,130
every conduct before that I could find

342
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:02,860
I have also called their data center I

343
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:05,230
called China's Han but nobody really

344
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:10,780
cares nobody really answered so they're

345
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:13,360
just a ghost vendor they do sell devices

346
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:16,240
actively so as you will see later they

347
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,130
have over a million devices line but

348
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,280
they never answer to anything ability

349
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:24,010
resolve the vulnerability at least they

350
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:28,000
had some kind of engage so you had to

351
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:30,790
buy one device to get a valid login and

352
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,170
then exploit to everything else it's a

353
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:35,829
classical horizontal escalation of

354
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:38,740
privilege and could allow anyone to view

355
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:43,780
and control all the devices by sending

356
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:48,370
those messages that's it

357
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:51,130
as you can see I can set the phone

358
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:53,230
number and the command and it will send

359
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:57,610
the response for that month to that

360
00:16:53,230 --> 00:17:00,730
number I don't know if it's clear but

361
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:03,940
the serial number in there it's 1

362
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:06,579
million plus something so pretty much

363
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:09,790
all the previous numbers respond to

364
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:12,790
something I didn't try it because it

365
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:14,589
would be breaking the CMA but it's as

366
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:17,349
easy as that you just say the push

367
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:19,810
number and that push command and you

368
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:25,030
will get an SMS so you can do a lot of

369
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:29,679
things with it cool and you can't even

370
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:32,410
step back a sec and so obviously was

371
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:34,610
pretty obvious is these devices have got

372
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:37,049
a sim card in them

373
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:39,299
but where do those SIM cards typically

374
00:17:37,049 --> 00:17:41,639
come from well typically with you know a

375
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:43,918
kids track and watch for example the

376
00:17:41,639 --> 00:17:45,990
parent will just buy a pay-as-you-go SIM

377
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,460
card right cuz you're not expecting a

378
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,299
lot of data on it you're not expecting

379
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,080
to call it

380
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:54,360
these are usually edged devices so 2g so

381
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:58,408
not a massive amounts of bandwidth so

382
00:17:54,360 --> 00:18:02,459
just a cheap SIM card will do you don't

383
00:17:58,409 --> 00:18:05,970
need a contract but when we think about

384
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:09,119
your car if it's a pre-installed service

385
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:12,320
that's likely to come maybe with an e

386
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:15,529
sim or just with a physical sims

387
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,730
inserted into the telematics type device

388
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:20,190
and that will have some kind of a

389
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:23,820
private APN to connect to and you know

390
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:25,590
win with industrial IOT you're likely to

391
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,059
find that they are going to be an

392
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:31,049
embedded e sim as well but again

393
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:35,190
connecting to a private APM but how can

394
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:37,408
we go about abusing sim cards what is it

395
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:41,159
that we can do well remember we can

396
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:43,440
change the phone number right so what

397
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:47,129
about changing that to a premium rate

398
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,590
phone line could we actually get the

399
00:18:47,129 --> 00:18:52,559
device to call up the premium rate phone

400
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:54,570
line and if we owned the premium rate

401
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:58,080
phone line would that mean that we'd

402
00:18:54,570 --> 00:19:00,779
make the money well yeah I'm sure

403
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,970
the downside is that in the UK it's not

404
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:05,279
that easy to set up a premium rate phone

405
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:06,840
line it costs you about 50 pounds to set

406
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:08,450
it up and then 50 pounds every year

407
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,949
which is fine that's not too expensive

408
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:13,440
and then of course you could tell the

409
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:15,119
phones to phone that premium rate phone

410
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,249
line and then of course you would get

411
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:19,860
the profit anyway so pretty good you can

412
00:19:17,249 --> 00:19:24,960
see that's just one provider this is a

413
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:27,658
one pound 50 a minute call and you'd

414
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,749
make sixty two P off every call of that

415
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:32,700
which is great

416
00:19:29,749 --> 00:19:34,710
pretty simple profit right we're all

417
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,049
happy with that the problem is that the

418
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:38,909
PSA require you to register with them

419
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:40,918
that cost you one hundred and fifty five

420
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:42,179
pounds a year that's okay that's not too

421
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:44,399
much of a problem look we've got

422
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:45,960
millions of devices so the likelihood is

423
00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:48,139
we're going to make millions or even

424
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,760
billions of dollars back or

425
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:52,950
we have to wait six weeks for our first

426
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:56,070
payment and then every month after that

427
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:58,590
and they also have got lots of auditing

428
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:02,189
in place to make sure that people don't

429
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:05,280
do this so the reality is setting up a

430
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:06,990
premium rate phone line and then phoning

431
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,750
it and making money out of all of those

432
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:11,580
devices is extremely unlikely to succeed

433
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,320
but there is a really cool attack

434
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:16,560
scenario which Vangelis is going to talk

435
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:28,439
about which is kind of gonna give you

436
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:33,000
that option so what's going on so I'm

437
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:36,300
just writing that is the only B to do

438
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:42,270
DBT device here we just say factory and

439
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:44,129
it will eventually get the SMS if we

440
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:47,370
have a volunteer so that we can see if

441
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:51,000
this works live with your phone come on

442
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:53,010
item Aidan you want to give your phone

443
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,510
so that we can see if I can send an SMS

444
00:20:53,010 --> 00:21:00,330
of it

445
00:20:54,510 --> 00:21:03,120
with neither no now I need your number

446
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:05,970
if anyone else wants to give me their

447
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,439
number and just like we're recording it

448
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:10,110
so it's going to be on public record but

449
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:19,110
even if you like it please do so if else

450
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:20,550
Aidan please say so we haven't actually

451
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:22,919
got this pay on screen but it's

452
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:24,480
basically he's just doing that right so

453
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,420
he's gonna put Aidan's phone number in

454
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,330
which coincidentally we already know

455
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:34,470
because we were attacking him earlier on

456
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:37,429
and bizarrely he he genuinely said yeah

457
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:40,560
use my personal phone for this one idiot

458
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:42,390
because annoyingly cuz this thing every

459
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,580
time it moves it my sends you a text

460
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:46,140
message which is why this phone has been

461
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:50,060
making lots of noise and now Aidan's

462
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:53,070
will to say yes or about Aiden yeah then

463
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:54,750
let's keep that demo from knavish I

464
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:58,470
don't know if it's for show you can

465
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:59,790
remember his phone number no hang on

466
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:05,460
it's my forms

467
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:07,080
okay okay this is how it works right

468
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:12,420
yeah this is perfect

469
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:14,100
I sent Aiden a message saying can you

470
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,510
take a photo of us on stage and he

471
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,850
thought I was gonna send him a text

472
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:20,190
message from my OTP - dongle and

473
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:22,230
apparently not that's good really

474
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:24,870
interestingly there are loads and loads

475
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:30,120
of little trackers and I've got a few of

476
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:31,830
them in my villa bag of doom and and

477
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:35,340
it's scary there's some really cool ones

478
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:37,199
that'd be great for OSINT and I sent for

479
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:40,740
an for se engagements these little

480
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,720
things these things GFO 7 and GFO nines

481
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:45,330
and you just ring them up and they're a

482
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,310
room bug so you can just put it in a

483
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:50,970
room and then it's magnetic so it can

484
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:54,360
stick to the bottom of the the and there

485
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:55,920
are also microphone activated yes so on

486
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,600
the next scenario that we're going to

487
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:01,940
see they're going to be really easily

488
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,939
triggers did you get a nice finish

489
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,450
probably the reception here is really

490
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:08,580
much sorry about that that's alright

491
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:13,730
let's see if he gets by the end of the

492
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:13,730
talk if she gets this so next turn up Oh

493
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,380
kopteva

494
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:29,150
sorry about that so the trigger

495
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:31,530
conditions as I said there we go

496
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:33,690
you can't see far my sorry about it

497
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:36,149
lots of flicking ha it's probably the

498
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:40,140
trickiest part of the attack I don't

499
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:41,880
know why - why is it doing let me let me

500
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,800
let me tell now I don't think you can be

501
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:48,270
trusted

502
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:51,060
sorry about that so ah as we see what's

503
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:54,240
going on this come on the slice will

504
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:57,980
light up again we're advancing slides he

505
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,980
does that I I'm not

506
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:05,780
really sorry about that I can talk you

507
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:07,730
have the slides so with Ricki party in

508
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:11,570
this kind of situation is you need to

509
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:15,620
trigger the SMS sending so at certain

510
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:18,470
servers as we saw with GPS UI and

511
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:21,469
certain thing receivers allow to use

512
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:22,670
commands from the server as you do with

513
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:26,360
the SMS command

514
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:31,970
so the setting them will trigger an SMS

515
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:34,100
send or a phone call now we get to the

516
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:36,679
trickiest part even the device is moving

517
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,689
and you can see if the device is moving

518
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:40,970
because the server is getting certain

519
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:44,390
flags like the speed or is moving or any

520
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:46,880
other flag you can draw with the offense

521
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:49,130
around the device and wait for it to get

522
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,610
outside when it gets outside with the

523
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:56,929
offense it will get it will send an SMS

524
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:59,840
or it will call you back on some mobile

525
00:24:56,929 --> 00:25:03,020
servers that's only thing raised you can

526
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:05,270
create a geofence around the device then

527
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:07,910
move to the offense and fully device

528
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:11,629
that it is actually moving and it got

529
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:14,840
out of the defense if everything else

530
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:17,240
fails you just set the microphone or

531
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:20,030
vibration sensitivity really really high

532
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:24,020
and wait for a couple of minutes for the

533
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:27,320
SMS to trigger as told Tony said ZF 4 7

534
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:29,929
and zfo 940 of microphone and if you

535
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:32,809
have a really high microphone my

536
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:36,760
microphone sensitivity it gets triggered

537
00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:40,879
with even the slides there's noise

538
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:43,910
affects that so good and so so obviously

539
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,970
you know we can we can kind of command

540
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:48,920
it contact any number we want so can we

541
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:52,820
actually get it to call a premium right

542
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,750
line yeah we can actually so I'm going

543
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:56,330
to use one of the watches because

544
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:59,000
they've actually got a speaker and the

545
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:00,949
microphone and now what I should caveat

546
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,230
is the SE track of which this watch

547
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:04,880
attached to has been fixed nice so this

548
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:07,490
vulnerability the only reason anyway I

549
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,100
can exploit it is by forcibly pressing

550
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:10,669
the SOS ban but prior to it being fixed

551
00:26:10,100 --> 00:27:35,809
we

552
00:26:10,669 --> 00:27:37,519
from the web interface so yeah yeah so

553
00:27:35,809 --> 00:27:40,369
you can actually call a premium rate

554
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:44,119
line so that's pretty scary we don't

555
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:46,129
need this video anymore but obviously

556
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:48,709
we've explained the you know setting up

557
00:27:46,129 --> 00:27:50,449
our own premium rate line is probably a

558
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:53,409
bit of a non-starter because ultimately

559
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:57,019
we would get caught so we could try and

560
00:27:53,409 --> 00:27:58,639
hack another one's provider what's the

561
00:27:57,019 --> 00:28:00,559
bet end that they don't really have very

562
00:27:58,639 --> 00:28:03,289
good security controls a simple phishing

563
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:05,269
attack against porn line would the

564
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:07,460
chances of you being able to get their

565
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:09,279
credentials for their phone provider I

566
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:11,840
would imagine that's probably quite high

567
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:13,970
and then of course we could then ramp up

568
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,590
the calls change the bank account

569
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:17,749
details to arraign and then next months

570
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:20,149
we take all of the money that could work

571
00:28:17,749 --> 00:28:23,299
it is pretty viable that we could do

572
00:28:20,149 --> 00:28:24,379
that but of course we can control pretty

573
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:26,270
much any aspect

574
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:30,730
these devices there's a lot more that we

575
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:33,260
can do with them or by text donating so

576
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:35,360
everyone loves text donating because

577
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:39,530
it's a really nice thing to do and you

578
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:43,850
know as as ethical hackers you know the

579
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:46,399
ceh is amongst the size of course we

580
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:49,189
want to donate because it's a nice good

581
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:51,680
thing to do the reality is with these

582
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:53,600
watches and these trackers it's actually

583
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:57,350
really hard to do that because in order

584
00:28:53,600 --> 00:29:00,620
to text donation you need to control the

585
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:03,679
message that's being sent so the only

586
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:05,389
way we could do that is by reconfiguring

587
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:07,070
the firmware so it is quite feasible

588
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:08,510
that we could reconfigure the firmware

589
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:10,760
upload a new firmware as Mangala

590
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:13,600
subscribes and then we could do some

591
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:16,129
text donating so that could kind of work

592
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:21,050
but well I think it definitely could

593
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:23,000
work is with text voting or even phone

594
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:25,070
voting text voting or phone baiting

595
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,930
where it's just the same pretty much and

596
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:28,850
that is how I think that we might be

597
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:34,750
able to win Eurovision so if your vision

598
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:36,949
is pretty simple so reviewer vision

599
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:39,830
essentially what you do is you ring a

600
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:42,320
telephone number and in this case the

601
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:45,560
mobile short cape the six two two five

602
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:47,210
two and then the number of the the

603
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:49,669
company there the country you want to

604
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:53,900
win cost about thirty five P for the

605
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:56,120
call average top-up is ten pains so do

606
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:58,600
the maths each device could

607
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:00,770
theoretically vote twenty eight times

608
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,990
twenty-five million devices twenty eight

609
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:05,600
times seven billion votes I think we

610
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:08,360
might do all right disappointingly

611
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,100
though your vision of thought of this

612
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:12,770
they thought that maybe someone might

613
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,879
try and scan them and they have a thing

614
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:15,800
called jury votes

615
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,140
so the telly voting the bit that we can

616
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:21,500
control only accounts to three hundred

617
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:26,090
points the other 300 points accounts to

618
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:27,980
the fury to win it you need much more

619
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:30,649
than three hundred points to give you

620
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:34,010
the example so if we look at the tele

621
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:36,580
vote from this year Norway came out top

622
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:38,360
pretty much with a near-perfect score

623
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:40,730
291

624
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:42,769
so in theory you would have expected

625
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:44,000
that they would have one right they came

626
00:30:42,769 --> 00:30:47,000
out right at the top

627
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,490
problem is the jury came involved and

628
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,179
they put north Macedonia as the top so

629
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:54,590
North Macedonia won the jury vote Norway

630
00:30:53,179 --> 00:30:56,600
really interestingly what they only

631
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:58,370
liked eighteenth or something ridiculous

632
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,709
so they were really quite far at the

633
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:03,830
bottom the jury did not like them and

634
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:07,130
that meant overall Norway only came six

635
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:09,019
and the Netherlands won and you can see

636
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:11,330
the Netherlands won by four hundred and

637
00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:12,919
ninety eight votes so you know we can

638
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:15,620
only control three hundred of those so

639
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:19,610
the reality is I don't think we can win

640
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:22,820
Eurovision even if we hacked them which

641
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:25,908
is really disappointing but hey it is

642
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:28,418
what it is but what I think we can win X

643
00:31:25,909 --> 00:31:28,419
Factor

644
00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:33,799
so X Factor the reason and Britain's Got

645
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:37,250
Talent is another great example both of

646
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:40,940
these use the same concept so they use

647
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:42,380
short numbers you dial the number and so

648
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,940
we would just dial the number so we

649
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:46,279
command the device to dial the number

650
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:48,049
and then it would register our vote

651
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:49,850
there is nothing else you need to do you

652
00:31:48,049 --> 00:31:53,620
just ring the number in it registers to

653
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:56,600
vote it charges you 35 P something like

654
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:58,699
strictly for example what this works in

655
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:01,219
the same way as your vision so there is

656
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:03,289
the judges have an input into it so I

657
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:05,029
think only in the final do they not have

658
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:06,710
an input so we could possibly win the

659
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:09,679
final and Strictly but certainly X

660
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:11,539
Factor we could win it without they and

661
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,269
the reason for that is because actually

662
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:17,299
the margins to win X Factor are not that

663
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:20,149
great and so these are these are the the

664
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:22,700
total percentage X Factor don't release

665
00:32:20,149 --> 00:32:26,209
the number of votes now they did once

666
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:27,799
back in 2010 they told you how many

667
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:29,419
votes they received across the whole

668
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:34,039
series they received 10 and a half

669
00:32:29,419 --> 00:32:37,159
million votes so my average you know one

670
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:39,769
and a half million a week and you can

671
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:42,799
see for the final we would have needed a

672
00:32:39,769 --> 00:32:46,220
swing of about 15% to win it so in the

673
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:49,010
final 15 percent of votes let's guess

674
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:51,020
that's probably 100 200,000 votes we

675
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:52,220
would need to win it remember we've got

676
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:55,030
control of

677
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:57,230
20 million divide 25 million devices

678
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:59,120
granted some of those aren't gonna have

679
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:00,830
credit but some of them I bet word and

680
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,199
you could vote multiple times from those

681
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:06,289
devices so I think is quite feasible

682
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,240
that we could win X Factor with this or

683
00:33:06,289 --> 00:33:11,030
certainly we could we could we could

684
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,909
choose who he wanted to win and that is

685
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:16,580
where I think we can profit because if

686
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:20,720
we bet on the winner much like sports

687
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:22,668
betting if we know who's gonna win well

688
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,940
we can bet large amounts of money and

689
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:28,820
lycra sports betting it's really hard to

690
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:30,919
spot that it's really hard to spot

691
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:33,320
fraudulent sports betting otherwise you

692
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:35,929
know if it was easy it wouldn't be so

693
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:37,490
successful and we wouldn't know it

694
00:33:35,929 --> 00:33:39,049
wouldn't have so much happening and a

695
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:41,480
great thing is that's tax-free because

696
00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:43,158
it's bettered it's a winning so it's

697
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,260
really really cool so we're not actually

698
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:47,740
doing anything that's directly going to

699
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:49,700
affect it other than just betting

700
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:52,820
another thing that I think would be

701
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:55,190
really viable it's denial of service of

702
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:57,260
phone lines so if there's a company you

703
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:59,090
dislike and you don't particularly want

704
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:01,760
them to be able to answer their phone

705
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:03,620
calls well you can just find them up

706
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,110
with all of these devices how many phone

707
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:07,820
lines do you think companies have you

708
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:09,080
get through to a call center they

709
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:11,330
haven't got millions of phone lines

710
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,799
they're gonna have a good three few

711
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:15,109
thousand sure but they aren't gonna have

712
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,000
millions of phone lines so if we tell

713
00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:20,210
all of their devices to call the phone

714
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,339
lines we're gonna get an engaged time

715
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:25,520
when a real person tries to ring up and

716
00:34:22,339 --> 00:34:27,799
a really cool thing about this is the

717
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,980
most famed sense that phone call centers

718
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:33,020
a zero three four five and that comes

719
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:35,359
out of your minutes so even if you do

720
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:37,429
not have credit on your phone we will

721
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,750
still be able to do it so if in the case

722
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:40,520
of you know you're bought your pay as

723
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:42,770
you go phone and you bought a pack

724
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:46,609
rather than buying buying just store it

725
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:48,770
straight credit I can use the data they

726
00:34:46,609 --> 00:34:50,659
make a patent minutes off that pack to

727
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:52,399
phone this so you wouldn't even know

728
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:55,730
that it's happened as an end user would

729
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:57,770
not even spot it and it's extremely

730
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:59,210
unlikely to be preventable what's really

731
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:01,900
interesting is if you're on the other

732
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:04,880
end of the phone what would happen is

733
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:05,900
you would just in most cases just hear

734
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,880
background noise

735
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,110
so the call center person would just

736
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,790
think there's a load of people ringing

737
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:12,500
up with a load of background noise and

738
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:14,870
they'd end up having to cancel the call

739
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:17,480
but I don't think that they would end up

740
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:20,060
spotting it a really don't thing I think

741
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,830
in reality this is a viable attack and

742
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:23,600
the other reason I think is viable it's

743
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:27,590
because there isn't a played fair for

744
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:29,990
call centers so I don't think that you

745
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:34,180
can you can call on CloudFlare through

746
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:38,140
air to prevent DDoS against call centers

747
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:40,850
but what about barring on phones so what

748
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:43,819
exists on pay as you go phones to

749
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:45,980
prevent premium rate phone calls well

750
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:48,350
that's really interesting actually on

751
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:51,250
pay-as-you-go on the main for providers

752
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:53,390
and I know there's loads of MVNOs

753
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:54,770
I'm not really that interested in

754
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:56,390
talking about those primarily because

755
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:58,730
there's too many think think and they

756
00:35:56,390 --> 00:36:01,910
all use these azar backends so if the

757
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:05,300
main four providers they are all on by

758
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:07,609
default so if you've got credit you can

759
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:10,970
call a premium rate phone line it is on

760
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:12,830
by default so assuming you've got credit

761
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:17,049
in your phone you will be able to find

762
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:19,430
any oh nine or o or MVNO short code

763
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:23,360
without any challenge it will come off

764
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:25,549
your credit one provider is controllable

765
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,830
online so the end user registers an

766
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:29,780
account they can then turn that bar on

767
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:32,299
to prevent premium rate phone lines the

768
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:34,400
other two you have to ring them up who

769
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:36,620
do things done that think anyone's done

770
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,470
that no I say the other two because one

771
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:41,210
of them three doesn't support 2g so no

772
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:44,359
one's going to use that in a tracker so

773
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:50,750
you they're largely out of the window of

774
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:53,210
this but what's interesting is this is

775
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:56,270
not just a UK problem these trackers

776
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:59,060
exist around the world the twenty five

777
00:36:56,270 --> 00:37:01,190
million devices are not just UK devices

778
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:04,580
there are devices that are present

779
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:07,400
throughout the world from Asia to the

780
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:09,230
u.s. to anywhere in Europe every

781
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:12,680
continent pretty much I think apart from

782
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:16,130
probably Antarctica has gods trackers in

783
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:17,930
them and so other companies may have

784
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:19,589
completely different processes in place

785
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:21,029
different systems and

786
00:37:19,589 --> 00:37:23,519
especially when you talk about premium

787
00:37:21,029 --> 00:37:27,299
rate lines other companies might not

788
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:30,629
have the PSA in place to protect us from

789
00:37:27,299 --> 00:37:33,059
fraudulent charges on our accounts Susan

790
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:36,599
is anyone actually exploiting this right

791
00:37:33,059 --> 00:37:38,190
now well I don't think so

792
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:40,019
I don't think anyone is there's talk on

793
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:42,359
Russian Russian forums of people

794
00:37:40,019 --> 00:37:45,299
exploiting it but this is the closest we

795
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:49,710
got to it so the the Russian version of

796
00:37:45,299 --> 00:37:52,019
the voice they got taken over and 41

797
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:55,859
thousand votes were submitted for this

798
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:58,288
one child whose parent was a billionaire

799
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:59,910
so I think doesn't take much of a leap

800
00:37:58,289 --> 00:38:03,390
of faith then one okay what's happened

801
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:05,759
there but they were really stupid really

802
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:07,589
really stupid they ended up using normal

803
00:38:05,759 --> 00:38:10,499
phone lines Geographic phone lines and

804
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:12,420
what they did is they had sequential

805
00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:14,519
phone numbers so essentially it looked

806
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:17,190
like a bot had just used found all of

807
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:19,950
the numbers or got phone numbers to ring

808
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:21,719
in on the voting they had SMS voting

809
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:25,279
it's rare actually find SMS voting

810
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:28,410
because actually it's time to time

811
00:38:25,279 --> 00:38:29,940
sensitive and and so SMS voting is not a

812
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:32,299
good choice if you're looking to do a

813
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:36,299
voting platform which is why things like

814
00:38:32,299 --> 00:38:39,930
X Factor use use telephone voting rather

815
00:38:36,299 --> 00:38:42,150
than just SMS voting and but they use

816
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:43,890
SMS voting and all of the devices all of

817
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:47,339
the mobile devices they had all text

818
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:49,499
from the same one area in Leningrad it's

819
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:53,249
a bit easy to detect and the reality is

820
00:38:49,499 --> 00:38:55,499
that girl she thought she'd won but then

821
00:38:53,249 --> 00:38:57,390
subsequently it was fine to be fortunate

822
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:59,089
and she didn't win anymore and say I

823
00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:02,160
think she's probably a bit disappointed

824
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:04,650
but they were a bit stupid with our

825
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,819
approach I it wouldn't be detected I

826
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:08,130
don't think or it'd certainly be

827
00:39:05,819 --> 00:39:09,749
significant order to detect it and

828
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:11,729
certainly was something like The Voice

829
00:39:09,749 --> 00:39:13,468
which again is an ITV program so it'll

830
00:39:11,729 --> 00:39:15,200
be exactly like X Factor and Britain's

831
00:39:13,469 --> 00:39:17,640
Got Talent in terms of the voting I

832
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,529
think it would be virtually impossible

833
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,210
because the voting windows for those

834
00:39:19,529 --> 00:39:24,420
open at very short periods of time

835
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:26,339
during the show so by the time that

836
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,930
they've detected that is fraudulent the

837
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:30,529
person's already one or the other

838
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:30,529
person's been eliminated

839
00:39:30,809 --> 00:39:35,339
so in terms of disclosure so we've

840
00:39:33,659 --> 00:39:36,809
already talked a little bit about a lot

841
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:38,429
of the providers how they don't really

842
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:41,880
care

843
00:39:38,429 --> 00:39:44,669
think race well Vangelis has told them

844
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:47,459
multiple times I think haven't you and

845
00:39:44,669 --> 00:39:49,109
they don't really care the only thing

846
00:39:47,459 --> 00:39:52,259
that has been fixed is the SE tracker

847
00:39:49,109 --> 00:39:54,449
watches which to be fair the majority of

848
00:39:52,259 --> 00:39:56,069
watches you buy for kids now are

849
00:39:54,449 --> 00:39:57,329
actually se tracker type watches

850
00:39:56,069 --> 00:39:59,339
especially if they're cheap end of the

851
00:39:57,329 --> 00:40:02,789
market I still wouldn't buy them though

852
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:04,709
because they are awful but the majority

853
00:40:02,789 --> 00:40:07,829
of the products are just not fixed and

854
00:40:04,709 --> 00:40:10,078
they have no interest in fixing them as

855
00:40:07,829 --> 00:40:12,900
we mentioned is not just think racer are

856
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,579
vulnerable here multiple devices from

857
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:18,539
multiple manufacturers around the world

858
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:21,479
they all have these same flaws basic ID

859
00:40:18,539 --> 00:40:23,039
or it's like we've gone back to the to

860
00:40:21,479 --> 00:40:25,109
the 90s where people just didn't think

861
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:28,199
about web development they just don't

862
00:40:25,109 --> 00:40:30,779
I'd always say everywhere rangel it's

863
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:33,419
fines I do and pretty much every API he

864
00:40:30,779 --> 00:40:35,939
looks at it's really really poor but

865
00:40:33,419 --> 00:40:40,109
what about the the the phone providers

866
00:40:35,939 --> 00:40:44,069
and the PSA so the phone provided the

867
00:40:40,109 --> 00:40:45,569
GSMA yeah I don't think they really

868
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:46,919
appreciated and understood what we were

869
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:48,089
talking about when we spoke to them

870
00:40:46,919 --> 00:40:50,009
because they didn't really see as a

871
00:40:48,089 --> 00:40:53,189
concern they thought it was something

872
00:40:50,009 --> 00:40:54,779
that wasn't really an issue we're gonna

873
00:40:53,189 --> 00:40:56,519
go back to them and try again because I

874
00:40:54,779 --> 00:40:59,339
think they probably misunderstood how

875
00:40:56,519 --> 00:41:02,609
significant of a problem this is but the

876
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:06,319
PSA really responsive so the PSA the

877
00:41:02,609 --> 00:41:11,038
phone regulators of paid services

878
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:13,650
regulator obviously only uk-based rather

879
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:15,359
than the than around the world but their

880
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:16,919
response was really good I said look can

881
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,659
I have a statement on this and they gave

882
00:41:16,919 --> 00:41:20,368
me pretty much this statement I've had

883
00:41:18,659 --> 00:41:22,559
to paraphrase it slightly to fit it into

884
00:41:20,369 --> 00:41:24,509
the screen but essentially they

885
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:26,599
mentioned you know you got register with

886
00:41:24,509 --> 00:41:29,069
us which is really really good

887
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:31,199
monetizing it would require working with

888
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:33,299
an aggregator which is what they call a

889
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:34,949
level one provider ie the person who

890
00:41:33,299 --> 00:41:36,749
provides your premium rate phone line

891
00:41:34,949 --> 00:41:38,519
and you'll need to work with them they

892
00:41:36,749 --> 00:41:41,249
would need to pretty much be complicit

893
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:42,689
in the fraud and they would likely to be

894
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:44,109
found out by them and they'd certainly

895
00:41:42,689 --> 00:41:45,790
suffer and

896
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:47,500
investigation and there it would all see

897
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:50,770
be illegal as well and they essentially

898
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:55,000
be law enforcement coming down on them

899
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:57,730
they also have implemented controls to

900
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,560
detect whether there's an artificial

901
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:01,690
inflation of traffic so that approach

902
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:03,490
where we kind of fish a phone provider

903
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:05,470
and take their account and then whack up

904
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:07,660
their traffic by sending loads of phone

905
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:09,819
calls to it from watches that wouldn't

906
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:11,920
work in theory they said that they

907
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:14,020
should detect that which is really

908
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,720
really good and then ultimately they

909
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:18,100
could withhold payments so we wouldn't

910
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,529
get the money out of it so I think

911
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:22,299
actually from from that kind of point of

912
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:25,090
view so the premium rate approach I

913
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:27,700
think is probably unlikely it would be

914
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:29,710
successful then things ever been tested

915
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,910
and if in fact they said in the response

916
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:34,930
to us that this is very much a

917
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:37,359
theoretical attack so so it hasn't been

918
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:42,040
tested so so I think that's that's

919
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:44,620
interesting I think we'll see but I'm

920
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:46,750
I'm relieved that the PSA have at least

921
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:49,330
applied some logic they have also asked

922
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:50,650
us to - they've made some changes to the

923
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:52,540
regulation they've asked us to review

924
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:53,980
those and and to have an input in it

925
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:57,580
which I'm really really looking forward

926
00:42:53,980 --> 00:43:01,180
to how do we go about fixing the

927
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:04,330
trackers themselves well most won't be

928
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:06,060
fixed and and I'm gonna quote Vangelis

929
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:09,160
rather than let him create himself and

930
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:11,020
his his quote is low he's gone to the

931
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:13,960
point that he just made hates all of

932
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:18,120
these trackers all of them even the ones

933
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:21,460
that say they're secure they are

934
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:24,339
probably the shittiest industry of all

935
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:26,980
Chinese iam shit that don't give a shit

936
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:29,530
I think words are like the red shit and

937
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:33,960
most of the server api's is a copy of

938
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:36,160
this brand-new server new GPS from 2008

939
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:38,860
12 sorry 2012

940
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:43,779
and and yeah that was written by an

941
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:45,370
intoxicated monkey so yeah the reality

942
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:48,100
is they're there they're shit

943
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:51,310
so from an end user point of view stop

944
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:54,040
using them they're all shit if I

945
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:57,310
mentioned are their shit and but you

946
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:59,470
know if you are gonna use them then top

947
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:02,380
up your phone and buy packs with your

948
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:04,509
data so with with your credit so don't

949
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:06,280
store the credit by an allowance of

950
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:08,620
minutes or an allowance of text and an

951
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,990
allowance of data that means that you

952
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:13,600
won't have credit to make a premium rate

953
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:16,600
phone call of course you can still DDoS

954
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:18,940
the the the phone companies but

955
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,890
certainly is gonna gonna make it harder

956
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:22,330
for YouTube for us to be able to

957
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:24,420
compromise your device and get it to

958
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:28,600
phone a premium rate line

959
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:30,970
the NVA knows they do a lot of more

960
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:33,310
traditional old-school pay-as-you-go

961
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:35,410
where effectively you have an amount of

962
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:38,410
credit and then you just get fixed fees

963
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:40,779
1p mobile for example sounds a great

964
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:42,279
idea for trackers it cost 1p for a phone

965
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:44,740
call one people a text message one

966
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,240
people Omega bio data in reality it's

967
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:49,299
probably only cost gonna cost you sort

968
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,439
of like 10 p.m. month with that so that

969
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:52,440
would be great but the problem is you

970
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,760
have to store credit for that and

971
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:57,490
premium rate lines are probably gonna be

972
00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:01,990
enabled and say you know potentially

973
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:04,689
that's actually a higher risk for you so

974
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:06,009
my advice is keep credit low if you're

975
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:09,310
gonna use one of these that will

976
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:10,840
minimize your risk but seriously stop

977
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:14,470
using trackers and if you see that

978
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:16,870
you're fucked from the phone company

979
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:20,740
point of view there is more I think that

980
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:22,960
they can do the default block should be

981
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:26,109
enabled you should have to request

982
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:28,300
premium rate lines to be enabled that's

983
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:29,980
what they do on pay monthly contracts

984
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:31,570
why are they not doing it on pay as you

985
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:33,730
go just seems really odd that they

986
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:35,440
haven't enabled that but actually

987
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:37,480
another approach for sure I've sort of

988
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,120
coined almost like a three-way handshake

989
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:42,070
for for text messaging or voting and

990
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:46,870
that's where effectively say look I want

991
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:48,460
to vote for a a person okay you'll get a

992
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:50,049
message back this is going to cost you

993
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:51,730
this much money texts yes if you want to

994
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:53,770
do that all no if you don't or just

995
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:56,050
ignore it and you won't be charged so if

996
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:58,600
you then text back yes it then charges

997
00:45:56,050 --> 00:46:00,880
you it just makes sense to me that

998
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:03,819
that's a more common-sense way of of

999
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:06,280
meaning that you can't get charged these

1000
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:09,070
devices can't do that level of

1001
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:10,329
interaction it will not be possible to

1002
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:12,939
do that with

1003
00:46:10,329 --> 00:46:14,949
we're trackers if you're ringing up a

1004
00:46:12,939 --> 00:46:17,799
phone number to vote have the end use of

1005
00:46:14,949 --> 00:46:20,739
positively press a button I want to

1006
00:46:17,799 --> 00:46:24,880
accept this charge by pressing one or

1007
00:46:20,739 --> 00:46:27,699
whatever I think those could be enough

1008
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,229
to kind of prevent prevent this but you

1009
00:46:27,699 --> 00:46:31,209
know the reality is the manufacturers

1010
00:46:29,229 --> 00:46:34,058
need to get better you know they need to

1011
00:46:31,209 --> 00:46:35,948
realize that you know our authentication

1012
00:46:34,059 --> 00:46:37,989
is not equal to authorization and you

1013
00:46:35,949 --> 00:46:40,029
really need to validate those access

1014
00:46:37,989 --> 00:46:42,609
requests but but please just stop using

1015
00:46:40,029 --> 00:46:45,689
trackers alright it's just the

1016
00:46:42,609 --> 00:46:51,009
underlying message just stop using them

1017
00:46:45,689 --> 00:46:52,808
and I say any questions I have there's a

1018
00:46:51,009 --> 00:46:55,449
question at the back now I've got three

1019
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:57,910
I've at the moment the rarest stickers

1020
00:46:55,449 --> 00:46:59,890
in the world which because I've only got

1021
00:46:57,910 --> 00:47:03,098
three of them which are unhackable

1022
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:05,078
unicorn stickers so I've got three

1023
00:47:03,099 --> 00:47:06,579
questions that can get these and that

1024
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:09,549
person stuck their hand up first at the

1025
00:47:06,579 --> 00:47:11,829
back whoever it was hey thanks great

1026
00:47:09,549 --> 00:47:13,599
presentation did you also test the

1027
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:17,349
built-in trackers from some of the more

1028
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:22,509
premium car companies not as part of

1029
00:47:17,349 --> 00:47:26,739
this research but we are and have in the

1030
00:47:22,509 --> 00:47:28,779
past done some of that but more directly

1031
00:47:26,739 --> 00:47:32,559
with the organization I think that's

1032
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:34,329
about right isn't it yes yeah say so

1033
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:36,160
yeah not something we can publicly

1034
00:47:34,329 --> 00:47:37,959
disclose put it that way because they

1035
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,999
come see me afterwards for your

1036
00:47:37,959 --> 00:47:44,890
unhackable sticker as a muscle firework

1037
00:47:39,999 --> 00:47:49,890
it's under NDA so sorry any other

1038
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:49,890
questions yes question at the back there

1039
00:47:52,049 --> 00:47:57,249
thanks for the presentation guys so I

1040
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,199
mean the advice to stop using trackers

1041
00:47:57,249 --> 00:48:00,819
like some folk over selves I need for

1042
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:02,890
this so I mean is there any that you

1043
00:48:00,819 --> 00:48:12,549
would recommend that our ninja stray off

1044
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:15,910
Aliexpress long story short no go for a

1045
00:48:12,549 --> 00:48:18,549
premium one I guess but don't use them I

1046
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:20,890
would say don't use them but that's me I

1047
00:48:18,549 --> 00:48:22,749
think the reality is when you look at

1048
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:23,520
the price point of these devices that

1049
00:48:22,749 --> 00:48:25,560
will tell you how

1050
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,720
security testing has been done really

1051
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:29,910
interestingly we contacted gates or with

1052
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:31,560
that platform admin take over problem

1053
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:33,029
and we said to them look you know this

1054
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:35,730
is this is something that would have

1055
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:38,010
been detected in a pen test what kind of

1056
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:41,310
pen testing have you done the UK agent

1057
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:43,020
said to us they said well if we had

1058
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:48,690
money for security we won't be able to

1059
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:50,940
afford a Christmas party so what does

1060
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:53,369
that say to you about how much they give

1061
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:56,400
a damn about you and your children in

1062
00:48:53,369 --> 00:48:59,070
your tracker my advice they are terrible

1063
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,110
stop using them and so yeah I can't

1064
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:02,369
recommend any I'm afraid it's really

1065
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:04,020
annoying because I got a couple of car

1066
00:49:02,369 --> 00:49:06,060
trackers which were dead easy to set up

1067
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:07,650
but horribly vulnerable and they worked

1068
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:08,820
really really well and I was like yes

1069
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:12,600
quite useful I could stick that in my

1070
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:17,400
car but but no no no I'm all right thing

1071
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:19,790
I like stopping the rest any other

1072
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,790
questions

1073
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:23,340
oh there one in the front row is there

1074
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:26,460
as well

1075
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:29,630
no I've got one second left who is he

1076
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:36,240
stuck the hand up first you'll say

1077
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:37,800
gentlemanly yeah our only track is

1078
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,330
available which you aren't actually

1079
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:43,380
connected to light over the Internet you

1080
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:44,490
just can't figure it really yes so I get

1081
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:48,990
what you mean so it's a really

1082
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:51,868
interestingly these trackers I'm gonna

1083
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:57,240
grab one I was here so these little GF

1084
00:49:51,869 --> 00:49:59,010
o7 trackers and GF oh nine trackers when

1085
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:01,500
you buy these in there's only like six

1086
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:03,570
or seven pounds off of ebay when you buy

1087
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,670
them they don't make any mention at all

1088
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:07,320
though they're internet connected all

1089
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:09,060
they talk about is you can ring it up

1090
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:11,100
and then you could hear what's going on

1091
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:12,990
you can send it text messages and it

1092
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:15,540
will it will configure it so that it

1093
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:17,729
will tell you details of of where it is

1094
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:20,759
and you know you can say ask where it is

1095
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:22,590
you can also send text messages so when

1096
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:25,170
it hears audio it will tell you it makes

1097
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:28,050
no mention that is connected to GPS nine

1098
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:29,820
five eight comm so the reality which is

1099
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:32,430
also vulnerable that's also the kitchen

1100
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:34,560
with a spy cable it's you know sui if

1101
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:36,690
you see the first postal truck mageddon

1102
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:39,060
we didn't know that these will

1103
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:42,180
connected we got it at some point

1104
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:44,040
because we sniff the data and see that

1105
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:47,339
it was talking to a server because we

1106
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:50,009
thought it was on the SMS control but no

1107
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:51,420
so yeah this is this is a spy capable it

1108
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:53,760
it actually works

1109
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:55,650
charging iPhones which is good because I

1110
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,660
lost my iPhone charge cable so I used

1111
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:59,280
this morning but also it's got a little

1112
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:02,700
like phone in it and the thing is you

1113
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:05,040
wouldn't think that it's no mention on

1114
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:08,819
there does it use on the instructions to

1115
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:12,420
use GPS UI but it does and it's horribly

1116
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:14,640
vulnerable so I think I'm not aware of

1117
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:16,950
any that just allow you to ring them up

1118
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:19,920
but they all allow you to configure them

1119
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:22,710
via SMS and that's ultimately how you

1120
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:25,230
can kind of tell it to do an SMS to send

1121
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:27,660
someone else the SMS which is pretty

1122
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:30,829
much more Vangelis did to get Aiden's

1123
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:33,240
painter to work yeah another question

1124
00:51:30,829 --> 00:51:34,470
you might unfortunately you're out of

1125
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:36,390
luck because I haven't got any more

1126
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:38,540
stickers left that's unless you fight

1127
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:42,960
someone for it which I don't mind

1128
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:47,730
yeah so with other types of IOT devices

1129
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:50,970
like cameras thermostats or do those

1130
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:54,390
have similar vulnerabilities what's the

1131
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:56,939
range they're a lot that we noticed from

1132
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:58,379
a from an ID or point of view I don't

1133
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:00,089
know if you've got anything it's right

1134
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:05,790
there it's just I thought on beside

1135
00:52:00,089 --> 00:52:10,170
whales next month yes and they are

1136
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:12,990
adorable for thermostats yeah we cannot

1137
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:16,500
release it now but you should watch our

1138
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:18,868
blog some yes I'm wearing no in December

1139
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:24,990
you will also see a thermostat which is

1140
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:27,810
adorable okay thank you keep an eye on

1141
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:31,649
our bloggers you do see a lot of high

1142
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:43,799
durable IOT things any other questions

1143
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:48,540
oh yes yeah so what this this one here

1144
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:49,990
yeah this was an ebay special again six

1145
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:52,300
or seven panes

1146
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:53,890
most of the cheat tracking devices you

1147
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:55,720
find on eBay it's actually quite hard to

1148
00:52:53,890 --> 00:52:58,390
find on one Amazon well if you do find

1149
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:59,980
them on Amazon you find them like 30

1150
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:01,750
pounds for the child's watch but it's

1151
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:05,320
exact same watch you buy off eBay for

1152
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:07,119
like 7 pounds but this thing yeah this

1153
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:09,160
was like 6 or 7 pounds it's actually

1154
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,869
quite useful it's got a battery inside

1155
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:13,270
it so it's actually working right now

1156
00:53:10,869 --> 00:53:15,220
and it's got GPS and it's fairly

1157
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:18,310
accurate a lot of the devices they say

1158
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:19,899
their GPS trackers their GPRS trackers

1159
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:22,180
they'll tell you a on their self-help

1160
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:24,640
terrorists but this actually is a GPS

1161
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:26,740
tracker and it's pretty accurate and and

1162
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,720
the other devices I've got these ones

1163
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:30,790
here these are the ones which are really

1164
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:34,180
easy to set up and actually really nice

1165
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:37,000
you should horribly vulnerable oh no I'm

1166
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:38,830
not going to put it in my car this again

1167
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,200
has got GPS and again it's pretty

1168
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:44,230
accurate um so yeah that works pretty

1169
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:45,279
well but yeah just eBay you can even get

1170
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:46,960
ones like these which you've got

1171
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,090
Bluetooth and a lot of people put in

1172
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,250
Bluetooth ODB 2 dongles into their car

1173
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:53,380

1174
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:55,590
they're really bad as well but but

1175
00:53:53,380 --> 00:54:00,190
