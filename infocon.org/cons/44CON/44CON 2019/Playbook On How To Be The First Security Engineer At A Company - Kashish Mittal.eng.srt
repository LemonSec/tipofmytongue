1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,029
Oh

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:09,080
hey everyone this is one person army how

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:13,219
to be the first security engineer at a

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,780
company I'm Cassius Myrtle if you want

5
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:16,099
to follow me on twitter that's my

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,740
twitter handle

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,630
so before I start quick disclaimer all

8
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,880
the opinions expressed in this talk are

9
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:25,130
solely my own and do not express the

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,590
views of either my employment of our

11
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:31,070
employers this is just so I don't get

12
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:33,680
sued so Who am I I'm currently head of

13
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:35,630
security at this team within Microsoft

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,790
called mobile data labs which was

15
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:41,420
formerly a start-up by the name of my

16
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:42,710
like you before we got acquired in

17
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,980
previous versions I've worked at

18
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:48,920
elevated security duo security scylab

19
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,930
Bank of America Deutsche Bank and if you

20
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,870
guys haven't realized it I speak with an

21
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:55,430
Indian accent I am not pretending to be

22
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,169
up who from The Simpsons or doing a bit

23
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,490
so if you guys don't understand anything

24
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:02,240
feel free to raise your hands and I'll

25
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:03,770
be happy to repeat it so a bit of

26
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,390
background about me so how did I get

27
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:08,420
into security so I went to this tiny

28
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,130
college in a study Pittsburgh in USA

29
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,230
called Carnegie Mellon so I did my

30
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,820
bachelor's and master's their master's

31
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:16,280
was specifically focused towards

32
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,860
computer security did a lot of security

33
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:22,040
research in our cybersecurity lab called

34
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:23,690
Scilab have been a member of this CTF

35
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,280
group called played Parliament of

36
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:29,450
pawning and that's where I learned a lot

37
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,070
of technical skills and through CDF's so

38
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:33,050
as I know it's late and you guys are all

39
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,490
waiting for the jano clock event so

40
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:38,330
let's do some exercise to wake you guys

41
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:40,390
all up so any of you guys here started a

42
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:45,200
security team or were the first security

43
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:48,440
person slash engineer in a company quite

44
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,840
a few of them nice and any of you who

45
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:53,149
don't identify as a security engineer

46
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,130
but were asked to manage the security at

47
00:01:53,150 --> 00:02:02,180
either a start-up or a company in the

48
00:01:55,130 --> 00:02:03,860
mean time okay cool so yes so what makes

49
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,830
me qualified to talk about this right so

50
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:08,869
I have done this three times now

51
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:11,300
basically building security teams from

52
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:13,810
the ground up my experience is mostly

53
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:17,080
been in working at hyper growth and

54
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:19,209
Huayra startups and the first instance

55
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,670
of this was where I started and helped

56
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:24,760
build the application security team at

57
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:27,488
duo security I'll talk a bit about each

58
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,170
of these experiences in a bit then I was

59
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:31,150
a founding engineer at this startup

60
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,890
called elevated security and most

61
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,750
recently I started the information

62
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:38,319
security program at my like you

63
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:39,610
Microsoft so we are duo security some of

64
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,310
you guys might be using duo security

65
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:44,850
it's it was a to FN authentication

66
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:48,130
company you know highly sensitive data

67
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:50,200
recently got acquired by Cisco so I was

68
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:53,170
the first dedicated application security

69
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,540
engineer there we were a team of four by

70
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:59,920
the time I left so what we basically

71
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:02,019
built or did there is install the SSD LC

72
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,929
cycle which is basically known as the

73
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:06,670
secure software development lifecycle so

74
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,910
things included stuff like threat

75
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:12,760
modeling design reviews code analysis

76
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:15,819
security assessments bug bounty so on

77
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:18,519
and so forth so the next opportunity I

78
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:19,988
got was at elevated security that's one

79
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:21,790
of the founding engine is there so our

80
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:25,500
aim there was to build security

81
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:28,720
awareness and security behavior change

82
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,239
content and platform for enterprise

83
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,030
employees and basically help security

84
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:35,500
teams roll out such training such

85
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,859
education platforms amongst their own

86
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,329
company and you know things involving

87
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:43,840
better security behavior in terms of

88
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:47,049
phishing or malware or passwords so on

89
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,060
and so forth and yeah most recently my

90
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:51,430
like you so my like you was a mileage

91
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:54,430
tracking and expensing application so if

92
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:56,139
you're a contractor or if you can claim

93
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,769
deductions based on how much you drive

94
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:58,420
for work

95
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:00,790
we used to track that and give you

96
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,548
reports that you can use for your tax

97
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,900
purposes or reimbursement and

98
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:07,090
fortunately we got acquired by Microsoft

99
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,639
so I was the first security engineer

100
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:12,250
there frankly there was little to no

101
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:14,049
security before I had joined I'm head of

102
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,899
security now so some of the things I

103
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:19,090
manage there include app sack Corp sack

104
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:22,690
infra sec a bit of privacy and

105
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:24,880
compliance so fundamentally if you look

106
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,979
at all these opportunities what's common

107
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,250
there is that we are looking to build

108
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:32,380
security from zero to one right or in

109
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,360
the computer science sense zero to one

110
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,610
but if you think about these two numbers

111
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,470
mathematically there's an infinity of

112
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,979
possibilities within them so that's

113
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,060
where the journey of a security engineer

114
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:46,000
who's the first security engineer

115
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:48,849
basically lies and my objective here is

116
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,830
to share some key learnings from these

117
00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:52,659
experiences that I've had so you guys

118
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:54,340
can you know use that and leverage that

119
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:57,580
in other such opportunities that you

120
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:59,859
guys get so yeah so what is the ideology

121
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,380
so the ideology is borrowed from this

122
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:05,110
military term called one-man army which

123
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,580
according to Wikipedia is defined in the

124
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,099
following way right so I want you guys

125
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:12,039
to pay focus on the bolded items there

126
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:15,310
so are heavily armed and well trained

127
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:17,590
combatant able to face numerous enemies

128
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:19,810
alone right so the idea here is heavily

129
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:21,310
armed is in like you have all the

130
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:23,349
weapons and defenses that you need

131
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:25,390
well-trained because you need to employ

132
00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:27,940
your skills your tactics your procedures

133
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:29,950
and numerous enemies alone because the

134
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,969
idea being when you are a team of one or

135
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,919
when you are the first Security Engineer

136
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:34,780
there's a lot of threats that you have

137
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:37,690
to manage on your own so that's where

138
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:39,909
the idea is borrowed form and yeah

139
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,260
earlier the talk was titled one-man army

140
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:43,870
because that's whether military

141
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,669
technique is but the idea is that you

142
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,830
know this is gender-neutral like it's a

143
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:49,900
equally likely for a woman to be as good

144
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:53,530
a security engineer so now it's called

145
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,570
one-person army so how do you go about

146
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:56,940
doing this right

147
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:58,990
so first things were like when you first

148
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,810
accept the job what what are the things

149
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,400
that you can do the very first thing

150
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,530
that you should do is familiarizing

151
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,390
yourself with the organization so for

152
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:08,979
those who view are pen testers it's very

153
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:10,960
similar to the reconnaissance phase

154
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:12,640
there so you know looking at

155
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,669
decision-making looking at who are the

156
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:18,880
stakeholders what kind of pace can you

157
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:20,830
impact changes with the other thing is

158
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,630
identifying yourself with the stack and

159
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:24,520
the tools that the company operates with

160
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:26,710
so what kind of cloud platform are they

161
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,359
using is it as your is it AWS is it

162
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,698
Google

163
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,650
what are the languages that the code is

164
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:34,259
written I tried back-end and front-end

165
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,580
code what kind of databases are being

166
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:37,319
used and where all the rate has being

167
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,680
stored so identifying and learning about

168
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:42,240
such stuff and then the other thing is

169
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,729
identifying some key associates who

170
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,900
understand or value security that will

171
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:48,628
be able to help you along your journey

172
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,878
so the idea is that if you're hired or

173
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:53,069
some similar company at least one person

174
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,780
in the organization and the stored and

175
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:56,009
valued security that's why you were

176
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,539
hired or that's why you are in that

177
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:59,220
position right now so you know

178
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:03,030
identifying such people who will be your

179
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:05,759
allies along your journey the other

180
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:07,679
point is making an impact early right so

181
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,509
when you get hired when you join the

182
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,550
organization show them the value of

183
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:13,469
having a security engineer show them the

184
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:15,449
Delta between what they did not have

185
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:17,879
earlier and what value you provide now

186
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:18,810
the idea there in the organization one

187
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:21,210
of the things that we've used

188
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:23,639
successfully is caching the low-hanging

189
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:26,068
fruit so what that means is you know

190
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:28,349
some three to five things that you can

191
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:31,650
change in the first 90 days they don't

192
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:32,789
need to be radical long-lasting projects

193
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,289
that will require six months because

194
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:36,990
then you won't be able to show the

195
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:39,659
immediate impact but basic quick fixes

196
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:42,840
that you can do which actually show a

197
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:44,580
big impact in reducing the threat factor

198
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,818
or reducing the risk for the

199
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,229
organization so I'll share some examples

200
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:51,719
hopefully where we'll be able to derive

201
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:53,969
more understanding from that so one of

202
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:55,620
the organizations that I joined they did

203
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:57,810
not have any 2fa two-factor

204
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:00,539
authentication they were using personal

205
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:03,210
emails for corporate resources and the

206
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:03,539
password hygiene was horrible to say the

207
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,758
least

208
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:08,699
so the idea is that if you combine these

209
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,490
things a simple phishing email to one of

210
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:13,319
the employees personal emails could lead

211
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:16,409
to compromise of all our customer data

212
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:17,729
or even you know taking over their

213
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:18,330
account which has a bunch of these

214
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:20,639
resources

215
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:22,650
so here the fixes were you know

216
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,509
relatively straightforward so the moving

217
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:26,250
access through all personal emails

218
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:29,789
because now we have a corporate domain

219
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:31,710
we have access to emails or work emails

220
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:35,039
from there so allowing access only

221
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:37,228
through that enforcing and mandating 2fa

222
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,260
on at least all the sensitive resources

223
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:42,000
including access to customer data

224
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:45,180
or access to production environment so

225
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,550
on and so forth and finally first

226
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,380
explaining why you know having secure

227
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:51,449
passwords is important and then

228
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,400
facilitating that through a password

229
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,050
manager or whatever you guys think is

230
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,120
the best alternative there we use

231
00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:00,089
password managers so that's one such

232
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,910
idea the other case was we were hosting

233
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:05,700
all our code on github so on github

234
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,949
there is this feature where you can give

235
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,500
revoke ibly delete all your organization

236
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:13,080
data including all the code and you know

237
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,820
you can allow this access or access to

238
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:22,760
this operation to a few select

239
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:25,500
individuals so in so in the in our org

240
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:29,010
unfortunately that access was given to

241
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,020
all the developers and again the issue

242
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,240
was that nobody bothered to check with

243
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:35,640
the github settings nobody wanted to you

244
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,770
know see what access control needs to be

245
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:41,040
implemented so here it was a relatively

246
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:43,410
simple fix revoking access to everyone

247
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,660
except the person who managed the github

248
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:47,100
account and the CTO because this is not

249
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:50,310
an operation that you guys will need to

250
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,740
do often or frequently so that was the

251
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:54,869
case there the last example I'd like to

252
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,670
share is extracting all our customer

253
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:59,850
data so we are working in this

254
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:02,310
organization we dealt with pis OPI is

255
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,960
personally identifiable information so

256
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,959
things like your social security number

257
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:09,450
things like your exact location things

258
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,190
like your name and credit card so

259
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,990
anything that can be used to personally

260
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:15,350
identify you which is considered the

261
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:17,910
most sensitive or the highest

262
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:21,360
sensitivity of data that you want to put

263
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:24,060
it so the concern there was that all our

264
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,760
data was being stored in this database

265
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:30,449
behind this dashboard which anyone had

266
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:32,210
access to and the access control policy

267
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:34,680
or the access control method of that

268
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:37,770
resource was such broke so broken that

269
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,239
anyone could add anyone else so the idea

270
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,189
is that you know there was a bunch of

271
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,080
personal emails that can use that access

272
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:45,950
at least those emails were employee

273
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:48,720
owned but many of them could get fished

274
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:51,930
get access to the portal and then also

275
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,730
add other emails to that world so again

276
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:55,439
in that case it would lead to

277
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:57,449
exfiltration of all our customer data

278
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,519
which I don't have to tell you as like

279
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:00,779
for a startup that's probably the worst

280
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,180
thing that can happen in terms of

281
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:06,300
security if all your customer data

282
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:08,489
including the PII bits gets exfiltrated

283
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,560
and you get that dreaded email so I so

284
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:13,829
here it was a two or three layered

285
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,779
procedure so first verifying that the

286
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:16,888
emails that were actually on there even

287
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:20,010
though they were personal emails they

288
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:23,100
were only owned by our employees and no

289
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:25,050
actual external email was added on and

290
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,630
we don't have to do more incident

291
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:29,910
response the second part was once those

292
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:31,769
emails were truncated you know

293
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:33,779
implementing some sort of some sort of

294
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:36,269
role based access control so who are

295
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:38,760
people who need reader access to this or

296
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:40,709
read access to this data source who are

297
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,750
people that mean you want to make admin

298
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:45,540
so they can add other people on there

299
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:47,910
and so on and so forth so these are like

300
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:50,399
relatively quick fixes I would say the

301
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:53,339
longest one that took us time was you

302
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,320
know setting up and evangelizing and you

303
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:57,089
know helping people on board to password

304
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,519
managers especially those who are not

305
00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:01,620
familiar with it but still any of them

306
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,149
did not take more than two weeks time so

307
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,130
these are some quick fixes that you guys

308
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:08,910
can implement which will you know

309
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:12,449
drastically reduce the risk or the

310
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:13,709
threat that your organization faces but

311
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:15,810
then there is this technique which I

312
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:17,489
call secure document repeat right so

313
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:20,219
when you first join the organization

314
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:21,510
you'll find a lot of insecure stuff so

315
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,160
what do you do with it right so you

316
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:24,870
obviously go about securing it but

317
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,360
that's not where your job ends

318
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:29,910
you should also document whatever you

319
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,560
feel is the secure way of you know

320
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,569
interacting with those resources and you

321
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,849
just keep doing this process over and

322
00:12:33,569 --> 00:12:38,519
over over and over so to give you an

323
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:40,800
examples let's assume you guys have a

324
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:42,990
bunch of VMs and subscriptions I have

325
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,790
taken as your as an example so there'll

326
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:46,980
be cases where people have opened these

327
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:49,199
VMs with ports that are not supposed to

328
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:52,589
be visible or you know they've given

329
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:54,180
access to interact with these VMs for

330
00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:55,769
people who don't need that so use

331
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:58,290
obviously secure down your current

332
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:59,760
resources but you also document what is

333
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:01,560
the correct way to spin up a new

334
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,930
subscription what is the correct way of

335
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,819
spinning up a new VM what kind of

336
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,550
logging and auditing controls you need

337
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:08,469
to build

338
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:10,420
and the idea there is that once you

339
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:13,180
document these processes and evangelize

340
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:15,880
them you don't have to keep manually

341
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:18,729
reviewing or fixing such resources for

342
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,410
future deployments and that's what we

343
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:22,120
are trying to look at similarly if you

344
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,410
look at data storage right so you might

345
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,390
want to publish a set of guidelines

346
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:27,339
saying these are the data security

347
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:28,540
guidelines that we care about not just

348
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,970
with the database that we are currently

349
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,349
interacting but any other database that

350
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:34,090
you guys spin up in the future this is

351
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,680
for developers you tell them that you

352
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:38,370
know I want you to follow this similar

353
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,479
set of guidelines and the idea here is

354
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:42,970
these three things that we want to focus

355
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,980
on efficiency availability and

356
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,690
repeatability so efficiency because you

357
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:49,180
don't want to keep spending your cycles

358
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,560
again and again on the same thing you

359
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,660
will be resource constrained especially

360
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,459
if you're a team of one availability for

361
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,800
that if you are a security engineer and

362
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,840
if you're off or like you're taking time

363
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,270
off or you know you're a conference

364
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,310
presenting whatever be the case your

365
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:05,290
developers still need to have access to

366
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:07,060
all these resources so they can exhibit

367
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:09,160
secure behavior they should not have to

368
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,869
wait for you to be able to do that and

369
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,880
the final thing is repeatability right

370
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:14,860
like this process is very readable you

371
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,750
can transfer it for like securing pretty

372
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:20,440
much all different parts of your network

373
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:22,260
and resources so yeah so I have an

374
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,830
example so this these are our data

375
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,530
storage guidelines

376
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,940
so we basically list out all on at an

377
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:30,339
abstract level these are some of the

378
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:32,950
controls we want developers and our

379
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:34,780
database managers to build in and you

380
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,960
know this again transfers across

381
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:40,689
different kinds of database whether it's

382
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,860
sequel whether it's Mongo whatever kind

383
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:44,350
of database that you're looking to build

384
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:46,450
so as you can see there include stuff

385
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:51,190
like encryption at rest encryption and

386
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:53,050
transit some newer database is claimed

387
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:56,140
to have what is called encryption during

388
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:58,750
use of encryption during run time then

389
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:00,640
things like role based access control IP

390
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:02,290
whitelisting which is basically you know

391
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,080
white listing only a bunch of IPS that

392
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:06,189
should be able to talk to this database

393
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,080
having logging logging and auditing

394
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:09,730
turned on so if there's something that

395
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,880
goes wrong you guys can go ahead and

396
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:14,770
check the logs and see what's going on

397
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:18,070
storing the database credentials in a

398
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:20,709
vault rotating those credentials every X

399
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:23,230
days and then you know providing

400
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:25,420
authentication to that database through

401
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:27,339
certain mechanisms so we are behind us

402
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,500
your so we recommend us your Active

403
00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:33,100
Directory so you know similar guidelines

404
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,509
that you guys on a publish the next part

405
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,199
which I believe is the biggest part of

406
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:39,699
this job or in such a journey is

407
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,008
education evangelism and communication

408
00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:43,779
so the biggest thing that you have to do

409
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:46,509
in this journey is basically educating

410
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:48,880
yourself and others about security the

411
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:51,069
need for security the value for it what

412
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,439
kind of input you can provide what kind

413
00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:57,009
of things that you guys can go about

414
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,529
secure and it's not just about you know

415
00:15:57,009 --> 00:16:00,459
doing something and then you think your

416
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:02,529
job is done

417
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:04,599
evangelizing what you did and what its

418
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:07,319
impact is is another really big factor

419
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:10,060
so at the start there is definitely some

420
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:11,920
employees who will not be the early

421
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:13,479
adopters of technology or who will not

422
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,219
be the early adopters of security

423
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,079
processes that you guys roll out so

424
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:19,540
evangelizing impact of some of the work

425
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:22,000
that you did earlier helps drive them to

426
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:24,639
adopt security practices for example the

427
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,290
first time you will enroll password

428
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,380
managers or the first time you guys will

429
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:31,689
enroll to FA there's always lis some

430
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:33,579
sort of extra effort that your employees

431
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,199
have to do to log into that resource

432
00:16:33,579 --> 00:16:37,569
which was which they did not have to do

433
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:40,180
earlier so this is to make sure that you

434
00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:43,060
know they are also on board for any such

435
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:45,310
future processes or outcomes that you

436
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:47,649
guys maldo rollout and yeah so

437
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:49,449
communication is key there's different

438
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:51,040
techniques that we've used there's no

439
00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:53,319
one technique that will work in all

440
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,240
cases with all people there's this

441
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:57,430
classic shock-and-awe slash fear

442
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,290
technique whereas which is basically

443
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:01,779
that you show them a life hacking them

444
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:03,579
or you actually takeover or compromise

445
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:05,290
one of their resources and show them

446
00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:07,569
that this is what a hacker can do or

447
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:09,938
this is what security professionals you

448
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:11,470
know have resources to do so if you guys

449
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:13,329
don't take this seriously this is what's

450
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:15,730
going to happen so that generally drives

451
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:17,559
the motivation for them higher to you

452
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:20,620
know adopt some of the changes that you

453
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:22,329
are talking about in some cases as such

454
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:25,540
a stick doesn't work so you have to be

455
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:28,359
more of a helping hand classic examples

456
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:29,860
you include when pm's or engineering

457
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:31,699
managers come up to you and say that we

458
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,139
really need to push out this product

459
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,120
the next two weeks for the next four

460
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:37,219
weeks but we haven't had a chance to

461
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,500
implement a lot of security right so can

462
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:42,200
you help us out and review it and make

463
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,730
sure we are covering at least the basics

464
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,559
that we need to so there you have to

465
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:48,590
provide more of a flexible helping ad

466
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:51,889
and yeah one other key information to

467
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:53,990
understand is communication or does not

468
00:17:51,889 --> 00:17:56,330
always mean telling everyone about it so

469
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,980
there has to be a silo between what

470
00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:00,110
information should be public and what

471
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:02,539
information should be private especially

472
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:04,850
if you've discovered something that's

473
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:07,190
you know potentially can lead to an

474
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:09,649
incidence or you know you found out that

475
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:11,450
something did not go well so limiting

476
00:18:09,649 --> 00:18:15,678
that knowledge on a need-to-know basis

477
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:17,929
is very important yes and the next

478
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,519
component is doing knowledge transfer so

479
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:21,289
you're the first security engineer

480
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,669
presumably you'll have the most

481
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:25,010
understanding and knowledge about

482
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:26,840
security so how can you transfer some of

483
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:28,309
this knowledge to developers who are

484
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,370
interested in writing writing secure

485
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:33,440
code or even non-technical people so the

486
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:35,449
idea here is that firstly we don't wanna

487
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,250
alienate or leave out non technical

488
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:39,529
people they are as much a part of

489
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:41,330
securing your organization as technical

490
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:43,429
developers so some of the things that

491
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:45,710
we've used our developer security

492
00:18:43,429 --> 00:18:48,260
workshops is basically educate them

493
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:50,720
about over f-stop and how to write

494
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:52,070
secure code in our case it was Python

495
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,320
that they were writing so how to write

496
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:56,330
secure code in Python and similarly for

497
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,279
non-technical employees it was the

498
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:01,039
security 101 training which is basically

499
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:04,370
how do you keep yourself safe at work

500
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,960
and at home so yeah and one other

501
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,850
presentation that we made which is

502
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,070
basically called security is not

503
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:12,439
complete without you emphasizing the

504
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:17,720
need for developers and technical people

505
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:18,919
to take part in the security process so

506
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,620
yeah one other thing I want to talk

507
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:24,440
about is developer empathy right so you

508
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:28,070
have to put yourself in their shoes in

509
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,960
most startups it's very high intensity

510
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,500
and there are strict deadlines to ship

511
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,210
code

512
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,519
I know ship features and that's how a

513
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:36,260
start-up sustains if there's no product

514
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:38,960
there is no company there's nothing left

515
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:41,570
to secure so that's why you know there a

516
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,309
lot of times when there'll be more power

517
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,330
focus and you will be frustrated saying

518
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:45,440
why are they not taking security

519
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:47,449
seriously

520
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,740
the other thing is it will definitely be

521
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,540
new for them especially if you're the

522
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,850
first person there because before you

523
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,320
they were probably not being asked to do

524
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:56,060
this or they were not people who were

525
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,220
pressing down the next to say we're into

526
00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:00,139
building security in your code or in

527
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,580
your processes so that's where we have

528
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,680
to empathize and realize that you know

529
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:06,620
this is new for them you have to work

530
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,450
with them and act as an enabler rather

531
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,800
than a blocker or just hang a SWAT

532
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:11,960
around the next thing you have to do

533
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:15,460
this otherwise I won't let you ship code

534
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:17,690
that's the idea behind developed empathy

535
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:20,030
one of the key pieces we want to

536
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:22,100
understand is motivation right as

537
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:25,520
security professionals I feel we get

538
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:27,139
this built wrong a lot of times so a lot

539
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,480
of times it's assumed that people are

540
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,810
not doing security because they can't do

541
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,180
it

542
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:33,950
right or they don't have the know-how to

543
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,720
do it but the first thing that we need

544
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:38,660
to address is do they even want to do it

545
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,890
right so basically in some cases might

546
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,440
be that they might have the technical

547
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:43,700
skill but they don't care about it so

548
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,190
motivation pieces the first piece that

549
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:50,060
we need to hit and then other steps can

550
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:53,600
follow from there one of the things that

551
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:55,100
I've used successfully to help me out in

552
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,320
this journey as this security Champs

553
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,699
program or security satellites program

554
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,280
as it's called in some companies

555
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:03,170
so quit show of hands how many guys have

556
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,800
heard of these programs what I've used

557
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:08,600
and their companies before what if you

558
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,879
got that's nice yes I will just run over

559
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,010
my ideology on security champs and how

560
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,130
I've seen it work so basically the idea

561
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:17,930
here is non-security dedicated employees

562
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:20,060
helped out with security stuff

563
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:22,100
when I say non security dedicated the

564
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,990
idea is that I am a firm believer that

565
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,340
security is everybody's job right so you

566
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:27,230
can't really say that ok this person

567
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:29,179
doesn't care about security or they

568
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:31,070
don't have to care about security that's

569
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,780
dedicated security employees like

570
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:35,330
security professionals like us who work

571
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:36,260
in the security so it's other people

572
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,909
from there so whether it's your

573
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:41,000
developers whether it's your marketing

574
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:42,740
folks finance legal HR any of the people

575
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,440
in this division when they are helping

576
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:47,300
out with maintaining and upholding the

577
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,610
security standards and security culture

578
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:51,230
of your team as I mentioned earlier in

579
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:53,240
some organizations it's also called

580
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,690
security ambassadors or security

581
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,029
satellites program

582
00:21:54,690 --> 00:22:00,389
and fundamentally it's the security

583
00:21:57,029 --> 00:22:02,789
privilege of the police asking you to be

584
00:22:00,389 --> 00:22:04,709
the eyes or police asking the citizens

585
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:07,710
of a state or a city to be its eyes and

586
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:09,539
ears right so you know I've seen boards

587
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:11,580
around London in other places basically

588
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:13,619
saying if you see something say

589
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,330
something or you know if you find out

590
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:18,149
something call us and let us know so

591
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:19,529
it's the same principle there and again

592
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:20,969
the key point I want to highlight is

593
00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:23,009
this is both for technical and

594
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:25,649
non-technical employees so don't forget

595
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:28,979
your non-technical employees how does it

596
00:22:25,649 --> 00:22:31,799
work so you have basically roughly a

597
00:22:28,979 --> 00:22:34,830
squad of security champs and you run

598
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:37,619
multiple rotations through them you want

599
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:39,720
to have ideally a security champion per

600
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:42,840
team so like one for marketing one for

601
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,999
finance one for legal have at least one

602
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,499
for your geographical location so in a

603
00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:49,169
lot of cases your team will be split

604
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:52,109
across multiple locations Europe Asia

605
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:55,320
America so have at least one per

606
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:57,779
location and roughly one security champ

607
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,369
or twenty full-time employees is what

608
00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:02,279
the structure that we've seen works well

609
00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:04,228
and the idea here is that you don't want

610
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:06,299
a security champ to be responsible for

611
00:23:04,229 --> 00:23:08,159
more than you know this number because

612
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:11,129
it will be too much work and effort for

613
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:13,169
them to manage and the other key

614
00:23:11,129 --> 00:23:16,228
component of this process working well

615
00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:18,119
is this executive sponsor position so

616
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:19,950
this is someone in your executive team

617
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:22,529
or your leadership team who has

618
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:24,659
organizational power who's buying you

619
00:23:22,529 --> 00:23:26,249
guys get who will be able to help you

620
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:29,820
institute some of the changes that are

621
00:23:26,249 --> 00:23:31,379
required or some of the you know manager

622
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:34,859
approval that you guys need for this

623
00:23:31,379 --> 00:23:36,570
program to be successful and yeah so

624
00:23:34,859 --> 00:23:38,789
what do the security champs do for you

625
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:40,918
guys right so primarily they're the

626
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:42,840
first point of contacts for anything

627
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,809
security related that comes up in their

628
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:48,299
team's their next biggest responsibility

629
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:49,769
is to drive security improvements within

630
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:52,499
the teams and the products that they're

631
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:54,359
working on and they act as prove a

632
00:23:52,499 --> 00:23:55,950
satellite so it's not just when you want

633
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:58,168
to you know get something done but when

634
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:59,609
they find out something within that team

635
00:23:58,169 --> 00:24:01,649
or just find out that they're working on

636
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:03,139
a feature which you know we should get

637
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:05,849
reviewed or have some sort of security

638
00:24:03,139 --> 00:24:07,309
approval for so then they engage the

639
00:24:05,849 --> 00:24:08,330
security team so

640
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:12,320
anything that's considered

641
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:14,090
security-critical they get always we get

642
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,950
a lot of more security knowledge than

643
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:17,840
they had earlier so they you know get

644
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:21,590
trained in whatever areas that relevant

645
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:23,090
so for example for HR folks or people

646
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:24,529
who are recruiters it might be around

647
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:27,590
you know opening and viewing documents

648
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:29,149
securely for people who are database

649
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:30,740
administrators it might be around how

650
00:24:29,149 --> 00:24:33,248
does you know manage their databases

651
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:36,620
properly so whatever is functionally and

652
00:24:33,249 --> 00:24:39,139
you know the relevant applicable to

653
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:41,209
those people and what we expect is that

654
00:24:39,139 --> 00:24:44,330
we want them to spend 10 to 20 percent

655
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:46,249
of their time contributing to security

656
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:48,100
initiatives rather than their regular

657
00:24:46,249 --> 00:24:50,419
stuff and this is where you need

658
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:52,668
approval and buy-in from their managers

659
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:55,009
because you don't want to impose extra

660
00:24:52,669 --> 00:24:56,840
work on them because that's not feasible

661
00:24:55,009 --> 00:24:59,450
firstly long-term and secondly they

662
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,399
might not be excited about doing more

663
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:03,110
work for the organ they're already doing

664
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:04,668
all their other work so that's where you

665
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:07,100
need to have a good working relationship

666
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:09,350
with their managers so they you know

667
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,449
approve all this time and in some cases

668
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:13,730
where you need a stickler that's where

669
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:15,470
the executive team sponsor position that

670
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:18,559
we talked about earlier comes into the

671
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:20,869
picture and you have what do they get in

672
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,668
return right so the first thing that you

673
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:24,830
can offer to them is basically an

674
00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:27,710
enhanced security knowledge and

675
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:28,999
awareness security is a booming field we

676
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:30,860
all know it not just for security

677
00:25:28,999 --> 00:25:32,929
professionals but even for people who

678
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:35,149
work outside security having some sort

679
00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:38,679
of security knowledge will help them

680
00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:40,850
advance in their career the biggest

681
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:43,190
thing that we've seen them motivate

682
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:46,189
people is recognition and appreciation

683
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:48,320
from their managers from leadership team

684
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:50,389
from their co-workers so there's a

685
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:54,350
multiple number of ways that you guys

686
00:25:50,389 --> 00:25:56,389
can you know manifest this if you guys

687
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:59,178
are on some sort of messaging platform

688
00:25:56,389 --> 00:26:02,178
you know like slack or teams basically

689
00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:05,749
showing up prom they're saying thanks to

690
00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:07,730
X Y & Z for helping us out here or if

691
00:26:05,749 --> 00:26:09,259
you mention it to the manager and he or

692
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:13,330
she calls it out in the next one-on-one

693
00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:15,830
or if you want to have like some sort of

694
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:17,299
appreciation box or whatever like you

695
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:19,610
know this is your time to be creative

696
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:20,900
but basically this is one of the things

697
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:23,840
that we've seen work really well

698
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:26,150
the other component is swag so anything

699
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:29,240
that you can build around security like

700
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:32,059
we used to have one three three seven

701
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:34,490
t-shirts distributed to some of our

702
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:38,120
security champs or give them sticker

703
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:39,559
saying I helped keep XYZ org secure so

704
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:42,219
these are other things that we've seen

705
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:45,139
work and yeah free food during meetings

706
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:48,080
you know all office employees even we

707
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:50,240
have free food in an organization during

708
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,760
every lunch and breakfast and dinner but

709
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,490
still you know having cupcakes or donors

710
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:58,490
during meetings that helps motivation a

711
00:26:55,490 --> 00:27:00,590
lot and yeah so what will this security

712
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:01,820
Champs program do for you right so the

713
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:04,340
biggest thing is that it will help you

714
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,500
establish a security mindset amongst

715
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:08,419
non-security dedicated employees so when

716
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:11,270
you first join in the security mindset

717
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:12,890
is lower you are building the security

718
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:17,000
culture so this will help you there and

719
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:18,860
it will enhance people's understanding

720
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,420
and contribution to security and that's

721
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:22,340
the kind of security culture that you

722
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:24,410
want and basically it will help you

723
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:26,240
scale security in the organization when

724
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:28,040
you are a small team there's a lot of

725
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,929
people in startups teams grow really

726
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:32,230
fast so you want to be able to like you

727
00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:34,820
know have more eyes and ears out there

728
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:39,020
you know caring about security looking

729
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:41,178
for security things so next component is

730
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:43,760
automation and alerts the idea is very

731
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:46,250
very simple you're a team of one or a

732
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,320
small team you don't have enough time to

733
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:50,600
operate a dedicated Sauk center or

734
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,610
monitor tools 24/7

735
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,219
so instead of looking at a screen and

736
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:57,260
looking at tools set up meaningful and

737
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:59,690
actionable or alerts again here the key

738
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:02,090
is meaningful and actionable so look

739
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:04,880
like set up alerts where you have some

740
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:06,020
follow-up action to perform and instead

741
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,860
of looking at the screen you know

742
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:12,110
looking at 24/7 tools have alerts inform

743
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:16,280
and guide your responses that will help

744
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:18,500
you save a lot of time so the next

745
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:20,360
component is build versus buy right so

746
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,550
what things do you go about building

747
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:25,340
versus what things you go or by

748
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:26,870
third-party tools or vendors form so

749
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:29,720
this is a place where you need to find

750
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:31,610
the right balance again there's no use

751
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,280
reinventing the wheel especially when

752
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:34,949
you have

753
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:36,930
a great time so the correct way of you

754
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:39,180
know approaching this is that you buy

755
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:42,650
the products that work off the shelf for

756
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:46,080
you and you invest time in building

757
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:48,120
custom tools or integrations where you

758
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,149
know your organization or your tech

759
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:53,370
stack has unique characteristics so I

760
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:55,290
have some examples that I'll share so

761
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:57,209
I've used as your as an example for

762
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:59,520
example key vault is one such place

763
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:01,560
where you can store all your secrets

764
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,810
including passwords including your

765
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:07,050
certificates including any keys whether

766
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:09,899
they're SSH keys integration keys or and

767
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:12,240
so forth so the idea here is that if you

768
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,310
are having this functionality so make

769
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,200
use of it rather than you know thinking

770
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:21,450
about building your own or custom

771
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:24,390
password storage facility or secret

772
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:25,860
storage facility similarly there's your

773
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:29,580
Security Center which will give you

774
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:31,560
basic stuff out of the box such as what

775
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:34,110
kind of ports to open what kind of IP

776
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:36,620
whitelisting to build what kind of

777
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:39,300
threat protection mechanisms to have and

778
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:41,040
similarly some of the databases they

779
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:44,850
will have encryption and rest encryption

780
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:46,950
and transit functionality for you to

781
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:49,290
build our buck so leverage all these

782
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:50,970
things so that you can focus time on

783
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:52,680
building some of the other things which

784
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:54,360
will not work for you out of the box or

785
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,850
which will not work as a default

786
00:29:54,360 --> 00:30:01,050
mechanism and yeah there are a lot of

787
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:02,879
such examples so there's this technique

788
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:04,680
which my mentor taught me which is

789
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,090
basically called the iPad sign-in

790
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:12,540
technique and the idea here was that

791
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:15,959
whenever he used to you know face some

792
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:18,180
sort of pushback or block from executive

793
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,190
team on doing some security tasks which

794
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:21,840
he felt was critical so you would go

795
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:24,150
into that meeting with our iPad

796
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,919
basically saying you know can you sign

797
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:27,840
off on this risk and the idea behind

798
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,340
that is that I have told you enough

799
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,620
number of times that needs T's to be

800
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:34,260
done I think this was gonna you know

801
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:35,939
impact us potentially in the future so

802
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:37,500
can you sign off on this risk saying I

803
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,000
have informed you but you know you don't

804
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,590
think this is important or we can't

805
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,450
prioritize this like blah blah blah

806
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:44,959
whatever it is

807
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:47,240
but basically kind of you know shift the

808
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,930
onus of responsibility of that security

809
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,310
risk and the whole idea was that

810
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:55,280
executives especially in the leadership

811
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:57,290
team they don't want to be the person

812
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:59,360
who's consuming that risk so when you

813
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:01,580
prompt this strategy it at least makes

814
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,649
them think twice and say that okay this

815
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:05,240
must be serious because this guy's come

816
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:07,280
up to me or this person has come up to

817
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,230
me and said that you know we need to get

818
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,450
this done otherwise you know you're

819
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:14,180
ingesting this risk and I've used this

820
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:16,850
technique myself to get buy-in it works

821
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:20,540
really well the concern here is that

822
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:22,610
this is not a SWAT that you can hang

823
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:24,020
around their heads multiple times but

824
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:26,540
you have to be very careful about using

825
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:28,250
this if you use this you know for every

826
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:30,560
small little thing then its impact will

827
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:32,810
go of it but if you use this at critical

828
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,159
points to basically say I think this

829
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:36,770
should be done if you don't agree with

830
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,670
me the more if it breaks it's on your

831
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:41,030
head not mine

832
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:42,860
that works the other point I want to

833
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:45,649
talk about here is safeguarding yourself

834
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:47,300
as InfoSec professionals we've seen this

835
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:50,210
happen especially in a number of cases

836
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:53,600
in America where security professionals

837
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:55,220
are let go of their jobs for standing up

838
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,260
for what they believe is the correct

839
00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:00,440
thing in terms of security whether it's

840
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:03,320
not paying money to hackers or hackers

841
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:07,520
as in a black hat hackers or basically

842
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:10,310
criminals or whether it be asking to

843
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:12,740
disclose or breach of their customer

844
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:15,200
data things like that so this is where I

845
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:17,390
would recommend all of us to be careful

846
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,700
and safeguard yourselves document

847
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:21,140
whatever you are recommending making

848
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,300
sure you're highlighting it to the

849
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:26,930
appropriate stakeholders making sure you

850
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:29,180
know it's not only known to one or a few

851
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:33,050
people who can you know misuse that

852
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:34,790
information and yeah hopefully no such

853
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:38,450
instance happens to any of us no of us

854
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:40,550
in this room so we've talked a lot about

855
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:41,900
the app sack and fraud second of

856
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:43,490
initiative so what are some of the

857
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:46,010
corporate security initiatives that you

858
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:47,990
guys can take so the number one factor

859
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:50,660
of breaches as you all know is phishing

860
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:53,539
so what can you do to prevent that 2fa

861
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:56,109
was built for this but you see in with

862
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:58,729
a lot of new attacks to F is also

863
00:32:56,109 --> 00:33:00,978
compromisable so V personally prefer to

864
00:32:58,729 --> 00:33:03,679
use these things called yoga keys which

865
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:06,469
basically work on this protocol called

866
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:09,709
Fido faster entity online so check them

867
00:33:06,469 --> 00:33:12,109
out basically reduces the chances of

868
00:33:09,709 --> 00:33:13,509
phishing module employees getting

869
00:33:12,109 --> 00:33:16,458
compromised by a phishing attack

870
00:33:13,509 --> 00:33:18,829
significantly lower than even two-factor

871
00:33:16,459 --> 00:33:22,789
authentication the other thing is

872
00:33:18,829 --> 00:33:24,799
passwords so you know a lot of times

873
00:33:22,789 --> 00:33:27,259
things here comprise because people are

874
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:29,299
using the same passwords so instilling

875
00:33:27,259 --> 00:33:30,950
this part in your employer saying why do

876
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:33,859
you need to have good password hygiene

877
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:36,109
what compromised or what constitutes a

878
00:33:33,859 --> 00:33:37,789
strong password and then you need to

879
00:33:36,109 --> 00:33:39,619
also provide them tools to be able to do

880
00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:42,679
that so we rely heavily on password

881
00:33:39,619 --> 00:33:44,299
managers and in case of production

882
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:46,729
secrets I told you about the key vault

883
00:33:44,299 --> 00:33:48,440
so that's the idea there malware

884
00:33:46,729 --> 00:33:50,690
execution so you know not running

885
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:53,389
untrusted executables not

886
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:55,789
double-clicking on every file let it

887
00:33:53,389 --> 00:33:57,978
download and yeah the last element is

888
00:33:55,789 --> 00:34:00,709
data access control so you know

889
00:33:57,979 --> 00:34:02,629
providing this functionality to say who

890
00:34:00,709 --> 00:34:05,029
needs to know what and providing access

891
00:34:02,629 --> 00:34:07,639
on a need-to-know basis rather than a

892
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:11,389
blanket or blanket back policy which

893
00:34:07,639 --> 00:34:12,768
gives access to everything so the last

894
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:17,329
cover and I want to talk about is

895
00:34:12,768 --> 00:34:19,008
security training in awareness so we did

896
00:34:17,329 --> 00:34:22,419
talk about how do you know interact with

897
00:34:19,009 --> 00:34:25,789
developers but how do you like is the

898
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:28,518
method and motivation for your employees

899
00:34:25,789 --> 00:34:30,799
across the board so one thing that we've

900
00:34:28,518 --> 00:34:32,629
seen is that the LMS based training

901
00:34:30,799 --> 00:34:34,460
where you know they're looking at videos

902
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:36,918
and answering multiple-choice questions

903
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:38,869
or you give them a corpus of twenty page

904
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:40,399
long text which is your InfoSec policy

905
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:43,519
and they have to answer questions based

906
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:44,929
on that that's not really great so some

907
00:34:43,518 --> 00:34:46,158
of the key factors that we've realized

908
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:48,168
which i want to share with you so

909
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:52,220
firstly training needs to be customized

910
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:54,109
to have maximum return on investment so

911
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:56,418
it needs to be customized for two levels

912
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:59,509
so firstly the functionality that they

913
00:34:56,418 --> 00:35:01,129
work in so you don't need to teach you

914
00:34:59,509 --> 00:35:03,529
know people in your finance team how to

915
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:04,819
like spin up a secure shell because

916
00:35:03,529 --> 00:35:06,840
they're never going to have to do that

917
00:35:04,819 --> 00:35:08,730
for their job functionality and

918
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,620
the second point is which needs to be

919
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:11,970
customized this the basic level of

920
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:15,270
security knowledge that they're coming

921
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:16,830
in with so if you give them if you teach

922
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:18,270
them things that are way above the

923
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:20,940
current security understanding they will

924
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:23,490
lose you really well or or similarly if

925
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:26,520
you were teaching basics to a person

926
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:29,009
that he already understands good decent

927
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,390
bit about security that will also you

928
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:32,280
know lose their interest so you need to

929
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:35,250
cater it to their current understanding

930
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:37,170
of security as I mentioned earlier it's

931
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:39,390
important for you to motivate your

932
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:41,790
employees to care about security so that

933
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:45,089
they want to do security and not really

934
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:46,590
have to or be forced to do security one

935
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:49,260
other learning here we have is that

936
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:51,150
active and experiential learning can

937
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,980
help improve retention so instead of

938
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:55,020
having one way streaming of whether

939
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:58,500
they're ingesting a video or whether

940
00:35:55,020 --> 00:36:00,150
they're ingesting a text piece if you

941
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:03,180
can have like some active engagement

942
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:05,220
sessions that can work whatever medium

943
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:06,600
you guys end up choosing definitely

944
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:09,990
measure the effectiveness of the

945
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:12,000
training that you guys introduced so you

946
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:14,279
know even if it's as simple as running a

947
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,860
fishing test before and after the

948
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:19,950
training to see you know how what things

949
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:22,530
changed who became more security aware

950
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:24,930
who did not really get impacted by all

951
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:27,480
this stuff and yeah so we are big

952
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:30,390
proponents of CTFs there actually if I

953
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,610
think a CTF going outside so yeah so if

954
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:37,109
you guys are interested that's one thing

955
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:40,130
that you guys can use so things to

956
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:42,720
consider before you say yes to this job

957
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:44,820
firstly and most important alignment

958
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,939
with the upper management which is your

959
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:49,430
leadership team executive team

960
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:51,630
understanding the motivation of the

961
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:53,790
organization why are they hiring the

962
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:56,160
first security engineer is it because

963
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:59,430
they recently got breached is it because

964
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:01,440
they want some compliance certifications

965
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:03,480
is it because they are looking to get

966
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,700
acquired and their potential investors

967
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,980
are asking for a security breach so

968
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:10,560
understanding this then looking at what

969
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:14,100
goals and targets you guys wanna hit

970
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:17,310
right so do they want to become ISO

971
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:19,240
certified in the next six months did

972
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:22,029
they get this gdpr

973
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:24,848
hammers on the head and then I want to

974
00:37:22,029 --> 00:37:26,319
become compliant as soon as possible do

975
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:28,569
they want to build a robust security

976
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:30,339
program for the next 12 months so on and

977
00:37:28,569 --> 00:37:33,069
so forth and yeah this will play around

978
00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:35,470
with your timeline and you know help you

979
00:37:33,069 --> 00:37:37,660
decide what things to target and

980
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:40,509
approach the other component to work on

981
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:44,109
is budget both in terms of acquiring

982
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:46,630
tools getting new headcount you know

983
00:37:44,109 --> 00:37:49,960
being able to go to conferences so on

984
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:52,509
and so forth and one problem that we see

985
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:56,309
especially in the Bay Area or California

986
00:37:52,509 --> 00:37:59,859
from where I'm the demand for security

987
00:37:56,309 --> 00:38:02,380
fairly outweighs its supply so we have

988
00:37:59,859 --> 00:38:04,210
to be more creative in hiring people so

989
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:06,970
whether it's you know outsourcing our

990
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:09,160
security to other parts of us or even to

991
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:11,259
regions like Europe in Asia or hiring

992
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:13,058
people as consultants when we can't get

993
00:38:11,259 --> 00:38:16,359
full-time employees so yeah being

994
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:19,240
cleared ever on that and yeah the last

995
00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:20,680
thing is basically as you some of you

996
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,979
who've already been this position will

997
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:25,868
understand this is not an all rosy

998
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:27,880
situation to be in there are definitely

999
00:38:25,869 --> 00:38:29,950
tough days at definitely frustrating

1000
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:31,749
moments especially in startups there'll

1001
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:34,239
be cases where you'll be working on

1002
00:38:31,749 --> 00:38:35,738
securing a feature or a new product for

1003
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:37,450
three six months and you'll find out

1004
00:38:35,739 --> 00:38:39,700
that that which feature isn't even going

1005
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:42,279
live or there'll be cases where you know

1006
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:44,078
you bang your head against the wall so

1007
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:46,119
much to say that you know I want this

1008
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:49,119
thing done but it's still not provided

1009
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:50,589
to you but yeah my recommendation is as

1010
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,180
long as you remember that cool and

1011
00:38:50,589 --> 00:38:53,980
followed by this followed by it you'll

1012
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:57,069
be fine which is basically to say that

1013
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:59,079
you have to secure the organization to

1014
00:38:57,069 --> 00:39:01,180
the best of your abilities and the

1015
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:02,829
resources provided to you and as long as

1016
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:05,319
you can keep you know making progress

1017
00:39:02,829 --> 00:39:05,999
towards that goal it will all be good in

1018
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:22,119
the end

1019
00:39:05,999 --> 00:39:24,970
any questions is Iceland and preciseness

1020
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:28,779
great I have a question what happens

1021
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:31,118
before we say yes we'll die is how you

1022
00:39:28,779 --> 00:39:33,040
convince more organizations I need

1023
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:36,830
security engineer and

1024
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:39,170
mmm mmm so I think you have a valid

1025
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:40,970
point that it's basically saying what

1026
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:42,830
can I do to convince an organization

1027
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:45,200
that they should care about security so

1028
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:46,940
from a security engineers perspective

1029
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,669
there's a number of things you can do

1030
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:52,640
even if your external you can point out

1031
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:54,200
issues in their system you can point out

1032
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,700
issues in their application so let's

1033
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,399
assume you want to work for a company

1034
00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:00,770
that builds a mobile application you

1035
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,450
look at the mobile application you see

1036
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:05,120
what things are going wrong or how you

1037
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:06,350
can exploit it you don't or you can

1038
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,910
actually even see if they have a bug

1039
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:10,279
bounty program or some some like

1040
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:12,200
something you know that's external so

1041
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:14,000
you don't get sued or like there's no

1042
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,830
liability issues but yeah those are

1043
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,270
things that you can basically point to

1044
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:19,930
them and say that okay this is where I

1045
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:22,400
would provide value the good thing for

1046
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:25,339
security engineers in general is a lot

1047
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,110
of companies are realizing this either

1048
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:29,540
on their own or because of external

1049
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:30,770
factors so if they get breached the

1050
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:33,110
first thing that look they look together

1051
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:34,430
security engineers if they want some

1052
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:36,200
sort of you know compliance

1053
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:38,210
certification whether it's ISO swap

1054
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,189
whatever they would bring where the

1055
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:41,690
weather was getting GDP are compliant

1056
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:43,520
right a lot of companies hired security

1057
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:45,320
in the nest for that so that is where

1058
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,450
it's coming I don't really think there

1059
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:49,100
will be many companies who will be able

1060
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:51,200
to sustain without having security

1061
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:53,900
engineers whether again it's full-time

1062
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,980
or part-time it depends but yeah I would

1063
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:59,960
say those are some of the things you can

1064
00:40:54,980 --> 00:41:01,520
explore high as it's a really

1065
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:04,370
interesting talking it's one of those

1066
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,780
things I think so your talk is one of

1067
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:07,700
those things that this conference should

1068
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:09,620
probably have more always the kind of

1069
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:14,000
practical stuff for professionals I just

1070
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:16,009
just wanted an hour on Sam I'd be doing

1071
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,500
all these things to this question but

1072
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:20,420
when you go into a company you've just

1073
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:25,220
been hired how do you stop yourself

1074
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:27,440
being the most hated person company all

1075
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:30,740
right yeah so that's something I deal

1076
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,930
with on a day to day basis so what helps

1077
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:35,000
for with me in my personal case is I do

1078
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:37,430
a lot of jokes with my team members

1079
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,070
outside the work so then understand that

1080
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:43,190
he is a good guy but it's his job to you

1081
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:44,600
know act as a bad guy but yeah like

1082
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:46,580
other things that you can think about is

1083
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,560
one of this philosophy which is to

1084
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:50,150
be an enabler rather than a blocker

1085
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,400
right so you don't want to keep saying

1086
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:53,960
no no no you can't ship this I won't let

1087
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,550
you do this I won't let you do that

1088
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,380
which is instead you go about and

1089
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:59,810
they'll learn that this is how we can

1090
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:01,910
build a robust SDL so you can ship more

1091
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:04,100
secure code right or if you find errors

1092
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:05,660
in their code in some cases like the

1093
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,310
technique I employees I know that they

1094
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:08,930
don't have time to fix it or they don't

1095
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:09,799
have time to review it so I just do it

1096
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:11,690
on their behalf

1097
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:13,580
right so it doesn't impact them much but

1098
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:15,530
the ultimate product that we shipped is

1099
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:17,870
much more secure it's which makes both

1100
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:19,610
of us look better so it's basically

1101
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:22,880
explaining this notion that I am NOT

1102
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:24,860
trying to be a jerk right like we have

1103
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,810
to secure this because now we care about

1104
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:28,810
security or this is our job and this is

1105
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:30,950
how we can work as partners or

1106
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:33,440
collaborators to achieve this common

1107
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:41,359
goal so I think that's the basic idea

1108
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:44,540
behind yeah just a quick one on working

1109
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:45,980
the steps this so once you're in there

1110
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:48,080
as the security guy

1111
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:50,060
how do you go about getting the

1112
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:52,220
justification for increasing the

1113
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:56,690
security team size before you end up

1114
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:57,950
blowing yourself away yeah so actually I

1115
00:42:56,690 --> 00:43:00,170
have a good answer for that because I've

1116
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:02,089
used that multiple times so you show the

1117
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:04,190
value of your work and then you show

1118
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:05,990
them this list of 20 other things that

1119
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:07,580
need to be done right

1120
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:09,709
so basically saying I did these three

1121
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:11,779
things this is how much it reduced your

1122
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:14,210
risk score this is how much it impacted

1123
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:15,920
the organization's now we need to do

1124
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:18,410
these 20 other things to become more

1125
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,150
secure and I as a one-person team or

1126
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:22,190
with two people whatever your team size

1127
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:24,980
is we can accomplish only five of them

1128
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:27,110
right the other good thing is to help

1129
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:28,910
make whatever whether it's your CTO that

1130
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:31,430
you report to or any engineering manager

1131
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:34,160
you help them make those prioritization

1132
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:36,230
calls so when you have them decide

1133
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,759
between two critical things and it

1134
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:39,320
basically comes up to them to say like

1135
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,910
okay I'm dropping this critical thing

1136
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,860
which can come and bite me back later

1137
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:45,410
then they'll start thinking about oh we

1138
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:47,180
should really get this person more help

1139
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:54,350
so you know we can accomplish both of

1140
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:56,810
those things you mentioned about

1141
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:58,750
measuring the effects of training do you

1142
00:43:56,810 --> 00:44:01,720
have any recommendations specifically

1143
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:03,130
training application security designed

1144
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,509
for fish I can see the running a

1145
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:08,500
simulation can give you some good data

1146
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:11,890
sure but it's like kind of practices are

1147
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:13,450
way harder to observe America right so

1148
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:17,230
one of the metric that you might wanna

1149
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:20,970
care about is the escape rate of the

1150
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:25,030
bugs which basically means how many bugs

1151
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:26,589
are identified at what level in the SDL

1152
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:29,200
whether it's during the architecture

1153
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:30,550
phase whether it's during the internal

1154
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,490
review whether it's when they've already

1155
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:35,530
gotten live into production and it's

1156
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:37,990
reported externally and what is your

1157
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:40,470
time to fix those bugs right so these

1158
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:43,299
are some of the metrics that you can use

1159
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:45,339
the whole idea behind matrix is to show

1160
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:46,869
to yourself and put the organize like

1161
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:49,000
your leadership team that this thing is

1162
00:44:46,869 --> 00:44:51,160
working right because like you might get

1163
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,109
thousands of vulnerabilities or you

1164
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,940
might get so many attacks so how do you

1165
00:44:53,109 --> 00:44:57,759
show value that you know what I am doing

1166
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:59,500
is working and also like what you can

1167
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:03,550
convince yourself to do more and less

1168
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:05,920
off so that's the idea for like stuff I

1169
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:08,440
mentioned phishing campaigns or security

1170
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,450
awareness test work for apps at work it

1171
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:12,460
can be you know like and defying bugs

1172
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:14,710
another thing you guys can try is like a

1173
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:16,810
bug bash day right you know where a

1174
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:19,030
bunch of developers sit for half a day

1175
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:20,589
try to nail out security bugs and see

1176
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:30,420
you know how many things you guys can

1177
00:45:20,589 --> 00:45:30,420
find and identify so good thanks
