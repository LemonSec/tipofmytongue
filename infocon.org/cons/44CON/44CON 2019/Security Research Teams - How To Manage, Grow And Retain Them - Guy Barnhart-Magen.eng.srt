1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,970
okay I can't actually see any of you but

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:12,840
you'll believe me that I'm very happy to

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,040
be here again my name is guy I'll do it

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,198
proper introduction in a moment I just

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,439
want to say something about this deck

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,570
somewhat personal I usually when I give

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,910
talks I do a lot of technical talks like

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,039
exploitation artificial intelligence and

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,869
stuff like that and those are very

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,510
technical very math oriented talks

11
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,430
because this is my background however I

12
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,020
wanted to do this talk because of a

13
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,940
couple of conversations that I've had in

14
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,239
the past I don't know probably a year or

15
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,709
so about research teams and the place of

16
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:47,578
research teams in larger organizations

17
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:49,140
and I haven't touched anything ok so the

18
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,629
scope of this talk would be more of like

19
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,940
how does managing the research team

20
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:57,449
looks like in a bigger organization big

21
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,399
might be a relative word and if you are

22
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,930
a manager of such a team or you're

23
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,430
looking or thinking about how to manage

24
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,530
such a team I hope that some of those

25
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,270
Nuggets would be very helpful to you but

26
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,770
also if you're a security researcher and

27
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,220
one of those teams I think that this

28
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,960
talk can help you understand the way

29
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,179
that the management thinks about

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,520
research teams and where you can find

31
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,549
yourself the most variable the best

32
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:24,470
pivot for your own InfoSec security and

33
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,470
for your own information security career

34
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:37,079
so first of all hi I'm guy guy behind

35
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,408
Arkham again not expecting I want to

36
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:43,229
actually know how to spell it I talk a

37
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,880
lot I like it so I travel and I speak in

38
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:46,350
many different conferences I just came

39
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,539
back from Vegas where I gave two

40
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,770
technical talks one on Linux hardening

41
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,560
the other about how to accelerate

42
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,798
exploitation using machine learning and

43
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:59,369
today I'm going to talk more about

44
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:01,619
managing security research teams I've

45
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:03,210
been a security researcher for many many

46
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:06,299
years and have transitioned into

47
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:09,679
management roles about 10 years ago I've

48
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:13,260
been in medium sized organizations like

49
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,810
4500 people manages security teams but

50
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,649
also for

51
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:21,450
very large corporations the latest of in

52
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:25,209
Cisco and Intel so both are 70 K plus

53
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:27,730
people in the org so my perspective and

54
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:29,950
this has been from both sides of the

55
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:32,709
table but also from the way that you

56
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:34,450
scale up a very small research team and

57
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:36,040
also when you transition to a role where

58
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:40,299
there's the research team already exists

59
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:43,840
and how to actually drive the most from

60
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:45,550
that situation I'm very biased this is

61
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,950
my own experience I'm very happy to

62
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:49,239
share my own experience but it might be

63
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,179
different in other places

64
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:54,370
not everything translates well even here

65
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,650
in the UK versus Israel where I'm from

66
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:59,950
but also from the United States to other

67
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:01,360
places but try to listen to everything

68
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,339
they say with a grain of salt ask

69
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,019
questions and I'd be happy to share

70
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,019
whatever information do they have

71
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,880
security research teams there are so

72
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,709
many definitions so you might be a pen

73
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,070
tester you might be a model researcher

74
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:20,200
you might be a vulnerability or

75
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:22,840
exploiter you might be a threat hunter

76
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,970
all of those come into the same kind of

77
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,370
grouping called security research teams

78
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:29,049
some of them are more product focused

79
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:31,720
some of them are more service or

80
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:36,250
infrastructure focused some of them are

81
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:37,959
looking at how to break anything some of

82
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,540
them are looking how to break specific

83
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:42,690
things but in the end most of them have

84
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,590
very similar cultures very similar

85
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:47,859
methodologies to the way that they work

86
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:50,139
I'm not trying to differentiate or

87
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:51,970
disrespect any of those teams my

88
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:55,690
background is more in the lower part of

89
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:57,730
this list here has been a red teamer

90
00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:02,739
I've mainly done a low-level

91
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:05,220
exploitation former level stuff as I

92
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:07,660
said I've worked at Intel but I've also

93
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,609
worked a lot with the teams that are on

94
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,630
the other side even on the blue side and

95
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:15,760
that brings me to something that's often

96
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:18,940
missing in many of the conversation and

97
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,700
really shapes the way that other people

98
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:24,159
in the org even other people in IT who

99
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,590
are partners look at research team and

100
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:28,870
that is that we often forget

101
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,849
that the blue team has to win finding

102
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:33,100
exploit is a lot of fun building the

103
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:35,080
exploit is cool you get a lot of creds

104
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,449
you get a CVE you get to speak at

105
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,130
conferences you really haven't moved the

106
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:40,750
needle for the organization by doing

107
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,790
that the only way that you move the

108
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,770
needle to organization is if you went

109
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:47,350
over and helped the blue team to defend

110
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:49,120
against this exploit against this kind

111
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:52,210
of attack and if you're unable to

112
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,680
mitigate this kind of attack you haven't

113
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,520
brought any real value to the

114
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,889
conversation

115
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,020
finding the issue is one thing fixing it

116
00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:01,120
is something greatly different one of

117
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,000
the things that I was very adamant with

118
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,650
all of my teams over the years was that

119
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,550
finding the issue is only one thing but

120
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,780
then you have to work with the

121
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,310
developers you have to work with the

122
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,500
architects to make sure that they

123
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:14,440
understand the root cause and help them

124
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,210
fix the issue and then test that they

125
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,910
actually fix the issue it's not

126
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:20,650
necessarily the same thing and sometimes

127
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:23,440
this gets lost the gets lost in a

128
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:25,270
conversation with our mad dash to run

129
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,539
after the next kind of vulnerability the

130
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:31,419
next kind of a new piece of PR coming

131
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:36,219
out exploiting isn't everything moving

132
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:37,750
the needle is so one of the I want to

133
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,729
share an example here one of the themes

134
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:43,320
that I was leading was very product

135
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:45,610
focus and here we got into kind of a I

136
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,610
would say like a dad spot like a

137
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:51,190
problematic spot because to me to bring

138
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:53,349
value you want to be able to influence

139
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:55,960
the development of the product whatever

140
00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:59,349
the product is in a timely manner to

141
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,760
actually actuate some effect and if

142
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:03,010
you're not doing that then you're have

143
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,229
it really made a change so on the one

144
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:07,090
hand you have to wait until the product

145
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:09,130
is ready for you to do some sort of

146
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:11,830
attack on it because if it's still being

147
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:13,930
written of it's not even alphabet up

148
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,880
ready you have nothing to work with

149
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,020
on the other hand if you're waiting

150
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,240
until you have something to work with

151
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,620
and you go to the development teams or

152
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,570
the architecture team seller look I

153
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,010
found like this list of issues so if

154
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:27,070
it's too late I'm already shipping this

155
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:31,419
version next week so finding that sweet

156
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:32,950
spot of working with those teams getting

157
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:34,599
them the information that they need in

158
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:36,219
order to influence their decisions to

159
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:38,680
change the way that they are building

160
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:40,540
the product is a very delicate balance

161
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,210
and you have to find a

162
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:46,090
to work together with those teams so

163
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:48,370
they will tell you when is the best time

164
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:50,440
to step in and work on their product and

165
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:52,360
it's a balancing act because you have

166
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,180
other jobs to do as well but if you're

167
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,770
not going to hit that timing right you

168
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:00,610
will not be able to move the needle you

169
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:02,229
will not make an effect different teams

170
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,970
have different focus and you have to

171
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,890
take that in mind when you're talking to

172
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:08,770
those teams if you're talking with a

173
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:10,539
blue team IT team that really wants to

174
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:12,010
protect the organization against threat

175
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:14,140
it's a completely different conversation

176
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:17,500
with them working with red team's that

177
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:19,510
are trying to find each and any and a

178
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,940
method available to any outside attacker

179
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:23,080
in order to access the assets or affect

180
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,969
the way that the product is working

181
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,950
those are different mindset different

182
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:28,420
philosophies and that means that when

183
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:32,080
you're building your approach when

184
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:33,820
you're trying to get them on your on

185
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,530
your team and influence the way that

186
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,270
they are working you have to take

187
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:41,289
different approaches and I will discuss

188
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:43,060
some of them later being a manager I'm

189
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:45,040
going to skim over this slides because I

190
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,900
think they're somewhat generic but I

191
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:51,400
have been on teams where they actually

192
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:53,140
didn't know this a manager most the core

193
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,419
of the responsibility of the manager is

194
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:58,330
to define the mission is to say to the

195
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:00,610
team what are we going to do what are we

196
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:02,169
working on is just not handing out tasks

197
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:04,330
but actually time the vision together

198
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:06,640
that everybody is working and pulling

199
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:08,590
together in the right direction it's not

200
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,060
so easy for research teams when

201
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,590
everybody's working on the product and

202
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,080
you have I don't know a JIRA or

203
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:15,609
something similar to that or an agile

204
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,039
process and everybody's working on their

205
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:19,360
user stories it's very visible that if

206
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,660
you are working on something that's

207
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,130
toward the product or not if you're

208
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,290
working on a research team and you have

209
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:28,330
to team members working on something and

210
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:30,840
another working on a PLC and the third

211
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:34,990
one is researching a new piece of

212
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:37,209
technology just came out how do you pull

213
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:41,340
everyone together in working on the same

214
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:44,710
thing it's not an easy problem to solve

215
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:46,330
also as a manager you have to make sure

216
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:48,040
that what your people are working on

217
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:51,490
actually aligns with the business need

218
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,380
and this is something that I've talked

219
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,980
to so many teams that actually forgot

220
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,470
this part

221
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,540
and that is doing research is nice

222
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:01,000
during research for the name of research

223
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,839
probably won't fly for long in most

224
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,840
organization

225
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:07,090
I love project zero I really do I have

226
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,280
friends working project zero and they

227
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:11,740
have the mandate and the budget from

228
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,140
management to do what they do but they

229
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,580
don't go around unchecked looking at

230
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:18,430
anything and everything whatever they

231
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:20,860
fancy they have a work plan they have

232
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:22,599
focus areas they decide ahead of time

233
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,010
where are they going to look at and what

234
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,650
kind of projects are going to approach

235
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:29,650
they're not running around randomly

236
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:31,600
attacking stuff and this is like the

237
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:33,430
gold standard on the other hand I've

238
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,740
talked to research team where yeah I'm

239
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:37,449
researching this stuff on automotive and

240
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,460
another team member is doing something

241
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:42,370
on a V onyx and another team member is

242
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:45,460
just doing some on malware the company

243
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:47,530
does not matter of those domains I agree

244
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,720
that you can learn from anything but you

245
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:51,400
actually have to align what your team is

246
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,650
doing to something that serves the

247
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,060
business because if you don't you're

248
00:09:53,650 --> 00:10:00,160
going to have a very difficult budget

249
00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:03,099
conversation at the end of the year your

250
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,949
team is everything you are as good as

251
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:08,740
your team some managers think that

252
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:10,690
because they are the managers or they're

253
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,640
on the management side they get like

254
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:14,560
special bonus points for being managers

255
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,689
if anything you get deducted boosts and

256
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,910
bonus points for being a manager you

257
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:22,510
have to think about how to push your

258
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:25,209
team forward how to make their results

259
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:27,330
visible to management to other people to

260
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:29,830
make it clear that their work has value

261
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:35,920
this is one of the rows of you as a

262
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:37,930
manager sometimes overlooked getting

263
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,709
people on your team working together

264
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:43,510
especially in the sin of security

265
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:46,420
researchers is difficult this is like a

266
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:48,670
rugged bunch of individuals everyone's

267
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:51,099
an anarchist nobody believes anyone and

268
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:53,020
everyone is paranoid and then they want

269
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,510
a job and they need to work together

270
00:10:53,020 --> 00:11:00,220
towards a common goal

271
00:10:54,510 --> 00:11:03,069
not so easy handling this kind of enough

272
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,660
translates to English herding cats so

273
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:07,450
it's just kind of like trying to get all

274
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,250
of those cats in the single-file walking

275
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,590
in the same direction

276
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:13,110
it's doable but it's not that easy on

277
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:15,210
the other hand if you're not going to do

278
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,920
that you won't have a team so you have

279
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:19,020
to be prepared and to think about your

280
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:22,500
strategy ahead of time of how are you

281
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:24,720
going to do that when I got the

282
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,530
responsibility for my first team that

283
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,060
was lying

284
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't know 11 years ago something like

285
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:31,739
that my manager at the time told me we

286
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,340
have a bunch of somewhat eccentric

287
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:37,200
people how are you going to handle them

288
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:40,110
which was very clear that he was not

289
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,690
handling them and I told him well I

290
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:45,840
don't know I'll work with them and I'll

291
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:48,390
find out what eccentric eccentric teens

292
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,920
they have and see what I can work with

293
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:53,069
and Maura what I have to work without

294
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:56,430
and when I got to know the team I knew I

295
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:58,890
learned how to let go of some stuff but

296
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:02,459
really bring down on other stuff and

297
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:04,439
that really helped because let's be

298
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,700
honest most security researchers have

299
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,630
their pet peeves

300
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:11,730
I had a researcher that vehemently even

301
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:16,230
violently refused to work on anything

302
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:18,420
other than vim why there are other tools

303
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:20,480
other know this was religiously enforced

304
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:24,599
mayhem he would only work inside VI

305
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,160
maybe then on good days okay we can work

306
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,990
with that I'm not forcing anyone what

307
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,030
kind of tooling he needs to use but if

308
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,830
he wants to work on the team he needs to

309
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:33,540
work with the same tools as a team write

310
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:36,870
your own plugin to make it work inside

311
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:39,630
them I don't care so you can make those

312
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:41,730
balances you can make this work if you

313
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:43,740
get prepared ahead of time but if you

314
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,420
don't if you're trying to work with them

315
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,330
and say I'm the boss this is what I've

316
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:53,370
said this has to happen you will not

317
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:55,260
have a team for very long another thing

318
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:57,480
that's very difficult for managers a

319
00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:00,780
specific specifically what I've seen in

320
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:03,000
security research managers is that at

321
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,620
least in my experience 99% of them came

322
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,540
from a security researcher background

323
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:09,300
that means that they have technical

324
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:11,640
proficiency and they have at least an

325
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:14,609
aura of source of some sort of technical

326
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,439
capability and then they got thrust into

327
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:18,180
management maybe they were the best on

328
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,890
their team maybe they were the most

329
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,888
available to it maybe they had a flair

330
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:23,920
for managing

331
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:25,480
people somewhere in the back of their

332
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,160
mind they're still with security

333
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,410
researchers I am still a security

334
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,809
researcher not an active one not even a

335
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:33,879
good one anymore but I'm still think of

336
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:36,160
myself as a security researcher but I'm

337
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:38,169
also a manager and when you go into

338
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,279
management you have to accept that you

339
00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:44,259
are no longer the hands-on type of

340
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,309
contributor you have other important

341
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:46,869
things to do

342
00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:48,969
and you can't do the research yourself

343
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:52,389
that's why you have a team and that's

344
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:54,129
why you have to show the team that you

345
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:56,109
are trusting them that you are leaving

346
00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:58,629
them but you're not trying to take their

347
00:13:56,109 --> 00:14:00,369
place you can't be the only one to speak

348
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:06,549
at blackhat other people need to speak

349
00:14:00,369 --> 00:14:07,660
as well this also effects training

350
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:09,999
decisions

351
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,919
I could probably at the time do the

352
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:13,689
training for my team and teach everybody

353
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:16,089
on my team almost every aspect of the

354
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:18,189
job if I would have done that that would

355
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:20,230
have been a very bad decision not

356
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:23,139
because I can do it but because it

357
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:25,179
shouldn't mean me to do that your best

358
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:27,459
bet is to find people on your team and

359
00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:30,850
empower them give them that

360
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:33,040
responsibility oversee it make sure that

361
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:35,439
they grow from that experience and that

362
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,748
they take on new responsibilities and

363
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:44,199
take that responsibilities off of your

364
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:46,329
backs power and politics is always an

365
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:48,969
issue in almost while I haven't been in

366
00:14:46,329 --> 00:14:52,118
an organization where it wasn't a major

367
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:55,209
driver for decisions but understanding

368
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:57,489
the politics behind them and in to some

369
00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:59,199
degree shielding your team from those

370
00:14:57,489 --> 00:15:02,559
politics is the responsibility of the

371
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:04,809
manager good managers are able to dance

372
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:06,610
between two different poles the first

373
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:08,289
one would be I want to make sure that my

374
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:10,749
team is completely isolated from

375
00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:12,999
corporate on the other hand I

376
00:15:10,749 --> 00:15:15,309
want my team to be open and transparent

377
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:17,049
about everything that's happening even

378
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:19,209
if it's going to stress them out and

379
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:20,919
give them the wrong idea of what's gonna

380
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,779
happen as a manager you have

381
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:25,299
perspectives that they don't have and

382
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:27,279
they are looking to you to share that

383
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:29,410
perspective sometimes you can sometimes

384
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,510
you don't but you have to be as open and

385
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:35,520
respect as you can

386
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:37,020
you will often find that even in our

387
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,400
well it's very common in large

388
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,590
corporates but also in smaller

389
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,630
corporates that there are other teams

390
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:43,860
working on similar things even on

391
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:48,020
exactly the same things that you're

392
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:50,940
working on so ignoring the blatant

393
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:52,290
misuse of resources here this is

394
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,720
something that I at least found to be

395
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:57,480
pretty common at the time when I was

396
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,490
working for Cisco I tried to do like in

397
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,760
an enumeration how many different teams

398
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:05,130
are working in the IOT space at the time

399
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,439
which was like seven years ago seven

400
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:09,270
eight years ago IOT was relatively new

401
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,660
it was not like something today very

402
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:15,210
orderly everybody was doing something

403
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:17,120
and then were like between five to seven

404
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:22,410
different security research teams

405
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:24,630
focusing on IOT why would this happen

406
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:26,910
why should it happen and the answer to

407
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:28,320
that is mainly politics because one of

408
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:29,670
the high level managers the group

409
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,950
managers or something like that said

410
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:33,390
look IOT is a new and sexy field we

411
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,160
should have someone looking into it and

412
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,660
then you have like five of those

413
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,969
managers and each of them has its own

414
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,500
group looking into it and you can see it

415
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,270
again and again it happened with

416
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,700
blockchain it happened with machine

417
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:46,439
learning it happened with IOT and need

418
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,780
to happen with any kind of new buzzwords

419
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:52,790
coming around and new teams will spring

420
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:56,400
up like fresh mushrooms up the drain

421
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:58,560
this causes strife this causes ego

422
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,720
issues this causes a lot of mistrust

423
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,569
between teams that all they all feel

424
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,890
that are competing for the same things

425
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:07,200
both of the team member ends as a

426
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:09,510
manager you have to be aware that this

427
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,130
happens and you have to think about how

428
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:13,619
to make sure that your core

429
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:16,050
responsibilities as a research team are

430
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:18,810
kept intact and not to be dragged away

431
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:21,329
after the newest buzzword that six

432
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:23,970
months to one year later dies out and

433
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:27,990
the team with it so you have to invest

434
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:30,810
your power strategically and realize

435
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:33,690
that some things are transient and not

436
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:38,460
everything needs to be sought-after so

437
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:40,890
vehemently ego is a big problem in

438
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:43,800
management in people in humans in

439
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:45,679
general whenever ego comes into the room

440
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:48,240
someone comes out suffering

441
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,010
you can't leave eagle out of the room

442
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,679
even though many people say that you can

443
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:54,510
or you should if you will keep your ego

444
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:56,760
out of the room somebody else will bring

445
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:58,740
his ego in the room you have to be

446
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,570
prepared for it there are other research

447
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,790
teams other than other research managers

448
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:06,419
out there and some of them will put

449
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:08,220
their ego first think about what are you

450
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,290
going to do in that position how are you

451
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,990
going to react thinking about this

452
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:15,809
before it happens and having a planned

453
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:18,240
response ready will really better your

454
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:21,000
position in the organization and in

455
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:26,670
general lead for a better team both

456
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:32,250
internally and externally skip this one

457
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:34,080
okay so how would you do that I had I am

458
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:36,000
preparing for this slide I had

459
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,550
conversation something like 12 different

460
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,790
research teams across the board as many

461
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:44,669
of you know Israel is a hub for security

462
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:46,770
technology I have friends in many many

463
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:49,559
many different security companies most

464
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:51,900
of them are in the same Watson hood so I

465
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:53,879
kind of asked around and said okay this

466
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,679
is the main issues that I see what do

467
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,450
you feel about that how how would you

468
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,390
tackle this and we had a lot of a lot of

469
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:02,429
lively discussions around how do we

470
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:05,100
actually manage security research teams

471
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:07,530
and I think that the number one issue

472
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,689
that came up is the most important for

473
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:11,639
many different reasons is that if you're

474
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:14,160
not clear or you don't have very clear

475
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,320
guidance about what you're actually

476
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:22,200
researching what the research question

477
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:25,409
is and who does what and why and when to

478
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:28,080
stop the research that leads to a very

479
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:30,179
bad research team experience on the

480
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,639
other hand if you have a manager that

481
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:35,090
clearly defines what you're what you're

482
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,830
going after what you're looking for and

483
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:39,120
timebox is it don't invest more than two

484
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:42,210
weeks around that let's have another

485
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,370
discussion then or whenever you reach to

486
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:46,050
that point that's done I don't need a

487
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:48,209
POC just make sure that you can show

488
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:50,790
that this happened get that address you

489
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:52,860
got that address fine stop there if you

490
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,780
have a very clear definition of what

491
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,189
you're going to do when you're going to

492
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,690
achieve it how it looks like when you

493
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,740
achieve it and when you are going to

494
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,480
stop

495
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:07,470
research team is the whole benefits

496
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:10,440
because they can affect their will their

497
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:13,130
resources their time their effort in a

498
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,450
very coordinated and a very focused way

499
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:18,420
but for every team that doesn't have

500
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:21,300
this thank you for every team that

501
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:23,070
doesn't have this you get a disarray you

502
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,110
get people getting confused to get

503
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:26,850
people investigating something

504
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:29,850
completely relevant for a very long

505
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:32,879
period of time I've heard examples like

506
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:35,340
someone on my team spent a month working

507
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,280
on a POC for something that's completely

508
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:41,250
stupid and irrelevant like I can exploit

509
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:44,520
this refrigerator now through that foods

510
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:47,480
ble stack and I can make it pop out free

511
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:50,490
ice cubes instead of two ice cubes

512
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,230
that's a very nice POC very bit

513
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:54,090
difficult to bring the refrigerator on

514
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:56,610
stage but at least I can make a video

515
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:59,459
but have you really done anything useful

516
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:00,840
if the manager for that team the team

517
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,390
leader for that team would have said

518
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,370
make sure you have code execution stop

519
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:07,980
there I'm happy with code execution and

520
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:11,669
device he wouldn't spend so much time

521
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:13,110
building it and any relevant POC I'm not

522
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,140
dissing POC I'll talk about them later

523
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:19,939
they have value but you have to like

524
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:19,940
focus on what's the right value for POCs

525
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:26,639
building the right research question

526
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:29,700
helps the people who are working on that

527
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,490
research question focus but also to get

528
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,050
focused help from others so when they

529
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:36,690
have a very clear definition of what

530
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:39,530
they're working on and why and they get

531
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:42,780
stuck they can go to another team member

532
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:44,520
another team entirely and ask for help

533
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:47,340
because they know what they're looking

534
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:49,260
for and they know what's irrelevant but

535
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:52,169
if you give them something general like

536
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:53,790
hack this refrigerator you get a lot of

537
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:55,890
kind of different results if you give

538
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:58,740
them something specific like I want to

539
00:21:55,890 --> 00:22:00,710
make sure that nobody can access the

540
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:04,230
Twitter credentials stored on this

541
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:09,300
refrigerator that gives a lot more focus

542
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:10,690
to what they're trying to do being a

543
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,830
manager does not

544
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:15,110
discourage you from being a technical

545
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:17,149
person you have to be a technical person

546
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:19,040
to manage security researchers who's

547
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:20,750
that has been my experience for every

548
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,899
research team that I heard of that they

549
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:27,470
got a non-technical manager either the

550
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:29,840
managers left or the team dispersed it

551
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:32,750
doesn't work well but on the other hand

552
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,030
being a technical person does not mean

553
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:40,430
that you have to do everything hands-on

554
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:42,770
which I just talked about earlier your

555
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:45,350
job is to understand what's wrong and

556
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:47,210
how to fix it when you're working with

557
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:49,189
your team and you see that they spend a

558
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:52,100
disorder net amount of time finding

559
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:53,630
tickets in JIRA well nobody likes JIRA

560
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,969
but you can write some scripts to

561
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:57,860
automate it if you see that most of

562
00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:00,490
their issues come from working with a

563
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:02,389
different team member some cross team

564
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:03,590
collaboration something like that and

565
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:05,540
they're spending lots of times in

566
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:07,790
meetings stuff like that step in

567
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:10,940
separate them find it video a better

568
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:14,000
solution to make that work you need to

569
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:17,480
be the voice for your team to make sure

570
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,270
that nobody is having a painful

571
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,400
experience doing what they need to do if

572
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:25,010
they do they'll either walk around it

573
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,470
that's what we do we'll walk around find

574
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:28,910
workarounds around those issues or we're

575
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,960
probably ignore them completely and

576
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:32,990
something will explode in our faces

577
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:35,060
later so you have to be really on point

578
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:37,130
understand what the team does and how to

579
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:41,780
help them do that team do their job

580
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:44,450
better research teams don't work in a

581
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:47,629
vacuum well they often don't work in a

582
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:49,220
vacuum and if you want to make the most

583
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:51,560
from your team and to make sure that

584
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:55,040
your team really influences the company

585
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:56,810
as a whole show the other stakeholders

586
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,580
your peers your colleagues what the

587
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:02,419
security research team can do for them

588
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:04,460
not just as their leaf a fig leaf to

589
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:06,410
protect their organization but something

590
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,060
that can actually help them in what

591
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:10,420
they're doing and I'll give some

592
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:16,129
examples of that later on how to show

593
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:18,290
ri4 research teams as a manager you also

594
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:22,270
have have to make some tough calls

595
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:22,270
this is your purview it's your turf

596
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:27,850
you even be responsible for active

597
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:29,440
research it's a question that comes up

598
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:31,629
in almost any conversation that they

599
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,640
have in end with any research manager

600
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:35,260
shoot the research managers be even be

601
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,300
responsible for active participation

602
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:38,920
should they be hands-on and this is

603
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,720
something that you should decide and the

604
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:43,210
team should know ahead of time

605
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,770
nobody likes a manager that comes in and

606
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:45,640
pops it up giving the keyboard I'll show

607
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:48,760
you how it's done

608
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:51,340
even if you know how it's done even if

609
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,620
you've done that 300 times before it's

610
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:56,280
better to give people the opportunity to

611
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:58,929
learn and to do that on their own and

612
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:01,420
learn and grow over time

613
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:06,610
then you stepping in and doing it for

614
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:08,320
them another thing is is that you need

615
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:11,080
to think about the future part of your

616
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,360
role as a manager what would happen in a

617
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,610
year from now when person X leaves the

618
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:19,030
company do you have someone else to step

619
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:20,860
in and fill in his shoes maybe she will

620
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:22,389
leave for a better proposition do you

621
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:24,459
know someone that can step in and take

622
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:26,050
over her responsibilities and if the

623
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:28,000
answer is no this is a very senior

624
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:31,389
person he knows everything we trust him

625
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,950
completely you're in a bad position you

626
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:35,800
need to think about how to get out of

627
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:37,030
that bad position maybe find other team

628
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,340
members that can take some of those

629
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:41,980
responsibilities so you'll have a backup

630
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:43,750
and maybe you need to think about what

631
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:46,000
would happen if you leave the

632
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:49,000
organization everybody has a replacement

633
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,920
but have you made the ground to have a

634
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,980
replacement from your team or what do

635
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:56,680
you have someone dropped from outside

636
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:59,080
for your team think about these kinds of

637
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:01,780
issues ahead of time and build your

638
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:04,480
pipeline make sure that you have people

639
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:06,820
ready at different stages Jr's turning

640
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,190
into seniors seniors transition to

641
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,720
leadership roles not necessarily

642
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:12,850
management when transition to other

643
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,330
kinds of fare rolls make sure that there

644
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:18,070
is a let's say an employment horizon for

645
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:19,689
people on your team they're not just

646
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:21,280
coming to be a security researcher for

647
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:23,260
two years or three years and then that's

648
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:26,440
it you have to make sure that they have

649
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:28,480
a career progression it's not a bad word

650
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,030
to have a career we just want to have a

651
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:35,040
car career in InfoSec we need to think

652
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:35,040
about our careers in that kind of lens

653
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:39,270
sometimes people are not the right fit

654
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:42,870
for your team I've had that happened

655
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:45,120
multiple times it takes time to identify

656
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:46,889
that the issue the core issue the root

657
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,449
cause is that you have the wrong people

658
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:51,270
on your team it might be a single person

659
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:53,160
might be two persons and it might be the

660
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:55,139
right thing to do is to transition them

661
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:58,170
to a different team and hire new people

662
00:26:55,140 --> 00:27:01,770
instead it might be a culture issue it

663
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:04,860
might be the way that they work with

664
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:07,620
other people so mill gave an example

665
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:09,090
just an hour ago about bad apples well

666
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:12,560
nobody wants to work with a bad apple

667
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:15,149
and if you can build a better culture by

668
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:17,100
getting the right apples getting the

669
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:19,680
fresh apples in your barrel then you

670
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:22,320
should focus on that this will big bring

671
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:27,120
better results for your entire team than

672
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:30,090
just condoning actions and behaviors

673
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:35,070
from bad apples sometimes you have to

674
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:37,500
and I'll talk to that in the end some of

675
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:40,620
the research managers that I know try to

676
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:42,570
like walk away from hiring so hiring is

677
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:44,250
somebody else's problem let me know when

678
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:46,169
you need the technical part of it being

679
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:48,720
done I'll ask the technical question

680
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:51,420
someone else handle everything else it's

681
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,920
wrong I believe it's wrong I think that

682
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:56,370
as a manager you have to be involved in

683
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:58,410
the hiring process along the entire the

684
00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:00,120
entire stack you have to be part of the

685
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:02,280
sourcing you have to be part of the

686
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:05,090
interview you have to be part of the

687
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:07,230
decision and you have to be part of the

688
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:10,050
transition that the employee does when

689
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:11,790
he gets into the organization a small

690
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:15,530
piece of statistic that I heard from

691
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,530
Google from Harvard Business Review

692
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:04,000
now we're just okay unless so they did

693
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:07,149
this study and the single most effective

694
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,040
factor to try to determine if someone is

695
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:11,980
going to be good or successful after

696
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:14,800
three months I found it very surprising

697
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:18,130
was that the manager the hiring manager

698
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:20,169
would meet them on their first day so to

699
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:22,390
me it was like a blown out statistics

700
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:23,770
what do you mean said some managers

701
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:25,780
don't need the employees on the first

702
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:27,730
day when they get hired and apparently

703
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:30,220
it was like in the 30 percent of the

704
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:32,590
cases the hiring manager was very busy

705
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:35,920
he had meetings he was off-site was

706
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:38,379
somewhere else and so he delegated it to

707
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:41,620
someone else and when that manager is

708
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:43,600
delegating responsibility those people

709
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:46,419
that were hired onto the team felt like

710
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,159
nobody cares about us we're just another

711
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:51,070
cog in the machine we're just another

712
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,990
screw when the manager was there to

713
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:54,310
greet them to walk them around to show

714
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,810
them where they're going to say it to

715
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:58,480
show them the keyboard the toilets the

716
00:29:55,810 --> 00:30:00,250
kitchen they felt like okay we're on

717
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,780
between onboarding to a team into a

718
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:04,660
family we're going to be in the right

719
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:06,670
place and this sounds like a very small

720
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:08,920
thing to do meet your employees on

721
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:12,960
you're free on their first day on the

722
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,960
job apparently it's not that obvious

723
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:20,950
getting a team that's all seniors is

724
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:22,870
very bad I don't know if you've ever had

725
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:26,380
that experience trying to manage a team

726
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:28,330
of six to eight seniors it's a lot of

727
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:31,450
fun a lot of very technical discussions

728
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:33,580
for about 20% of the time and the other

729
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:36,130
80% of the times is being talked about

730
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:38,800
other stuff other than technical which

731
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:41,350
is find are all very good people but now

732
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:44,680
you have no pipeline you have no way to

733
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:46,899
grow the team senior people are by

734
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,580
nature very independent they know what

735
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:51,300
they're doing they're very proficient

736
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:54,699
and very professional in what they do

737
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:56,350
but there are some rows or some stuff

738
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:59,350
that they won't do for some stuff

739
00:30:56,350 --> 00:31:01,389
they're overkill to do on the other hand

740
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:04,480
when you have a team of all juniors and

741
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:07,040
I had the misfortune doing this once

742
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,890
an experience that I don't care to

743
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:12,770
repeat you have a team that everybody is

744
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:15,290
very enthusiastic and nobody knows what

745
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:18,050
they're supposed to do which also it's a

746
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:20,420
good thing I'm not disrespecting any of

747
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:22,879
them but it's a good thing but you need

748
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:24,950
someone to be there on-site on keyboard

749
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,570
to help them to show them the ropes if

750
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:30,770
you're the manager you're not that

751
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:33,250
person so when I build new teams from

752
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:36,760
scratch or when I receive new teams I

753
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:41,450
always push to either get the the

754
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:43,910
directs the hiring requirements to open

755
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:45,980
new headcount for junior people when I

756
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:47,930
had a lot of seniors or if I had a lot

757
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,370
of junior people to say okay stop with

758
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:51,440
the hiring the junior people this

759
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:52,879
doesn't help me take two or three of

760
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,400
those head counts pull them together and

761
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,800
get me seen here because you can't run a

762
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:59,300
show with eight junior people and you

763
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,399
definitely can't run a show with eight

764
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:03,560
senior people you have to think about

765
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,300
your team for the long term you have to

766
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,879
think about your team in a broad sense

767
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:11,379
and not just in making sure that all the

768
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,380
day-to-day operations are being done

769
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:18,200
building an incentive plan for junior

770
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:20,870
people or for senior people for any

771
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:23,900
security researcher is usually dependent

772
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:26,929
on what the researcher care about I this

773
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:29,180
photo was not selected randomly I have a

774
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:32,510
huge incentive to talk right here London

775
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:35,320
is my favorite city but this is also

776
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:39,140
happens quite often because you have

777
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:40,310
tools you have opportunities when you're

778
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:42,440
talking with security researchers

779
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:44,780
there's not not just the salary the

780
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:48,140
server is not the only thing that counts

781
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:49,580
so a couple of things that really help

782
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:52,040
when you're talking with security

783
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:55,689
researchers is showing them that there

784
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:57,649
are other venues or other methods to

785
00:32:55,690 --> 00:33:00,080
drinking's one but hopefully not the

786
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:02,840
only thing other things that they can do

787
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,970
in your team that actually they might

788
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:08,720
not be able to do in other teams so

789
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:11,030
publishing work is a difficult point

790
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,730
I'll give my own perspective in that I

791
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:15,830
worked for Intel someone might have

792
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:17,120
heard of that company for the past two

793
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:18,000
and a half years I left like three

794
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,939
months ago

795
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,900
and it took me over a year to get the

796
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:28,380
approval process and marketing people PR

797
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:30,360
people legal people HR people everybody

798
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:33,120
aligned properly so I would have

799
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,469
permission to go and talk and it wasn't

800
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,969
because anybody was thinking oh you

801
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,690
shouldn't talk about that subject it's

802
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:39,780
very risky

803
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:41,910
we're very paranoid it's more like we

804
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:44,129
haven't encountered anyone who actually

805
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:48,840
wanted to speak how would we go about

806
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:51,000
this we have no process so yeah that's

807
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:53,850
another way but that won't last for long

808
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,280
hitting them really clears out the

809
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:59,669
senses but doesn't affect change for a

810
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:01,530
longer period of time so if you can get

811
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:03,570
it done and I'd be happy to bring to

812
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:05,310
help you some tips on how to do that but

813
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:07,740
it also really helped with getting

814
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:11,250
people on my team because once the

815
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:13,500
people other people heard that my team

816
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:15,960
is out there presenting talking and

817
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:17,610
going to conferences so I want to be

818
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,220
part of that team this is the stuff that

819
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:22,730
I care about I want to do that this is a

820
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:25,199
very marginal cost to you as a manager

821
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:28,340
allowing or sending your people to speak

822
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:31,830
at conferences it's a very cheap

823
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:34,260
incentive to include in the package site

824
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:36,000
research is also very important allowing

825
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:38,100
your people to grow and enhance their

826
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,280
skills is a benefit to use an employer

827
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:42,540
doing this doing so on the side research

828
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,720
it's actually beneficial for the

829
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:48,179
business is good for you as well Google

830
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:50,609
has their or at least had a 20% to roll

831
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:51,779
most of the companies can't afford one

832
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:54,000
day week with somebody walks on

833
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:56,040
something that they care about but find

834
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,870
a side side project that everybody and

835
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:01,250
the team can care about and work on it

836
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:03,750
especially if you have some downtime

837
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:06,180
sending people to conferences is the way

838
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:09,810
that we as security professionals really

839
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:11,879
learn and improve our abilities some of

840
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:13,650
that actually comes from listening to

841
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,480
talks probably a very small percentage

842
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:17,370
of that most of that comes from

843
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,920
attending the office and talking to

844
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:21,569
other people and getting new views and

845
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,120
hearing about new tool sets a new

846
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:26,040
frameworks this is actually what happens

847
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:28,049
at conferences and it's a very difficult

848
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,850
sell when you go to corporate and say I

849
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:30,779
really have to go to that conference and

850
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:33,848
talk to people

851
00:35:30,779 --> 00:35:35,200
they don't get it but you can't go to

852
00:35:33,849 --> 00:35:37,059
them and said I really have to go to

853
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,859
that conference and do that workshop and

854
00:35:37,059 --> 00:35:40,930
do that training and go to other

855
00:35:38,859 --> 00:35:42,788
sponsors and the vendors and see what

856
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:45,368
they're doing and to better enrich my

857
00:35:42,789 --> 00:35:48,039
own intelligent feeds on on how stuff is

858
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:50,079
done they can relate to that so change

859
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:52,569
your messaging the same thing still

860
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,980
happens if other people know that your

861
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:56,500
team is part of the community

862
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:58,690
contributing to the community they would

863
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,099
love coming working for your team even

864
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:03,490
if a different team is offering more

865
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:10,440
money and that's also very strongly

866
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:14,769
correlated to retaining those people ok

867
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:17,859
I'll try to hustle a bit another thing

868
00:36:14,769 --> 00:36:19,689
that really comes about pretty often in

869
00:36:17,859 --> 00:36:22,210
conversation about rescue research teams

870
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:26,019
is how do you show the organization the

871
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:28,660
return on investment I have an encounter

872
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:30,459
where I encountered one so I almost

873
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:34,000
never encountered a security research

874
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:36,130
team that was tied to a P&L Center to a

875
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,049
profit and loss center most security

876
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:39,910
research teams are part of a some sort

877
00:36:38,049 --> 00:36:42,910
of research division where they get a

878
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:44,288
budget but they don't have revenue so in

879
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:46,299
the corporate world that means that

880
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:48,279
there are a cost center they cost money

881
00:36:46,299 --> 00:36:50,019
to operate they are not getting any

882
00:36:48,279 --> 00:36:51,880
money from operating that piece of the

883
00:36:50,019 --> 00:36:54,269
business so whenever you have budget

884
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:56,650
conversation headcount conversations

885
00:36:54,269 --> 00:36:59,558
anything with someone else in the

886
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:01,210
management chain in the in the overall

887
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:03,369
corporate world there say ok but you're

888
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:05,680
just costing me money show me what's

889
00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:08,019
your value understanding how they think

890
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,759
about value and thinking about some of

891
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:11,649
these ideas will help you be better

892
00:37:09,759 --> 00:37:13,089
positioned for those conversations and

893
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:16,740
you have to be ready for those

894
00:37:13,089 --> 00:37:16,740
conversations because they will happen

895
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:21,879
the first thing is that whatever you're

896
00:37:19,809 --> 00:37:23,529
working on should be aligned with what

897
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:26,380
the business is working on aniline is

898
00:37:23,529 --> 00:37:28,210
not something like flimsy like we are

899
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:30,069
working in IOT so I'll work in IOT as

900
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:32,710
well you have to show that what you're

901
00:37:30,069 --> 00:37:34,329
working if it's successful if you fund

902
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:36,309
whatever you're looking for or if you

903
00:37:34,329 --> 00:37:38,230
show that you're not able to find what

904
00:37:36,309 --> 00:37:40,930
you're looking for has actual business

905
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:42,609
value and you get that from talking to

906
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:44,290
the business people who actually care

907
00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:46,299
about their product

908
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:47,950
you go to them and say oh you have a web

909
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,930
facing product and I can show you that

910
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:51,899
if you use this library then the hacker

911
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:54,580
can come in and take all of our

912
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:56,800
customer's data that's pretty bad

913
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:58,870
he understands the value for something

914
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,240
pretty bad going to happen doing

915
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:04,319
research like I want to do research or

916
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:07,209
new types of xxs XSS vulnerabilities

917
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,860
nobody cares but if you can show that

918
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:10,990
these new types of exercise or abilities

919
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:12,190
are applicable to the website that

920
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:14,290
they're working on or that the

921
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:20,920
application that they're deploying you

922
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:23,200
have immediate are I sometimes on I

923
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:26,350
really can quantify this numbers all

924
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,480
just like 60% of the times security

925
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:29,830
research teams go on a rabbit hole and

926
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,930
have no idea how they're going to come

927
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:34,180
out the other end they might find

928
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:37,000
something or they might not what often

929
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:38,529
happens is you go one rabbit rabbit hole

930
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,790
you come out from a different path of

931
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:41,800
the finding something else completely

932
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:42,970
and that's fine for a research team is

933
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,430
part of the way that they do business

934
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:47,980
but you as a manager need to be prepared

935
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:49,990
for that and have a plans to set in

936
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:52,360
motion once you have those results to

937
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:55,180
show those results and get buy-in from

938
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:57,790
people above you sideways you below you

939
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:59,830
when you have those results to show that

940
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:02,680
you haven't conducted that research in

941
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:04,210
vain however I met many research teams

942
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,919
that didn't have that plan ready

943
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:08,050
so they invested a lot of time they

944
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,150
found something interesting and now they

945
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:12,100
don't know what to do with it so now

946
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:13,810
they start shopping around see maybe

947
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,770
someone can use this maybe someone can

948
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,060
do a tool from it

949
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,650
maybe we can improve a piece of our

950
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:20,740
product that might use this then they

951
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:22,390
found that nobody does make sure that

952
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:24,069
you have a plan to set in motion once

953
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,730
you have something and if you don't have

954
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,860
a plan for that

955
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:30,520
think very strongly of why don't you

956
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:32,470
have a plan for that and that comes to

957
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:35,410
the point of do you really need proof of

958
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:37,540
concepts everybody loves PLC's everybody

959
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:39,430
loves building them this is the closest

960
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:42,850
that most security researchers come to

961
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:45,640
actually building products in most cases

962
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:48,400
that I've seen the POC was unneeded was

963
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:50,170
even completely unnecessary because if

964
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,020
you can take the same concept sit with

965
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:54,790
the development showing what can be done

966
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:58,060
you can probably solve that problem

967
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:59,680
right there right now building a POC you

968
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:01,690
best two weeks of your life building it

969
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,069
and then you have to demo it around to

970
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:05,290
people to try to understand why it's

971
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:06,970
relevant what they're built and it

972
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:08,650
doesn't even overlap a lot this build

973
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:12,250
instead of just showing them in their

974
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:13,840
code a POC is sometimes are very useful

975
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:16,000
especially if you need to build a dam or

976
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:18,010
something for management but if you

977
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,800
don't have a very strong reason to do so

978
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:26,770
skip the POC go straight to the source

979
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:29,620
and fix those issues don't go about any

980
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:30,220
kinds of tangents or weird research

981
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:32,770
paths

982
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:35,109
nobody cares about not because you can't

983
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:37,270
or you shouldn't but because you will

984
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:40,480
lose the trust of your business partners

985
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:42,220
of your colleagues very very fast do

986
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,470
this from time to time there's a good

987
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:46,209
compelling reason to do so but most of

988
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:48,759
the time you should be going after stuff

989
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:54,430
that's relevant for the business for

990
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:57,430
some reason people forget this don't

991
00:40:54,430 --> 00:41:00,700
just go for bugs everybody can find bugs

992
00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:02,080
buzzing your folks find bugs take those

993
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:04,149
bugs and find something that really

994
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:06,400
matters that that has a root cause that

995
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:08,350
might change a lot of things that might

996
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,680
make security better overall for the

997
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:13,930
product security research resources are

998
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,569
very expensive don't waste them on

999
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:18,910
finding just menial bugs focus them on

1000
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:22,840
finding important impactful things for

1001
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:24,850
the business you should also plan for

1002
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:27,460
down times because sometimes you won't

1003
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:29,620
have a new project in the pipeline so be

1004
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:31,750
prepared have side projects ready

1005
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:34,900
maybe something working something lower

1006
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:36,850
priority maybe something that the entire

1007
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:40,240
team can benefit from like new skills or

1008
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:42,490
new technologies you can also think

1009
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,200
about doing bug bounties responsible

1010
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:45,879
disclosure start of things with the

1011
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,950
caveat that you have to involve legal

1012
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,840
because as an employee you might get

1013
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:52,120
into a hairy situation working on other

1014
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:54,160
people's products stuff like that still

1015
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:56,140
doable you can still spend some time

1016
00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:01,870
doing that when you don't have something

1017
00:41:56,140 --> 00:42:05,740
more pressing to do one of the most

1018
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:09,200
effective things that I've used in order

1019
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:13,399
to show the ROI for my teams

1020
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:15,750
alternative costs if we found that issue

1021
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,579
what would have been the cost to fix it

1022
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:20,130
what would have been the cost from men

1023
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:22,559
hours what would the cost from marketing

1024
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:25,529
perspective the damage to the brand what

1025
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:27,720
would be the cost from other waste of

1026
00:42:25,529 --> 00:42:29,849
resources that might happen aggregate

1027
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,919
that number now calculate how much the

1028
00:42:29,849 --> 00:42:34,410
headcount cost for your team for that

1029
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,750
period of time and weigh them against

1030
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:39,029
their one another and often you can show

1031
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:41,609
that if you spend a week or two or three

1032
00:42:39,029 --> 00:42:43,200
of your team's resources it's much much

1033
00:42:41,609 --> 00:42:50,460
cheaper than have someone else in the

1034
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:52,439
wild doing the same thing you should

1035
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:54,930
invest in automation as much as you can

1036
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:57,000
even for security research teams getting

1037
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:59,129
good practices down getting good

1038
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,680
automation down will free up their time

1039
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:05,549
to focus on the important stuff try to

1040
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:08,339
get as much of the code the black work

1041
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:09,990
or the the dirty work out of their hands

1042
00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:12,058
and into the hands of automation because

1043
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:17,129
we can and we really shouldn't do this

1044
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:18,420
my hand by now over time after the first

1045
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:19,470
time you'll do this calculation the

1046
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:22,589
second time the third time the first

1047
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:24,480
time you will have a new RI path to show

1048
00:43:22,589 --> 00:43:27,420
and that is you're saving the

1049
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:29,700
organization money over time and that is

1050
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:31,380
the first issue we found save the

1051
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:34,710
organization 1 million dollars

1052
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:36,720
the second issue failed $500,000 the

1053
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:38,700
third issue save 1 million dollars or

1054
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,348
whatever it is and then you can put it

1055
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:43,109
in a very nice graph you do it in Excel

1056
00:43:40,349 --> 00:43:44,700
if buddy loves excelling management you

1057
00:43:43,109 --> 00:43:47,308
do the graph and you show over time

1058
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:49,589
we've saved such-and-such money for the

1059
00:43:47,309 --> 00:43:51,390
org it was 10 million dollars from the

1060
00:43:49,589 --> 00:43:53,490
inception of the team but 3 million

1061
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:55,470
dollars the last year alone ma

1062
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:57,569
management loved those numbers you will

1063
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:59,549
get support from management much faster

1064
00:43:57,569 --> 00:44:02,009
when you talk their language other than

1065
00:43:59,549 --> 00:44:03,269
saying we found an RCE and if somebody

1066
00:44:02,009 --> 00:44:05,730
else found that our C that would have

1067
00:44:03,269 --> 00:44:12,959
been horrible they have no idea what it

1068
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:14,070
is even after you explain it when you

1069
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,500
give you T

1070
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:18,330
goals or even more than that when you

1071
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,790
declare your goals upward in the

1072
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:23,610
management chain be very careful about

1073
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:24,600
what you want to measure because what

1074
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:27,570
you're going to measure what you're

1075
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:30,150
going to optimize for matters and when

1076
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:32,220
you are deciding of those metrics for

1077
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:35,460
your team which are going to be measured

1078
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:38,819
against you might make mistakes a common

1079
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:41,280
one that I found is that people give

1080
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:44,340
their metric as how many bugs is that my

1081
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:46,380
team found over a period of time or a

1082
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:48,630
number of bugs their lines of code we

1083
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:51,180
looked at or other kinds of metrics like

1084
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:52,950
that I really really don't like those

1085
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:55,740
metrics and the reason for it is because

1086
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:58,020
you can take a two-week period and find

1087
00:44:55,740 --> 00:45:00,089
10 bugs you can make it take another 2

1088
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:02,040
week period and find a single bug and

1089
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:04,140
you can take a four month period and

1090
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:06,330
find no bugs and all of them would have

1091
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:08,310
equivalent value from a business

1092
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:10,259
perspective and if you only measure

1093
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:11,910
yourself on the number of bugs what

1094
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,620
would happen is that one of your

1095
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:15,359
teammates will write a JIRA script to

1096
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:17,910
file new bugs automatically from the

1097
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:20,130
fastener thermic that you use and then

1098
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:22,259
you have 1,000 new bugs and the metrics

1099
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:24,320
are through the roof and you flooded the

1100
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:27,450
system out and nobody cares anymore

1101
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:31,830
think very closely about what are your

1102
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:34,200
goals what are your metrics sometimes

1103
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:37,529
you will have to build a PLC to show to

1104
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:39,810
upper management to show upper

1105
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:41,940
management what you're working on and

1106
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:43,350
how much value it has sometimes it's

1107
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:45,750
something completely stupid

1108
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:49,830
for example we build a demo that shows

1109
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:51,900
that you can upload an image into an

1110
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:54,210
image classification machine learning

1111
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:56,730
system and then you change all of the

1112
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:59,910
images to begin to have labels called

1113
00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:02,250
hacked hacked hacked stupid it was

1114
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:05,220
really from a POC perspective was like a

1115
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:06,840
better script equivalent of a POC from

1116
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:08,129
management perspective was this first

1117
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:10,590
time that they actually understood what

1118
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:13,950
it means to hack machine learning so

1119
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:16,620
PLC's have value if you create them for

1120
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:18,330
a very specific purpose if you just

1121
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:19,859
create them to talk to other developers

1122
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:21,270
about what's wrong with their code over

1123
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:24,530
their security impact that you found

1124
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:24,530
you're doing it wrong

1125
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:30,670
you're going to have to tune your ROI

1126
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:32,470
again and again and again because every

1127
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:35,440
org is different and rules keeps

1128
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:37,089
changing but you have as the manager you

1129
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,680
have to be on top of that because that's

1130
00:46:37,089 --> 00:46:42,430
the way that the organization measures

1131
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:44,049
you and as a research team you're kind

1132
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:45,520
of like an outlier of organization

1133
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:48,160
you're the developer team you're not a

1134
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:49,420
QA team you're not finance you're not HR

1135
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,640
you're not something that they're used

1136
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:54,490
to and they know how to manage in in

1137
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:57,308
measure and budget you're something that

1138
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:59,910
just cost a lot of money and if you're

1139
00:46:57,309 --> 00:47:02,680
doing your job properly nothing happens

1140
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:05,920
that's very difficult for finance people

1141
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:08,410
for HR people to measure because impact

1142
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:10,150
is not a parent think about it all the

1143
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:14,799
time how are you going to visualize how

1144
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:20,380
can you float upward the value of your

1145
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:21,849
team when you're in down time excellent

1146
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:22,960
time to review everything again maybe

1147
00:47:21,849 --> 00:47:24,670
you can do something differently

1148
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,220
collaborate with your team they might

1149
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:29,530
have better ideas of how to do that in

1150
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:31,629
the end you get what you measure and

1151
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:33,130
that means that if you measure for the

1152
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:35,980
wrong things you will get the wrong

1153
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:38,049
results it's not easy to measure for the

1154
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:41,260
right things and the goals post keeps

1155
00:47:38,049 --> 00:47:47,109
changing but be on top of it and pay

1156
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:49,390
close attention just as a short note on

1157
00:47:47,109 --> 00:47:51,609
conferences we're all here right now at

1158
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:53,049
conferences so I'm speaking to the choir

1159
00:47:51,609 --> 00:47:55,270
here everybody here believes that

1160
00:47:53,049 --> 00:47:56,859
conferences are important but whenever

1161
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:58,180
you have a conversation trying to

1162
00:47:56,859 --> 00:48:00,130
explain to someone else while going to

1163
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:03,399
conferences is important maybe some of

1164
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:05,440
these ideas will help so the first thing

1165
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:07,420
is that if you're a security researcher

1166
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,250
going to conferences is part of being a

1167
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:10,720
security researcher you need to have the

1168
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:12,460
budget set aside for it and you have to

1169
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,439
have the goals ready and measured

1170
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:16,299
against if you're not going to do that

1171
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:18,460
it means that you will have troubles

1172
00:48:16,299 --> 00:48:21,339
hiring talent because you're not doing

1173
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:22,809
that and other places are this is an

1174
00:48:21,339 --> 00:48:24,308
argument that the HR really likes

1175
00:48:22,809 --> 00:48:27,420
because it helps them measure themselves

1176
00:48:24,309 --> 00:48:30,520
against the rest of the industry

1177
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:32,170
learning investing in learning for

1178
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:34,690
security researcher is not just easy

1179
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:37,660
like getting a udemy class for the new

1180
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:38,540
nodejs framework or something you don't

1181
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:40,279
get security

1182
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:41,509
that way you have to talk to other

1183
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:46,520
people you have to learn from other

1184
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:48,170
people also you need your people to be

1185
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:51,200
out there and representing your brand

1186
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:53,900
your team your company so you will have

1187
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:57,080
an easier time to hire other people I

1188
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:59,560
have a letter that I wrote and I don't

1189
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:01,759
have any problem open sourcing it

1190
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:04,880
sending it to my own corporate ladder

1191
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:06,860
showing them why I got an ROI from

1192
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:09,410
attending and sponsoring conferences I

1193
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:10,880
was trying to hire security researchers

1194
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:13,040
for about eight months

1195
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,380
zero hires I couldn't find anyone I

1196
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:17,180
started sponsoring those conferences

1197
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:18,860
giving talks at conferences getting

1198
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:22,609
myself out there and talking about what

1199
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:24,470
we do I got five hires in six months for

1200
00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:25,940
me these are very strong numbers now not

1201
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:31,480
very different from the other numbers in

1202
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:31,480
our industry so the RI is very apparent

1203
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:39,830
okay so what do you get by attending

1204
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:42,339
those conferences a lot of on of a lot

1205
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:45,259
of trainings are only offered on-site

1206
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:47,330
workshops free everybody loves free

1207
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:48,790
workshops also on-site you have to be

1208
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:52,100
there to do them

1209
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:54,020
CTF a great opportunity to learn usually

1210
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:58,250
on-site sometimes their remote mostly

1211
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:59,810
they're not you can go to the talks not

1212
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:02,390
a very strong argument because most of

1213
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:04,640
them get to be available online sometime

1214
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:06,259
after the fact however going to the

1215
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:08,480
underground talks which is any talk

1216
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:10,220
that's not recorded it's probably worth

1217
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,710
your time and effort to attend that talk

1218
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:15,230
so for example I gave a talk about

1219
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:16,580
machine learning in numerous places but

1220
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:19,400
I gave one talk about machine learning

1221
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:21,680
in the peaceful sky talks in DEFCON and

1222
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:23,690
in that talk I kind of ripped to shreds

1223
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,759
many of the machine learning algorithms

1224
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:28,640
in the security and we seen how there

1225
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:32,540
are for any for loss of a better word

1226
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:34,220
lying about their statistics yeah

1227
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:35,509
anybody in the business no that's not

1228
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:37,490
true I just showed the numbers why

1229
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:39,200
they're not true so a lot of stuff that

1230
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:40,819
you can go and see in underground talks

1231
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,609
you will not be able to see anywhere

1232
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:46,520
else but the most valuable thing is

1233
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:49,310
talking to other people the amount of

1234
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:51,980
ideas research opportunities that I

1235
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:52,369
found in conferences for my team for my

1236
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:55,279
comm

1237
00:50:52,369 --> 00:50:57,829
for every position that I've held was

1238
00:50:55,279 --> 00:51:00,440
extraordinarily valuable compared to the

1239
00:50:57,829 --> 00:51:03,769
cost of attending that conference so

1240
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:06,170
much so that I left Intel maybe three

1241
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:09,288
months ago four months ago I attended

1242
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:12,440
the hacker summer camp this Vegas a

1243
00:51:09,289 --> 00:51:15,259
month ago on my own expense because it's

1244
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:19,999
worthwhile and I don't have a stronger

1245
00:51:15,259 --> 00:51:22,630
argument in that I'll skip this one also

1246
00:51:19,999 --> 00:51:26,058
a good thing to share with your team

1247
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:28,940
this is an important one so it's going

1248
00:51:26,059 --> 00:51:30,499
to convince is just a fancy bonus which

1249
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:34,039
is a nice picture of Vegas by the way

1250
00:51:30,499 --> 00:51:35,808
from the Bellagio I don't think so but

1251
00:51:34,039 --> 00:51:37,910
if you don't have a clear criteria on

1252
00:51:35,809 --> 00:51:40,999
who gets to go to the conference's in

1253
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:43,940
your team you can find yourself very

1254
00:51:40,999 --> 00:51:46,669
very fast in a place of doing favoritism

1255
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:48,769
nepotism stuff like that which brings

1256
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:50,869
out bad apples in your team and you

1257
00:51:48,769 --> 00:51:53,209
don't want to be there have clear

1258
00:51:50,869 --> 00:51:56,359
criteria make sure that people that go

1259
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:58,039
share their knowledge and make sure that

1260
00:51:56,359 --> 00:52:00,109
you get something out of the process it

1261
00:51:58,039 --> 00:52:02,029
might be a hiring pipeline it might be a

1262
00:52:00,109 --> 00:52:03,890
blog social awareness something don't

1263
00:52:02,029 --> 00:52:05,930
just send people to conferences and

1264
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:07,879
that's it it's a waste of your money

1265
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:10,940
it's a waste of their effort make

1266
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:12,799
something out of it try to plan ahead

1267
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:14,359
what are you going to do what are you

1268
00:52:12,799 --> 00:52:16,849
going to spend your budget on get a

1269
00:52:14,359 --> 00:52:19,609
budget for it sponsorship opportunities

1270
00:52:16,849 --> 00:52:21,589
giving a conference $1,000 to make sure

1271
00:52:19,609 --> 00:52:24,680
that they have their logo your company's

1272
00:52:21,589 --> 00:52:26,719
logo is a huge value to get in front of

1273
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:28,729
the people you care to be in front of I

1274
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:31,609
haven't mentioned that but I am one of

1275
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:34,640
the organizers of besides Tel Aviv it's

1276
00:52:31,609 --> 00:52:37,848
a relatively large secure conference in

1277
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:39,739
Israel about 1200 people and getting an

1278
00:52:37,849 --> 00:52:42,170
opportunity to just have your logo in

1279
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:44,390
front of 1200 security professionals

1280
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:47,239
it's probably worth more than thousand

1281
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:52,609
dollars and this directly affects your

1282
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:54,979
hiring pipeline in order to get the most

1283
00:52:52,609 --> 00:52:57,078
value out of this have a pipeline where

1284
00:52:54,979 --> 00:52:58,788
they have a process ready how you're

1285
00:52:57,079 --> 00:53:00,259
going to do that who do you need to talk

1286
00:52:58,789 --> 00:53:02,359
to who do you need a legal

1287
00:53:00,259 --> 00:53:04,489
who do you need a social who holds the

1288
00:53:02,359 --> 00:53:06,250
keys to the Twitter account make sure

1289
00:53:04,489 --> 00:53:09,700
that you have all of that information in

1290
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:11,500
and that brings me to Talent the

1291
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:13,210
situation we have today I don't know how

1292
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:15,040
strongly you feel it here but I can tell

1293
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:17,980
you definitely how strongly you feel it

1294
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:20,410
in Israel it's a seller's market most

1295
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:23,440
people can name their price and more

1296
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:24,970
than that the half-life time of that the

1297
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,880
security research is looking for a new

1298
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:29,589
position is around two weeks and usually

1299
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:32,470
that means that most of them already

1300
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:33,760
have a new signed contract in hand by

1301
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:36,759
the time that they let you know that

1302
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:38,349
they're leaving the work place that

1303
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:40,900
means that you don't only have to work

1304
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:42,550
fast you have to be out there with

1305
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:44,920
fillers out there to understand when

1306
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:47,500
something goes wrong but also who you're

1307
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:49,060
going to hire once someone leaves if you

1308
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:51,160
start right now trying to hire a new

1309
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:53,609
person it might takes you months to fill

1310
00:53:51,160 --> 00:54:01,710
that void if two persons leave your team

1311
00:53:53,609 --> 00:54:04,830
that's a huge void to fill now so

1312
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:07,900
sourcing where can you find that talent

1313
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:10,900
going to conferences going to community

1314
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:13,359
events sponsoring events getting on the

1315
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:15,730
right groups mailing lists IRC channel

1316
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:19,240
slack channels lots of different

1317
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:21,250
opportunities be out there talk to the

1318
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:23,109
people who are living ask them why are

1319
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:28,510
they living there are red flags you

1320
00:54:23,109 --> 00:54:32,319
should be aware of if they are something

1321
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:35,530
messed up my slides okay don't leave

1322
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:41,589
sourcing for HR do this yourself work

1323
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:44,140
with HR another note which is very

1324
00:54:41,589 --> 00:54:45,640
important is that what happens in a lot

1325
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:47,440
of cases is that you take your best

1326
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:50,290
security researcher and you make him a

1327
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:52,390
team leader most cases this is the wrong

1328
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:54,790
decision is the wrong decision because

1329
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:56,348
being a manager or a team leader is a

1330
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:58,810
different skill set and being a very

1331
00:54:56,349 --> 00:55:01,000
talented security researcher that's true

1332
00:54:58,810 --> 00:55:02,650
for most teams but even more so for

1333
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,820
security research teams because security

1334
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:08,109
researchers if I'll take the like the

1335
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:10,180
the metaphor for what a security

1336
00:55:08,109 --> 00:55:11,799
research is is some introvert working in

1337
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:15,250
a basement with the hoodie over his head

1338
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:16,960
that's obviously not true but for most

1339
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:19,119
cases I think that we can say that we

1340
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,660
are rugged individuals we don't work

1341
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:22,990
well

1342
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:24,609
with teams we work best alone when we

1343
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:27,160
are doing deep dives into technical

1344
00:55:24,609 --> 00:55:28,450
stuff it's not really the framework that

1345
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:31,740
you would want for a manager

1346
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:34,480
think about how you separate the two

1347
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:37,029
when people leave you you should focus

1348
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:39,160
your attention about fixing the problems

1349
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:43,750
that cause people to leave in some cases

1350
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:46,569
you won't be able to for example and a

1351
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:48,130
different workplace is offering a lot

1352
00:55:46,569 --> 00:55:50,740
more money than what we are offering for

1353
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:53,890
example one of our sites in Israel where

1354
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:55,750
I was at the Intel got a new employer

1355
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:58,058
called Amazon which you might have heard

1356
00:55:55,750 --> 00:56:01,690
of and they paid between forty to sixty

1357
00:55:58,059 --> 00:56:03,400
percent above market for talent I can't

1358
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:05,530
argue with any person who comes to me

1359
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:07,660
and saying this new places offer means

1360
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:09,309
sixty percent more on my salary I'm not

1361
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:11,950
trying to argue I can't I don't have the

1362
00:56:09,309 --> 00:56:14,829
tools to do that but for other cases

1363
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:16,270
maybe you can do something someone tells

1364
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:17,530
you look I'm just I want a more

1365
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:20,349
interesting position I'll be doing the

1366
00:56:17,530 --> 00:56:22,329
same thing for two three years find them

1367
00:56:20,349 --> 00:56:23,829
a new thing to do a new stuff to work on

1368
00:56:22,329 --> 00:56:25,750
a different team to transition into

1369
00:56:23,829 --> 00:56:27,099
their in asset to our organization

1370
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:28,599
they're already know the organization

1371
00:56:27,099 --> 00:56:30,539
help them stay

1372
00:56:28,599 --> 00:56:33,579
help them make the best of themselves

1373
00:56:30,539 --> 00:56:35,170
and if somebody says that I'm leaving

1374
00:56:33,579 --> 00:56:40,000
because I can't stand that manager

1375
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:41,829
that's a red flag research again Harvard

1376
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,839
Business Review has shown that in over

1377
00:56:41,829 --> 00:56:45,640
seventy percent of the cases when people

1378
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:47,470
leave their workplace they don't go

1379
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:49,569
because they don't pay enough money they

1380
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:51,669
don't go because the benefits of change

1381
00:56:49,569 --> 00:56:52,720
they go because they don't want to work

1382
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:54,670
for that manager anymore

1383
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:56,618
manager are the number one reason why

1384
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:59,049
people leave their workplace think of

1385
00:56:56,619 --> 00:57:01,510
your own personal histories in how many

1386
00:56:59,049 --> 00:57:03,250
of those places you worked at did you

1387
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:04,089
really like your manager but you decided

1388
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:06,539
to leave anyway

1389
00:57:04,089 --> 00:57:08,650
maybe if you're offered a lot more money

1390
00:57:06,539 --> 00:57:11,289
probably not if you offered the same

1391
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:13,839
amount of money you won't leave your

1392
00:57:11,289 --> 00:57:16,930
current workplace for an added I don't

1393
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:20,770
know pop-tarts or something are some

1394
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:22,270
bonus meals or something retaining

1395
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:24,670
talent is very difficult

1396
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:26,619
think about what interests them most and

1397
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:28,990
get them what interests that most I

1398
00:57:26,619 --> 00:57:31,480
always had some toys lying around when I

1399
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:32,269
say toys I mean raspberry pies some

1400
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:34,519
pieces

1401
00:57:32,269 --> 00:57:36,769
good we can play with some lab that we

1402
00:57:34,519 --> 00:57:40,279
can work her a hassle around with

1403
00:57:36,769 --> 00:57:42,678
something we can do books learning most

1404
00:57:40,279 --> 00:57:44,809
of the people I worked with would give a

1405
00:57:42,679 --> 00:57:46,719
lot to get like I really wanted this

1406
00:57:44,809 --> 00:57:48,949
malware research volume number six

1407
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:51,079
that's a benefit that I can give it's

1408
00:57:48,949 --> 00:57:52,999
like a hundred dollars it's like nothing

1409
00:57:51,079 --> 00:57:55,759
but the ratio between the amount of

1410
00:57:52,999 --> 00:58:01,038
money did cost versus the payout in

1411
00:57:55,759 --> 00:58:03,619
retention is huge but the single most

1412
00:58:01,039 --> 00:58:05,419
effective thing that you can do is to

1413
00:58:03,619 --> 00:58:08,089
get everybody on your team to understand

1414
00:58:05,419 --> 00:58:10,219
how their specific individual tasks that

1415
00:58:08,089 --> 00:58:11,359
they're working on are pushing whose

1416
00:58:10,219 --> 00:58:13,519
value for the business as a whole

1417
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:15,139
everybody wants to feel like what

1418
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:16,848
they're doing is important what they're

1419
00:58:15,139 --> 00:58:19,009
doing has value and what they're doing

1420
00:58:16,849 --> 00:58:20,989
is actually moving the needle they don't

1421
00:58:19,009 --> 00:58:22,879
want to work in a vacuum they don't want

1422
00:58:20,989 --> 00:58:25,579
to be disconnected from the business and

1423
00:58:22,879 --> 00:58:27,739
I think more often than not you'll find

1424
00:58:25,579 --> 00:58:31,179
that most people have a very keen sense

1425
00:58:27,739 --> 00:58:33,469
of what really matters for the business

1426
00:58:31,179 --> 00:58:35,869
to wrap this up I want to talk a bit

1427
00:58:33,469 --> 00:58:38,689
about what's it like to manage prima

1428
00:58:35,869 --> 00:58:43,329
donnas so the first thing is I know the

1429
00:58:38,689 --> 00:58:46,189
old meta type the eccentric very highly

1430
00:58:43,329 --> 00:58:48,049
sought after talent that really knows

1431
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:52,399
what it wants but he will not budge a

1432
00:58:48,049 --> 00:58:55,549
moment to get anything else so if you

1433
00:58:52,399 --> 00:58:57,319
can manage that person immense value he

1434
00:58:55,549 --> 00:58:59,989
can like he can build everything on his

1435
00:58:57,319 --> 00:59:02,119
own in a midnight on the other hand the

1436
00:58:59,989 --> 00:59:04,399
cost of managing that person might be

1437
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:06,289
too high it might hurt the entire team

1438
00:59:04,399 --> 00:59:10,848
when you have such a talent in your

1439
00:59:06,289 --> 00:59:14,569
midst so getting that balance is very

1440
00:59:10,849 --> 00:59:17,029
difficult on the other hand if you see

1441
00:59:14,569 --> 00:59:19,279
such raw talent in one of your juniors

1442
00:59:17,029 --> 00:59:20,919
this is something that I would hop on

1443
00:59:19,279 --> 00:59:23,809
with my Bo both of my hands because

1444
00:59:20,919 --> 00:59:26,299
someone jr. versus a senior is much

1445
00:59:23,809 --> 00:59:28,299
easier to educate it much easier to help

1446
00:59:26,299 --> 00:59:30,799
to get him out of his prima donna

1447
00:59:28,299 --> 00:59:32,869
position into something that's more team

1448
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:35,149
collaborative position but more than

1449
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:37,879
that when someone is a junior and has so

1450
00:59:35,149 --> 00:59:40,519
much talent you have time to work with

1451
00:59:37,879 --> 00:59:42,558
him to still get value from what he does

1452
00:59:40,519 --> 00:59:45,279
and help him to be a better person a

1453
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:45,279
better teammate

1454
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:57,020
get help your team are your best allies

1455
00:59:52,610 --> 01:00:00,170
the community is a great ally use them

1456
00:59:57,020 --> 01:00:03,080
ask them ask around don't keep those

1457
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:05,300
struggles to yourself you can learn a

1458
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:06,920
lot from other people you yourself can

1459
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:09,980
improve a lot by listening to other

1460
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:14,440
people and with that I want to thank you

1461
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:14,440
and open them the mic for questions

1462
01:00:20,619 --> 01:00:52,760
other any questions yes so they very

1463
01:00:51,319 --> 01:00:55,579
much depends of what you're trying to

1464
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:58,369
measure in regards to PR but one thing

1465
01:00:55,579 --> 01:01:00,710
that I can tell you that we've done

1466
01:00:58,369 --> 01:01:03,619
something like sentiment analysis before

1467
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:05,390
and after we gave the talks to see how

1468
01:01:03,619 --> 01:01:07,910
people reacted differently to the brand

1469
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:09,259
also we talked to the marketing people

1470
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:12,410
and told them that you're doing your own

1471
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:14,569
surveys look at those Peaks and see if

1472
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:16,460
we got a different perspective maybe got

1473
01:01:14,569 --> 01:01:17,930
a different set of data I'm not sure

1474
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:20,329
that's the right thing to measure as a

1475
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:22,129
metric for the success of your team but

1476
01:01:20,329 --> 01:01:24,049
it might be worthwhile to measure when

1477
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:28,609
you're working with their team how your

1478
01:01:24,049 --> 01:01:33,140
work influence is what they do other

1479
01:01:28,609 --> 01:01:37,190
questions okay thank you very much I'm

1480
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:38,450
sorry someone in the back I'm sorry one

1481
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:39,230
moment someone with a mic because I

1482
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:43,460
can't hear you

1483
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:45,319
I say there's still a question but thank

1484
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:47,720
you for phenomenal talk it's probably

1485
01:01:45,319 --> 01:01:49,970
one of the best talks I've seen on the

1486
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:52,279
leadership of security research over the

1487
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:54,700
last ten years so thank you thank you

1488
01:01:52,279 --> 01:01:54,700
very much
