1
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:09,379
all right well I was at radar recon this

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,570
weekend in Barcelona I was fortunate

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:14,000
enough to go there and they started an

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:16,698
hour and a half late which is better

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,090
than usual for them because radar recon

6
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:21,590
isn't really organized it just happens

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:25,880
so I think being about ten minutes late

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:29,020
where we're not doing too bad it's been

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,020
a bit of a year isn't it

10
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:34,460
my goodness oh my god this is yeah I see

11
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,999
that what's happened this year is just

12
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:39,739
proof we're in the worst timeline so we

13
00:00:37,999 --> 00:00:41,960
started planning last year for a Blade

14
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:44,059
Runner themed event because it's 2019

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,979
and we thought well you know obviously

16
00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:48,019
we were promised all these flying cars

17
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:49,850
and replicants and everything and the

18
00:00:48,019 --> 00:00:56,120
world turned out to be really boring in

19
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:57,620
the end nothing much happened and yes so

20
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:01,129
there's the dystopia we were promised in

21
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:03,739
the dystopia dystopia we have so in here

22
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:07,429
at least for the next couple of days we

23
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:09,259
have the dystopia we've been promised so

24
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:11,720
I'm going to start with slide with the

25
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:14,440
emergency number on it and emergency

26
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,700
contact details so quite a lot of our

27
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,009
attendees are from other countries if

28
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,150
you find yourself needing help if you

29
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:22,070
find yourself in a difficult situation

30
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,560
whether that's at the conference or

31
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:26,449
elsewhere and you're not sure what to do

32
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,480
you can call us on the emergency number

33
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:32,060
which will be manned during the daytime

34
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:34,430
and most of the evenings we have someone

35
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,650
on call - it's basically be available if

36
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:40,580
it's slightly less urgent you can email

37
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:44,030
help of 44 con-com you can act 44 con on

38
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:47,210
Twitter but don't DM us because the DMS

39
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:48,890
aren't monitored so you know in order of

40
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:50,929
preference we'd say emergency number

41
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:52,430
first if you've done something that you

42
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,530
know for example you've got a cut or

43
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:57,310
there's something like half a dead

44
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,310
person in your bathtub

45
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:07,340
so if anybody wants to take a picture

46
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:09,709
that now is the time if not okay all

47
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:15,650
right all right good to move on yeah all

48
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:17,810
right so 44 Khan is nine and I never

49
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,360
expected to say that when Adrian and I

50
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,910
started for we for comeback in 2011

51
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,470
I think the longest-running conference

52
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,660
in the UK the longest conference series

53
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,819
is a thing called DNS con in Blackpool

54
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,290
and then other than that there was a

55
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:32,000
thing called access all areas and the

56
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,069
nineties that got to three so I never

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,900
expected us to get to nine

58
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:41,268
to be honest frankly I expect it to be

59
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:42,380
dead by now yeah but but yeah you never

60
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:44,959
know the night is young

61
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:48,380
we've got some interesting talks on so

62
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,900
we've got the sheduled up on 44 con 2019

63
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:53,180
shed calm there's a link off the website

64
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,069
the main forum website if you want to

65
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,900
get to it when we make changes will

66
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:58,910
update shared will make sure that things

67
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,840
are updated so we have a couple of

68
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,900
changes that I'll tell you about later

69
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,510
on but this evening what we've got is we

70
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,570
have Daniel Romero Maria and Rivas

71
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:09,530
talking about hacking Enterprise

72
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,630
multifunction devices printers and

73
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:14,180
things like that Chris Wade is gonna do

74
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:17,780
what is gonna be a really knockout talk

75
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,549
about repurposing hardware and turning

76
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:23,600
innocent things into slightly less

77
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:25,880
innocent things and in the village hall

78
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,489
we have Kody Brosius from hacker 1 we

79
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:31,130
have Alex Chapman and we have a

80
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:32,959
screening of Blade Runner upstairs we've

81
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:35,709
got a workshop the Chrissy Morgan now

82
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,180
Chrissy has asked that the talk isn't

83
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:41,329
uploaded anywhere isn't published so

84
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:43,430
we're not recording it also to go and

85
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:45,680
attend the workshop you need a set of

86
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:48,260
equipment now she's had a list up on her

87
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,359
website I believe we may still have some

88
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,410
kits left at front desk so you'll be at

89
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:54,079
pick one up

90
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:56,750
she'll be on from 6:45 upstairs in the

91
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:58,310
Hyde Park workshop room and also this

92
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:02,840
year we have a mental health village

93
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:04,669
because our industry as a whole tends to

94
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,790
lend itself towards a large amount of

95
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:10,530
despair

96
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:11,730
and depression and you know so we've got

97
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,290
a mental health village we've got lots

98
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:15,629
of things for you to try lots of

99
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:17,039
self-care stuff we we flew in the mental

100
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:19,228
health hackers from the United States

101
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,570
and they have a whole load of kit for

102
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:23,880
you try everything from stress balls to

103
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:26,190
weighted blankets and stuff they're also

104
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,990
running some workshops and talks so do

105
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,850
check it out it's open this evening

106
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:32,870
that's upstairs it think it's a couple

107
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:35,580
of doors down from the workshop area and

108
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,470
then just for kind of stuff that's going

109
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,500
on tomorrow that that kind of stands out

110
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:42,240
that's new and a bit different

111
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:46,229
registration opens at 8:00 we also have

112
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:50,130
yoga in the morning I know of all the

113
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:52,409
things for us to do but we have yogurts

114
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:55,159
for the beginners if you if you have a

115
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:57,120
yoga mat bring it we have some yoga mats

116
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,389
if you're going to be up at 8 o'clock

117
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:04,169
and I don't extend that to people who

118
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:06,110
are still in the pub at 8 o'clock you

119
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:08,370
should probably go to bed by then but

120
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,470
yeah if you if you feel like doing yoga

121
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:12,419
in the village pub then it's home from 8

122
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:14,910
o'clock we have a Careers morning from

123
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:17,698
9:30 to 11 and what we're focusing on

124
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:19,380
because our attendees tend to be more

125
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,580
senior in level 2 than a lot of

126
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,949
community events that you see around the

127
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:26,580
country we're focusing more on

128
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:28,110
transitioning across careers we're also

129
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,539
supporting people who are new to the

130
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,919
industry but there's hope that we're

131
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,479
hopefully looking for people to be out

132
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,909
talk to people about going from maybe

133
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:37,740
blue to red shifting left doing some

134
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:42,030
other things there's gonna be a panel as

135
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:44,310
well we've got one change so far which

136
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:47,369
is Matthew Fowler's talk on Torian

137
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:48,659
Lightner on which we think we're going

138
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,280
to swap out with some oh sure but I

139
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:52,710
haven't had a chance to properly convert

140
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:56,010
confirm that with him so hopefully I'm

141
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:57,210
not dropping him in it too much I really

142
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:00,960
should have checked these slides before

143
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:03,719
I did this Jenna clocks at 4:15 and

144
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,260
again in the kind of what the 44 con

145
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:09,449
kind of view we have mocktails we have

146
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,800
lots of non-alcoholic options and the

147
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:13,590
fact is that none of us are getting any

148
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,510
younger and we really want to try and

149
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:18,690
make sure that as an event we're helping

150
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:19,510
people pace themselves is you can only

151
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,980
get rekt so

152
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:23,170
many times before it starts to creep up

153
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:25,540
on you food comes out about five o'clock

154
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:28,240
pizzas again and then the many hats club

155
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:31,030
meetup is here starting at 7:00 p.m. now

156
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,770
what you're gonna notice as you go

157
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:34,869
through the week you're gonna feel like

158
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:37,000
you're going slightly mad because things

159
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,440
keep appearing and disappearing the

160
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,910
walls are going to come up and down at

161
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,590
different points along the way so

162
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:43,720
sometimes this will be two tracks and

163
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:45,549
then on the Thursday night this part of

164
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,190
the room will actually be part of the

165
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:52,450
pub so extending it to fit more people

166
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:53,710
in and even Dow if you feel disoriented

167
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,030
and it's starting to get to you well the

168
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:59,260
mental health hackers village is

169
00:06:55,030 --> 00:07:01,479
upstairs that's not moving so one have a

170
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:04,719
look now I'm really really sorry because

171
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,190
I had hoped to go and do a new PCB with

172
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,390
a new design and a bunch of stuff for

173
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,969
the soldiering area and a bunch of

174
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:11,380
challenges and cool things

175
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,160
unfortunately my house was nearly

176
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,900
destroyed

177
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,980
and when I say nearly destroyed we have

178
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:20,560
one usable room in the house so I lost

179
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:23,350
my lab so I couldn't really do much so

180
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,690
we've done a special edition 44 coin

181
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:28,120
which dedicates the memory of Rooker how

182
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:30,640
it passed away this year you know they

183
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,380
say only the good die young but it's

184
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:35,260
pegged to the North Korean one now so

185
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,960
5000 best Korean Won is equivalent to

186
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:41,800
144 coin thanks to the work of Mister

187
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:43,630
McFlurry and the the bar bus is on its

188
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,480
way to North Korea Korea on a

189
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:48,880
humanitarian mission to extract / arrest

190
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:51,580
Dom McFlurry and bring him back for next

191
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,740
year the other thing about this is that

192
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,060
last year we have the gold coins and we

193
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,220
only gave a thing that gave something

194
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,900
out one or two out to people generally

195
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,400
we have tons of these things so the

196
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,289
sponsor is going to have them they can

197
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,940
give them to you you could as long as

198
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:06,340
you don't solder them you can go at the

199
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:10,000
bar and you can exchange them for drinks

200
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:11,859
soft drinks other stuff and if you do

201
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,930
solder them we've got different colored

202
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,480
LEDs so you can make it your own design

203
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:18,520
there is also a thing going on with the

204
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,780
serial port for you to try again if you

205
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:23,770
did it last year it's the same thing

206
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:26,590
just different content so hopefully next

207
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:28,419
year we've now got an office sorted so

208
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,039
I've now got some lab space I can go and

209
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,540
get you something cooler I have some

210
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,560
ideas they'll be really really good for

211
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:36,830
next year

212
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:38,479
we've also got lock-picking so the moon

213
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:42,050
on a stick lock-picking and cold brew

214
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:45,200
coffee emporium the two kind of go

215
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:47,599
hand-in-hand really they're they're

216
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,160
actually out in the main hall and you

217
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,080
can go and try your hand with some

218
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,839
lock-picking they also have some smart

219
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,400
card readers so you should have one of

220
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,010
these which is the world's most

221
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,170
ubiquitous smart card and also one of

222
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:01,640
the world's most insecure smart cards

223
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:04,430
these are used everywhere from

224
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,949
cafeterias to automate laundromats and

225
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:08,930
these are blank so you can program them

226
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:11,150
and the workshop that will be going on

227
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:13,040
in the village hall will introduce you

228
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,449
to hacking these smart cards so that

229
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,430
should you ever find yourself in a

230
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:18,740
situation where you're faced with having

231
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:23,260
to use a money system to load up credit

232
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,260
fear not my friends we've got your back

233
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:31,000
so let's talk about the 44 Con CTF it is

234
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:33,190
as you might suspect Bladerunner themed

235
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,020
it will start at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow

236
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:38,300
Cody from hacker was in charge so if you

237
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:40,250
want to take part the CTF head over to

238
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:43,130
the hacker one table from around 10 a.m.

239
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:45,230
tomorrow we have lots and lots of

240
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:48,080
smaller prizes mostly Bladerunner themed

241
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:51,080
and we have some very good prizes I get

242
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,090
Bladerunner themed so if you want to go

243
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,250
and take part don't feel like you you

244
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:57,800
have to be Buber elite or anything like

245
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:59,990
that you have to be super duper in any

246
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,520
particular field we've got different

247
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,750
types of challenges and there's

248
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,949
different things you can do and there's

249
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,880
plenty of prizes to be won

250
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:11,600
so thanks very much to hacker one for

251
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:16,550
putting together the CTF for us just a

252
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:18,860
polite reminder of our house rule so if

253
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:21,680
if we want this to be a space that

254
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,570
everybody can enjoy regardless of what

255
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,819
political views they have or regardless

256
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:27,410
of of what kind of general views they

257
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:29,990
have a life and other people as long as

258
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:30,680
they don't impinge upon other people and

259
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,510
that's fine

260
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,709
anything consensual that isn't illegal

261
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:38,090
is pretty much reasonable and

262
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:40,550
realistically if you see somebody giving

263
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:43,070
somebody unnecessary grief if somebody

264
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:44,760
looks like they're they're being treated

265
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:47,070
badly in any way

266
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,330
tell the person doing it to please stop

267
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,920
doing what they're doing and that it's

268
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:54,270
not looking good and try and do in non

269
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:56,610
confrontational way we can if we see

270
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:58,829
some acts of rather severe Turkishness

271
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,390
we will in the first instance talk to

272
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,910
the person will try and separate people

273
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:06,660
in rather extreme Turkishness situations

274
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:10,760
we will eject the Dix from the venue so

275
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,760
we ins law don't be a dick

276
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:16,020
I'd like to thank our sponsors so

277
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:19,319
particularly hacker one detective I F

278
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,850
Sakura BT for basically making this

279
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,360
event possible without them it wouldn't

280
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:27,360
happen also tenable NCC group Microsoft

281
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:30,420
safe passed me 2t security risk tree and

282
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,880
SPECT X who are silver sponsors some of

283
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:35,099
these guys are hiring and they're hiring

284
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,720
for various roles some of which might

285
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,010
not be things that you used to or you

286
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,020
might not have considered so it's worth

287
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:42,030
talking to them about whether on or

288
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:45,000
they're hiring when you get your your

289
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:47,189
sponsor passport stamped I'd also like

290
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,390
to thank our exhibitors and supporters

291
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:54,840
in particular Czech SEC and Google and

292
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:57,360
also wire security steel con am internet

293
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:59,520
for supporting us particularly with the

294
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,170
assistance program that was really quite

295
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,180
spectacular and thanks very much for

296
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:05,640
that I'd also like to thank integrity

297
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:08,819
which is fantastic business out of

298
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,980
Portugal who effectively sponsored our

299
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,750
8-bit arcade championship so have you

300
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,920
seen as that steel con or besides

301
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:16,710
Manchester you'll have seen as with

302
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,870
Commodore 64's and games to play we are

303
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:21,000
planning on scaling that up we're gonna

304
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,740
potentially get rid of one of the c64 s

305
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,900
and swap it out for something else so if

306
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,120
you have any ideas of what we should get

307
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:30,270
and I would say be reasonable but this

308
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,120
is 44 con so reason doesn't necessarily

309
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:35,040
apply just tweet as your suggestions at

310
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,550
44 con and we'll consider them /ignore

311
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,770
them I'd also like to thank our our

312
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:42,240
community sponsors the Issa i waas pin

313
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:44,880
crest thanks very much for coming guys

314
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,660
and thanks for all of your support over

315
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,910
the year now historically 44 con has

316
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:53,310
been a one year event we used to do 44

317
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:54,719
con cybersecurity some of you might not

318
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:56,010
know that in this year what we've been

319
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,150
doing is we've been scaling up our

320
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,140
training and we've been running these

321
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,930
local courts lee for

322
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:03,780
forty-four connect events and we have

323
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:04,709
another one in December so we have in

324
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,120
December

325
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:09,420
we're running training from the 2nd to

326
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,130
the 5th which completely coincidentally
