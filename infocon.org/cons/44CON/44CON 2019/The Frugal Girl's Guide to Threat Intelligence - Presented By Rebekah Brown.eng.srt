1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,730
all right good afternoon everyone thank

2
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:07,500
you for coming to my presentation this

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:12,269
is the frugal Girls Guide to threat

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:16,049
intelligence I am Rebecca Brown PDX Beck

5
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:18,000
on the Twitter's PDX is the airport code

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,830
for Portland Oregon for those of you who

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,650
don't know it's the hipster capital of

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,880
the world home to man buns and bicycles

9
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:30,359
and all things before they were cool

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:31,859
including me I am currently the threat

11
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,610
intelligence lead at rapid7

12
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:37,500
I'm responsible for aggregating and

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,180
managing and implementing threat

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,340
intelligence across our product line as

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,019
well as with all of our services it's a

16
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,610
lot of fun I have a lot of cool cool

17
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,620
teams I get to work with our Metasploit

18
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,539
team is amazing and they help me come up

19
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,649
with some really really cool ways to

20
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,949
generate and apply it threat

21
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,210
intelligence before that I was a gunnery

22
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:57,030
sergeant in the United States Marine

23
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,940
Corps I was a Chinese crypto linguist

24
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,829
and a Network warfare analyst my last

25
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,750
position before I left active duty was

26
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:07,200
the operations chief of the Marine Corps

27
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:09,119
cyber unit which is a lot of fun and

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,680
then I left and I went to go do some

29
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,780
work with state and local governments

30
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,970
and I don't know how your systems are

31
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,000
set up here but our state and local

32
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:21,600
governments they they are not super

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,070
well-funded now they look like basic

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,509
things but and then you talk about

35
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,158
cybersecurity and trying through threat

36
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:28,320
intelligence on top of that and they're

37
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,670
like yeah we've got a guy part-time who

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,820
comes to make sure our computers work

39
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:36,000
like is that what you're talking about

40
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:37,798
so I learned there that I had to do had

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,210
to take some kind of novel approaches to

42
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,110
threat intelligence and implementing

43
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:45,720
that and oh yes I am a two-time kickball

44
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,920
champion I was told maybe I should take

45
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,750
this out because apparently kickball

46
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,399
isn't super cool here but it actually

47
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:55,430
isn't a super cool in the US either so I

48
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:59,930
just left it in anyway so why be frugal

49
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:02,399
threat intelligence is a very expensive

50
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:04,170
industry right now when you talk about

51
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,700
threat fees and you talk about your

52
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,320
threat platforms that you need to use

53
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,179
the threat feeds and then the people you

54
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,190
need to interpret the results that were

55
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,480
generated by the threat feeds through

56
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,930
your threat platforms and

57
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,640
start to pile on very very quickly so

58
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,959
there's a couple different reasons that

59
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,730
you might need to be fruitful the first

60
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,799
kind of the example when I work with

61
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,959
state and local governments is necessity

62
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:27,450
you don't have money you don't have a

63
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,950
budget but you have a job to do

64
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,738
and people still expect that you're

65
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,988
gonna be doing things so clearly being

66
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:35,700
frugal is really your only choice well

67
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:36,989
that are not getting out of bed in the

68
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,780
morning but that did not make for a very

69
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:41,700
good talk the second option is

70
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,250
sustainability maybe you do have a

71
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:47,910
budget maybe you have some resources

72
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:49,290
some money some people but what turns

73
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,459
out happening a lot of times is that

74
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,560
we're kind of the victims of our own

75
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:55,440
success when you start doing something

76
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,170
well people expect more of you they

77
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,299
expect you to you know tack on more more

78
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,858
problems and provide more of what you

79
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:04,079
are doing and your budget might

80
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:06,239
necessarily might not necessarily scale

81
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:09,480
with that so in order to keep doing the

82
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,519
kinds of things that are providing value

83
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,220
to your organization you might need to

84
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,859
be frugal for that sense and then the

85
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,599
last one is doing things correctly so a

86
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:20,730
lot of times people think that the idea

87
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:23,069
for this talk came solely from my

88
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,138
experience working with companies or

89
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:27,328
organizations with no budget but

90
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:30,599
honestly it came from the opposite

91
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:33,810
situation one company I worked with had

92
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:35,940
a crazy budget one of those anything you

93
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,079
could think of you could buy you know

94
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,150
you don't even really have to have a

95
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:40,560
justification just be like it looks cool

96
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,780
and I want it and they would buy it for

97
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,480
you and that is what they did about a

98
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:48,239
month before I started spending spree

99
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,798
thought all the feeds millions of

100
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,840
indicators it's gonna be great we're

101
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,239
gonna do all this threat Intel and then

102
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,129
it fell on me having chosen none of

103
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,260
those tools to show the return on

104
00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:00,929
investment for all of this this huge

105
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:03,358
huge amount of money they'd spent and it

106
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,370
was really really hard to do because

107
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:08,459
they did not go about purchasing all of

108
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:11,730
these things in a good or pragmatic way

109
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:14,129
even to solve problems it was just hey

110
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:17,339
this looks cool let's buy it and then

111
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:19,228
now do something cool with it and that's

112
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:21,929
the approach that I see a lot with

113
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:24,940
threat intelligence you know the step

114
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:27,340
one by intelligence step two

115
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:30,130
do some things and then three security

116
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,929
and people wonder why that actually

117
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:37,000
doesn't work and why they aren't seeing

118
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:38,500
the results they want and that is

119
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,760
because a lot of times when you go into

120
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,440
it that approach you don't even know

121
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,090
what you're doing you don't quite know

122
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,860
what threat intelligence is except that

123
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,270
it sounds cool and you want to do it it

124
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,370
has the word intelligence in it it's

125
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,900
like the emperor's new clothes basically

126
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,400
you think you should do it so you know

127
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,830
you end up parading down the road with

128
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,570
your millions of threat feeds saying

129
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:58,510
look how great I am when really you're

130
00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:00,490
not providing any value so since the

131
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:02,620
purpose of this talk is how to do what

132
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,960
you can with what you have whether you

133
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,310
have a lot or a little before you can do

134
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,299
that you have to understand what it is

135
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:11,980
you're actually trying to do so for this

136
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,600
talk I'm going to talk about the three

137
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:16,510
different areas that I see people

138
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,700
applying threat intelligence a lot and

139
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:20,710
again I am a believer that threat

140
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,900
intelligence is not a standalone

141
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:25,510
function it's not just like something

142
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,989
you do it is an enabler for all the

143
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:30,610
other aspects of your security program

144
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:32,590
and so three of the primary ones that

145
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,330
we're going to talk about our sock the

146
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,849
security operations center or the kind

147
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:39,550
of the alerting use case the Incident

148
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:41,790
Response support use case and then the

149
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:44,230
strategic support case where you're

150
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,610
informing executives not just your

151
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,020
security executives but also the

152
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,040
business executives they want to

153
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:52,180
understand the threats that they're

154
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,530
facing as well and so for all these

155
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,660
three different areas and there's many

156
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:57,520
more you know I've seen people use it

157
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,020
with vulnerability management I've seen

158
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,430
them use it with like strategic business

159
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:04,990
planning but there are some some places

160
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,940
where it overlaps the tools and the

161
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,140
processes that you will use overlap and

162
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,270
there are some places where they're

163
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:13,120
completely different for example if

164
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:15,010
you're using a threat feed for your sock

165
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,810
and you're alerting please please do not

166
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:18,400
use that to you know inform your

167
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:22,240
executives about the threats facing you

168
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,469
you will lose them very quickly so the

169
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,280
first thing we're going to talk about is

170
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:29,500
alerting for the sock and what this

171
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,989
looks like is alerting on known threats

172
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,669
and I know a lot of people don't like

173
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,110
talking about that because threat

174
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:36,460
intelligence was supposed to get us out

175
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:38,200
of the age of you know the signature

176
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:41,739
based detection but that's really what

177
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:45,760
it is we know something's bad and we're

178
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:47,020
going to tell you if we see that but

179
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,789
what we want to do differently is we

180
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:52,060
want to provide context on those alerts

181
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:53,740
we want to help people understand the

182
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,120
threat behind that alert and what it

183
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,860
might mean and what they might need to

184
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:01,120
do and we want to enable quick

185
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:03,550
decision-making if you're not making it

186
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,140
easier for the sock to understand and

187
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,870
act on alerts then you're not doing your

188
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:09,250
job kind of one of my key tenants for

189
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,140
whether or not this is successful is

190
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:14,110
that if the sock hates you you're doing

191
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:16,570
something wrong some of the resources

192
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,100
some of the the frugal or the free or

193
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:20,770
very very cheap resources you can use

194
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,960
for this are threat lists threat

195
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:25,060
exchanges there's a lot of open source

196
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,570
tools and then there are community

197
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:30,730
versions of tools which are turns out is

198
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:32,349
happening a lot started out as open

199
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:35,410
source tools and then got acquired by

200
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:37,180
someone and now they have a commercial

201
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,740
version you can buy but there's also

202
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:45,130
still a free community version that you

203
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:48,490
can have access to so a quick note on

204
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:51,100
threat lists and exchanges they're not

205
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:53,530
all created equal some are very good

206
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,670
some are bad this is kind of themed as

207
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:56,049
we talk about everything in threat

208
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,970
intelligence there are good things and

209
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,350
there are not-so-good things

210
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:02,170
the handling and the maintenance of

211
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:03,790
these lists vary greatly especially when

212
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:05,530
we're talking open source lists this is

213
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,640
usually somebody's pet project or

214
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:09,909
something they're doing because they're

215
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:12,130
they are passionate about security or

216
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:14,170
something they're interested in and and

217
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:16,270
that their time that they can devote to

218
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:18,640
those things changes so you will see

219
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:20,229
some with some threat feeds where the

220
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,210
every single day they're on it every

221
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:24,760
hour updating it and then somewhere it's

222
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:26,440
been a good month so it's always

223
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,150
important to kind of re-evaluate and see

224
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,580
what you're using

225
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:32,890
you need to have context again if it's a

226
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:34,000
list of IP addresses and you have no

227
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,979
idea where it came from

228
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,809
just just leet let it leave it alone

229
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:40,150
those are that's not not what you're

230
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:42,760
looking for and they can be very useful

231
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:46,390
if implemented correctly so I took this

232
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:50,250
yesterday so firehole is actually one of

233
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:52,390
the resources I liked the most for

234
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,760
evaluating threat feeds and seeing what

235
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:58,330
would be good but right here this is an

236
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,710
example of the the aggregate of all of

237
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,540
these different lists these hundreds of

238
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:03,430
different threat lists that they keep an

239
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:06,240
eye on and they kind of aggregate and

240
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:10,660
monitor and as of yesterday there were

241
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,310
667 million IP addresses can you imagine

242
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,290
if you took that entire list and plugged

243
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:15,880
it into your sim that would be one of

244
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:17,260
the situations where your sock would

245
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,689
hate you I feel like they would be

246
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:22,569
hunting you down at that point so it's

247
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:24,460
important to be aware of what's out

248
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:31,060
there and figure out how to best handle

249
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:32,650
it so a good way to evaluate threat

250
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,180
feeds and again this is from fire holes

251
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:36,220
so they have if you ever go to the

252
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,719
website and I have my last step my last

253
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,690
couple slides have all these resources

254
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,160
on them but they provide a lot of

255
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:44,380
information in contextual information

256
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,000
around the feeds themselves which is

257
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,680
really really useful with figuring out

258
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,020
what you're gonna use so here for

259
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,650
example average update frequency one

260
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:54,910
hour in one minute that's pretty solid

261
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:56,470
the last time it was updated by its

262
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,819
maintainer z' again that's how you go

263
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,860
and check and make sure that this is a

264
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:02,200
feed that is actually someone's paying

265
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,640
attention to it's not two weeks old or a

266
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,320
month old because especially when we

267
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,000
talk about things like IPS and network

268
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,339
based indicators they're not very

269
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,080
they're not good for very long if it's a

270
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:13,720
month old list it's probably not gonna

271
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:16,750
do you a lot of good and then this graph

272
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,310
here shows how many the number of unique

273
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,260
IP addresses they have on their list at

274
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:21,369
any given time and I really like this

275
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,890
one because if you remember the first

276
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,690
one like that's just flat it's there's a

277
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:27,400
little little increase there right

278
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,780
around like September 9th but again

279
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,199
we're talking six hundred sixty seven

280
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:35,290
million indicators so it's hard to see

281
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,970
but here clearly sometimes there are

282
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,349
more IP sometimes there are less that

283
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,209
shows that they're actually expiring

284
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:42,100
them when they do their updates every

285
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:44,739
hour they're not just adding more it's

286
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,270
not just accumulating they're actually

287
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,589
expiring ones that are no longer valid

288
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:51,370
and putting in the new ones so right

289
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:54,940
here we have 157 IP addresses that's a

290
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:58,900
much more consumable volume of

291
00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:00,700
indicators but it gets better so for

292
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,819
this particular that that last graph was

293
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,949
the open block list one day list

294
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:09,179
and they have they have like seven days

295
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:10,738
30 days you know all eternity lists so

296
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:12,629
you can actually go through and refine

297
00:11:10,739 --> 00:11:14,879
what you're gonna be pulling from based

298
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:16,139
on what you need and so here they

299
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,239
actually provide where this information

300
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:19,350
comes from which is a critical thing

301
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:21,689
that I think most people don't think

302
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:23,729
about with threat feeds that data comes

303
00:11:21,689 --> 00:11:26,248
from somewhere a lot of times it's

304
00:11:23,729 --> 00:11:28,470
coming either from reports like this one

305
00:11:26,249 --> 00:11:31,679
down here with the Apache block list its

306
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,699
reports IP addresses report within the

307
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:36,539
last 48 hours

308
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:38,998
attacking Apache services so that's

309
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:40,379
great and if and if you have those types

310
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:42,209
of systems that you're monitoring this

311
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:44,970
would be a great list to use if you

312
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:46,469
don't don't use this why would you but

313
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,639
again it's it's important to know where

314
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,619
the data came from

315
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:51,809
I love how specific they are with the

316
00:11:49,619 --> 00:11:53,489
open block list as well they tell you

317
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:54,569
what specific ports um they're

318
00:11:53,489 --> 00:11:56,489
monitoring for that it's that it's a

319
00:11:54,569 --> 00:11:57,660
honeypot and they're looking for brute

320
00:11:56,489 --> 00:11:59,759
force attacks they're looking for

321
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,858
attacks against specific applications

322
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:04,799
when you have that type of information

323
00:12:01,859 --> 00:12:07,739
it is much easier to understand how that

324
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:08,970
fits into your overall security posture

325
00:12:07,739 --> 00:12:13,169
and whether you need to be using this

326
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:15,299
list or whether you don't and again it

327
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:17,970
also shows overlaps so a lot of feeds

328
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:19,739
pull from other feeds so there's a lot

329
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:22,649
of cases where if it's a feed that's

330
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:24,419
actually been ingested by another feed

331
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:26,249
that you use you don't need both or

332
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:27,839
maybe you don't want the aggregated feed

333
00:12:26,249 --> 00:12:29,879
maybe you want to have that ability to

334
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,679
say I only want this small portion but

335
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:33,059
looking at that overlap you start to

336
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:34,709
understand a little bit more about just

337
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:36,600
the nature of threat fees in general I

338
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:38,699
also think it's hilarious I still

339
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,079
haven't figured out how it did this but

340
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:42,329
apparently that one has like over a

341
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,478
hundred percent of the IPS from someone

342
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:49,349
else I guess with you know free stuff

343
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:51,149
you get what you pay for so there's a

344
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:53,220
lot of feeds out there there's hundreds

345
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:54,600
and hundreds of fees and it can be very

346
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,339
difficult to figure out which ones you

347
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,289
should be using you probably don't want

348
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:00,529
just one you probably don't want them

349
00:12:58,289 --> 00:13:02,729
all it's but you'd want a good mixture

350
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:05,850
and so one of the approaches I like to

351
00:13:02,729 --> 00:13:08,069
take is making a collection plan which

352
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:09,299
is sitting there and using the you know

353
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:12,929
best through intelligence tool out there

354
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:15,779
excel and saying okay what do I need and

355
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:16,350
so for this example I kind of said okay

356
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:17,820
these

357
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,830
Fields I want these the types of data

358
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,270
that I want you could be more specific

359
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,800
you could say okay these are all the

360
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:24,660
systems we have on my network I want to

361
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,370
make sure I have threat lists that cover

362
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,140
threats against all those systems and

363
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:29,550
then you just start going through all of

364
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,680
your open source threat feeds and you

365
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:33,270
you plot out where they fit okay this is

366
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,130
where this one fits in this is where

367
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:38,160
this one fits in you might start to see

368
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:40,380
well hey I have you know 67 different

369
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,660
fees that are targeting my Apache system

370
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:44,400
but I have nothing that's protecting my

371
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,530
windows systems so maybe I need to look

372
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,540
for something else or same thing maybe

373
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:51,480
there is a fee that you cannot find an

374
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,110
open source feed at all that fits your

375
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,360
needs

376
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:57,390
that's one at the bottom here is where I

377
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,400
started looking into commercial or some

378
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:01,260
of those more community tools sometimes

379
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,850
you will need to go outside and you

380
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,640
won't always be able to use the open

381
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:06,960
source or the free tools but if you

382
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,699
actually if you look at it like this

383
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,960
then you will you'll get the right tools

384
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:15,480
and you'll be able to invest money in

385
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:16,860
the right places there's a couple other

386
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,250
really cool tools out there that can

387
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:22,410
help you understand whether or not your

388
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:24,840
your the feeds you've chosen are good

389
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:27,150
for you there's two tool these next two

390
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:30,000
tools were built by the ML Set project

391
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:32,240
so Alex Pinto and Kyle Maxwell this is

392
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,190
the threat intelligence quotient test

393
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:38,910
and it is a bunch of really cool data

394
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:40,230
science it uses our which kind of threw

395
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,939
me off I was a little afraid to use it

396
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:43,890
at first I just kept emailing Alex and

397
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,740
saying hey run this data for me and he

398
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:47,850
finally told me how to use our it's

399
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,640
really awesome you should probably look

400
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:52,410
into it but you can wear it against your

401
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,210
own data sources and it checks for

402
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:58,079
things like overlap it checks for things

403
00:14:54,210 --> 00:15:00,480
like a novelty of indicators and it can

404
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,760
be useful for again determining whether

405
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:08,520
or not you actually have the right

406
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:10,200
sources that you're using and the next

407
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,290
tool I'll talk about combine helps deal

408
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:15,300
with this problem the standards problem

409
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:18,750
how many people here have heard of

410
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:22,170
sticks how many here think sticks is

411
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:23,910
awesome yeah there's a couple yeah it's

412
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:25,740
not terrible I'm actually I like it a

413
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:27,600
lot more with this latest update where

414
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:29,439
it's no longer in XML it's now in JSON

415
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,599
so that makes me very happy

416
00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:35,199
and then we have cybox which is a

417
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:37,569
component of sticks we have open IOC we

418
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,699
have all these different standards that

419
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:41,228
again were meant to solve this problem

420
00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:43,419
of competing standards but we just end

421
00:15:41,229 --> 00:15:44,559
up with lots and lots of standards so

422
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:48,249
another tool they develop is called

423
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:49,569
combine which takes all your different

424
00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:50,979
data and all its different formats and

425
00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:52,569
it kind of reads through and parses it

426
00:15:50,979 --> 00:15:54,309
and does some data field mapping and it

427
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:56,259
puts it out in a standard format that

428
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:57,939
you can use there's a lot of commercial

429
00:15:56,259 --> 00:16:00,419
tools that will say they do this as well

430
00:15:57,939 --> 00:16:02,769
but this is you know it's on github

431
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:05,739
obviously it takes some time you have to

432
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:09,069
have some some Python I think Python

433
00:16:05,739 --> 00:16:10,239
skills to use it but it is a really good

434
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:14,199
alternative to some of these really

435
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:16,299
pricey data feed ingestion services that

436
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:18,368
are out there it does some enrichment

437
00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:21,239
from Macs mine and Farsight DNS database

438
00:16:18,369 --> 00:16:23,439
you have to have accounts but I believe

439
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:25,569
last time I checked they did still have

440
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:27,129
community accounts like I said things

441
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:29,998
things changed rather quickly in this

442
00:16:27,129 --> 00:16:32,199
world I mean it integrates with crits

443
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:34,749
which we're going to talk about next

444
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:37,389
so threat intelligence platforms are I

445
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:39,249
think the most recent really really

446
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:42,129
expensive tool you can buy for threat

447
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:43,929
intelligence and they were came about

448
00:16:42,129 --> 00:16:45,159
because people realized oh my gosh what

449
00:16:43,929 --> 00:16:46,869
am I gonna do with my three million

450
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:49,389
indicators that I just spent two million

451
00:16:46,869 --> 00:16:51,519
dollars on I can't just throw right into

452
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:53,859
my sin that's craziness what should I do

453
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,689
we need an intermediary platform to

454
00:16:53,859 --> 00:16:57,999
store all of these and the threat

455
00:16:55,689 --> 00:16:59,498
intelligence platform was born the

456
00:16:57,999 --> 00:17:02,619
terrible acronym I wish they'd come up

457
00:16:59,499 --> 00:17:04,659
with a different term but so chris is an

458
00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:06,339
open source solution for that and it

459
00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:09,970
started out as a malware analysis

460
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:12,698
platform and it was because people who

461
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:14,409
doing a lot of responding a lot of

462
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:16,029
incidents doing a lot of analysis kind

463
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:17,740
of just stored the outputs of their data

464
00:17:16,029 --> 00:17:19,480
all over the place and then anytime they

465
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:21,819
wanted to kind of cross-reference or

466
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,039
find out oh hey I think I saw this

467
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:25,329
before a couple weeks ago where was it

468
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:27,519
you know they're searching through their

469
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:29,740
email and their desktop and do they put

470
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:32,139
it in a word file so crits became a

471
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:33,820
place to store all that and then they

472
00:17:32,139 --> 00:17:35,139
gradually added indicators of

473
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,750
compromised and some of the network

474
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:41,080
based stuff and so you can use it to

475
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:43,059
store in rich and discover threats it is

476
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:47,860
has anybody here's used or stood up

477
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:50,110
crits it's it's not a super fun process

478
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:51,519
it's getting better again it's one of

479
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,408
those trade-offs when you're using open

480
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:56,559
source tools is you do actually have to

481
00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:58,720
put in the work and have some people who

482
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,850
have the skills to to stand it up and to

483
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,450
maintain it but it is actually a really

484
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:03,449
useful tool

485
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:13,149
so my frugal tips for sock alerting it's

486
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:15,519
an investment even if it's free and I

487
00:18:13,149 --> 00:18:17,320
know we have free as in beer I like to

488
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:20,320
refer to all my open source projects as

489
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,700
free as in puppies meaning sure it might

490
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,249
be free now but you are now responsible

491
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,480
for caring and feeding and cleaning up

492
00:18:24,249 --> 00:18:27,429
after that thing for the rest of its

493
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,859
life so just go into it with that

494
00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:31,059
mindset and you won't be surprised when

495
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:33,460
you realize that you have to you know

496
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:36,309
stay up till 2:00 a.m. on a Saturday

497
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,960
morning updating your servers it's

498
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:40,350
totally worth it though I know that

499
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:43,840
sounds terrible but it's worth it

500
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:45,998
one of the big issues is that especially

501
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,220
executives and a lot of ceases like to

502
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:50,499
say oh but I won't have that zero day

503
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,210
information ahead of everybody else and

504
00:18:50,499 --> 00:18:54,970
I say yeah that's that's kind of the

505
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:58,269
point of 0 days like it's you don't know

506
00:18:54,970 --> 00:19:00,190
about it before it happens so when you

507
00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:01,539
use open source information there's that

508
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:03,850
feeling that you're missing out on the

509
00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:06,009
good stuff but a lot of the commercial

510
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:08,738
thread feeds have a lot of the same data

511
00:19:06,009 --> 00:19:11,859
pull from the same sources as the open

512
00:19:08,739 --> 00:19:14,320
source threat feeds and honestly do you

513
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:16,600
really need to know about it you know

514
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,489
the split second it happens are you that

515
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,080
good at patching are you that fast and

516
00:19:18,489 --> 00:19:22,179
that able to respond to threats that if

517
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,549
you know about it ten minutes after you

518
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:25,929
know the the commercial vendor puts it

519
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:28,418
out that you're really at that much of a

520
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:30,940
disadvantage I think in all but a few

521
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:32,919
cases it really isn't that big of a deal

522
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,119
that the information is public when

523
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:36,940
you're using it you're still able to use

524
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:38,769
it still able to respond you have many

525
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:42,009
options so find out what works best for

526
00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:44,859
you this is the best part about using

527
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:47,109
free tools if it doesn't work who cares

528
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:48,639
find a new one you're not locked into a

529
00:19:47,109 --> 00:19:49,779
two-year contract that you're gonna have

530
00:19:48,639 --> 00:19:51,860
to go back to your board of directors

531
00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:52,880
and show them how how your

532
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,549
using it and how it's helping your

533
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,490
company keep track of what's working and

534
00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:59,840
what isn't don't let you know don't make

535
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,280
somebody else reinvent the wheel don't

536
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,659
make them go through the same pain you

537
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,010
had when you step through your

538
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,840
collection plan and figured out what

539
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:08,000
fees you should be using make sure you

540
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,459
document it all in a place where you can

541
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,380
refer to it in the future as you're

542
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:14,150
helping other people as well and again

543
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:25,730
if the sock hates you you're doing

544
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:28,190
something wrong so incident response

545
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:29,630
support is the next area that I see a

546
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:31,850
lot of people using threat intelligence

547
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:34,130
and again this is another area where

548
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:37,580
they have a lot of commercial tools that

549
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:39,200
are very very expensive I'm talking like

550
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:41,020
oh gosh she can't do conversion to

551
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:45,110
pounds in my head right now

552
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:47,240
okay it's like a hundred thousand pounds

553
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:49,790
for like two licenses the eye

554
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,549
it's like hundred fifty K yeah I think I

555
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:54,350
did that well ish just for some of these

556
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:57,049
tools that are basically pulling open

557
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:58,490
source information so there's a lot of

558
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:00,530
ways you can either do that yourself if

559
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,580
you don't have that money to spare or

560
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:03,950
again if you just want to validate

561
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:05,449
whether using open source information in

562
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,559
this use case is something you're

563
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:10,040
actually going to do and is going to

564
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,840
benefit your organization so I work with

565
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:15,230
our Incident Response Team a lot and the

566
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,899
primary tasks I do are validating their

567
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:19,970
IO sees when they are you know going

568
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:22,160
through logs and their finding whether

569
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:24,679
network based or host based artifacts

570
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,480
they send in my way and I go through and

571
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:28,700
say okay here's what I think this is

572
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,160
here's what it means identify additional

573
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,140
things okay if this is related to this

574
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,549
malware family here's some other things

575
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:37,850
you might expect to find and provide

576
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:41,270
that back to them and then the key the

577
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:42,860
key difference though is the incident

578
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,150
responders they want to identify and

579
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,620
contain they want to eradicate the

580
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:48,080
threat they just you know they want to

581
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:50,299
get rid of it but threat intelligence

582
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,799
can bring in an aspect where you're kind

583
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:54,080
of understanding what were the attackers

584
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:55,700
after was this a targeted attack was a

585
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,159
casual did you just happen to have a

586
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:00,169
horribly vulnerable web server and 15

587
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,900
different actors you know hacked you at

588
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:03,450
the same time providing information on

589
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,580
those goals

590
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:08,130
motivations of the attacks is something

591
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:09,899
that can help increase your security

592
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:11,639
posture in the future and it's also

593
00:22:09,899 --> 00:22:13,799
something that the executives really

594
00:22:11,639 --> 00:22:15,510
want to know about they want to

595
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:18,710
understand why this happened

596
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:21,870
why me what did we do what did they want

597
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:23,159
and you can actually through doing a lot

598
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:25,590
of this open-source research you can

599
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:27,149
find out a lot of stuff about that again

600
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:29,428
some of our resources are open source

601
00:22:27,149 --> 00:22:33,809
intelligence community tools and then

602
00:22:29,429 --> 00:22:36,179
threat reports and blogs the first thing

603
00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:37,918
I do when they send me an IP address is

604
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:40,440
I check to make sure it's not a tor exit

605
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,000
node because there's a lot of you canyou

606
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,980
can spend a lot of time digging into an

607
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,450
IP address and trying to figure out okay

608
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,370
I know who this is most the Whois

609
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:48,929
information and okay where has this been

610
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:53,209
seen you can spend hours and hours

611
00:22:48,929 --> 00:22:56,010
spinning up on this when it was you know

612
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:58,710
knowing that something was a tor relay

613
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:59,970
or Tor eggs and node is a good good TTP

614
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,289
and it's a good thing to identify for

615
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:03,000
the attacker but it's really one of

616
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:05,129
those okay let's stop looking into this

617
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,690
IP let's not waste my time we're being

618
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:09,980
frugal not just with money but with our

619
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:14,610
time with our resources so exonerate

620
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:16,139
exonerate tor is the tool I use and you

621
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:18,719
have to know the IP address and you also

622
00:23:16,139 --> 00:23:20,668
need to know the date so just like the

623
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,860
sock doesn't like when we hand them big

624
00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:24,570
old list of IP addresses you should not

625
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,309
like when your IR team just hands you a

626
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:28,289
big list of IP addresses and said tell

627
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:29,668
me about these you need to understand a

628
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:31,500
little bit more about them as well at

629
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:34,590
the very least what date is this

630
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,090
yesterday is this three years ago that's

631
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:38,389
going to help you figure out a lot more

632
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:40,500
about what's going on with it

633
00:23:38,389 --> 00:23:44,428
another tool I like this was one of

634
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:46,230
those community tools that was acquired

635
00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:48,720
passed the total was acquired by risk IQ

636
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:51,929
they still have a community version it

637
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,809
has lesser functionality than the paid

638
00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:58,529
version I think they have some some of

639
00:23:54,809 --> 00:24:00,870
they're like commercial use terms and

640
00:23:58,529 --> 00:24:02,190
user License Agreement type things so

641
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,539
look into it and make sure you're not

642
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:06,269
using it in a way they don't intend you

643
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:07,980
to but it is a really good resource so

644
00:24:06,269 --> 00:24:10,320
you cannot you know search for a domain

645
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:12,990
or for an IP and it will provide you

646
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,310
information first time seen last time it

647
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:17,190
was seen where they're pulling there

648
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:18,120
from which again is and I I love when

649
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,440
people tell you where they get their

650
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,610
data from because then I know how to

651
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:25,110
handle it especially when you're doing

652
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:26,729
open source and then tags so these are

653
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:28,949
things that have been associated with

654
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:33,630
this IP address so here we're seeing

655
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:35,550
again it targets Apache and this is it

656
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:37,530
so it's a associated with brute force

657
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:39,540
login attempts so that's something you'd

658
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:41,490
go back to your IR people and say hey

659
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:43,139
for this IP address this is actually

660
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:44,730
activity it's seen before does that line

661
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:47,870
up with what you're seeing you need to

662
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:50,160
check other resources things like that

663
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:52,709
no talk is complete without me

664
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,420
mentioning multi go I could do a whole

665
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:57,150
entire talk on that I feel like somebody

666
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:59,970
is at this conference already so I won't

667
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:01,590
beat a dead horse but multigo has passed

668
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:03,480
the total transforms that our community

669
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:05,879
transforms so you again have to have a

670
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,130
community account with the key but it's

671
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,300
not paid and here you can pull the same

672
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:11,580
information all the registration

673
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:13,590
information and you can also pull the

674
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,060
the tagging information so it's just

675
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:17,070
another way to access that information

676
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:18,270
and I like doing it through multi go

677
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:20,129
because then I can pivot to other

678
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:22,110
resources without having to go login to

679
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:23,880
another platform some of the other

680
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:25,709
things we're gonna talk about a threat

681
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:30,720
crowd threaten minor they all have multi

682
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:33,600
go transforms as well back in passive

683
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,830
total they have a heatmap functionality

684
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,899
and again this is all the community

685
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:40,740
version so it can provide you some some

686
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:42,750
pretty cool pretty cool information for

687
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:45,300
example this IP address which is the 72

688
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,590
IP address from before we can see that

689
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,659
it used to have a lot of domains

690
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:51,090
associated with it and then sometime in

691
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:53,310
August something changed you can see now

692
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:55,050
is only got one or two so that can be

693
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:56,850
something really interesting to look

694
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:59,100
into and to be aware of from a threat

695
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:00,990
intelligence perspective and again it

696
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:03,419
speaks to why it's important that you

697
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:05,940
have more contextual information like

698
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:07,590
the date when this attack was was it way

699
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,330
back then when it was you know new

700
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:10,709
domains popping up every time or was it

701
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:13,889
a more recent attack when things are

702
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:17,130
pretty you know it's narrowed down to

703
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:18,900
one or two in addition it pulls from

704
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:21,030
places like virustotal and emerging

705
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,210
threats now on but proof point to

706
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:23,860
provide

707
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:26,590
she's and malware samples that are

708
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:28,389
associated with that IP address as well

709
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:30,340
so that's again another place where you

710
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:32,650
can pivot and if you were to look at

711
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:36,040
that first virus total hit you would see

712
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:37,360
that it has a lot of different names we

713
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:40,750
can't get our act together to name

714
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:43,600
things appropriately but that that hide

715
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:45,070
link is kind of a commonality and a lot

716
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,270
of them so that might be another place

717
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:49,300
where you can pivot and start to look

718
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:51,250
for stuff I have a my malware analyst I

719
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,520
work with he hates any time I'd call

720
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:56,560
something a generic generic malware

721
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:58,810
because he he tears that stuff apart

722
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,950
he's like that is not generic it is you

723
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:01,960
know every malware is a special

724
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:04,840
snowflake and I have to say no it's okay

725
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,760
it's not me it's those guys I get it

726
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,100
but we can still get some information

727
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:11,830
just from the names that these different

728
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:13,300
antivirus vendors are providing and so

729
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:17,439
from here we can see that it is a

730
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:18,760
JavaScript that is running you know

731
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,780
clicking hidden links in the background

732
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:22,300
and we have a little more information

733
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:23,410
about what this threat might be and

734
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,550
again this is all stuff you should

735
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:27,210
provide back to your Incident Response

736
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:30,010
Team what was the nature of the threat

737
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:32,410
where else has it been seen one has it

738
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:33,700
been seen and then what does it target

739
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:37,170
because that will help them narrow the

740
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,170
scope of where they need to look next

741
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:43,270
some other resources for investigating

742
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:45,880
IOC s threat crowd is a good one

743
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:48,730
again they provide things like domain

744
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:51,060
and IP linking malware hashes I think

745
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:54,130
they pull from virustotal of malware com

746
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:56,320
but they also have a like a crowd

747
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:57,850
sourced because you can see right there

748
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,350
at that top circle you can say is this

749
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:02,320
malicious so if you're investigating

750
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:04,330
this and nobody else has said it's been

751
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,919
malicious before you know you have that

752
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:07,320
opportunity to contribute back and make

753
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,910
someone else's job a little bit easier

754
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:13,480
you know we talked about using blogs and

755
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:14,710
things like that if you are dealing with

756
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,810
a piece of malware you are on an

757
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:18,340
investigation where there's nothing out

758
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:20,409
there nobody is written or talked about

759
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:22,389
this before there might be something

760
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:23,800
that if you can get approval from your

761
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:25,570
management from your organization

762
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,010
whoever you're working for just put

763
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,629
something out there oh it doesn't have

764
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:30,850
to be a public blog can be part of like

765
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:31,570
a trust group or community where you're

766
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:34,120
sharing that in

767
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:35,169
formation back so now next time somebody

768
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,550
else will have a little bit more

769
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:39,640
information about it it's kind of the

770
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:43,510
whole open-source ecosystem of providing

771
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,830
back a threatened miner is another one

772
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,520
it pulls from a lot more places

773
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:48,040
including

774
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,320
alien vaults open thread exchange which

775
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:52,240
is another cool exchange I don't think I

776
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,830
talked about it much here but it's

777
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,110
another area where they kind of

778
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:58,030
aggregate lists they have community

779
00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:00,929
contributions and they provide more

780
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:03,310
context and they actually now have

781
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:05,170
private groups so it used to be if you

782
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:06,850
were sharing with otx you were sharing

783
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:08,320
with everybody and now they have the

784
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:10,510
ability for you to say like well here

785
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,250
this community within OT X's who I want

786
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:13,300
to share this with so it gives people

787
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,620
kind of a little more comfort with

788
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:18,129
sharing if it's something you think

789
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:19,780
might be a little more sensitive but the

790
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:21,700
other cool thing about threat miner is

791
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:24,220
in addition to dealing with just like IO

792
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:26,920
sees and those kind of those discrete

793
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:29,530
pieces of the puzzle you can also search

794
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:32,380
apt notes and apt notes is a repository

795
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:34,720
of all of these threat reports that

796
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:39,600
we've been publishing kind of in math

797
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,600
since oh gosh when did apt one come out

798
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:47,350
2011 I think yes they store it in a way

799
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,760
that's searchable so for example you can

800
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:50,770
search for the manufacturing industry

801
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:53,020
you can search by year and that kind of

802
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:55,060
goes to not just understanding okay what

803
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:57,129
is this IP address what is this malware

804
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:58,720
sample but understanding more about the

805
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:01,120
actors who are using them and who are

806
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,830
behind them which again can help you go

807
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,050
back to your overall goal which is let

808
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:07,149
me understand this attack you know it's

809
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:08,530
its threat intelligence has the

810
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:10,810
opportunity to provide kind of that

811
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:12,790
bigger picture view and using things

812
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:17,830
like apt notes can help you figure that

813
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:19,270
out as well presenting the information

814
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:21,730
this is my new favorite tool I just

815
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:24,490
discovered this last week and this is

816
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:27,220
called office timeline and it's like a

817
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:29,290
plugin for PowerPoint it only works on

818
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:31,900
windows which made me sad but hey that's

819
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:34,360
why we have the ends right but if this

820
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:37,450
is a feature I've always wanted because

821
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:39,639
it allows me to take the kind of the

822
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:41,290
different events that are IRF people

823
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,950
focus on like okay they did this they

824
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:43,570
did it this

825
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:45,490
then map it in this case the kill chain

826
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:47,260
which I did down here kind of stepping

827
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:49,269
through the different phases and it

828
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:54,610
provides a good visualization as to the

829
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:57,130
actual lifecycle of the attack I used I

830
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:58,959
used to not like the kill chain for a

831
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:01,059
variety of reasons I dislike that it's

832
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,470
trademarked I feel like that's a term

833
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:03,639
that you can't really I don't know what

834
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:06,809
the military term we use it all the time

835
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:09,580
but also apparently Oregon Portland

836
00:31:06,809 --> 00:31:12,519
hippie capital of the world if you sit

837
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:14,529
in a coffee shop and are on a conference

838
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:16,179
call and you say the word kill chain 15

839
00:31:14,529 --> 00:31:17,649
times quickly in succession

840
00:31:16,179 --> 00:31:20,860
turns out they ask you to leave because

841
00:31:17,649 --> 00:31:22,689
you're scaring other customers but again

842
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:24,158
I really like this it has a lot of

843
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:26,200
functionality if you ever in a position

844
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:29,380
where you need to present something like

845
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:32,230
this to executives or management or even

846
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:33,639
to help your own IR team understand kind

847
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:35,740
of a threat intelligence approach what

848
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:39,490
we look at from from this perspective

849
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:41,230
it's a good tool and then storing the

850
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:43,210
intelligence again another threat

851
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:47,080
intelligence platform this is called

852
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:49,539
threat note I really like it it is to be

853
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:51,279
upfront kind of in its beta version

854
00:31:49,539 --> 00:31:52,720
there's definitely some additional

855
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,159
functionality that I think the

856
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,799
developers are trying to build into it

857
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,419
but it's really neat because unlike you

858
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:01,418
know crits and myths and the kind of

859
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:03,159
very IOC centric repositories this

860
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:05,519
allows you to capture information on

861
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:07,720
threat actors and campaigns which are

862
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:11,260
different attacks or different

863
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:13,059
intrusions with similar goals it uses

864
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:14,529
the diamond model that's another good

865
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:16,210
read if you're not familiar it's the

866
00:32:14,529 --> 00:32:18,299
diamond model for intrusion analysis

867
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:20,529
which kind of steps through how to link

868
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:22,990
attackers and infrastructure with their

869
00:32:20,529 --> 00:32:25,510
victims to identify campaigns and

870
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:28,840
identify trends in attacks so it is a

871
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:31,019
kind of a more robust analysis platform

872
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:34,059
rather than just kind of an IOC

873
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:35,440
aggregation platform and again Brian

874
00:32:34,059 --> 00:32:41,289
Wareheim and Scott Roberts have been

875
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:44,169
working on that so kind of to sum up

876
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:46,720
some of the tips for incident response

877
00:32:44,169 --> 00:32:48,429
again many sources of information on Io

878
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,100
CS don't automatically assume that

879
00:32:48,429 --> 00:32:52,809
because you don't have access to you

880
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,610
know a threat Intel vendors portal which

881
00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:56,470
again cost lots and lots of

882
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:58,540
the money that you're on your own there

883
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:59,860
is a lot of information out there there

884
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:01,510
will be times when you hit a dead end

885
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:03,610
there will be times where you will not

886
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:06,340
be able to find open source information

887
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:08,919
on things and that stinks

888
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:10,840
but again kind of step through the

889
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,610
traditional malware analysis approach an

890
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,049
incident response approach and take all

891
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:15,790
that information you learn and if you're

892
00:33:14,049 --> 00:33:17,260
able share it back out so next time

893
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:19,470
somebody is looking for it they're

894
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:21,520
actually able to find something

895
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:23,350
aggregators like threat crowd and threat

896
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,790
miner can help cut down on some of the

897
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:28,418
work of going to all these different

898
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:30,490
places individually identify if

899
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:32,710
something as legitimate indicator not

900
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:34,480
everything is going to require a

901
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:36,309
full-scale investigation by a threat

902
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,100
intelligence analyst and being able to

903
00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:41,290
figure out which ones to focus your time

904
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:43,629
on and which ones to kind of just let go

905
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:45,790
to the side is another way to make sure

906
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:48,370
that you are being respectful of your

907
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:51,010
resources and your time keep the big

908
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:52,239
picture in mind if they wanted you to be

909
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:53,980
an incident responder you'd be on the

910
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,650
incident response team and not threat

911
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:58,690
intelligence so work with them but try

912
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:59,710
and make sure that you're not digging

913
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:02,890
down too deep okay

914
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:04,660
make sure you're maintaining a view of

915
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:06,610
the overall attack so you can understand

916
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:12,760
that better and again keep track of

917
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:13,960
what's working and what isn't and then

918
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:17,139
the last test we're going to talk about

919
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:19,690
is strategic support I really like this

920
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:21,850
aspect because with a lot of things with

921
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:23,830
the sock it's assumed you you have some

922
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:25,449
sort of logging and response capability

923
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:26,739
with Incident Response it's assuming you

924
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:29,469
have some sort of incident response

925
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:32,699
capability with strategic support you

926
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:34,719
really don't need anything else except

927
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:36,489
you know good a good head on your

928
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:38,918
shoulders and people who will listen to

929
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:41,439
you again those two things aren't always

930
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:43,750
a given but I hope that at the very

931
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,119
least people have those those things

932
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:47,859
available to them so when you're

933
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:49,270
providing kind of strategic support and

934
00:34:47,859 --> 00:34:50,879
again this is to executives and to

935
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:53,879
business managers and things like that

936
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:56,529
you're targeting the business to the

937
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:58,480
higher level again you don't want to go

938
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:00,700
in and talk about your latest malware

939
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,800
analysis and how you know you're able to

940
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:04,259
do this gave the C to traffic that is

941
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,310
going to go right over their head

942
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,260
they're not going to want to listen to

943
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:10,049
you anymore so make sure that you were

944
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:12,180
scoping what you're presenting to them

945
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:14,130
to the things that they care about and

946
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:15,569
again it require your providing an

947
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:18,150
assessment of threats that have that

948
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:20,820
kind of strategic impact and that might

949
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:22,140
require some longer-term planning so

950
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:24,420
some resources were going to talk about

951
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:26,609
our the threat reporting kind of apt

952
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:28,230
notes that we had just talked about some

953
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:30,660
of the annual breach reports and then

954
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:33,320
internal data as well we didn't talk

955
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:36,420
about it much in the the last two

956
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:39,390
aspects but your own data your own logs

957
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:41,520
and information for previous incidents

958
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:43,080
is really really invaluable so don't

959
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,180
don't discount that if you have access

960
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,290
to that you are far better off than

961
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:50,399
anyone who just spent a million dollars

962
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:54,259
on a threat feed so quick note on threat

963
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,280
reports many are good some are not

964
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:59,460
always remember that they're used for

965
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:01,860
marketing purposes for the most part you

966
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:03,570
know even if it is a company who says no

967
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:06,990
no we don't sell this we do this you

968
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:08,220
know we do research they're still trying

969
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:09,779
to build their brand they still have

970
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:12,000
some sort of angle so just be prepared

971
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:13,470
to look for those biases they're gonna

972
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,300
want you to think that what they had to

973
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:17,129
talk about is really really important

974
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,360
and really really relevant to you but

975
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:21,570
you're the only one who can actually

976
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:25,800
determine what is important so keep that

977
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:27,720
in mind as you read through things all

978
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,520
right how to spot a bad thread report a

979
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,620
threat report it's always fun to make

980
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:36,000
fun of Norse xoay is anybody here work

981
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:38,580
for Norse wood used to okay so this was

982
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,870
a report that they came out with when we

983
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:44,610
were in the middle of doing nuclear

984
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:46,620
treaty negotiations with Iran so a

985
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:51,450
threat report like this can have very

986
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:54,120
serious policy implications and so what

987
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:56,669
they came out and they said was Iran has

988
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:58,410
engaged in sophisticated cyber attacks

989
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:01,530
against American industrial control

990
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:02,520
systems which then you know clearly if

991
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:06,990
they wouldn't have written it if it

992
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:08,190
wasn't true so Fox News which I don't

993
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:09,870
know if any of you are familiar with Fox

994
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:12,510
News but I have a hard time watching it

995
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:14,890
without like yeah but they came out and

996
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:16,569
they turned this into there was a

997
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:19,390
cyber-terrorist army that is going to

998
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:20,890
attack america and then you read through

999
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:22,690
the report and you realize these

1000
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:25,299
sophisticated cyber attacks were

1001
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:29,170
scanning activity over a one-month

1002
00:37:25,299 --> 00:37:32,680
period and the attribution to iran was

1003
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:33,970
from IP geolocation and if you read

1004
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,828
through the report they they justify

1005
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:37,808
this by saying things like oh well

1006
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:39,549
clearly when you're going to attack

1007
00:37:37,809 --> 00:37:40,900
someone well then then you out you know

1008
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:42,460
you hide where you are and you go

1009
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,690
through hot points but if you're just

1010
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,460
gonna do your reconnaissance and

1011
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:48,339
scanning well then the attackers go from

1012
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:51,730
their own IP address things were you're

1013
00:37:48,339 --> 00:37:53,710
like oh okay and then you know things

1014
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:56,170
like oh yes and then the second-highest

1015
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:57,549
behind Iran were where France in the

1016
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:59,319
Netherlands and no we know that they

1017
00:37:57,549 --> 00:38:02,619
have those crazy hackers there too so

1018
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:05,079
gotta watch out for them the report did

1019
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:06,880
not make a lot of sense but people who

1020
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:09,160
read it did not have the background we

1021
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:11,049
have and so they were like oh my

1022
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:14,098
goodness clearly we're about to be

1023
00:38:11,049 --> 00:38:16,089
attacked this is a catastrophe and

1024
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:18,339
luckily there were enough people who

1025
00:38:16,089 --> 00:38:21,788
could read through and Andy hype and

1026
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:24,160
bring out some of these facts and able

1027
00:38:21,789 --> 00:38:25,809
to discredit them and then then they

1028
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,118
discredited them themselves enough for

1029
00:38:25,809 --> 00:38:30,039
the rest of us so all right so that's

1030
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:32,650
how to spot a bad threat report how do

1031
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:33,970
you spot a good threat report so we'll

1032
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:36,009
provide information on who's being

1033
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:38,769
targeted there have been very few

1034
00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:41,670
attacks that affect everyone everywhere

1035
00:38:38,769 --> 00:38:46,089
on the Internet it's always targeted at

1036
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:47,740
something a country a group an industry

1037
00:38:46,089 --> 00:38:49,210
something you need if it provides you

1038
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:52,118
some sort of information that helps you

1039
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:55,569
gauge who is being who the victim is

1040
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:57,220
that is really really good it provides a

1041
00:38:55,569 --> 00:38:58,359
time frame just because they're

1042
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,890
reporting it now doesn't mean the

1043
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:01,390
attacks happen now could have happened

1044
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:02,980
two years ago especially with the way

1045
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:04,990
our detection and incident response

1046
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:08,410
cycle works it's probably much more

1047
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:10,089
likely that it was a long time ago so

1048
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:12,490
again this helps you understand if you

1049
00:39:10,089 --> 00:39:16,058
need to look at yesterday's logs or

1050
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:18,069
90-days logs so it indicates where the

1051
00:39:16,059 --> 00:39:20,380
information came from a lot of times

1052
00:39:18,069 --> 00:39:22,029
they will not be as upfront as some of

1053
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:23,890
the threat lists was saying oh this came

1054
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:25,359
from these specific systems or these

1055
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:26,779
specific locations they want to protect

1056
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:28,520
their sources and methods

1057
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:30,020
but you do need to be able to get some

1058
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,600
sort of idea whether it came from

1059
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:34,610
scanning data or whether it came from an

1060
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:36,860
incident response engagement where they

1061
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:41,480
have a lot more information and there

1062
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:46,040
will be ways to tell within that how how

1063
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:47,270
it was where the data came from you

1064
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,970
don't want for things that don't make

1065
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:52,040
analytic leaps you do want some of that

1066
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:53,540
analysis that's the reason that they

1067
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:55,370
have a job is because they are threat

1068
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:57,050
analysts so you want that analysis but

1069
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:58,759
you want to be able to logically follow

1070
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:00,590
their steps and how they came to that

1071
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:03,980
conclusion you don't want any of those

1072
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:05,870
crazy leaps and then objective

1073
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:08,360
information when you start seeing things

1074
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:10,339
like cyber terrorists and sophisticated

1075
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:12,200
attacks and and things were you know the

1076
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:15,290
adjectives that are very clearly trying

1077
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,850
to get you to think a certain thing stay

1078
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:18,080
away from those stick with the ones that

1079
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:21,830
are objective and that kind of tell you

1080
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:23,720
the facts annual breach reports or

1081
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:25,750
another really good way to provide that

1082
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:29,450
kind of strategic level assessment

1083
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:31,730
things like you know the the DB ir m

1084
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:33,049
trends that fireEye puts out Symantec

1085
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:36,140
has their internet security threat

1086
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:37,850
report I feel like we're gonna be seeing

1087
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:39,529
more and more of these annual assessment

1088
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:41,930
reports which are good because they all

1089
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:43,520
come from different data sets the DVR

1090
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:44,960
comes from kind of self reported

1091
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,210
incidents people who want to participate

1092
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,830
or if they're the government are forced

1093
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:50,870
to participate but it comes from that

1094
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:53,420
incident response data whereas like the

1095
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:55,759
Symantec report comes from their sensors

1096
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:57,770
and the things that they are monitoring

1097
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,300
so you have two different data sets and

1098
00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:00,500
it's kind of interesting to read over

1099
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:02,630
both of them and see how they compare

1100
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:04,370
see what you can learn from one versus

1101
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:08,090
the other and aggregate it into what it

1102
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:10,430
actually means from you and these annual

1103
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:11,960
reports can provide a lot of answers to

1104
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:14,830
questions that your executives will have

1105
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:18,170
such as you know what are threats to

1106
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:20,150
organizations in our industry you know

1107
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:22,010
what type of actors are targeting our

1108
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:24,650
industry or other organizations like us

1109
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:27,250
what do they do and then the big one are

1110
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:30,260
we are we positioned to identify and

1111
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:31,970
defeat an attack and that's something

1112
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:33,710
that you only know if you work with your

1113
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:35,720
own organization if you understand not

1114
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:38,770
only your security posture but the

1115
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,770
threats against you as well

1116
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:44,058
the DBA are also does

1117
00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:46,190
Street snapshots all the data is made

1118
00:41:44,059 --> 00:41:47,869
available so they have some like this

1119
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:49,150
ones for the healthcare sector that you

1120
00:41:47,869 --> 00:41:51,230
know provides some specific examples

1121
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:52,670
about threats facing the healthcare

1122
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:54,349
sector but all that information is out

1123
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:56,749
there and again if you have some our

1124
00:41:54,349 --> 00:41:58,730
skills which is what they use for the

1125
00:41:56,749 --> 00:42:00,319
Dvir you can very quickly pull the

1126
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:02,299
information for your particular sector

1127
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,980
organization there's a lot of different

1128
00:42:02,299 --> 00:42:05,480
ways you can handle the data you know

1129
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,829
doesn't just have to be by industry it

1130
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:09,619
can be like okay what about our

1131
00:42:06,829 --> 00:42:12,170
geographical area or companies of a

1132
00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:13,880
similar size to us when you have some of

1133
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:15,890
that the the data science and the

1134
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,990
analysis skills you can pull a lot of

1135
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:21,049
information especially from the publicly

1136
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:23,149
available data sets and then leverage

1137
00:42:21,049 --> 00:42:26,059
your internal data don't just look

1138
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:28,400
outside a lot of times that's where

1139
00:42:26,059 --> 00:42:31,009
threats come from but we will have a lot

1140
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,950
more information on those threats from

1141
00:42:31,009 --> 00:42:35,869
our internal resources so the different

1142
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:38,779
business units they know what is

1143
00:42:35,869 --> 00:42:41,029
important to them they know what would

1144
00:42:38,779 --> 00:42:43,339
be a what would stop their operations or

1145
00:42:41,029 --> 00:42:45,410
what would cause them to have a

1146
00:42:43,339 --> 00:42:47,029
significant setback better than we do

1147
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:49,460
you know insecurity we like to think

1148
00:42:47,029 --> 00:42:51,559
that we know everything it's important

1149
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:55,190
to realize that we don't always know

1150
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:57,650
everything lawyers you know no one wants

1151
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:59,359
to talk to them I know some lawyers in

1152
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:01,549
there were actually very decent human

1153
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:03,288
beings believe it or not and they can

1154
00:43:01,549 --> 00:43:06,349
provide a lot of information as to what

1155
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:07,730
you are required to protect which again

1156
00:43:06,349 --> 00:43:10,579
will help you figure out where you need

1157
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:12,559
to position yourself Asset Management

1158
00:43:10,579 --> 00:43:13,730
it's hard to protect what you don't if

1159
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:15,950
you don't know what you have you know

1160
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:18,109
what type of systems you have hopefully

1161
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:19,399
you have asset management if not please

1162
00:43:18,109 --> 00:43:22,460
focus on that before you do threat

1163
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:24,289
intelligence find out about previous

1164
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:25,640
incidents what types of threats have you

1165
00:43:24,289 --> 00:43:27,470
seen again there is no better threat

1166
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:30,499
intelligence then the intelligence

1167
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:34,098
you've generated yourself so be prepared

1168
00:43:30,499 --> 00:43:35,419
to respond and to detect those types of

1169
00:43:34,099 --> 00:43:36,829
threats especially if it's something

1170
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:38,180
you've seen over and over again and it's

1171
00:43:36,829 --> 00:43:40,069
kind of persistent and you know it's

1172
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:42,230
likely to come back again and then

1173
00:43:40,069 --> 00:43:44,058
third-party partners a lot of times

1174
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:46,700
we're seeing people are not actually

1175
00:43:44,059 --> 00:43:48,799
getting breached by their own networks

1176
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,569
it's somebody they partner with it's a

1177
00:43:48,799 --> 00:43:52,009
third party resource you know going all

1178
00:43:50,569 --> 00:43:52,850
the way back to target and their HVAC

1179
00:43:52,009 --> 00:43:54,920
vendors

1180
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:57,200
but then we see things like the the

1181
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,850
TeamViewer which again they say they

1182
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,009
weren't hacked but again those

1183
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:03,140
credentials allowed people access to

1184
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:05,090
their networks so you didn't even have

1185
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:07,339
to do anything wrong except maybe not

1186
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:08,180
have two-factor authentication but you

1187
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:10,640
need to understand what those

1188
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:15,710
third-party connections are and how that

1189
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:20,000
extends to your attack surface alright

1190
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:21,590
so again tips for strategic support you

1191
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,020
have to understand your business in

1192
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:26,210
order to provide this type of support so

1193
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:28,970
take the time to understand what's

1194
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:30,530
important not just for a Security's sake

1195
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:33,799
but for a whole business operating sake

1196
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:37,520
and that way you can approach the

1197
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:39,650
threats from a place where you're

1198
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,820
actually providing value because you

1199
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:43,430
understand what's important to the

1200
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:45,380
business find threat reports that are

1201
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:46,700
relevant and unbiased again not

1202
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:48,650
everything is going to be directly

1203
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:50,180
applicable to you so look for the ones

1204
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:52,550
that are and the more you read through

1205
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:54,290
them and the more you really dig into it

1206
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:55,910
and kind of look into some of the things

1207
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:57,259
that you think are good relevant to you

1208
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:59,690
worse the ones that aren't it'll become

1209
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:02,600
quicker to understand which ones to

1210
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:04,010
focus on learn from previous incidents

1211
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,900
build a threat model of your

1212
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:06,980
organization that's another thing that

1213
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:09,740
kind of reading through all these

1214
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:11,990
reports in the annual the annual reviews

1215
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:13,580
that will help you understand a lot more

1216
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:15,470
about the threats that are facing other

1217
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:16,850
organizations similar to yours that you

1218
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:19,490
might face and it can help you build out

1219
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:22,670
a threat model talk to executives about

1220
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:24,290
what they care about and use your

1221
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:26,120
strategic planning to support threat

1222
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:28,640
intelligence investment requests and

1223
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:30,440
again it all comes down to you don't

1224
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,960
want to always have to be you know

1225
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:35,660
scramming and begging and borrowing and

1226
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,070
stealing resources if this is something

1227
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:39,529
that is going to be useful to your

1228
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:41,210
organization and you've taken the time

1229
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:43,700
and the work to understand what it is

1230
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:45,830
you need to operate then this is a

1231
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:46,759
really good place to say hey these are

1232
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:48,410
the threats that are facing our

1233
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,390
organization over the next three years

1234
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:52,430
we expect an increase in this type of

1235
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:54,470
attack we have this type of data that is

1236
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:56,419
critical to our success as a business

1237
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:58,490
here's some things we can put in place

1238
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:00,100
to monitor to identify threats and to

1239
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:02,330
continue to increase our security

1240
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:03,980
they're much more likely to listen than

1241
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:07,060
if you just say like hey this thing is

1242
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:07,060
really cool and I want to buy it

1243
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:16,560
so in closing open source feeds free as

1244
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:18,810
in puppies open-source platforms free

1245
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:21,090
open-source reports a lot of times

1246
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:23,340
they're free community tools they have

1247
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:24,810
free sometimes limited access but you

1248
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:26,820
can definitely get some use out of them

1249
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:28,259
but that's solid foundation that you're

1250
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:30,030
gonna build by actually going through

1251
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:31,560
the process and figuring out what is

1252
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:34,619
important to you and what works for you

1253
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:36,090
is priceless and that means suddenly

1254
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:37,350
someone shows up tomorrow and says

1255
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:39,330
woohoo we have all the money in the

1256
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:41,670
world which usually means you just got

1257
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:42,960
hacked so sorry if that happens you'll

1258
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:44,760
know what to do with it and you'll know

1259
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:49,650
where to wisely invest your resources

1260
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:52,650
that you do have if you have any

1261
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:54,330
questions I think I have some time now

1262
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:56,220
otherwise you can hit me up on on

1263
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:58,859
Twitter or my email and then I will put

1264
00:46:56,220 --> 00:47:00,480
my slides up after the site just listed

1265
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:02,369
all the links to the different tools I

1266
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:10,710
mentioned in case anybody wants to take

1267
00:47:02,369 --> 00:47:11,940
a picture at - slides - so well wait

1268
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:16,580
till I see no more cameras and then I

1269
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:17,910
will go to the next one any questions oh

1270
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:21,840
yes

1271
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:25,200
Rebecca is there any tool that will

1272
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:27,690
automatically look for useful and ip's

1273
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:29,640
or naughty IPS and add them either to a

1274
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:33,090
windows firewall or even better to an

1275
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:35,819
AWS security group there are there are

1276
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:38,250
several so it depends on where you where

1277
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:39,600
you're looking for I mean when you say

1278
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:42,690
like looking for IPs

1279
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:44,549
here's the second slide do you mean like

1280
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:46,770
running your own honey pots or just

1281
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:48,270
searching to see when when new threats

1282
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:49,830
are popping up online when new threats

1283
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:51,690
are popping online I'd like the magic to

1284
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:55,500
my AWS security group so I don't have to

1285
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:58,050
worry about so I am sure there are

1286
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:59,460
specific tools that do that they will go

1287
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:00,780
by and aggravate the fields you still

1288
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,280
have to kind of point them to what you

1289
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:03,450
want

1290
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,460
combine actually might be a good tool to

1291
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:07,500
do that because you can tell it what

1292
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:09,570
data feeds you want it to do

1293
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:12,030
it won't really intuitively identify

1294
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:13,830
when new feeds pop up or or feed goes

1295
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:15,480
bad so you will still have to monitor

1296
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:18,330
for that but that's kind of what's the

1297
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:19,380
point of it was is to to aggregate a

1298
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:21,480
bunch of different data feeds

1299
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:23,310
specifically around things like IPs and

1300
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,410
then put them into a format that you can

1301
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:26,310
use and again since it's open source if

1302
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:28,049
you want to make it you know

1303
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:29,400
specifically for your able to AWS

1304
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:32,550
instance you can probably tweak the code

1305
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:40,830
a bit to to make it the output work with

1306
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:42,390
that Thanks so on your slide how to spot

1307
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:45,180
a good threat report there was something

1308
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:47,609
that seemed to be um conspicuous by its

1309
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:48,720
absence which is the thing that military

1310
00:48:47,609 --> 00:48:51,390
intelligence people really like about

1311
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:54,390
confidence yeah so is there any reason

1312
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:55,980
why you didn't have that with that

1313
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:58,290
confidence in the threat report yeah

1314
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:59,730
yeah so how confident you are in terms

1315
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:04,380
of percentages you know fifty percent is

1316
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:06,510
perhaps seventy five percent is so is

1317
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:08,730
especially with the vendor type reports

1318
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:10,800
they will always send a report as high

1319
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:12,210
confidence they will say I wouldn't have

1320
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,339
given this to you if it wasn't high

1321
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:16,680
confidence and then the other default is

1322
00:49:14,339 --> 00:49:20,099
medium confidence and which is kind of

1323
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:21,990
like not bad it's not good so I see

1324
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:24,630
those two things a lot so I have a

1325
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:28,049
really hard time putting my faith in

1326
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:29,670
somebody else's confidence rating and

1327
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:32,070
then again it kind of comes down to the

1328
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:33,930
skill of understanding okay who is this

1329
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:35,490
person who's putting the report out are

1330
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:37,890
they telling me where the data came from

1331
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:39,689
do I know how old it is and then I can

1332
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:42,779
kind of intuitively form my own

1333
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:46,530
confidence rating based on that but

1334
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:48,300
again it also I think that with when

1335
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:49,530
you're taking intelligence from someone

1336
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:51,000
else and you're trying to see how you

1337
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:52,740
can use it you have to do that

1338
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,560
additional layer of analysis as well

1339
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:57,959
because it's great to know what's what's

1340
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,890
the larger kind of global threat but

1341
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,180
when you're trying to approach whether

1342
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:01,890
that threat is relevant to you

1343
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:04,049
specifically you do have to do that own

1344
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:05,490
level analysis and I think that's where

1345
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:09,810
you come in you generate your own

1346
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:11,490
confidence does that make sense yeah if

1347
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:15,200
anybody ever says like confidence level

1348
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:15,200
five I'm like you didn't even try

1349
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:22,899
tell us one more question yes so in the

1350
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:24,910
the risk equation standard risk question

1351
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:29,200
there's a lot of metrics available on

1352
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:32,190
impact and vulnerability how do you know

1353
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:37,240
of any work to score threat intelligence

1354
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:40,030
yes I'm blanking on what it is right now

1355
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:47,290
I know there there is several people are

1356
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:49,810
trying to tackle that so the like the

1357
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:51,040
the vulnerabilities I know that people

1358
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:52,390
that there's a lot of research into

1359
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,640
actually the vulnerabilities and they

1360
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:56,200
they take like the CDSs scores and then

1361
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,790
they try and cross-reference that by

1362
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,350
whether it's you know is it actually

1363
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:01,450
being exploited in the wild or is it

1364
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:03,220
just a theoretical exploit and then wrap

1365
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:04,419
that into okay well if we've seen it has

1366
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:06,520
it been and get you've been used against

1367
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:08,200
the sophisticated adversary or you know

1368
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:10,030
is it just is it an exploit kit that

1369
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,529
type of thing so people are trying to do

1370
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:13,770
this type of modeling I don't think

1371
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:17,860
anybody has actually gotten it really

1372
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:19,090
solidly right to this point and there's

1373
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:20,110
also been a lot of work where people

1374
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:22,510
have been trying to come up with

1375
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:25,000
processes and algorithms for indicator

1376
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:26,950
expiration as well such as okay if it's

1377
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,140
an IP associated to this thread it's

1378
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:31,770
good for 46 hours as opposed to this

1379
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:33,910
threat which is only good for two hours

1380
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:35,410
there's it there's actually a lot of

1381
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:37,779
stuff out there on github a lot of

1382
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:39,700
people's you know in progress work

1383
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:41,710
that's out there on those but I don't

1384
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:44,080
think there's anything anything solid

1385
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:53,700
that I would would say this is spot on

1386
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:53,700
but we're getting there all right oh yes

1387
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:15,290
yes yes so the question was since

1388
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,570
Dominic didn't have a microphone

1389
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:19,640
how should analysts handle potentially

1390
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:21,080
misleading information like the denial

1391
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:23,240
and deception the example was that gusta

1392
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,560
42.0 where we don't actually be weren't

1393
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,540
doing the investigation we don't have

1394
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:28,430
the tools to say one way or another so

1395
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:30,560
how should we handle that and that is an

1396
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:33,500
actually a great application of the

1397
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:36,560
analysis of competing hypotheses which

1398
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:38,359
is a intelligence model that I Oh God

1399
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,740
Richard you're developed I think in the

1400
00:52:38,359 --> 00:52:41,900
70s or something I might have gotten the

1401
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:43,669
date wrong but it's where you step

1402
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:45,410
through and you you take the evidence

1403
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:47,630
that you do have available to you and

1404
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:49,879
you come up with a set of different

1405
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:51,920
hypotheses so for the that particular

1406
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:53,750
hack it was okay it was boosted for 2.0

1407
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,450
acting as a lone wolf it was the

1408
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:58,040
Russians it was you know the DNC hacked

1409
00:52:56,450 --> 00:53:00,830
themselves to make Donald Trump look bad

1410
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:02,930
and you take all of those hypotheses and

1411
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:04,819
you run them against the evidence you

1412
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:06,740
have and you say either it supports or

1413
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:09,200
it refutes that particular hypothesis

1414
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:12,020
and in the end you should probably have

1415
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:15,259
something where you have a bit more a

1416
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:17,599
bit more information to say okay this is

1417
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:19,400
the most likely scenario it will never

1418
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:21,380
be a hundred percent especially if you

1419
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,910
don't have access to the actual log data

1420
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:24,859
and you only have what the information

1421
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:26,450
is out there in the media but there is

1422
00:53:24,859 --> 00:53:28,130
still even when you don't know exactly

1423
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:29,779
who it was and you can't point the

1424
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:31,520
finger to it was this person or this

1425
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:32,990
group there's still a lot that an

1426
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,830
analyst can learn from that type of

1427
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:35,899
situation

1428
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:38,750
which is that it's kind of like what I

1429
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:42,740
took away from the the DNC hack and all

1430
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:46,280
that was that it's it's kind of a

1431
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:49,368
changing the game's changed as far as

1432
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:51,230
how the threat intelligence world is

1433
00:53:49,369 --> 00:53:53,960
working and now we have private

1434
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:56,060
organizations who are you know calling

1435
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:57,650
out essentially nation-states and what

1436
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:58,580
might the implications of that be and

1437
00:53:57,650 --> 00:54:01,609
we're seeing a lot more of the

1438
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:04,009
scapegoating type activity and so it

1439
00:54:01,609 --> 00:54:06,410
really changes the dynamic and again

1440
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:08,740
that's not something that you can always

1441
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:10,839
clearly articulate or always know 100

1442
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:12,990
what happened but there are still a lot

1443
00:54:10,839 --> 00:54:21,369
of lessons you can learn from a

1444
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:23,700
situation like that one more any other

1445
00:54:21,369 --> 00:54:23,700
questions

1446
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:30,130
alright you guys might not have noticed

1447
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:32,709
but at the very end my daughter walked

1448
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:34,089
in she's hiding in the back so what you

1449
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:35,950
should all do is just talk about how

1450
00:54:34,089 --> 00:54:38,078
awesome I am and how good I am at my job

1451
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:39,910
because then she won't mind when I have

1452
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:43,240
to go out of town and don't get to take

1453
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:44,390
her to cool places like London all right

1454
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,060
well thank you very much

1455
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:49,290
[Applause]
