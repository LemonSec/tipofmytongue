1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,029
Oh

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:09,350
go a good morning wow I've never seen

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,380
ruin this full and I don't know whether

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:14,360
that's a good thing because you take

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,040
time to warm into a conference and I

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:20,029
didn't open last night it's Steve dead

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:22,150
and this is so this is like first time

8
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:26,000
talking for a few months to anyone so

9
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:30,528
anyway do you remember this logo we put

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,519
it at the end of the presentation last

11
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:38,120
year and it was actually kind of a theme

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:41,270
going through 44 con last year which was

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:44,419
kind of relevant to the politics of the

14
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:46,460
day so this year we decided to change

15
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,660
his little bit and because it's the

16
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,020
anniversary of Blade Runner

17
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:55,250
we found the Blade Runner fonts or yeah

18
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:58,010
that's vaguely legible and we started

19
00:00:55,250 --> 00:01:00,080
playing with it and it we liked it and

20
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:04,849
everything around this event this year

21
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:07,250
is Blade Runner and one thing that Steve

22
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:09,399
did last night is this slide and I

23
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,600
thought who was here last night

24
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,740
okay so you've seen this already for the

25
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:19,910
people that haven't seen this already

26
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:22,429
mmm okay so bearing in mind the second

27
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:25,039
picture for the first time we actually

28
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:26,900
have something if you don't want to call

29
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,390
the Samaritans which if you suicide what

30
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:32,690
you should do if you just want to talk

31
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:35,300
to someone about whatever else that

32
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:37,580
isn't Samaritan related then this number

33
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:40,729
is being manned 24 hours a day during

34
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:44,330
the event you can email us at help of 44

35
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:46,940
con-com you can mention us at 44 con on

36
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:49,400
twitter but do not send us DMS please

37
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,380
because we are not reading them in fact

38
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:55,130
that had only we've even gotten turned

39
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:59,289
on on any output devices so that's it so

40
00:01:55,130 --> 00:02:03,250
is this anyone's first time at 44 con oh

41
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:07,700
right next slide I won't skip it then so

42
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:09,318
we founded it in 2011 we put the first

43
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,330
event together in six months and

44
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:14,250
basically our friends sponsored us and a

45
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:16,940
friend spoke at the event it was awesome

46
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,470
nine years old Steve did a swanky slide

47
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:22,890
very nice graphic you remember this from

48
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,660
the film very nice and win nine so

49
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,940
that's good now the result of being

50
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:30,000
around for nine years is when you type

51
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:32,190
44 con into Google this happens and I

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,680
believe that I get a lot of emails

53
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:37,829
offering me this type of result for

54
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:41,700
paying them some dollars but 1.2 million

55
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:47,070

of doing it please tell us so in terms

68
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:28,320
of telling people how to do things we

69
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:32,640
have a mental health hacker set up it's

70
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:34,230
upstairs they've got various techniques

71
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,959
that they're willing to teach you to

72
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:39,660
help you to relax and not be so obsessed

73
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,570
with log files once you log files are

74
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,340
good so anyway there is some talks and

75
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,560
workshops and more and self care

76
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,600
products available and all of that good

77
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,610
stuff

78
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,380
fantastic right soldering we have

79
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:56,550
soldiering again this year but there is

80
00:03:52,380 --> 00:04:00,660
a reason not to solder the badge you can

81
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:02,370
use it to get drink so your choice is

82
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,250
you either solder the badge and have a

83
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:07,880
cool thing to take away or you trade it

84
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,880
in for beer

85
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:18,930
hmm so we've got lockpicking

86
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,760
they guaranteed to us that they would be

87
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,740
available during the day of first day

88
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:26,170
and Friday they'll only be around

89
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:28,120
tonight if you feed them beer

90
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:30,640
and please don't remove stuff from the

91
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,730
area that was a problem last time they

92
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:38,830
were here capture the flag

93
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:44,890

94
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:46,690
four minutes before it kicks off we have

95
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:50,110

97
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:56,830

Hammersmith and Fulham families it's

105
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:22,630

106
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,330
helping people this year we ran an

107
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:30,640
Assistance Program and these companies

108
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:32,349
all sponsored people to be here so it's

109
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:37,300
too early for a round of applause just

110
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:39,730

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,020
some very grateful people out there

114
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:52,060
sponsors we've got a lot of sponsors any

115
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:55,960
sponsors in the room and whatever

116
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:58,330
they're good you can have lunch too but

117
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,520
the people you gave tickets to the

118
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,349
exhibitor tickets they can't because

119
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,090
there are freeloaders but they're your

120
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:07,270
freeloaders so you take care of them

121
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:08,799
it's all good but you do also have tea

122
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,930
and coffee vouchers to give out don't

123
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,050
forget that don't keep hold of them you

124
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:17,200
have a thirsty audience in terms of

125
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:19,600
sponsors lots of pretty logos all very

126
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,460
very nice they'd all love to talk to you

127
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,200
and one of the things we do here is the

128
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,450
sponsor passports you go around to each

129
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:28,150
sponsor you get the sponsor part for

130
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:29,770
passport stamps you give that to us on

131
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,450
the end at the end with your name on

132
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,609
very important to put your name on

133
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:35,800
because we draw these out of a bucket

134
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:40,500
and whoever we draw out gets free entry

135
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,500
next year kind of cool

136
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:46,419
they also have tea and coffee vouchers

137
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:49,080
and we'll talk more about it the state

138
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:51,730
of tea and coffee in a couple of slides

139
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:55,150
next thing you should know we have talks

140
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:58,150
not being filmed they will not appear on

141
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:59,469
YouTube they will not I'd only reading

142
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:04,030
and get slide decks for them

143
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:07,810

know these marvellous espresso machines

180
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:06,520
this one's one not even one year old and

181
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:10,780
powered up this morning did the first

182
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:14,410
pull and a rubber gasket that costs 2

183
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:16,180
pence failed and they don't have a

184
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:18,040
replacement so they've been jury-rigging

185
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,140
it and they've brought the machine back

186
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:23,770
up to pressure they've promised me it

187
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:27,580
won't explode this is good and by the

188
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:33,100
end of this talk it should be it should

189
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:35,230

195
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:49,630

196
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,640
vouchers yeah cuz last year we actually

197
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:53,710
had sponsors that didn't give them out

198
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,420
so go and harangue the sponsors for your

199
00:09:53,710 --> 00:10:06,730
tea and coffee vouchers so you don't pay

200

202
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:17,410

210
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,490
to follow them because we don't like

211
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,920
throwing people out and we especially

212
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:46,360
don't like calling the police we do have

213
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,390
a member of the police on that on the

214
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:53,640
staff you do something illegal we won't

215
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:53,640
be the judge jury executioner they will

216
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:02,430

217
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:11,840
