3
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:09,920
this talk is actually part of the mental

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,810
health hackers village so if you haven't

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,390
had chance go up to the second floor say

6
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:17,449
hello to them effectively I want to talk

7
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:19,070
today about some strategies for having a

8
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:20,990
good career having a good life and that

9
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,310
we talk a lot about that right oh I'm

10
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,930
burned out I'm not feeling good okay

11
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:27,259
good well cute you know exercise drinks

12
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:29,330
of water you're fine but what happens if

13
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,789
you continue to burn out what happens if

14
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:34,579
you've got a career a little bit longer

15
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:35,569
than most how can you survive and make

16
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:36,800
sure that you're headed in the right

17
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:38,809
direction those are some of the things I

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,909
won't explore today as already mentioned

19
00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:45,440
my name is wolf Gorelick I am an adviser

20
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:46,969
EC so with dual and a lot of this comes

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,949
out of some of the work I've done in the

22
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:52,039
community I've co-founded the converged

23
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:54,049
conference out in the States I ran in

24
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:56,420
the besides Detroit for many many years

25
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:57,949
this was the first year I didn't run it

26
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,449
it felt really weird I kept trying to

27
00:00:57,949 --> 00:01:00,469
tell people what to do and realizing I

28
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:03,409
could just relax

29
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:06,710
it was great start a couple different

30
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:09,530
communities like the OWASP chapter CSA

31
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:11,240
we'd try to chapter that behind the my

32
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:14,240
set group and this is one of the things

33
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:17,210
I'm really proud of a very grainy photo

34
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,520
of me with some of my first folks in the

35
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:22,190
thing called CBI Academy for four years

36
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,410
I ran an apprenticeship program - your

37
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:26,259
apprenticeship program for junior

38
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:29,149
analyst people just getting in and

39
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:31,820
there's a lot of fun we put 67 people

40
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:33,760
through that program so I can watch 67

41
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:36,770
very different very unique people

42
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,630
struggle and figure out how to find

43
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,399
their way how to find their path and how

44
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,630
to get a good career going and I'm

45
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,720
really proud of some of the people who

46
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:46,640
came out of this - because now they're

47
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:50,240
senior level people security officers

48
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,070
one of them is an insurance agency very

49
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,710
good group and gave me a lot of exposure

50
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:56,509
to what it takes to do a good career so

51
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:58,640
I'm gonna talk today about some of the

52
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,229
strategies for mental health I'm gonna

53
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,659
talk today about how to put it together

54
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:04,850
I'm gonna end up with a proposal for a

55
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:07,130
career owner's manual right what are

56
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:09,859
some of the things you should do weekly

57
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:11,719
monthly quarterly annually on a decade

58
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:14,060
basis I think that's decade lis I'm not

59
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:15,400
sure to make sure that you've got a good

60
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:20,799
current things are going well

61
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:23,470
so first off master the basics master

62
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:25,720
the basics and where I want to start

63
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:29,069
with that is what is it we actually do

64
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:32,109
what is that we do in cybersecurity I

65
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:33,730
got into this field when the movie

66
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,950
hackers came out if you guys remember

67
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:38,170
that movie probably love that movie I

68
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,730
saw it in the theaters shortly

69
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,409
thereafter I had a data center I tried

70
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:44,078
to skateboard it across the dish like

71
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:45,359
the plague fun fact that is not a good

72
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:48,010
idea to do

73
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,510
you've got raised floors and lips that's

74
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:52,030
my excuse not the fact I'm absolutely

75
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,679
terrible a skateboard but do you know

76
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,660
that idea of like hacking the Gibson and

77
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,109
everything really got me excited and I

78
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:01,359
think fundamentally what we do is we

79
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:03,159
sing to computers right we sing the song

80
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:04,780
that computers understand we're

81
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:07,179
responsible for making sure these

82
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,299
machines work and operate and do

83
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,799
whatever organizations need to do and

84
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:12,970
just keep the bad guys out if we're on

85
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:14,680
the blue team if you're on the red team

86
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,709
you sing like I don't know death metal

87
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,640
the computers and they break down

88
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:21,669
interpret that as you will I'm a blue

89
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,929
team kind of guy of course to sing the

90
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:25,209
song to the computers we have to have

91
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,130
good mental health we have to be sharp

92
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:29,319
we have to know what we're doing we have

93
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:31,269
to know the commands that need to be

94
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:33,339
entered we have to know the syntax we

95
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:35,109
have to know the connectivity we have to

96
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,060
know the ins and outs of how to secure

97
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:38,560
them we have to know how to put data

98
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,959
into the cloud and everywhere else so

99
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,329
things don't break down we have to know

100
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:47,019
to secure s3 buckets please secure your

101
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:48,910
s3 buckets and to disable authentication

102
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:52,389
protocols and as your please secure your

103
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:54,668
authentication points on Azure those

104
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:57,810
other things right we need to know a lot

105
00:03:54,669 --> 00:04:00,849
and so a lot of it focuses in on I think

106
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:03,430
these two things are we seeing to the

107
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:05,108
computer in the right key and do we have

108
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,629
the right amount of mental health to

109
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:09,010
pull this thing off but behind all of

110
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:10,929
the course and some of the things we

111
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:13,328
oftentimes don't think about is our

112
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:20,260
physicality are we are we physically fit

113
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:22,930
do we have the right state of body state

114
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,419
of health to actually go ahead and run

115
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,039
things in our in our world and so much

116
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:29,159
of it is focused on that mental health

117
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:30,719
so much is like wow if you just were

118
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,880
you know calmer if you just had the

119
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,770
right meds if you just did but so much

120
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,140
of it I think overlooks that physicality

121
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:39,510
peace are you in a good physical state

122
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:42,030
are you rested are you fed have you gone

123
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:43,650
ahead and done some exercise and trying

124
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,510
to fit all those things in together and

125
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:49,409
have that full context so that we can

126
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:53,310
sing with machines so does it mean to

127
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:56,210
sing to the machines right part of it is

128
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:58,230
obviously knowing what we're doing and

129
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,669
when we don't know what we're doing you

130
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,990
got that whole impostor syndrome I'll

131
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:03,600
talk more about impostor syndrome in a

132
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:07,250
little bit but having a good fundamental

133
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,960
grasp of what it takes to do the job and

134
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:11,640
so many great ways to do that 44 con

135
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,739
obviously is one way so many good

136
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:16,020
conferences some good events books

137
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,060
podcasts it's just a wealth of

138
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:21,240
information today out today when I was

139
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:23,520
first getting into this you know I I was

140
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,950
on the BBS's so if you guys remember the

141
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,849
BBS and they were fantastic you get on

142
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,140
there and everyone tell you you're

143
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,970
terrible and stupid you don't know what

144
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,830
you're doing and you'd ask one question

145
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,180
and they would all dogpile you but

146
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,280
there'd be this one person go yeah but

147
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:38,190
wait a minute here's a doc and how to do

148
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,690
it yes I know and the log often change a

149
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,460
user name and you'd be like I know all

150
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,860
the things and someone asks the same

151
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:46,440
question like you're an idiot

152
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:48,030
and then you ask your questions quietly

153
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,710
and get dog powder and you change your

154
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:53,010
eyes like seven different usernames

155
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:54,570
after a couple years it was crazy but

156
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:56,010
then it was all about trying to find the

157
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:58,020
information today what's fascinating to

158
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,820
me is this about trying to make sure you

159
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,320
get the right information it's really

160
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,659
fascinating about how we went almost

161
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,969
full circle if only I had access to all

162
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,710
the information I could do my job and so

163
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,750
you're trying Google and search and you

164
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,400
end up at no library doing the Dewey

165
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,590
Decimal System and reading left to right

166
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,179
and this is real old days people but now

167
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,919
I looked at some of my Millennials of

168
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,330
those coaching and it was the exact same

169
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,590
thing I don't know where he get the

170
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,539
information I'm like Google they're like

171
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:24,359
why did Google it and I got 10,000 page

172
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:25,500
results so which one do I follow like I

173
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,660
don't know ask somebody he's the current

174
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,970
who do I ask we kind of come full circle

175
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,740
in terms of not it used to be we had

176
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:33,330
this information dearth now we are

177
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,860
information wealth when we had

178
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,900
information dearth we'd have to talk to

179
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,950
people now we have information wealth so

180
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,750
we have to talk to people to figure out

181
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,789
what to do

182
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,870
so to sing to the machines first off we

183
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,300
need to have a really

184
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:47,520
community and of course they have good

185
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,680
mental health something we talked about

186
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,570
all the time here in the villages and

187
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,340
everything else are you in a good mental

188
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:55,290
state do you have a good mental attitude

189
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:58,200
a lot of us don't a lot of a struggle

190
00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:00,360
this is a hard job it really is I mean

191
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,620
you look at everything we have to do are

192
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,660
we doing the right thing I don't know

193
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,850
are we appreciated I don't know do we

194
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:09,480
have budget no do we have enough people

195
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:10,980
no and so to kind of overcome that

196
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:14,970
negativity can be a very difficult

197
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:18,390
challenge especially again if you look

198
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:20,520
at online not the BBS's but now Twitter

199
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:23,760
I posted something on Twitter the other

200
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,530
day and and it went like so many of my

201
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,090
tweets and actually it was kind of funny

202
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,440
because I posted it on Facebook and I

203
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:30,619
posted on Twitter so on Facebook

204
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:35,219
everyone's like you know like up like

205
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:37,950
emoji there's so much that I'm Twitter

206
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,270
they're like well yeah but and let me

207
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,039
explain that to you it's like it's sort

208
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,450
like this it's like I made spaghetti on

209
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,860
Facebook people are like we love

210
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:45,270
spaghetti you're awesome

211
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,690
on Twitter it's like I made spaghetti

212
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:51,330
people are like well why did you do that

213
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:52,980
because I was hungry did you buy box no

214
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:55,500
do you know what the does the

215
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,850
environment to buy box noodles I mean I

216
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,500
could just have made my own those yeah

217
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,540
you should have maybe it's true that

218
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,040
kind of like everyone whatever you do is

219
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,380
wrong or if you made your own do this

220
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,490
like well really isn't a cultural

221
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:10,590
appropriation that makes spaghetti

222
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:13,200
Wolfgang you're German come on so we've

223
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:16,080
got this kind of culture that's went

224
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,490
from IRC to seeming to be nice and now

225
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,140
suddenly brought out as sort of bad

226
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,680
habits back to Twitter where we dog out

227
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,960
on people

228
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,550
very frustrating so we need a good

229
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,950
community and we need to be supportive

230
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:29,000
of those in our community on the

231
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:32,309
physical side we need to have good

232
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,630
attention on our on ourselves you know

233
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:38,189
the the idea of hackers and body hacking

234
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:41,340
has really come about in past couple

235
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:43,410
years and I love it I know myself if I

236
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,630
go to the gym and the day I in the

237
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:47,339
morning I feel better all day if I skip

238
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:49,590
it I feel terrible I've been traveling a

239
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:51,690
lot and I know some of you can travel

240
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:53,640
all the time hit the gym I can't I

241
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:55,320
forget I'm tired I'm grouchy I'm not

242
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,120
hitting the gym in the morning and then

243
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,700
it's like three weeks go by I'm like

244
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,670
I feel terrible I got to hit the gym on

245
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,500
Thursday with a good friend of mine and

246
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:06,360
my lift was down he's giving me shit

247
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,890
he's like well you know if you would hit

248
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,350
it every day I'm like I know I know just

249
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:12,900
spot me I'm sure I can lift this

250
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,550
actually but does not only have to be

251
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,170
absolutely weightlifting it could be

252
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:18,569
cardio could be any number of things I

253
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:21,089
think one thing we tend to forget is and

254
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,220
singing the Machine and focusing in our

255
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:25,320
brain the absolute importance it is of

256
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:28,290
realizing that we are animals right

257
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,210
we're we're highly functional cavemen

258
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:32,069
and we need to go out for a walk we need

259
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:34,080
to go run down a mammoth we need to do

260
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:36,900
something exciting your heart pumping

261
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,980
and handle all those chemicals in our

262
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:42,779
body so what do we need to do for the

263
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,510
basics we need to have a good balance of

264
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:47,189
everything we need to make sure on a

265
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:49,160
regular basis we're getting a balance of

266
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:53,880
our basic needs right sleep and water

267
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:56,010
food obviously good food I love my not

268
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,439
so good food but keep you some balance

269
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:59,850
and that exercise already mentioned sex

270
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,110
is a good one I'm married into a sex

271
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,120
therapist she's like you got to talk

272
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:04,740
more about the sex like no one wants to

273
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,000
hear about the sex she was yeah but you

274
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,560
got to talk about I'm like I'm not gonna

275
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,270
get in stage you talk about the sex so

276
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:14,969
if anyone sees her tell her I did but

277
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,560
your amount of sex is up to you guys the

278
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:18,420
important thing is is that each one of

279
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,719
these things is so vital and so critical

280
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:24,959
and when you skip them we really quickly

281
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:28,580
run into a hard state right we really

282
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:30,660
run into a situation where we're like

283
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,890
everything sucks and I hate everybody

284
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,500
and I'm gonna yell at someone about

285
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:35,850
spaghetti on Twitter it's it's one of

286
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,060
those situations where you gotta

287
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:40,350
maintain those basics so as I was

288
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,670
lifting and I was telling my friend

289
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,830
about this talk he's like you need to

290
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:46,229
have a slide that says hypocrite and

291
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:47,430
like wow you're right he's like no you

292
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,020
don't need to I'm like no I'm going to

293
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:51,410
because as I was putting together this

294
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:54,360
deck and thinking about these things

295
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:56,880
when I opened up PowerPoint I went okay

296
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,589
where's my abstract and I and I had been

297
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,920
traveling a bit I've been writing a bit

298
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:03,900
I had this thing about two months ago

299
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,880
where I was like I'm sick of all the

300
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,260
talks I give all the time so I know what

301
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,570
I'll do I'm going to submit new talks

302
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,840
and then they all got accepted and now I

303
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:14,050
got to write six new deck

304
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:18,700
for this month and I'm like ah can I

305
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:20,650
just recycle something so I could find

306
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,450
my abstract for this and I'm like here

307
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,860
I'm gonna be talking about mental health

308
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,360
and the importance of not burning out

309
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,860
and the importance of getting enough

310
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,630
sleep when I haven't got enough sleep I

311
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,010
took a red-eye flight I drew up to

312
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,210
Toronto I'm trying to put together this

313
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:33,310
deck in the hotel room at the last

314
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:35,770
minute and so I actually emailed the 44

315
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:37,329
kind of folks like hi funny irony I'm

316
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:40,329
speaking about burnout I don't remember

317
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:42,190
what I told you guys I was gonna say it

318
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:44,590
happens to the best of us right it

319
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:46,780
really does and I think the the key

320
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:50,410
thing that I tell a lot of the junior

321
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:52,079
folks that I manage is you've got to

322
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:55,360
realize that this is part of the gig

323
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:57,640
we're gonna rise we're gonna challenge

324
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,640
the the situation we're going to fight

325
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:03,010
off the criminals we're gonna stand on

326
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,020
the hill and survey the damage of the

327
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:07,780
red team that's tried to climb our Hill

328
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:10,270
hopefully we're gonna stand on the

329
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:13,660
parapets and as they put up the ladder

330
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:15,490
kick them down and go ha I patched that

331
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,900
server before you got there but we're

332
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,830
gonna do these things in the blue team

333
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,360
and I'm the red team of course we're

334
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,470
gonna break it and we're gonna find new

335
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,630
challenges we're gonna do all this stuff

336
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:24,820
and then two weeks later we're gonna

337
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:26,170
have not slept for a while right a month

338
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,210
goes by we're gonna be eating like

339
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:31,120
terrible and not exercising and we're

340
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:34,930
gonna burn out and it's so vitally

341
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,030
important I feel in this community in

342
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:38,739
this industry that when we burn out we

343
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:40,480
have compassion for ourselves that we

344
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:44,560
understand that it happens that we build

345
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:47,290
time in over the duration of our year of

346
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,510
our decade of our career to have that

347
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:51,819
burnout to have that moment where we can

348
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:54,790
just sit back and go okay I do this

349
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:56,140
myself I know what I did be reflective

350
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:58,990
and figure out what got me into the

351
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,920
situation email the 44 count or ghen

352
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:02,020
eyes errs in hope that they'll

353
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,959
graciously give me a math track up or

354
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:06,579
whatever it is in your field it's gonna

355
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,560
happen and we got to be sure that we're

356
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:12,640
ready for it and they were compassionate

357
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,709
with ourselves all right let's talk a

358
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:18,580
little bit about potholes and chipped

359
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:21,540
windows common things that go wrong so

360
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:23,880
just to recap we sing to the computers

361
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:26,230
and when we sing to the computer

362
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:29,260
that of course requires us to know

363
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:30,970
things right so what we do we drink can

364
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,529
we know things that's the cybersecurity

365
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:34,570
community if you don't drink I'm sorry

366
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:36,490
that's not indicate that you should

367
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:38,050
drink if this was Twitter there'd be 16

368
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,550
people tweeting me right now saying but

369
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,930
we don't drink and you need to be more

370
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:43,000
supportive people don't drink I don't

371
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:44,769
care what you drink drink water for all

372
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,260
I care but the point is we know things

373
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:49,480
this is what we do this is our value our

374
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:53,829
values to come in and apply creative

375
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:55,959
unique solutions one part of that is

376
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:57,609
especially if you're transitioning from

377
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:59,768
one career to another or starting your

378
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:03,010
career is to recognize you don't need to

379
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:06,640
go ahead and recreate everything right

380
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:08,680
away I love the way that painters

381
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,420
learned to paint I dated an artist once

382
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:14,349
she was fantastic until she drove me

383
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:16,930
nuts but it was fan fantastic watching

384
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:18,070
how she learned she would go to school

385
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:20,920
and they'd be like we're gonna learn how

386
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:22,600
to paint landscapes and they're b16

387
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,510
landscapes and she'd pick one and she'd

388
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,820
meticulously copy it and then she

389
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:32,319
meticulously you know paint a paint a

390
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:34,120
portrait and paint a bowl of fruit or

391
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,550
whatever may be and she Kathy and she

392
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:39,699
Kathy and she copy until she went from

393
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:41,890
copying the overall composition to

394
00:14:39,699 --> 00:14:43,899
figuring out what techniques work to

395
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:45,640
create that composition to copying the

396
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:47,050
individual pieces to putting those

397
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,449
pieces together in a new way

398
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:52,569
to creating new pieces of art and new

399
00:14:49,449 --> 00:14:54,099
compositions if you were to do that in

400
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,839
cybersecurity a lot of people say wait a

401
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,459
minute stop you're copying what someone

402
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:02,110
else did your recurring someone else's

403
00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:03,819
work I think it's paramount as we

404
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,440
develop our skills to be able to sit

405
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,959
back know you know what I'm gonna not be

406
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,699
innovative for six months I'm going to

407
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:11,349
reproduce some people's work so I can

408
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:13,029
understand it I saw a great talk at 40

409
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:16,660
for Kahn I'm gonna build that in my lab

410
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:19,449
I love the CTF I'm gonna follow the CTF

411
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:22,390
how-to and I'm gonna recreate the steps

412
00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:24,819
that they did those sort of things so

413
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:26,649
that you can begin to build those skills

414
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,899
and then duplicate them and get better

415
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:31,300
and better I was doing I was really into

416
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:33,640
CTFs like ten years ago now probably

417
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,349
five ten years ago and I built this

418
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,529
framework called the torii well if the

419
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:39,689
torii was was a bunch of ways of doing

420
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:41,519
simple things like all the different CTF

421
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:45,719
trucks right pulling things out of a

422
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:47,220
pcap doing basic decryption Caesars

423
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,810
shift and all that sort of stuff and

424
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:52,170
what I would do is I would take a

425
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:53,459
challenge every week and I try for XM on

426
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:55,079
time to figure it out once I couldn't

427
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:56,399
figure it out these challenges are in

428
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,229
CTF time by the way if you want to do

429
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,639
this I take the challenge do it for a

430
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:01,050
week if I couldn't figure out I pull

431
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,579
down the lesson learned and I'd

432
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:04,589
reproduce what they did and then I build

433
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:06,540
a script and build my own tool for it so

434
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,860
that when I got to the CTF side a whole

435
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,149
toolbox where I could just go oh that

436
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,800
reminds me with this that Ramones do

437
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:13,499
that no I think I saw that on this other

438
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,410
CTF and go ahead and do it it was a lot

439
00:16:13,499 --> 00:16:18,569
of fun I learned a ton doing that and I

440
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:20,189
think that type of approach can be very

441
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:21,839
very valuable especially when you're

442
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:24,748
starting out or especially when you're

443
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:27,499
switching jobs it's this concept of

444
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:31,410
practice practice makes excellence right

445
00:16:27,499 --> 00:16:33,779
welcome Gladwell popularized it as the

446
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:35,790
10,000 hour rule you need 10,000 hours

447
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:38,069
to be great at anything I really hope

448
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:40,019
that's not the case because I think the

449
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:41,819
average tenure of seaso is like 18

450
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:43,920
months right now so no one's ever gonna

451
00:16:41,819 --> 00:16:46,469
be great at being a seesaw

452
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,839
and we all jump around jobs every couple

453
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:50,910
of few years and the industry's changing

454
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,949
I don't know there's 10,000 hours but I

455
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:55,469
do think it is a matter of having

456
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:57,809
consistent discipline to practice and go

457
00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:00,899
ahead and build those skills and then

458
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:03,540
also knowing how to forget things I got

459
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:06,959
kind of sad the other day because it was

460
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:09,270
like the top 20 like dead and dying IT

461
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,439
skills and I always pull this up cuz I

462
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,569
gotta read them I'm terrible

463
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:14,250
so I pulled up I'm like yet made money

464
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:15,869
off that yet made money off that yep

465
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:18,619
used to love doing that yep yep yep yep

466
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:20,489
um they're all dead

467
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:22,438
because the minute we know something

468
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,030
it's dead right our skills keep

469
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:25,980
advancing our industry keeps advancing

470
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:28,168
and that's one of the things that makes

471
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,549
it fun so one anything we learn is gonna

472
00:17:28,169 --> 00:17:31,020
have a finite lifespan we just need to

473
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:33,360
deal with that and to anything we learn

474
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:36,510
is gonna be bound by our memory there's

475
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,908
this idea of a six-week half-life of

476
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:41,090
memory whatever I tell you today six

477
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:43,140
weeks half of it you might remember

478
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:45,629
really fascinating when you think about

479
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:47,730
it in terms of your work your job your

480
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:49,260
skillset if I'm doing it something every

481
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:51,240
single day I'm gonna remember it no

482
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,800
problem I take six weeks off I'm

483
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,080
forget half of it if I take a quarter

484
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,919
off or a year off I'm gonna be so rusty

485
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,230
it's not even funny

486
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,790
and that's really exciting for me as an

487
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:01,650
IT guy because I'm like I know Active

488
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:03,240
Directory and someone's like here fix

489
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,940
this problem I like that's not Server

490
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:10,770
2003

491
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:12,960
what's this PowerShell and however of

492
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:14,429
course a career that can get really hard

493
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:20,370
right it's like we're constantly

494
00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:22,020
reinventing ourselves every six weeks so

495
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:25,110
what are some of the things we face some

496
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:28,440
of the things that ships that may occur

497
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:31,260
in our windshield obviously all the

498
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,600
normal stuff being disorganized will hit

499
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:37,770
us having trouble prioritizing will hit

500
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,689
us not having good time management will

501
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:41,370
hit us I mentioned I was putting this

502
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:44,130
back together just a couple weeks ago

503
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,989
and I was so finishing it up last night

504
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:48,900
and my wife's like you always put things

505
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:50,610
off and I don't rush me woman I'm

506
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,860
waiting to the last minute on purpose

507
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,550
that's what I'm the best right when

508
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,760
you're the best

509
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:58,320
well torso is that but there's two parts

510
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,270
to that one obviously please don't wait

511
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,070
the last one I hate when I husband that

512
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:05,220
did all these drugs down the other part

513
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:06,840
of it is so what I think often times we

514
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:09,870
beat ourselves up because we're like oh

515
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:12,720
I read this article where super hacker X

516
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:14,969
is up every morning at 4 a.m. and hits

517
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,650
the gym and then reads 2 books and then

518
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,990
writes his blog article and then

519
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:21,809
recompiles a colonel and sends a patch

520
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:25,440
in and then hits the office at 9:00 I'm

521
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:26,540
like holy hell it's ten o'clock I'm just

522
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,510
getting out of bed

523
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:31,639
what what is going on again I think we

524
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:34,559
need to be compassionate with ourselves

525
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,660
ultimately a good career owner's manual

526
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,860
is very personal for you because you

527
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,660
need to know when you're strong and when

528
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:42,090
you're weak I used to do a survey every

529
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,710
day and it was just interesting me I

530
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:45,449
would ask myself like 6 different

531
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,880
performance questions I was trying to

532
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,559
spot some trends in data and after a

533
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,330
while I realized it's like I have two

534
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,620
really awesome weeks I'm like yeah top

535
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:54,030
of the world I can do anything I will

536
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:56,129
volunteer for anything I would even sign

537
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:58,170
up for ten new talks in one month and

538
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:00,000
then two months for two weeks so I'm

539
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:01,890
like I'm doing it I'm doing I'm doing it

540
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,030
in two weeks or I'm dead like my

541
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:07,740
performance just boom dead cuz I had

542
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:09,059
needed that time right and once I

543
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,850
realized that I started building my

544
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:14,220
schedule a lot more intelligently

545
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:17,159
so I'd have like more quiet weeks on my

546
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:19,650
down weeks knowing that on basis and

547
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,660
pulse productivity pulse of yourself to

548
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:25,230
really help you handle those sort of

549
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:27,210
things a lot of it will come back down

550
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:29,880

551
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:31,620

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,760

562
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,710

565
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,610
figure out healthcare in this United

566
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:59,880
States people so health care is a big

567
00:20:53,610 --> 00:21:03,659
deal this is bad and funny he's like the

568
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:05,340
doctor tells me I have ADHD and as a

569
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:09,230
manager that was my moment to be

570
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:12,899
compassionate as me I started laughing

571
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:14,550
I'm good he's like what do you mean good

572
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,910
I'm like you got a doctor's note to be

573
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:19,770
on my team bro you're in the right spot

574
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:21,480
because we all have hdhd or we all have

575
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:24,570
some problem with this right if we could

576
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,590
handle normal work and normal jobs we

577
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:27,870
wouldn't have gotten into computer

578
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:31,230
security where everything's crazy that's

579
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:33,270
why we're here but it's knowing where

580
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:35,250
our highs and lows are that allows us to

581
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:36,840
build the shock absorbers into our

582
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:39,960
career into our schedule that allows us

583
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,280
to succeed next thing I want to talk

584
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,710
about real quick is imposter syndrome

585
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,149
this is my favorite graph for imposter

586
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:46,530
syndrome I'd always give this to Mike

587
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:48,210
Adam II people like here's what you

588
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:49,530
think they know because you went to a

589
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:51,780
conference and they're brilliant and

590
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:52,770
here's what it really looks like because

591
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,360
they know a little of this and you know

592
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,660
that and they're faking a whole bunch of

593
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,830
other stuff and everything works

594
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:01,050
imposter syndrome is something that we

595
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:03,659
also all face right everyone gets

596
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:06,090
impostor syndrome it's just a nature of

597
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:07,740
of our career no matter how good I've

598
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:09,300
gotten no matter how high in the ranks

599
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,610
I've been I've always looked across to

600
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,970
my pyramid man here

601
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:16,030
good how are they holding it together

602
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:18,679
that guy's got a budget and everything I

603
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:20,149
got a spreadsheet he's over there go man

604
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:23,110
I got my budget but how come he's got a

605
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:25,280
business case because I know PowerPoint

606
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,870
this is one of those things right no

607
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,330
matter how high you get and I say

608
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:31,070
everyone's do does imposter syndrome but

609
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:32,360
don't get imposter syndrome if you don't

610
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:34,040
have imposter syndrome that's the other

611
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,659
side of it but I don't have good enough

612
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:39,139
imposter syndrome maybe I'm not in the

613
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:40,940
right field it's just the nature of our

614
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:44,780
of our industry and I think it's it's

615
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:46,580
good it is a indicator to me that when

616
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:49,220
you don't have imposter syndrome that

617
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:50,120
maybe you're in the wrong room so one of

618
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:52,370
those things like you don't want to be

619
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,809
the smartest person in the room right

620
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:55,520
you want to get to the room where other

621
00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:58,010
smart people are if you feel like you

622
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,799
really belong maybe it's time to start

623
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:02,179
looking for a new gig and also too

624
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,129
sometimes you are the imposter

625
00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:06,230
that's the other thing right and posture

626
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:07,549
syndrome is a syndrome when you think

627
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:09,350
you're the impostor I was speaking at a

628
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:10,910
conference and I landed and they picked

629
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:13,340
us up from the airport and here's like

630
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:15,320
the guy who invented a power show here's

631
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:17,360
like the guy who invented Ruby there's

632
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,010
the guy up front who does a magazine for

633
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,110
PHP and does it one of the major user

634
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:22,910
groups of Catholics is for it to people

635
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:24,799
on the on the side of me are arguing

636
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:26,510
about what it's like is it hard to do

637
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:29,210
your second O'Reilly book or your third

638
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:30,919
O'Reilly book and I'm like I don't I

639
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:33,049
didn't invent anything I'm not writing a

640
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:35,750
book right now but what am I doing here

641
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:36,830
and so we're at the speaker party I'm

642
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:39,169
hanging out with the guy who was doing

643
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:40,340
the track is a wasup track and I'm

644
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:42,559
hanging out with the chart guy was doing

645
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:44,689
the track and my story was about this

646
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:47,660
time that a bunch of hackers built the

647
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:49,250
CTF platform and one of my guys was a

648
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,080
secure web coder another guy was a pen

649
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:53,090
tester we hadn't followed SDL seals

650
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:55,699
great it was brilliant and went live and

651
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:57,168
we're hacked within 24 hours and how we

652
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,950
learn lessons from that and how you can

653
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,150
apply it to death

654
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,620
so that was my whole story the whole

655
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:02,990
story is just like this cute funny thing

656
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:05,689
that happened on the way to Chicago you

657
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:08,720
know it's not like I'm carrying cancer

658
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:10,700
and oh I just invented Ruby so I asked

659
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,799
the guy many bottles of wine into the

660
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:15,380
evening I'm like why am i year why am I

661
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:17,900
here and he had a little bit of a French

662
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:19,309
accent and I'm not gonna not gonna try

663
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:22,070
but there's something well you know wolf

664
00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:24,350
I don't know you and no one knows you

665
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:26,389
okay this is a good start it goes but

666
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:27,639
you did something will throw wasp and

667
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:31,940
you have lots of followers on Twitter

668
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:35,090
like ah okay so I really am an imposter

669
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:37,640
it's great I felt such a relief at that

670
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:39,199
moment I'm like good son syndrome when

671
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,700
you do feel like that it was really

672
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,050
awesome to me because I don't like okay

673
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,370
there's someone I started to be there

674
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:45,649
someone is where to be there's someone I

675
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:47,209
swear to be worth the gap between where

676
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:49,550
I'm at were there and how am I going to

677
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:50,930
close that gap it's a much better

678
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:52,790
conversation to have than me going

679
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:54,980
should I belong in this room I don't

680
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:56,480
know if I belong in this room do it will

681
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:58,610
they find out if I don't blow in like no

682
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,750
I don't belong hi they chose me because

683
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:01,520
of my Twitter follower account which

684
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:03,830
really isn't an impressive this is like

685
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,500
the worst vanity metric ever but I'm

686
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:09,649
gonna talk really relieving when you

687
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:13,760
actually have imposters not had just

688
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:16,580
assumed so some lessons here one is

689
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,830
embraced the stress short term stress is

690
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,970
really good for growth right it's the

691
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:21,800
long term we need to worry about I'll

692
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:24,740
get back to that but I think

693
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:26,930
fundamentally we need to get comfortable

694
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:29,000
being uncomfortable in in this industry

695
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:31,460
in this career as we're mentoring people

696
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,280
I would oftentimes bring folks in my

697
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:35,810
favorite story is of a waitress before

698
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,149
she joined us here as a waitress and so

699
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:40,820
she 'its degree she joined my team and

700
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:43,160
within two years she left to lead

701
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:44,720
compliance for one of the top five

702
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,300
credit unions in my home state in the

703
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,190
United States and what was phenomenal

704
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,409
about her is she was always

705
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:54,080
uncomfortable like you know the Hulk and

706
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:56,120
the Avengers were like my secret is I'm

707
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,280
always angry you know that moment that

708
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,810
was her she's like no I focused anxiety

709
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,430
I'm like what are you talking about

710
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,840
she's like I'm always anxious you're

711
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:05,150
always asking me to do this crazy stuff

712
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,740
I always think we can't do it right up

713
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:08,210
into the day we do it and then the

714
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,920
customer is happy and then I take a

715
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:13,130
breath and damn it wolf you asked me to

716
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:15,410
do it again like you know that's true

717
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:17,750
okay it's good all right focus that

718
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:19,250
anxiety keep going and she use that to

719
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,600
really propel her career forward I think

720
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:23,930
it's so important we get comfortable

721
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:25,610
being uncomfortable while back there is

722
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,810
a earth-2 program you guys probably

723
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:28,760
heard that a biome they've tried to

724
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:30,440
build a biome to simulate what it'd be

725
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,270
like to go to Mars they planted a whole

726
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,610
bunch of trees and they find these trees

727
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:35,590
in this biome and the trees kept falling

728
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:37,178
over like

729
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:38,889
how wide our tree ski falling over

730
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:40,659
there's no reason for these trees to

731
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:42,909
fall over they're native to this area

732
00:26:40,659 --> 00:26:44,559
everything should work fine why did they

733
00:26:42,909 --> 00:26:46,900
keep falling over they dug into it and

734
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,279
what happened was dug into it like

735
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,529
literally they looked at the root

736
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:52,330
structure and because there was not

737
00:26:50,529 --> 00:26:53,740
enough wind and stress in the tree it

738
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:57,879
was not developing deep enough root

739
00:26:53,740 --> 00:27:00,130
system and therefore absence distress it

740
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,809
couldn't stand up on its own and I think

741
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:03,820
that's a great metaphor for a lot of

742
00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:07,178
what we go through short term stress is

743
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:09,100
awesome focuses us gives us adrenaline

744
00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:10,000
gives us excitement makes this career

745
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:13,959
all worthwhile

746
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,909
and allows us to build deeper roots so

747
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,169
fundamentally fundamentally right we

748
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:19,600
need to concern ourselves I think as

749
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:23,919
elite athletes we need to consider

750
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:25,389
ourselves as mental athletes folks who

751
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,120
sing the computers folks who push

752
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:31,029
ourselves train regularly handle stress

753
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:34,029
like an athlete and and are

754
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:37,230
compassionate with ourselves when we're

755
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:38,740
down and getting our butts whipped and

756
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:40,929
compassionate with those in the

757
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:43,360
community and do so in a way that

758
00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:49,000
continues to push forward the art and

759
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:52,090
science that is cybersecurity all right

760
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,830
let's talk a little bit about some

761
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:57,189
traffic problems things you might run

762
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:59,199
into again we seem to the computers how

763
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:01,169
do we seem to the computers no longer

764
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,000
alone we seem to the computers and teams

765
00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:05,679
right and teams have a lot of different

766
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,039
things they've culture they have rhythm

767
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:11,770
they've cadance they have shared values

768
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:14,740
have personalities they have egos I

769
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:16,000
recently joined a group and the CEO

770
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,890
reached out to me he's like thank you so

771
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,600
much for joining our group we got a lot

772
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:21,490
of big personalities here a lot of big

773
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,559
egos I'm glad there's room for yours

774
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:27,250
I'm like you don't know how big my ego

775
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:29,470
is bro no it's true though even in our

776
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:33,130
industry we can kind of have quite a big

777
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:36,390
ego so part of being in cybersecurity is

778
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:40,240
to ask yourself you know is the team

779
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:43,570
positioning us in the right way Steve

780
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,970
Jobs once had this awesome comparison

781
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:48,189
for their early Macintosh's and he

782
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:48,860
called it - you know the bicycle because

783
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:51,380
his point was

784
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:54,199
you plotted out the speed of all mammals

785
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:56,750
humans were really really low compared

786
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:59,540
to everything else she does ostriches

787
00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:01,700
everything and but he put a man on a

788
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:03,590
bicycle you give him a mechanical

789
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,900
advantage something he's off like a

790
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:07,340
rocket and so his idea was the computer

791
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,870
should be like a bicycle for man's

792
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:12,320
intellect I like that analogy I like

793
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:13,879
that analogy but today almost everything

794
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,129
we do because of the growing

795
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:18,970
specialization cybersecurity is a team

796
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:21,140
sport so not only do we need the

797
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:23,809
mechanics and the advantage of

798
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:25,760
tool-making we also need that team

799
00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:27,080
working that team to support us that

800
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,100
sense a friendship that sense a

801
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,220
connection right

802
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:33,320
that feeling of fam there is this really

803
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:36,200
cool thing mentally this in-group bias

804
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:38,210
it's a it's a cognitive trick whatever

805
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,740
your in-group is you love them if you

806
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:41,750
think about some great teams you've been

807
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:45,049
on I'm like I would die for you bro I

808
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:47,179
was at a data center and we lost a

809
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:49,160
generator and that should've been a bad

810
00:29:47,179 --> 00:29:50,840
problem but the transfer switch didn't

811
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:53,059
work and that might not have been a bad

812
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:57,110
problem but the UPS was wired

813
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:59,960
incorrectly and those three things when

814
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:03,229
we blew out UPS's threw out like every

815
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:05,540
through cabinet and for the next six

816
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:08,000
weeks it was living hell because I was

817
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:10,159
very highly redundant which was great

818
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,140
but that meant like a firewall seemed

819
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,280
fine but then it would fail and a

820
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,020
failover did another one and we're like

821
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,760
okay we hope that one's good

822
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:18,200
we get the other one in place and then

823
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:21,290
flipped back were no notices

824
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:25,400
I just twelve node email cluster we lost

825
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:27,678
seven of the nodes it was a brutal six

826
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,809
weeks and towards the end of it as we're

827
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,240
rebuilding it I had in my office a cot

828
00:30:29,809 --> 00:30:34,129
and I was taking a nap in the cot and I

829
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,480
got off off the cot because of right

830
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:37,100
around the time it said alarm because

831
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:40,070
some files are moving the files should

832
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:41,540
have been completed by then and I got up

833
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:43,520
cuz alarm went off I got a cup of coffee

834
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:45,049
and looked around I had one guy sleeping

835
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,580
on a beanbag at another guy on his

836
00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:49,549
computer just like this I don't know if

837
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:52,490
he's alive or dead and I'm like I would

838
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:54,379
I would go to the mat for these people

839
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:56,030
right now right I felt so close these

840
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,980
people I'm like these are these are my

841
00:30:56,030 --> 00:31:00,290
brothers in arms

842
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:02,929
and that is a great feeling when you're

843
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:05,059
in a team and you face down the mammoth

844
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:07,580
and you triumph it is just a phenomenal

845
00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:10,580
feeling and I hope we all have that

846
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:12,290
feeling sometimes when you're facing

847
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:13,668
down the mammoth and someone trips you

848
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:15,409
because maybe the mammals will step on

849
00:31:13,669 --> 00:31:17,419
you and not them that's such a good

850
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:19,190
feeling when you're gonna team where

851
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:21,440
they're not supporting you not such a

852
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:25,270
good time well you've got a leader whose

853
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:27,950
values don't match yours not good at all

854
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:29,840
so fundamentally we got to look at four

855
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:31,730
different valves I believe we got to

856
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,270
make sure that our culture fix fits the

857
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:36,830
company culture we oftentimes become the

858
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:41,299
average of the people we spend time with

859
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:43,280
so are we happy with the people in this

860
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:44,600
organization if we become more like them

861
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,918
are we gonna be feel good about

862
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,709
ourselves or we're gonna feel like we

863
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:51,470
need a shower you know what I mean our

864
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:53,720
value is reflected in theirs this is one

865
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:55,280
I always always ask myself right before

866
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,650
I leave a company are my values

867
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,428
reflected and do I feel good looking at

868
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,570
myself in the mirror every morning

869
00:31:58,429 --> 00:32:01,130
because of what I'm doing at this

870
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:02,870
company or do I feel like I'm

871
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:06,110
compromising myself my friendships my

872
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:08,299
integrity are the tasks good do we like

873
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:09,949
the songs we get to sing and this is a

874
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:11,540
diversity good I mentioned earlier my

875
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:13,429
brother-in-arms because they're all like

876
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:16,580
middle-aged white guys and we loved it

877
00:32:13,429 --> 00:32:18,140
but as I built more teams and had more

878
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:20,480
exposure I'm like man that was not a

879
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:21,919
very diverse team and I love a good set

880
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,280
of diversity because it brings different

881
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:27,169
points of view different perspectives

882
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:28,910
and when I was building my Academy teams

883
00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:30,950
I was always had an eye for that because

884
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:33,020
the conversations were much better much

885
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:35,320
richer I'm a very firm believer that

886
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:38,540
high performance teams are diverse teams

887
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:40,309
so these four things we need to make

888
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:42,530
sure all the time those inputs line up

889
00:32:40,309 --> 00:32:43,910
with our direction who we want to be and

890
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:46,280
where we want to go and what's

891
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:49,850
interesting is lots of companies have

892
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:53,090
lots of different values and I honestly

893
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:54,799
don't even know that it matters one

894
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:57,439
culture over another one set of values

895
00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:00,320
over another with with exceptions you

896
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,270
know if it's like oh come work for our

897
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,909
company and and our values are we're

898
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:07,940
gonna sell your blood no that's not a

899
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:09,820
good value but with some exceptions I

900
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:12,550
think what honestly matters is

901
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:14,439
that they become a tool for self

902
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:16,149
selection finding your group where you

903
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,770
really feel like you belong we can grow

904
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:21,960
where you can become the person you want

905
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:26,800
to be soft skills are hard right

906
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:29,380
everything is a soft skill fundamentally

907
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:31,659
we need to really work on building up

908
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:33,520
teamwork collaboration skills it's an

909
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:35,620
area that I focus in a ton on when I was

910
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:37,180
mentoring people it's an area that a lot

911
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:39,310
of us growing up didn't have to worry

912
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:40,990
about because that was the one-man show

913
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:42,940
when I was at a hospital running i.t

914
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:44,980
nights he's good for a hospital I was

915
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:46,210
pretty much it right I didn't my team

916
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,860
work was going hey wolf do you want

917
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:48,340
coffee I would love coffee and then I go

918
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,409
get coffee

919
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:52,540
you know it's great communication was

920
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:55,450
phenomenal we are really all on the same

921
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:56,920
page with me myself and I but you could

922
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,180
do that back in the day right as long as

923
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:00,460
you know how to network and write some

924
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:02,350
code and stand up some computers you

925
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:04,750
could do the whole show those days are

926
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:06,429
long long gone so part of it is building

927
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:08,830
up good teamwork and good collaboration

928
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:09,850
skills another thing is making sure we

929
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:11,230
are stronger together

930
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:13,989
we're not stronger together you got a

931
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:16,929
gtfo all right get the eff out however

932
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:19,600
you want to say it but the point is this

933
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:22,000
is a diagnostic tool do I feel in this

934
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,259
tribe that I belong here do I feel in

935
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,090
this tribe that I'm becoming a better

936
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:26,830
person do I feel this tribe maybe a

937
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:28,420
little bit of impostor syndrome it's

938
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:30,580
gonna push me forward and make me

939
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:33,070
stronger do I feel like I'm running with

940
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:35,739
a pack that's gonna help me become more

941
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:40,960
competitive if not we need to select a

942
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:42,729
different team all right let's talk a

943
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:48,190
little bit about Road feel right driving

944
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:51,699
value delivering some skills there's

945
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:53,980
always a risk of feeling disconnected if

946
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:55,389
you plugged in and you're feeling good

947
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:57,130
you're gonna get recognition right you

948
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:58,450
have sense of respect if since the

949
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:00,250
status around the work you do you're

950
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:02,410
proud of the work you do I think we've

951
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:04,200
all have had times in our careers we

952
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:07,480
then perform it what we thought was peak

953
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:09,549
value and our boss is like why did you

954
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,380
do that task it doesn't matter or

955
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:14,650
they're like oh yeah we really support

956
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:16,930
James over here because she is awesome

957
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:19,270
you know John well okay keep keep

958
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:22,120
patching servers like but I splashed

959
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:24,009
everything and we avoided what took down

960
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,480
Equifax and they're like yeah okay

961
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:28,450
that's that's lovely I'm glad he patched

962
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:29,710
a server I reported to a CFO one day and

963
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:31,060
I remember watching his office I was all

964
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,440
problem like because I just heard about

965
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,970
risk management and I'm like all right

966
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,290
as the security officer this is great

967
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:37,540
we're gonna take a risk-based approach

968
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:39,840
I'm gonna start doing risk management

969
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:44,160
and he looked at me

970
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:46,960
it's like wolf we trade in Wall Street

971
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:50,160
again entire floor phd's above you doing

972
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:53,440
risk management across stocks worldwide

973
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:55,290
what are you talking about like mental

974
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,430
note don't talk about risk management I

975
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:58,630
am talking about Security's like yeah

976
00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:00,160
good just keep things running is

977
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:03,250
everything up okay good

978
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,480
this has been a great meeting we need to

979
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:06,130
make sure that we're actually plugged in

980
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,020
right we need to make sure too that

981
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:11,980
we're able to stand out from the crowd

982
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:14,680
and the fundamental question is is how

983
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:19,960
will you stand out and part of that is

984
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:22,330
finding the tasks that only you do well

985
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,770
I think if you look at people who are

986
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:25,810
top of their field they're doing

987
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:28,390
something that only they can do and

988
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:30,100
contribute value that only they have it

989
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:32,589
is very difficult to get to this point

990
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:34,360
but it's a matter of regularly asking

991
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:36,610
yourself am i doing something in this

992
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,440
team adding value that can be replaced

993
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:40,780
with any of my other teammates or am i

994
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,640
contributing unique value am i doing

995
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:44,410
something that only I can do because of

996
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,150
I'm wired for it because I love it

997
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,230
because I got the skills in it because I

998
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:49,150
got the background right because I know

999
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:53,500
my productivity pulsed it fits the way I

1000
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:57,040
work or am I just like 70 other people

1001
00:36:53,500 --> 00:37:01,200
and trying to gauge that and make that

1002
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:04,060
distinction is is a ongoing effort

1003
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:09,370
there's a lot of tasks that need to be

1004
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:12,549
done this is a C so mind map and was it

1005
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:14,080
from Dow security and I used to use this

1006
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:15,520
when I was doing CSO coaching I'm like

1007
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,170
all right here you go here's what you

1008
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,540
need to do it's all simple just do that

1009
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:21,220
stuff and the guy you have no idea I

1010
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:22,779
have no way to do all that stuff I

1011
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:26,500
you can't do all that you don't have

1012
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:27,400
time no I've got like 60 hours no week

1013
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,619
maximum

1014
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,630
alright let's step back and let's figure

1015
00:37:29,619 --> 00:37:33,190
out a different way to do this and one

1016
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:36,249
of the things we talk about is how do we

1017
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:38,259
take the tasks in this a to figure out

1018
00:37:36,249 --> 00:37:39,609
what tasks that as I'm talking about

1019
00:37:38,259 --> 00:37:41,259
Caesar what tasks the seaso is really

1020
00:37:39,609 --> 00:37:43,450
good at and they love so let's start

1021
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,859
with the tasks you love I'm a big fan of

1022
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:45,730
outsourcing boring if you don't love it

1023
00:37:44,859 --> 00:37:47,470
don't do it

1024
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:50,170
delegate it figure someone else to

1025
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:51,848
partner with those be what tasks on this

1026
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:53,230
actually line up with what the team's

1027
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:56,140
mission is and what the corporation's

1028
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:57,789
mission is at my own position we used to

1029
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,618
talk about this in terms of rocks you

1030
00:37:57,789 --> 00:38:01,420
guys are probably heard this analogy

1031
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:03,549
right you put the sand in first and then

1032
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:04,900
you put the rocks in then you can't fill

1033
00:38:03,549 --> 00:38:07,119
up the whole jar rocks being your big

1034
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:09,400
priority so you put the rocks in first

1035
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,960
and then you can fit more stuff in you

1036
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,240
can get more tasks done it's great

1037
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,710
sounds motivational it's exciting this

1038
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,749
is the way that my old team used to do

1039
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:18,519
it by Coralie rocks you may have

1040
00:38:16,749 --> 00:38:20,828
quarterly goals you may have quarterly

1041
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:22,629
okay ours it doesn't matter in your

1042
00:38:20,829 --> 00:38:24,220
corporation there's someone who can say

1043
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:26,890
here's the top five things my company is

1044
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:28,779
doing right now you get awesome and then

1045
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:29,440
go back and go okay based on those top

1046
00:38:28,779 --> 00:38:31,690
five things

1047
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,009
what are these line up and how do these

1048
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:34,720
things tell that story that we're

1049
00:38:33,009 --> 00:38:36,400
supporting those top five things or

1050
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:39,308
three things or two things or whatever

1051
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,200
maybe tying those threads between

1052
00:38:39,309 --> 00:38:42,670
overall matters to the corporation to

1053
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,439
what we're doing and tagging those

1054
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:46,509
threads to what we're really good at to

1055
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,220
what we're doing allows you to create a

1056
00:38:46,509 --> 00:38:52,390
job description that's really distinct

1057
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:53,950
and supports your unique advantages all

1058
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:58,359
right so what ultimately we want to

1059
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:59,769
build a team and build yourself so that

1060
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:02,380
you're doing their tasks to support the

1061
00:38:59,769 --> 00:39:04,598
company goals support the team goals and

1062
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:09,039
position you to have a better career in

1063
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:11,079
the long term and to put it in a

1064
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:13,660
different way we need to align your

1065
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:15,220
values with your verbs right what does I

1066
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,660
do what do I care about and how do those

1067
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,069
things come together and how is that

1068
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:19,660
positioned me to be different and unique

1069
00:39:18,069 --> 00:39:24,400
in the organization in the community and

1070
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:27,038
to give back you one more sip of water

1071
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:31,900
and get parched so we're gonna talk

1072
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:35,950
about worn tires rebalance every 10,000

1073
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:37,809
kilometers of course ISM a nod to tires

1074
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:38,939
or if you don't rebalance your tires you

1075
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:41,560
end up wearing

1076
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:45,400
you end up wearing them out you know

1077
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:46,720
causing problems for all you drive so

1078
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,160
what are some of those things that would

1079
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,069
build up over time and cause problems

1080
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:53,529
one is I talked about embrace distress

1081
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:57,040
but what about embrace to stop short

1082
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:59,080
term stress is awesome this is exciting

1083
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,180
we've got a deadline we got a big

1084
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:03,730
production coming we got a big software

1085
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:05,109
release coming we've got a compliance

1086
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:06,520
out of coming I know a lot of you were

1087
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:08,710
like a complaints I'm not that exciting

1088
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,420
listen to me sorry I give anyone like

1089
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:12,760
trigger warnings I should have given it

1090
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:13,990
right before I said compliance but but

1091
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,190
we got something coming we're going to

1092
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:16,209
do it we're gonna do the thing we're

1093
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:18,370
gonna get the team together we're gonna

1094
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:20,440
make it happen it's exciting short term

1095
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:23,230
stress is great long term stress is

1096
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:25,930
killer long term stress is I think I

1097
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:28,720
think and I'd posit why in cybersecurity

1098
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:30,040
were not often strategic right we're

1099
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,120
very much here's the thing we're fixing

1100
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,140
here's this thing we're fixing right now

1101
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,569
because this is what we can do right now

1102
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:38,470
short term stress awesome long term

1103
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:40,870
stress depletes us it focuses us to the

1104
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:43,060
point of being unable to be creative it

1105
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:45,520
focuses us to the point of on being

1106
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:47,950
unable to learn short-term or long-term

1107
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:50,020
stress is one of the things that often

1108
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:52,330
times will someone over the long

1109
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:53,890
duration of your career because you're

1110
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:56,049
no longer able to absorb information

1111
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:56,859
going back to that half-life of memory

1112
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:59,080
six weeks

1113
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:00,280
that means six weeks of I have stress I

1114
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,540
haven't absorbed anything I'm already

1115
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:04,540
starting to loose and fall further

1116
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:07,390
behind people or more rested more able

1117
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:09,130
learn and more able to ingest I told you

1118
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:11,310
about the trees in the dome another

1119
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:14,230
experiment was done the sixties all

1120
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:17,259
really interesting psychological studies

1121
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:18,670
were done in the 60s I'm sure that I say

1122
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:20,020
that and my wife would tell me she's

1123
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:22,660
she's a therapist he'll go

1124
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:26,620
yeah because they didn't have like any

1125
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:28,960
ethical rules back then I'm not sure but

1126
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:31,120
they like gave college kids LSD and that

1127
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,160
was a study and that was cool so yeah

1128
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,810
then we go back and forth on this but

1129
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:37,870
one of the says those done in the 60s

1130
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:39,640
was done with cute little animals cute

1131
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:41,980
little fuzzy animals they put them in a

1132
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:44,770
warm space they put him gave him enough

1133
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:46,840
water him enough food bedding lovely

1134
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:48,030
little cute low animal and then they

1135
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:50,950
stressed it out with strobing lights

1136
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:52,420
that's all they did everything was fine

1137
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:54,339
this animal should be

1138
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:55,630
so okay this was stressed out with

1139
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:57,400
sterling lights which would prevent it

1140
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:59,410
from sleeping and leave it in a stress

1141
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:02,250
State and they were actually able to

1142
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:05,830
sicken weaken and in some cases kill

1143
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:08,800
animals from just prolonged stress from

1144
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:10,660
a light so what happens if we're in a

1145
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,220
sock getting ticket after ticket after

1146
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:14,529
ticket after ticket after ticket and

1147
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:17,200
seeing on the big boards so-and-so

1148
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:19,000
hacked so-and-so all saw hacked you're

1149
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,200
not keeping up and seen the news feeds

1150
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,550
from other pundits going well security

1151
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:24,220
people clearly have their head in the

1152
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:26,710
sand right that's our strobe light it's

1153
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:28,600
terrible it's a long term stress can get

1154
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:30,910
us we do not only embrace the stress

1155
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:35,650
short term we need to embrace the stop

1156
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:37,480
longer term all right it's okay to

1157
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:40,330
become depleted over the course of the

1158
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:43,330
day but if that is like your quarter

1159
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:47,590
we're in a really bad spot but we didn't

1160
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:49,540
know a how to put our phone in airplane

1161
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:51,910
mode so that we don't run on the battery

1162
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:54,400
and be what it is that ultimately

1163
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:57,490
recharges us what is it that will charge

1164
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,450
up ourselves our careers energize us and

1165
00:42:57,490 --> 00:43:00,850
get us back in the game

1166
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:02,200
and see we need to know the warning

1167
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:04,240
lights the things that are actually

1168
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:06,310
causing us to during our batteries

1169
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:08,859
here's some warning lights and some some

1170
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:09,549
things that you should do physiological

1171
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:12,100
effects

1172
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:13,840
I gained a ton of weight before I burned

1173
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:15,700
out I'm a little bit heavy at the moment

1174
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,780
now don't think I mean I know I am you

1175
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:19,210
can pick on me it's okay

1176
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:21,940
but I came like I can't it's like 40

1177
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:24,010
pounds in six months because I was in

1178
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:25,750
this stress job and I was building this

1179
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:28,080
sock no striving myself into the ground

1180
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:30,190
right physiological effects like that

1181
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:32,650
having to go the doctors all the time

1182
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:36,240
stress related injuries those are things

1183
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:39,820
we need to balance our lives or gtfo

1184
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:42,549
non-competitive compensation they're not

1185
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:46,120
paying us enough when you get a raise or

1186
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:47,400
GTFO if you stay if as an industry if a

1187
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:49,839
bunch of us continue to keep

1188
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,860
non-competitive compensation our

1189
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,550
employers of course are going to

1190
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:57,040
continue to not pay us competitively

1191
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:58,390
lack of training if the position you're

1192
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,220
in doesn't provide training

1193
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:01,810
opportunities downtown for training

1194
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:03,700
budget for training those sort of things

1195
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:06,180
you need to make either make your own

1196
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:07,350
time by setting your schedule and

1197
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:12,810
Oh seeing that with your leader and your

1198
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:14,310
team or gtfo lack of a career path if

1199
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:17,970
your career path does yeah I hope you

1200
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:19,650
stay that's not a career path and that

1201
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:20,790
may be because there isn't a career path

1202
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:22,440
in your organization that's a

1203
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:23,670
conversation with your leader or it may

1204
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,380
be because your career path is

1205
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:27,330
ultimately going to take you to another

1206
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:30,570
organization so in which case you need

1207
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:33,299
to level up and then GTFO poor teamwork

1208
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:35,010
I mention this earlier if your team is

1209
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:36,540
not supporting you if you don't gel with

1210
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:37,890
your team if your team's not driving you

1211
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:40,440
if you don't feel like your team is a

1212
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:42,569
little bit better than you can you get

1213
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:45,360
some training there's plenty of books

1214
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:46,860
out there to work better with others I

1215
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:49,470
think soft skills is an area where we

1216
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:52,430
can all improve on and if you still do

1217
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:56,520
that and you're still in problems gtfo

1218
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:57,779
poor leadership maybe it's a matter of

1219
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,070
motional intelligence maybe it's a

1220
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:01,530
matter of dealing with your boss better

1221
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:04,830
every time I have not liked my leader I

1222
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:07,860
have left very quickly because they

1223
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:09,150
define your tasks they define where

1224
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:09,990
you're going I mean if you're not

1225
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:13,940
getting along with you later

1226
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:13,939
you either make it work or gtfo

1227
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:19,710
similarly if there's no appreciation of

1228
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:22,860
recognition for what you're doing if you

1229
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:25,230
can't tie your tasks to what you're good

1230
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:27,330
at and what only you can uniquely do and

1231
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:30,740
tie those tasks to what the company is

1232
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:33,569
rocks quarterly goals ok ours are and

1233
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:34,589
what you're achieving then you're not

1234
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:35,240
going to get that appreciation

1235
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:37,530
recognition

1236
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:41,879
either reset your expectations about

1237
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:47,340
what your job is or gtfo misaligned

1238
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:48,870
values I had a client and he came to me

1239
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:50,070
and is like what are we doing this for

1240
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:52,170
this isn't working

1241
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:53,940
and I guess not working we need to pull

1242
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:55,950
the plug say I have this other company

1243
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:57,870
that can do the work I trust them

1244
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:58,980
they're already in here I'm like yeah I

1245
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:02,009
don't want to hurt your career I've

1246
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:02,850
known you for 10 years you need to you

1247
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:05,190
know work with this other company

1248
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:06,240
alright glad we talked I went back to my

1249
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:07,890
leadership and look look

1250
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,270
values are we do what's right for the

1251
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,650
customers right for the customers walk

1252
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:11,750
away from the deal no no we can't do

1253
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:14,570
that we do lose money

1254
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:15,920
but we're entering this relationship we

1255
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:17,510
can't deliver we don't have the people

1256
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,650
we don't have the skills but we got to

1257
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:24,100
make it work because we can't lose the

1258
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:27,320
money okay all right good gtfo

1259
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:28,430
all right fundamentally these are your

1260
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,810
warning lights and I think it's very

1261
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:32,060
important we look for these warning

1262
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:34,580
lights regularly it's very easy as our

1263
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:36,890
battery is dying to overlook them it's

1264
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:40,040
very easy to take the teenager approach

1265
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:41,810
to your car and say okay yeah I got a

1266
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:44,240
warning late I'll just tape over it it's

1267
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:48,650
cool I keep driving I didn't really do

1268
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:50,660
my brakes I was doing consulting work I

1269
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:52,430
didn't have much money and I literally

1270
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:54,560
had tape over one of my warning lights

1271
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:55,940
and my brakes went out in rush hour and

1272
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,480
I had to drive home with the emergency

1273
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:59,780
brake

1274
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:03,170
short term stress is great I never again

1275
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:05,630
ignored a warning light Wow is that

1276
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:07,280
scary so you need to make sure you're

1277
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:09,350
looking at those in taking care of it I

1278
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:12,320
don't - need to protect yourself right

1279
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:15,049
your greatest kurasov is you and only

1280
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:17,570
you can know what works well for you how

1281
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:18,800
you work and where you need to go and

1282
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:20,720
you need to make sure you're taking care

1283
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,190
of that over the longer term we're gonna

1284
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,419
give you a couple tools for that and

1285
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:24,940
then give you the career owner's guide

1286
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:31,330
and we'll call it a day

1287
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:34,370
so some tools one two three relax

1288
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:36,380
recharge and relearn on the relaxed side

1289
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:39,319
it's all about distressing taking care

1290
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:41,240
of the basics I'm doing what is good for

1291
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:44,030
you in a toolbox

1292
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:45,620
I would oftentimes sit down with my

1293
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:47,540
academy team and say alright how do you

1294
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:50,299
relax what is working for you I learned

1295
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:51,380
the term retail therapy from one of one

1296
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:53,540
of the ladies who worked for me I'm like

1297
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:54,710
I've never felt relaxed spending money

1298
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,670
but that's if that works for you that's

1299
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:58,430
awesome

1300
00:47:55,670 --> 00:48:00,710
I like massages I'm a big fan of massage

1301
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:01,930
I get a massage every month every couple

1302
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:04,430
weeks when things are very tight

1303
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:05,509
meditation works obviously therapy works

1304
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:07,490
if you're in therapy

1305
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:11,150
I hear it's wonderful my wife's a

1306
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:12,290
therapist she's very Pro therapy if that

1307
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:14,360
works for you do that

1308
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:16,670
taking down days I'm gonna come back to

1309
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:18,200
this idea of down days in a minute and

1310
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:20,360
then taking time away right making sure

1311
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:22,040
you actually take that PTO in America

1312
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,390
we're terrible at this I don't know

1313
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,500
maybe you guys are much better at more

1314
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:24,830
enlightened you can tell me after this

1315
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,810
talk

1316
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:32,180
but we oftentimes like God I didn't take

1317
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:34,270
PTO for two years I am awesome okay how

1318
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:37,009
are you doing I'm fine I'm fine

1319
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:40,759
what's your risk appetite bourbon okay

1320
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:44,330
so good um in hiking there's this

1321
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:45,590
council called zero days and in hackers

1322
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:47,150
there's this concept of zero there so

1323
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:48,530
oftentimes I would say something like we

1324
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:50,660
had this conversation on the cut I'd

1325
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:52,190
take a zero day and I go okay

1326
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:53,839
and then they remind the right guy right

1327
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:55,130
so I need to write an exploit maybe if I

1328
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:57,890
give it to Apple I get a million dollars

1329
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:59,950
and that would definitely help my mental

1330
00:48:57,890 --> 00:48:59,950
health

1331
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:05,840
hiking there's this idea that if you're

1332
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:07,670
going to do a long-distance for example

1333
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:09,890
the Appalachian Trail is about six-month

1334
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:13,130
total hike have been hiking it in

1335
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:16,009
section since I was 18 and you if you're

1336
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:17,900
gonna go the long distance you need to

1337
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:19,760
have a down day so you can recharge the

1338
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:22,040
zero day is no miles on the trail zero

1339
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,360
day is you know I went far enough enough

1340
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:25,670
food in my pack and the water in my pack

1341
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:28,310
I'm going to sit rest recharge and do it

1342
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:30,860
again we need I believe to apply that to

1343
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:32,750
InfoSec so that when we reach that peak

1344
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:35,090
were like a day off would be really good

1345
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:36,740
will help me recharge get my head back

1346
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:38,090
in the aims and I can learn and handle

1347
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:42,709
those problems we need to take those

1348
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:45,650
zero days then on the charge side what

1349
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:46,790
what energizes you hacker conferences I

1350
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:48,320
love going to these things to come back

1351
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:50,210
I got a million what ideas I can build

1352
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:52,550
it on my lab will be great six weeks

1353
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:54,800
later I'm a rack but it happens action

1354
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:56,060
movies work for me too I love the

1355
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,710
Mission Impossible movies they are

1356
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:59,390
brainless but I put them on the plane

1357
00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:03,050
and I land that plane and I had the mi6

1358
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:04,759
you know music and my earphones is a

1359
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:07,430
walking off the planet I go yeah let's

1360
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:11,540
do this like wolf it's a spreadsheet I'm

1361
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:13,940
like yes but I'm gonna you know you go

1362
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:16,279
on those things and then as we have this

1363
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:18,560
this cadence also know how you can

1364
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:20,000
relearn right was it take to get your

1365
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:24,230
head in the game to do those sort of

1366
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,950
things I did several years ago burn out

1367
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:27,650
really hard

1368
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:29,600
I built a sock I built a red team I

1369
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:32,180
built a man service provider that was

1370
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:34,430
doing monitoring and vulnerability

1371
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:37,220
management and I built it all in a very

1372
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:39,348
short period of time and about you

1373
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:41,390
a half I was just ran myself into the

1374
00:50:39,349 --> 00:50:43,940
ground and actually took about three

1375
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:45,830
months off it was great great anyone can

1376
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:48,050
take three months off I get that but it

1377
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:51,020
was so awesome because I wake up I'd hit

1378
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:54,140
the gym I go swimming a ticket nap naps

1379
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:56,270
are awesome Pro naps don't mean to brag

1380
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:58,040
but I've great staying power for naps

1381
00:50:56,270 --> 00:51:01,130
I'm always up for a nap I go for a long

1382
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:04,310
time but not in then I will go on hey

1383
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:05,810
what's up my friends right so I I added

1384
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:07,310
all these things in and then I would

1385
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:09,349
study a little bit in the evening go to

1386
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:10,820
bed and do it again and man after those

1387
00:51:09,349 --> 00:51:12,500
three months I was ready to take on the

1388
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:16,700
world because I brought all these

1389
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:21,440
elements together and recharge myself so

1390
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:24,609
was this look as a owner's manual one

1391
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:28,040
thing I keep talking about GTF alright

1392
00:51:24,609 --> 00:51:29,359
it beats coping because it frees you up

1393
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:31,730
to do something that you can really

1394
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:34,040
excel at something really fits you I'm

1395
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:35,810
not suggesting we always quit but I am

1396
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:37,279
suggesting that as an industry we need

1397
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:39,009
to make sure that we draw a clear line

1398
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,960
of what we will do and what we won't do

1399
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:44,869
and hold that line both for our own

1400
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:46,550
sanity our own growth as well as for

1401
00:51:44,869 --> 00:51:47,990
everyone else in this room because the

1402
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:49,910
minute and organization is like I could

1403
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:51,770
take care advantage of these people then

1404
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:53,629
we all get brought down writes our gets

1405
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:57,020
brought down all the flexibility we have

1406
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:58,520
gets brought down but don't quit over

1407
00:51:57,020 --> 00:52:01,670
short-term issues right short-term is

1408
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:03,770
good short-term is awesome it's not fun

1409
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:05,599
it hurts it's scary but it builds

1410
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:07,369
character it helps you grow it's the

1411
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:09,230
longer-term that you need to work for so

1412
00:52:07,369 --> 00:52:10,790
it's balancing those two window I need

1413
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:12,980
to do you know check my engine or window

1414
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:14,690
I just need to add some oil and knowing

1415
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:16,520
where to draw those lines and I think

1416
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:20,330
fundamentally only you can draw the

1417
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:22,369
lines for yourself what do you do or

1418
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:24,290
longer-term so weakly the basics already

1419
00:52:22,369 --> 00:52:26,180
talked abouts eat well prepare for the

1420
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:28,040
week ahead do the things do all the

1421
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:29,810
things make sure there's time you're

1422
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:31,099
scheduled to de-stress and make sure

1423
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:32,450
this time your schedule somewhere in

1424
00:52:31,099 --> 00:52:34,640
there that pumps you up and energizes

1425
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:36,710
you and then do a weekly review certain

1426
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,330
ex Crump's or like agile do this friends

1427
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:41,480
do cycles if you look at my calendar

1428
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:43,279
it's like two days of meeting with

1429
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:44,810
people because that energizes me two

1430
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,430
days of doing deep work where I'm just

1431
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:47,930
focusing and I'm doing the things and

1432
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:49,490
then one day we're on like command I'm

1433
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:51,980
toast I'm I'm

1434
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:56,240
catching up an email expense reports are

1435
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:57,710
a thing on a monthly basis you're doing

1436
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,060
all those things but review the stress

1437
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:01,040
keep track of it was a short-term

1438
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:02,869
stressor or have I been now stressed for

1439
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,490
two months what's going on

1440
00:53:02,869 --> 00:53:06,680
check your warning lights check for

1441
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:08,509
those things and make sure you're noting

1442
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:10,549
them when they happen and then schedule

1443
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:13,340
your zero days what is what day and your

1444
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:14,960
month or a couple days are you doing a

1445
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:17,240
downtime where you're giving yourself a

1446
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:19,420
breather to catch up on tasks the hiker

1447
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:22,160
version of course not the hacker version

1448
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:24,020
quarterly check your health make sure

1449
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:26,629
you're still in good shape everything's

1450
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:28,520
going well review your accomplishment

1451
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:31,040

1453
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,490

1454
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:36,200

a few weeks so review your learning you

1459

figure out what you're going to do and

1460
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:47,000
ask yourself as your is your work being

1461
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:49,160
recognized and are your values being

1462
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:53,180
supported subvert of do you feel good

1463
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:57,500
still are you excited or those are

1464
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:59,868
things keeping up annually job reviews

1465
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:02,300
we all have them but how often do we

1466
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:04,960
review our employers I think it's so

1467
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:08,540
vital we sit down with ourselves

1468
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:11,960
definitely with a peer preferably with

1469
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:14,390
the leader ideally and say okay how am I

1470
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:16,490
feeling about this job where am I going

1471
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:18,799
where's this taking me let me review the

1472
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:20,810
company in the position if I had to

1473
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:23,840
apply for this again would I fly for

1474
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:26,180
right now does it support your long-term

1475
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:29,660
career path where's the teamwork taking

1476
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:33,169
you where does management leave you and

1477
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:36,440
decade Lea I don't know routinely every

1478
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:41,240
few years ask yourself where are you now

1479
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:42,500
right when I was 25 years ago my career

1480
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:44,959
goals were a lot different than they are

1481
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:46,310
today and every few years I'm just

1482
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,140
conscious stepping back knowing where

1483
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:51,080
where should I go next where is the

1484
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:52,640
market going where my passions going

1485
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:54,740
what do I used to be really excited

1486
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:57,350
about what do I not care about anymore I

1487
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:59,209
could care less about writing code and I

1488
00:54:57,350 --> 00:55:00,490
think 20-year old me would not believe

1489
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:07,670
that

1490
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:10,580
so with that the point is make sure you

1491
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:12,320
got the right tools new toolbox make

1492
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:13,670
sure you're doing regular maintenance on

1493
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:15,620
yourself and your career

1494
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:17,660
I hope these I've given you some ideas

1495
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:20,810
on how to go about doing those sort of

1496
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:23,089
things fundamentally this is a fantastic

1497
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:24,950
industry to be in it's a fantastic

1498
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:25,940
community to be a part of I'm always

1499
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:27,830
excited to do it

1500
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:29,750
and yet I watched so many of us struggle

1501
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:30,740
and burn out and deal with impostor

1502
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:33,170
syndrome and deal with all these issues

1503
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:35,270
so I hope I've given you some ideas and

1504
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:38,960
on the handle them if not hit me up
