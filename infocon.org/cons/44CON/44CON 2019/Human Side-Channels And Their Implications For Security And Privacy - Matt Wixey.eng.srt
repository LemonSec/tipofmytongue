1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,029
Oh

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:07,040
hi everyone thank you very much for

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:08,510
coming so this is I'm unique just like

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,660
you human side tales and the

5
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:13,250
implications for security and privacy my

6
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,530
name is Matt wick see I lead cyber

7
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,210
security research for PwC UK

8
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,948
cybersecurity practice I'm also a

9
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,000
part-time PhD student at University

10
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:22,519
College London

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,470
prior to joining PwC I work for the Met

12
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:26,689
Police in London our leading technical

13
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,189
research and development and previously

14
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:29,900
spoken a number conferences including

15
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:33,560
full to full con a couple years ago as

16
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:36,050
well so aims for this session is to

17
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,120
introduce you to three kinds of what I

18
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:40,040
call human side channels and how they

19
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,750
work give you some practical takeaways

20
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,640
for each one of those include some tools

21
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,620
that you can download and start playing

22
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,270
with straightaway I look at the

23
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,730
implications of those side channels for

24
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:51,620
security and privacy associated

25
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,690
countermeasures from a privacy

26
00:00:51,620 --> 00:01:00,199
perspective and then explore some future

27
00:00:53,690 --> 00:01:02,150
research ideas as well so these are the

28
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,580
side channels that I'm going to explain

29
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:08,450
forensic linguistics behavioral

30
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:10,310
signatures and cultural captures so I

31
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:14,780
want to start with this story anyone

32
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:17,210
familiar with John Christie yeah yeah a

33
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:21,230
couple of people so this is a

34
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:23,149
fascinating story so in 1949 a man

35
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,530
called Timothy Evans walked into a

36
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,170
police station and said that he'd

37
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,910
accidentally killed his wife he gave

38
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:32,030
four separate statements to the police

39
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:35,990
over over a certain period and he was

40
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:37,550
eventually arrested charged and executed

41
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:40,399
for the murder of his wife and

42
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:43,670
subsequently his infant daughter as well

43
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,620
Timothy Evans shared a house with this

44
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:49,310
guy John Christie in 10 Rillington place

45
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:52,610
which is or was not a million miles away

46
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:54,229
from here I was in Notting Hill and it

47
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:57,289
sounds like John Christie was the actual

48
00:01:54,229 --> 00:02:01,820
murderer of Timothy Evans wife and child

49
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:03,380
the thing kind of where what I'm going

50
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,949
to talk about comes into this story is

51
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:10,220
his linguistics so a Swedish professor

52
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,810
called Yan's for Vic later analyzed the

53
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:15,650
statements that Timothy Evans had given

54
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:18,860
to the police and he found that he

55
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,060
identify distinct authorial voices in

56
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,219
those statements one of which was

57
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,480
Timothy Evans and these statements were

58
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:24,590
supposed to be verbatim they were

59
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,840
supposed to be a transcript of what

60
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:29,120
Evans was saying but he found a number

61
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,939
of other authorial voices in those

62
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,950
statements particularly in instances

63
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:36,260
where Evans had said something

64
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,939
incriminating and the conclusion as

65
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,590
father came to was that the police

66
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:42,230
officers had essentially put words in

67
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:45,920
Evans's mouth so he was posthumously

68
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:48,638
pardoned and Yan's for vick coined this

69
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,679
forensic linguistics are the practice of

70
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:57,409
analyzing language to try and identify

71
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:58,879
who wrote ill who said it so a bit of

72
00:02:57,409 --> 00:03:00,798
background into why we should be

73
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,750
interested about human side channels and

74
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:05,299
what they mean so if you're

75
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,709
investigating a real-world crime as a

76
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:07,939
police officer or something like that

77
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:09,379
there are various things you look for

78
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:11,000
various kind of bits of physical

79
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:13,668
evidence you know for fingerprints you

80
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,769
look for DNA you might look for things

81
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:17,239
like gait in video footage so the way

82
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:19,459
that people walk and that kind of thing

83
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,780
if you're looking at digital offences

84
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:24,739
though it's a little bit more complex

85
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:26,269
because whilst you have kind of

86
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:28,569
equivalents in the form of IP addresses

87
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:30,799
and MAC addresses and things like that

88
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:33,108
they are also the identifiers that are

89
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,560
easiest to spoof or obfuscate or

90
00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:38,389
anonymize so this kind of takes us onto

91
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,699
the field of attribution which is a very

92
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:42,290
active field in research and there's all

93
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:44,030
sorts of things that some researchers

94
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:46,970
have come up with on how to try and

95
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:49,549
attribute things to throw actors to the

96
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,199
people responsible typically though they

97
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:53,540
take us further away from the individual

98
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:56,540
behind the crime the fingers of the

99
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:58,698
keyboards so if you look at activity

100
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:01,939
correlated to time zones for instance

101
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:04,129
which is a very popular technique so you

102
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:05,840
look at the attack activity you

103
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:07,668
correlate it to business hours in a

104
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:12,049
particular country or particular region

105
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:14,299
that might get you closer to a region of

106
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:16,940
the world but it will take you further

107
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:18,320
away from the individual another thing

108
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,029
you can look at is the tools and

109
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,430
techniques that an attacker uses and try

110
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:23,719
not to buting's that way but again that

111
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:26,469
potentially takes you further away from

112
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:26,469
the individual

113
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:31,240
so a possible solution is inside there

114
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:34,720
of human side channels so computers have

115
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,460
side channels which are leakage

116
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,160
essentially in kind of primitive alphas

117
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:41,620
things like heat electromagnetic

118
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,230
radiation light that kind of thing as a

119
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,870
result of the things they do and humans

120
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:48,550
also have unintentional leakage as a

121
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,620
result of the things we do whenever we

122
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:53,650
write or whenever we speak there's

123
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:56,380
unintentional leakage which potentially

124
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:59,229
is distinctive enough for it to be used

125
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:02,050
as an attribution technique and this

126
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:04,090
comes back to behavioral theory in

127
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,950
personality psychology which basically

128
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,109
says that because we've all had unique

129
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:10,479
education and experiences and training

130
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:14,140
and stimuli and way of looking at the

131
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:16,470
world that we form our outputs in a

132
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:19,930
distinctive and yet consistent way

133
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:21,940
hence human side channels so I'm gonna

134
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,700
start with forensic linguistics and this

135
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:27,370
is from a genuine email that I sent to

136
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,840
my professor when I was uni my first

137
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,000
degree was in English language and

138
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,380
literature and this is kind of when I

139
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,360
got interested in linguistics and I

140
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,909
decided I want to do a talk sorry I

141
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,860
heard essay on where the F word came

142
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:46,780
from so I sent in this email and this

143
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:49,030
was his response so the theory of

144
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,500
forensic linguistics um forensic

145
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,460
linguistics covers a lot of stuff we're

146
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,410
gonna be looking at one in particular

147
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,330
which is authorship attribution so if

148
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:58,330
you have a piece of text can you work

149
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,919
out who wrote it and that's also called

150
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,109
spot on a tree that kind of particular

151
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,400
area of forensic linguistics and it

152
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,960
typically comes down to these five

153
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,549
things you've got spelling and

154
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,500
orthography you've got grammar you've

155
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:12,430
got lexicon or vocabulary

156
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:14,080
you've got idiom which is kind of unique

157
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,600
sentence construction and that kind of

158
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,180
thing and you've got identical

159
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,640
expressions now in the real world

160
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,630
forensic linguistics are used for a

161
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,789
number of things they used in newer

162
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:26,290
forcement it's a pretty niche area of

163
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:29,800
law enforcement but they are used for

164
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:32,280
things like ransom notes so a famous

165
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:36,220
example is the Jon Benet Ramsey

166
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:38,049
kidnapping which was 1980 something like

167
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,850
that in the US and our forensic

168
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,400
linguistics was used for that issues for

169
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,710
plagiarism

170
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,130
investigations in academia is being used

171
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:48,349
in the literature so to try and work out

172
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:50,330
who if not Shakespeare wrote

173
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:53,360
Shakespeare's plays the Federalist

174
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:56,359
Papers and JK Rowling's first post Harry

175
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,009
Potter novel and as with the John

176
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,850
Christie Timothy Evans case looking at

177
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:03,740
miscarriages of justice what forensic

178
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:05,870
linguistics isn't he's trying to work

179
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,479
out if someone is lying when they're

180
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:10,520
writing so there was a fascinating bit

181
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:15,039
of research last year by van der Zee and

182
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:20,180
others who took the tweets of a

183
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:22,430
well-known American politician and given

184
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,350
that they had ground truth for some of

185
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:26,539
those tweets when that person was lying

186
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:28,729
they were able to construct the machine

187
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:30,740
learning model that could work out when

188
00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:32,030
that person tweeted something what the

189
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:36,229
likelihood was that they were telling

190
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:37,760
the truth deliberately forensic

191
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:40,930
linguistics isn't detecting what someone

192
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,949
means in a piece of text it's not

193
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:45,470
creating something like a textual

194
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:46,849
fingerprint it's not looking at

195
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,650
handwriting which is a separate

196
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:51,800
discipline and it's not looking at the

197
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:53,210
context in which a piece of writing was

198
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,190
written it's purely looking at the

199
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:56,960
writing itself from a very technical

200
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:58,760
perspective to see if there are

201
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,698
particular identifying attributes about

202
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,949
it so some ways that star dormitory is

203
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:06,199
done range from the very complex to the

204
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:07,520
pretty basic complex techniques would

205
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:10,490
involve the creation of some kind of

206
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,990
corpus collection of texts extracting

207
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,270
features of interest typically that's

208
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,889
done automatically and particularly

209
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,990
looking at things like parts of speech

210
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:19,940
word length sentence lengths that kind

211
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:23,270
of thing and then doing some form of

212
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:26,659
statistical comparison that used to be

213
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:27,919
done manually it's now done principally

214
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:30,110
with machine learning particularly

215
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,549
support vector machines and principal

216
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:34,430
component analysis but there are other

217
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:36,140
techniques as well a really hot topic of

218
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:38,539
debate in forensic linguistics is which

219
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,010
of those techniques are better but we're

220
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:43,309
not going to go into that here and then

221
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:44,959
from a basic perspective without having

222
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:46,939
a corpus necessarily you just have a

223
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,650
piece of text and you're looking at it

224
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,800
for particularly unusual Spelling's or

225
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:53,420
punctuation or phrases the Unabomber

226
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,969
case is a good example of that

227
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,949
there was a particular phrase that led

228
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:00,170
law enforcement to suspect an individual

229
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:03,820
and just looking for those phrases or

230
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:06,050
sentences on Google or something similar

231
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:08,329
so a couple more cases just to

232
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:10,279
illustrate our most basic techniques

233
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:11,839
really so on the left is a woman called

234
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:16,250
Julie Turner who was murdered in

235
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:20,000
Yorkshire in 2005 and after she

236
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:22,339
disappeared a text was sent to or from

237
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,440
her mobile phone that said she needed to

238
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:26,389
disappear for a while and saw her head

239
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,120
out it turns out that one of the main

240
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:32,000
suspects in that investigation used that

241
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,620
phrase very commonly it turned out that

242
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,209
he had actually murdered her and sent

243
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,850
those texts from her phone so that kind

244
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:41,089
of sentence that phrase gave him away

245
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:44,630
on the right are a couple of men who

246
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:48,079
were wrongfully arrested and wrongfully

247
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:51,139
imprisoned for allegedly participating

248
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:54,019
in a murder in the 1980s this was part

249
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:58,480
of the ice cream Wars in Glasgow the

250
00:09:54,019 --> 00:10:00,949
kind of drugs gang war in the 80s and

251
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,860
the interesting thing about that case is

252
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:05,300
that several police officers claimed

253
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,550
that these two men had said a

254
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,930
particularly incriminating phrase some

255
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:11,449
hours after they were alleged to have

256
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:12,979
said it and subsequent research found

257
00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:14,269
that it's really really unlikely for

258
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,920
people to prove it to be able to

259
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:19,790
remember the exact phrase that someone

260
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,649
said hours after they've said it even

261
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:24,920
more so when it's several different

262
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:26,839
police officers remembering that in

263
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,640
terms of cyber specific stuff and kind

264
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:31,940
of forensic linguistics application to

265
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,890
cyber security it's not a new topic and

266
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,420
there have been several researchers who

267
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:38,180
have kind of suggested or tested out

268
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:40,969
various things various contexts so to

269
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:44,569
try and work out who has sent tweets so

270
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:46,399
if you have someone operating several

271
00:10:44,569 --> 00:10:47,750
different Twitter accounts under

272
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,730
different names pretending to be

273
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,350
different people as sockpuppets

274
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:53,420
and they can potentially be detected

275
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:55,459
through forensic linguistics similarly

276
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,740
with forum posts or with emails the same

277
00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:59,029
kind of thing applies there's been some

278
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,420
really interesting work on applying

279
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:05,730
forensic linguistics to source code so

280
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:07,530
looking at the way that people construct

281
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:09,180
source-code the way that they have

282
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,920
particular habits in whatever language

283
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,870
it is in terms of the syntax that they

284
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,089
use and can also be used in thei

285
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:18,150
anonymize programmers based on source

286
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:20,520
code and as a kind of really interesting

287
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:22,560
offshoot of that some of those kind of

288
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:25,530
artifacts even survive the compilation

289
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,300
process so callus can Islam and others

290
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:29,670
have done some really great work on

291
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,949
looking at the anonymizing programmers

292
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:34,319
from compiled binaries which is

293
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:36,510
fantastic so and has also been work on

294
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,660
detecting authorship deception this is

295
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:41,880
where authors try and pass themselves

296
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:45,469
off as someone else I'm so trying to

297
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,470
imitate someone else's writing style

298
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:52,650
some case studies pretty recently

299
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:55,340
operation Tripoli which was a bit of

300
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:57,660
research by checkpoint earlier this year

301
00:11:55,340 --> 00:12:00,680
focused on a really large social

302
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:02,670
engineering campaign on Facebook and

303
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,050
essentially was kind of executing a

304
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:05,699
watering hole attack it was getting

305
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:07,229
people to follow a particular profile

306
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,090
then posting links on those profiles

307
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,890
people following those links would then

308
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:12,510
get infected with malware

309
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:14,100
what checkpoint were able to do is by

310
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:16,890
searching for repeated spelling and

311
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,480
grammatical errors in the the language

312
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:20,730
used on that profile they were able to

313
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,210
reveal about thirty other profiles all

314
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:27,090
run by the same factor judith de Bruyne

315
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:29,760
in 2016 looked at the language used by

316
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:32,010
IRS phone scam 'as and was able to find

317
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,430
several features that they had in common

318
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:37,140
and a really interesting one i copied it

319
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:39,359
from a well three years ago now is gucci

320
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:42,660
42.0 and this was a really interesting

321
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,850
case of an individual who had one native

322
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:49,949
tongue but was pretending to have

323
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:51,000
another one so really interesting some

324
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,530
other use cases that you could

325
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,970
potentially use forensic linguistics for

326
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:55,920
would be if you have spear phishing

327
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:58,080
emails coming in you could potentially

328
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,760
try and work out if it's the same person

329
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:03,510
behind them even though that complete

330
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,610
different pretext and audiences missives

331
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,700
and manifestos that throw actors or

332
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:10,740
other criminals are posting on lion

333
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:13,880
ransomware instructions posts or tweets

334
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:16,200
that are coordinating say DDoS attacks

335
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,269
in theory you could use it to try and

336
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,379
work out who Satoshi Nakamoto is

337
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:20,970
I'd be surprised if none was done

338
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:23,730
thatalready but potentially you could do

339
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:25,319
that so in terms of how you could use

340
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:26,879
this practically essentially what you

341
00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:28,199
want to do is collect the corpus like a

342
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,389
phishing emails or something like that

343
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:32,609
try and attribute them where possible to

344
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:34,470
a particular for a group or a person and

345
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,240
their new samples that you get in you've

346
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:37,649
compared to that corpus using some of

347
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,499
the tools that I'm going to show you in

348
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:43,170
the next few slides or you could take a

349
00:13:40,499 --> 00:13:45,779
more basic approach and as sönke was

350
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:47,309
come in you look for unusual Spelling's

351
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:48,959
or unusual constructions things like

352
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:50,339
that and then search for those online

353
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,649
and see if they can kind of generate

354
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:53,910
other leads

355
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:56,040
so some tools that you could use to do

356
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:58,639
this and these are all free to download

357
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,290
these are all kind of available now they

358
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:04,079
range in their kind of ease of use and

359
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:05,639
and applicability but the first is j-cap

360
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,429
which is available and get harvested

361
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:11,189
java based tool pretty complex for first

362
00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:13,230
time users but it is it shows some

363
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:14,670
promising results pretty easy to use as

364
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:16,439
you can see it's just a GUI that you can

365
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,878
upload different text into and it will

366
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:20,879
compare those using a number of

367
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:23,369
different techniques Delta spreadsheet

368
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:25,019
so you'll all be pleased to know as

369
00:14:23,369 --> 00:14:26,879
security professionals that this one

370
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:30,600
involves you downloading an Excel

371
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:31,949
spreadsheet and enabling macros but and

372
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,139
as you can see this one involves a lot

373
00:14:31,949 --> 00:14:37,709
of manual data entry as well it looks a

374
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:39,420
bit kind of difficult to kind of use at

375
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:40,829
first hand once you get used to it's not

376
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,290
that bad but this only uses one

377
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:46,709
particular technique to compare

378
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:49,860
different text together a style ama tree

379
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:50,910
this is a collection of Python tools as

380
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:54,240
you can see this gives you some

381
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:55,879
graphical output so on the right hand

382
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,860
side you can see various different

383
00:14:55,879 --> 00:15:00,179
famous novels and plays and things like

384
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:02,100
that they're grouped together according

385
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:05,790
to how similar they are using one

386
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:07,889
particular technique you've got stylo so

387
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:11,429
this is um this is my favorite one this

388
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:14,610
is an r library and here are users in

389
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:16,920
the room yeah a couple of people so this

390
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:18,959
isn't too difficult to use is about my

391
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,399
five commands that you need to know to

392
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,750
use it and you can generate this kind of

393
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,720
output various different kinds of output

394
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:28,360
and then this silo which is a wrapper

395
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,250
for stylo so this enables you to run

396
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,269
that library from within a browser as

397
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,709
you can see it's got quite a nice

398
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:34,660
interface and you've got various

399
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:36,609
different kinds of outputs here so that

400
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:39,490
the graph on the right hand side has

401
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:41,259
grouped together so war and peace on the

402
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:42,759
right hand side you've got Shakespeare's

403
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:44,470
plays top right which are completely

404
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:46,180
different from everything else and then

405
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,829
you've got various other novels that

406
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:50,019
have been grouped together and depending

407
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:51,339
how similar they are so you could just

408
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:52,689
load a whole load of spear phishing

409
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:57,430
emails in here or something like that

410
00:15:52,689 --> 00:15:58,750
and produce similar kind of alpha so and

411
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:01,180
this is an example with some blog

412
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:03,759
articles that myself and colleagues at

413
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:05,829
PwC have written so three of us writing

414
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,170
three blog articles each and you can see

415
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:10,508
that using Trello in this case it's

416
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:12,399
grouped together those text according to

417
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:16,240
the author because of our similar

418
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:18,939
writing styles so summary of these tools

419
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,199
here if you kind of want to use these as

420
00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:23,079
I said these are all kind of free to

421
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:25,810
download have a play with them and kind

422
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:27,430
of see what you think there are some

423
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:29,290
caveats there using forensic linguistics

424
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:30,878
for things like threat intelligence or

425
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:32,589
Incident Response the first is that

426
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:35,470
register makes a big difference so in

427
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:37,059
linguistics register is the context that

428
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,680
you're writing something in the purpose

429
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:40,269
the audience will that kind of stuff and

430
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,979
it does make a big difference as I'll

431
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:44,620
show you in the next couple of slides

432
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:47,379
you do need a baseline of text with some

433
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:50,800
sizable samples you may need some ground

434
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:52,569
truth as well time lapse might affect

435
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,699
results so if you've got someone writing

436
00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:57,309
something in 2003 and it's my right on

437
00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:58,959
the in 2019 it may be very different

438
00:16:57,309 --> 00:17:01,509
writing style because over time people

439
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,709
do kind of change and if you want to

440
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:06,459
remember this isn't a silver bullet

441
00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:09,188
you're not going to get 100% accuracy so

442
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:11,439
just on register this is a really two

443
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:13,659
good examples here so the first on the

444
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:17,110
left is looking at different chapters of

445
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:19,110
1984 the novel by George Orwell and you

446
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:22,149
can see most of them are kind of fairly

447
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:24,479
well grouped together but for two

448
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:29,130
anomalies on the left-hand side and

449
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:32,620
those two anomalies as anyone read 1984

450
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:34,490
yeah so yeah so you know there's a

451
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:37,260
chapter in there where

452
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:38,820
Winston Smith is in the the room above

453
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,830
the bookshop and he's reading that book

454
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:44,159
by Emmanuel Goldstein so there's kind of

455
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:45,449
a book within a book in 1984 and that

456
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,740
goes on for about a chapter and a half

457
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:48,720
and one of those normal e's is that

458
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,640
chapter so it shows you kind of how good

459
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,080
all world wars first of all but also

460
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,010
that if you're writing a different style

461
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,850
it can make it appear completely

462
00:17:53,010 --> 00:18:00,990
different oh and on the right hand side

463
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:02,399
so this is some of my writings so like

464
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:04,050
short stories and stuff like that and

465
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,850
you can see on the left hand side on my

466
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,560
blog articles grouped pretty close

467
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:09,330
together on the bottom left but

468
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,710
everything else is kind of spread all

469
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,090
over the place so it does depend what

470
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:15,570
genre or what register you drive you're

471
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:18,360
writing in some privacy implications or

472
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:20,070
forensic linguistics so obviously there

473
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,830
are very legitimate reasons why someone

474
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:24,389
would want to write anonymously online

475
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:26,669
or under a different identity and

476
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:30,210
forensic linguistics potentially gives

477
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:32,130
people are a mechanism to try and have

478
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:34,200
to beYOU anonymous text to you if you've

479
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:36,960
written them there are some

480
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,790
countermeasures to this the first is

481
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,550
that just being aware that you have a

482
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:43,860
distinctive linguistic style and can

483
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:45,360
facilitate you disguising it if you know

484
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,760
there are particular things you do

485
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,229
particular punctuation types you use

486
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,600
particular phrases particular

487
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:53,010
expressions you can disguise those you

488
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,030
could try and imitate someone else's

489
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:58,440
style either during or after writing

490
00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:00,090
something that gets suggested a lot is

491
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,430
putting text through Google Translate

492
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:04,080
translating it twelve times in different

493
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,710
languages and then putting it back into

494
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,750
English

495
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,100
you then have to kind of fiddle around

496
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,780
with it quite a lot to get the original

497
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,790
sense of the meaning but that can help

498
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:14,399
you can try and combine with other

499
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:15,570
authors or you could run some forensic

500
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,180
linguistic tools so there have been a

501
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:21,030
couple of projects in on a mouth being

502
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:23,130
probably the best well-known that

503
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:25,500
focuses on equal adversarial spirometry

504
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:26,910
so trying to disguise writing style to

505
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,400
prevent adversary's being able to link

506
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:31,020
it back to you those tools aren't that

507
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,520
well maintained and you have to fiddle

508
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,870
around a lot with the courage to try and

509
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:37,230
get into work but that might be worth

510
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:38,909
kind of looking into so in terms of what

511
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:40,590
you can do now with your stuff test

512
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:42,300
these tools out I'm saving and get some

513
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:44,909
text from previous attack so I open so

514
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:47,280
later build a corpus have a play and see

515
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,670
what you think and I'm sure there are

516
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,260
loads of

517
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:52,980
scenarios and context that it could be

518
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:54,390
used for as well okay I'm going to move

519
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,210
on to the second human side channel

520
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:59,100
which is behavioral signatures now the

521
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:01,590
fact that no one's laughed at this I

522
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,909
kind of expected that because it's a

523
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:05,000
joke that depends on a very niche

524
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:07,200
audience which is which is a

525
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,360
statisticians who are also jay-z fans

526
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,870
which is a very very small target

527
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,280
audience but um so I talked earlier

528
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:18,300
about attribution and how that's a

529
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:19,590
really active area of research and in

530
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,480
addition to things like discreet

531
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:23,939
identifiers IP addresses MAC addresses

532
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,520
that kind of thing a really active area

533
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:29,430
of research within attribution is who

534
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:31,680
hacks and why and what these researchers

535
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:34,890
have looked at is things like motivation

536
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:37,620
skills attack behaviors attitudes and

537
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:39,980
culture what they do when they were not

538
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:42,870
compromised machine things like that

539
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:45,390
typically again whilst these concentrate

540
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:48,090
on the individual they don't necessarily

541
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:52,080
take any active steps towards actually

542
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:53,820
attributed an attack to someone so what

543
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,679
hasn't been done in that vein is

544
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,600
comparing the profiles of attackers

545
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,730
using something called pace linkage

546
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,340
analysis has anyone heard of case

547
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:05,210
linkage analysis before it's not

548
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:08,040
particularly well known it's an academic

549
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:10,230
discipline it might have been used in

550
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,610
practice by a few police forces but

551
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:13,860
essentially it's a technique for trying

552
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:16,830
to link together separate crimes to

553
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:18,750
common offenders so what you do is you

554
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:21,300
take a really granular look at a crime

555
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:23,310
you look at all the kind of behaviors

556
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:25,889
that have been used in the commission of

557
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:28,830
that crime so for instance a burglary

558
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:30,450
you would look at how the offender got

559
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:32,429
into the house what tool did they used

560
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:34,230
in the target window a door what's Hamid

561
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:36,000
they did they get in that kind of thing

562
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:37,500
and you go through the whole crime like

563
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,610
that you end up with a very kind of a

564
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:43,290
very fine-grained list of behaviors and

565
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:45,510
you then compare those to the behaviors

566
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:47,220
from another crime to see how likely it

567
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:49,560
is that the same offender committed both

568
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:51,210
so there's been some success in academic

569
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,889
literature with applying CLA to

570
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:56,040
real-world crimes to things like

571
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:58,980
homicide and arson and sexual offences

572
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,629
and robbery and burglary and lots of

573
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,010
others and it's

574
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:03,270
based on these same principle as I

575
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,650
mentioned at the start and the same

576
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:06,990
principles that underpin forensic

577
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:09,090
linguistics which is that people have

578
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:12,060
distinctive yet consistent ways of doing

579
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:15,209
things so and that applies to offenders

580
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:17,159
as much as does to anyone else so in

581
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:19,110
terms of applying this to cybercrime a

582
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,580
possible methodology would be something

583
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:22,889
like this you log keystrokes on a

584
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:25,189
honeypot you take very granular crime

585
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:27,510
behaviors from pairs of offenses you

586
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:29,430
perform classification on them which

587
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:31,890
I'll come unto you then determine a

588
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:33,960
degree of similarity and you do some

589
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:35,610
statistics to work out how similar those

590
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,260
two attacks are and whether they might

591
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:41,729
have been perpetrated by the same three

592
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:43,770
actor so with classification you would

593
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:45,780
kind of define a domain a behavioral

594
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:47,879
domain so one might be navigation so

595
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:49,680
what keystrokes does an attacker enter

596
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,750
on a system to try and navigate around

597
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:53,820
the file system copy files move files

598
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:56,340
list folders that kind of thing another

599
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:58,020
might be enumeration so what an attacker

600
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:00,179
is doing to find out what operating

601
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:02,730
system they're running on what possible

602
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:04,890
vulnerabilities might be and then you

603
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:07,890
turn those behaviors into yes-or-no

604
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:10,080
questions so an example would be did the

605
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:13,500
attacker use W get to download malware

606
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,030
from a site off the compromised and in

607
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,740
terms of classification you just assign

608
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:17,820
a one if it's a yes in a zero if it's in

609
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:20,220
though and you end up with a really long

610
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:22,649
binary string for an offense in each

611
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:26,280
domain you're then apply something

612
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:27,810
called a similarity coefficient the most

613
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,910
commonly used one for case linkage

614
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:31,260
analysis is Jack odds coefficient I'm

615
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,970
going into the maths a bit more with

616
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,830
this one because it's not quite as

617
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:37,800
complex it is as it is for forensic

618
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:39,840
linguistics and you calculate one of

619
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,820
these coefficients per domain her pair

620
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,209
of attacks and as you can see it's a

621
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:46,679
pretty simple formula so X is the count

622
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,870
of behaviors present in both of the

623
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:51,240
attacks you're looking at why is

624
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:53,040
behaviour in a burn or B Z is those

625
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,300
present in B burn or a and then if

626
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,220
you're not with the scores one it means

627
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,050
the crime the attacks are perfectly

628
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:02,370
similar if you're not with zero they're

629
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:03,870
perfectly dissimilar then you put these

630
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:06,449
coefficients into something called a

631
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:08,070
pirate logistic regression model now if

632
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:09,900
you've never done stats before this

633
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:12,030
sounds kind of a little bit intimidating

634
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,440
when I did this I had never really done

635
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,990
stats before either it's really not that

636
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,000
bad so

637
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:18,580
use something called like spss or you

638
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,320
can use R for it so R is free loads of

639
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,809
tutorials online on how to do logistic

640
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,040
regression and essentially what you're

641
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:25,570
trying to do is sing for you can work

642
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,610
out whether those two pairs of attacks

643
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:30,240
are linked and which of your behavioral

644
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:32,469
domains contributes more to that result

645
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,270
so you run the gist of regression for

646
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:36,040
each behavioral domain you end up with a

647
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:37,150
positive or negative correlation which

648
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,550
told you when or whether they're linked

649
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:41,020
unit with a p-value which in statistics

650
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:43,899
just tells you how significant your

651
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:45,010
result is and if you want you can repeat

652
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,780
that with something called forward

653
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:48,670
stepwise logistic regression which is

654
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:52,570
basically a really kind of primitive

655
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:53,980
form of machine learning and then you

656
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:56,439
run something called a ROC curve I'm

657
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:58,480
sorry you see ROC curves a lot in in

658
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,890
machine learning papers essentially they

659
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,510
plot the probability of a false positive

660
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:03,220
against the probability of a true

661
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:04,600
positive and just give you a measure of

662
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,550
predictive accuracy and you get

663
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,500
something called an AUC value area under

664
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:14,919
the curve basically that tells you how

665
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:17,710
good your model is from 0 up to 1.0 so

666
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:19,840
this is what a ROC curve looks like just

667
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:22,059
to give you an example if you get a UC

668
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:25,090
value of 0.5 to 0.7 that's low

669
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:28,230
predictive accuracy 0.7 2.9 is good and

670
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:31,000
put 9 to 1 it's obviously high perfect

671
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:33,790
so I ran an experiment to test case

672
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,760
linkage analysis out against offenders

673
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:39,070
attacking a vulnerable VM so I modified

674
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,660
an open-source Python key logger which

675
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:44,678
uses s trace so you can download that

676
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:46,900
from github I exposed two VMs on the

677
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:50,920
internet over SSH and I set up one

678
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:52,990
account per user per box configure those

679
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,970
VMs with deliberate privilege escalation

680
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:56,679
vulnerabilities and then put some like

681
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:59,320
fake interesting data for them to

682
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:01,510
exfiltrate as well and then I got 10 pen

683
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,639
testers and students and kind of amateur

684
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:06,610
enthusiasts to ssh in with low

685
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:09,250
privileges to each of those VMs so each

686
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:11,409
of one of them attacked one VM and then

687
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:14,170
VM too and I asked him to try and get

688
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:15,580
route to steal the data to try and cover

689
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:16,870
their tracks and just generally poke

690
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:21,730
around like they would if they were on a

691
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:23,229
pen test all the while this key logger

692
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:25,840
was recording everything they did

693
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:27,430
so I Cal a to those keystrokes per user

694
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,350
split them into behavioral domain

695
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:31,420
so I used navigation enumeration

696
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:33,280
exploitation and you end up with these

697
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:35,820
individual behaviors per domain so this

698
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:39,040
is an example from the exploitation

699
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:40,600
domain and you can see how granular are

700
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:43,000
we're going we're not just looking at

701
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:46,060
kind of general attack strategies this

702
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,920
is not did an attacker try and use two

703
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:49,899
mod to change permissions of a file but

704
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:53,140
what numbers did they use for modding

705
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:54,250
that file if they tried to pseudo what

706
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:56,650
was the command that they were using

707
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:58,780
what with the syntax and similarly with

708
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:00,640
the navigation domain for example it's

709
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:04,540
looking at things like what flags did an

710
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,980
attacker use with the LS command and did

711
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:11,560
they consistently do that over a period

712
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:13,960
of time then calculated the jackpot

713
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:16,629
values so if you look if you focus on

714
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,190
the mean column here and you look at the

715
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:19,950
offenses which were linked in each

716
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:22,000
domain you can see that the mean

717
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:23,560
similarity coefficient value is much

718
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,910
higher than it is for the unlinked ones

719
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,800
which gives kind of an initial

720
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:29,170
indication this technique might be

721
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,850
successful and depending on how kind of

722
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:32,110
strict or how rigorous you want it to be

723
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:33,790
you could stop there you might not need

724
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:36,610
to do logistic regression that kind of

725
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:38,050
thing but if you wanted to you can you

726
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:40,240
can progress with that and do logistic

727
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:42,639
regression so in my case I use the SPSS

728
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,550
did the logistic regression calculated

729
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,560
the ROC curves and you end up with this

730
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:50,080
table so if you concentrate on the AUC

731
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:51,669
value which is the important one area

732
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,730
under the curve you can see that

733
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:56,640
navigation enumeration and exploitation

734
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:59,070
predictive accuracy ranges from

735
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,630
ninety-one percent up to 99 percent

736
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:03,550
which is very high for kind of working

737
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:08,830
out together where those attacks are

738
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:11,470
linked so in terms of kind of deploying

739
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:12,490
this in the real world here are some

740
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:14,560
things that you could do I mean the

741
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:16,480
obvious one is to run a honeypot some

742
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,760
kind of interactive honeypot and have an

743
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,500
SSH key logger running on it and just

744
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,750
build up a corpus of attackers who are

745
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:25,570
hitting the honeypot now that kind of

746
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:27,460
leads you into some problematic

747
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:29,139
territory because you're also going to

748
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,160
get bots attacking that honeypot so

749
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,470
another thing you're gonna have to do is

750
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,450
try and separate BOTS from humans which

751
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,800
is a separate problem there's some

752
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:37,330
evidence that suggests you can do it

753
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,210
pretty easily but it's just another

754
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:40,830
issue you have to deal with

755
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:42,570
potentially you could also use this

756
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:45,030
technique to identify attackers who's

757
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:46,620
trained together now this kind of flies

758
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:48,750
in the face of that distinctive

759
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:50,909
consistent impersonator psychology

760
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:53,370
theory but potentially you could do it

761
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:54,900
so if you've got attackers who took the

762
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:56,760
same kind of pen testing cause for

763
00:28:54,900 --> 00:29:01,980
example they might always do things a

764
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:03,690
particular way some other caveats

765
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,670
however for kind of using this technique

766
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:07,230
in the real world include the fact that

767
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:10,560
some offenders will be more distinctive

768
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:14,390
than others some behaviors will be less

769
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:16,830
consistent and it depends to some extent

770
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:18,810
what the attacker experiences when they

771
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:21,439
compromise a mission and what their

772
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:24,149
goals are there's also the caveat that

773
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,400
an attackers mo is a learned behavior

774
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:29,040
and offenders will develop they will

775
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,930
learn over time either in situation to

776
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,870
things sorry either in response to

777
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:36,210
things like getting caught or from

778
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:39,090
learning from other offenders or a

779
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:40,320
response to new technologies offenders

780
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:42,870
will also change their behaviors in

781
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,970
response to events and this is something

782
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:46,409
that's kind of been echoed in case

783
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:49,950
linkage analysis applied to real-world

784
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:52,100
crimes so crimes which involve a high

785
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:55,200
degree of interaction with a victim

786
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:56,850
often show less consistency and less

787
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,470
distinctiveness because the offender is

788
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:00,120
forced to vote it's forced to respond in

789
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:04,350
a particular way depending on what the

790
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:06,060
victim does this experiment is obviously

791
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:08,760
a really small sample is only ten people

792
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:12,270
it was only looking at one scenario

793
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:16,230
which was low privileged access on a

794
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:18,270
Linux box over SSH they weren't real

795
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:19,740
attackers they were kind of volunteers

796
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:20,760
for an experiment so they knew they

797
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,770
weren't going to get cool

798
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,240
they knew they didn't have to take any

799
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:25,250
kind of major measures to try and cover

800
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,240
their tracks or anything like that

801
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:29,160
there's also the point that not all

802
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,890
attacks will have the same motivation so

803
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:33,960
attacker won't necessarily want or need

804
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:36,000
to escalate the privileges depending on

805
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,250
what they're trying to accomplish and

806
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,450
again worth noting that it's not 100%

807
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:44,940
accurate but there are some privacy

808
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:46,860
implications there so predominantly that

809
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:50,100
people can be linked to separate hosts

810
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:51,549
or separate identities and that's based

811
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,080
on your the syntax

812
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:54,340
the commands that you use regardless of

813
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:58,119
any other object measures that you're

814
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:59,619
taking and in that way in that way you

815
00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:04,029
could be linked to historical or future

816
00:30:59,619 --> 00:31:06,070
activity so some countermeasures for

817
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:07,450
this pretty similar to forensic

818
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:10,418
linguistics on the face of it there's

819
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:16,090
kind of making a conscious decision to

820
00:31:10,419 --> 00:31:17,649
disguise your style now kçêäa diocese is

821
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:21,279
kind of a little bit more complicated

822
00:31:17,649 --> 00:31:22,899
because some commands you need to issue

823
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:25,659
to get a particular output and kind of

824
00:31:22,899 --> 00:31:27,609
changing the command is not gonna get

825
00:31:25,659 --> 00:31:28,929
you the help so it can be hard to

826
00:31:27,609 --> 00:31:30,730
automate that but you could try and

827
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:32,350
semi-automated using some scripts

828
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:35,139
you could try randomize like the

829
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:37,330
ordering of command switches so for

830
00:31:35,139 --> 00:31:40,149
example in the navigation domain there

831
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:44,408
was one volunteer who consistently used

832
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:45,699
LS LS - la h and if they do kind of

833
00:31:44,409 --> 00:31:47,049
randomize the order of that it might

834
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,450
have made them a bit more difficult to

835
00:31:47,049 --> 00:31:51,789
track you could switch up the tools you

836
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:53,879
need you're using if you if it's not

837
00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:56,379
going to affect the output so instead of

838
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:59,199
W get you could use curl if that's

839
00:31:56,379 --> 00:32:00,668
appropriate you could use V instead of

840
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,639
Nano or I realize that's a hugely

841
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:04,899
controversial thing to say hum so there

842
00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:08,289
are kind of things you can do in terms

843
00:32:04,899 --> 00:32:09,908
of the tools you use so um I'd encourage

844
00:32:08,289 --> 00:32:12,009
people to kind of give this a go it is

845
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:13,330
sounds complicated if you haven't kind

846
00:32:12,009 --> 00:32:14,950
of messed around with statistics before

847
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:17,168
but it's really not that bad so you

848
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:18,999
could you can even run a CTF or

849
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:20,679
something at your workplace obviously

850
00:32:18,999 --> 00:32:21,970
make sure the people participating know

851
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:22,989
that they're being logged and that kind

852
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:24,999
of thing and take the right ethical

853
00:32:22,989 --> 00:32:27,210
measures but you run a CTF run a

854
00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:29,769
keylogger run it get people to attack it

855
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:32,679
the Jaccard coefficient is really easy

856
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:34,419
to calculate logistic regression it just

857
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:35,710
takes a little bit of practice in SPSS

858
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:38,200
or R or something like that

859
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:40,389
same with ROC curve analysis if you're

860
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,799
familiar with that stuff already then

861
00:32:40,389 --> 00:32:43,238
haven't got automating it so the

862
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:44,950
experiment that I did the analysis that

863
00:32:43,239 --> 00:32:46,269
I did was purely manual it would be

864
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:48,909
really cool to see if someone could kind

865
00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:50,409
of automate this in R or Python and try

866
00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:52,779
and make it like a viable technique that

867
00:32:50,409 --> 00:32:54,519
people could use on honey pots there are

868
00:32:52,779 --> 00:32:55,779
other behavioral domains also that it

869
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:57,909
would be really interesting to have a

870
00:32:55,779 --> 00:32:59,440
look at so evasion techniques would be

871
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:01,980
one that I didn't really look how that

872
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,020
much sohow attack is trying

873
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,520
kind of cover their tracks and whether

874
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,710
that can also be used that attribute

875
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:10,260
attacks to them there is a full white

876
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:12,270
paper available if you're if you're

877
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,860
having trouble sleeping at night I can

878
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:16,290
send that to you it's about 10,000 words

879
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:18,540
or I gave a talk on this at Def Con last

880
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:21,360
year and the videos on YouTube if you

881
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:23,190
want watch stuff okay so I'm going to

882
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:28,770
move on to the last human side channel

883
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:31,140
which is cultural captures so a really

884
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:32,639
kind of an important question when

885
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:35,340
you're looking at like social media is

886
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,230
is this account run by a human or a bot

887
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:38,879
and there's been loads of academic

888
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:41,790
research and practical research on that

889
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,950
question and there are paid and free

890
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:45,030
services online which claim to be able

891
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:47,580
to give you like a percentage

892
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:49,350
probability of how likely is that a

893
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:51,000
particular account is run by human or

894
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:52,469
whether it's all automated and that's

895
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,870
based on things like the frequency of

896
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:58,380
posting the ratio of retweets to

897
00:33:54,870 --> 00:34:01,379
original tweets patterns of following

898
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:04,920
and followers and a sort of stuff but a

899
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:06,900
much harder question is if we know an

900
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:09,300
account humor if we know an account

901
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:11,730
owner is human are they actually who

902
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:14,520
they claim to be and that's particularly

903
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:16,770
important in the context of potentially

904
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:19,739
hostile social media accounts attempting

905
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:22,259
to influence consensus about political

906
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:25,109
issues about elections about things like

907
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:27,510
brexit if someone claims to be British

908
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:30,780
and they're getting themselves involved

909
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:32,909
in conversations about breaks it it's an

910
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:35,630
important question to ask are they

911
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:38,399
actually who they say they are

912
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:40,260
so this is where cultural captures

913
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,880
potentially could come in and I do want

914
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,620
to stress that whereas forensic

915
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:47,820
linguistics and takes linkage analysis

916
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:50,819
or kind of empirically verified to some

917
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:52,710
extent this is much more of a wacky idea

918
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:56,100
that hasn't really been kind of tested

919
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:57,630
in practice and perhaps that's something

920
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:59,190
that someone will go and do after this

921
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,900
talk that'd be really cool but

922
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:02,820
essentially cultural captures are our

923
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:05,280
cultural artifacts which for whatever

924
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:07,590
reason haven't spread beyond their

925
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,880
country of origin and in many cases a

926
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:11,370
popular culture but there's lots of

927
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,430
other possibilities so I want to try a

928
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:15,210
test and I did this at blackhat and it

929
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:16,560
failed because

930
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:19,740
they're about three British people in

931
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:22,730
the audience but if you know who these

932
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:26,098
two people are put your hand up

933
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:29,220
okay and now put your hand down if

934
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:33,630
you're either British or you've spent a

935
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:35,848
significant amount of time in Britain so

936
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:40,050
okay so what okay it's a two people okay

937
00:35:35,849 --> 00:35:41,880
that's interesting how about this one so

938
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:45,540
hands up if you know the answer to that

939
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:46,560
question and then they get hands down if

940
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,290
you're from Britain or spend a

941
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:51,150
significant amount of time room okay

942
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:54,089
all right cool that's really interesting

943
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:56,760
so what this is kind of looking at is is

944
00:35:54,089 --> 00:35:59,910
popular culture that hasn't spread

945
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:01,740
beyond the UK for whatever reason there

946
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:03,029
are kind of issues around quality that

947
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,790
you could kind of point to rather but

948
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:06,810
let's leave that for a other discussion

949
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:08,220
so if you don't know who these two are

950
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:11,130
these are the Chuckle brothers they were

951
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:15,509
a pair of children's comedians in the

952
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:18,920
90s and 2000's the answer this one is

953
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:21,300
Vic Reeves got multimers comedy partner

954
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:26,760
and the reason this one's changed

955
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:28,349
slightly is because of this so if you

956
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:31,859
were trying to use cultural captures as

957
00:36:28,349 --> 00:36:34,530
a way to verify someone's authenticity

958
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:35,970
if you like on social media one thing

959
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:38,010
they might try and do to circumvent it

960
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:39,118
similar to cultural cap are two actual

961
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:40,530
captures is they might try and do

962
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,970
something like a reverse image search or

963
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:43,440
something like that and if you reverse

964
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:44,730
image search the original image you get

965
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,030
an answer straight away who that person

966
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:52,200
is but if you kind of manipulate it then

967
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:56,190
you don't get any results at all do we

968
00:36:52,200 --> 00:37:02,180
have any Americans in the audience one

969
00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:03,690
okay do you know who this person is okay

970
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:06,210
thanks

971
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:14,460
there's a okay hands up if you know who

972
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:17,040
this person is one anymore okay that's

973
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:18,660
sort of work then okay so this is

974
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,369
interesting because this example I

975
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:24,569
thought some people might know because

976
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:30,050
this was a meme so who put their hand up

977
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:30,050
for this one who's that who's the guy

978
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:35,549
one guy put his hand away didn't even

979
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:37,640
know it was um this is I Jake from State

980
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:40,559
Farm does that ring any bells of anyone

981
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:43,379
yeah so this was a meme a few years ago

982
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:45,359
but interesting because you know I've

983
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:47,790
got no idea what State Farm is or who

984
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:49,950
Jake is so it's an interesting one

985
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:51,420
here's an example that's less around

986
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:53,490
popular culture or more just around

987
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:55,619
culture generally so this is from the

988
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:57,569
film Inglourious Basterds and if you

989
00:37:55,619 --> 00:38:01,020
haven't seen it this is from a scene

990
00:37:57,569 --> 00:38:02,880
where Michael Fassbender is a British

991
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:05,369
officer he's gone undercover as a Nazi

992
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,900
officer in occupied France he's trying

993
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:10,530
not to give himself away and he's just

994
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:11,730
ordered three glasses of whiskey and the

995
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:14,849
thing that's given him giving him away

996
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:17,760
here is that he said three glasses and

997
00:38:14,849 --> 00:38:19,170
in Germany you say three glasses so

998
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,050
another kind of interesting example of

999
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:25,020
how cultural captures could potentially

1000
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:27,059
be used there are some other possible

1001
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:28,619
examples so not just popular culture or

1002
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:30,450
things like that but we say food music

1003
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:32,609
cultural norms and quirks popular

1004
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:34,799
culture education Royale with cheese

1005
00:38:32,609 --> 00:38:37,859
would be an example of kind of a food

1006
00:38:34,799 --> 00:38:39,569
example so I want to show you an example

1007
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:42,690
of where this technique was used by

1008
00:38:39,569 --> 00:38:46,950
somebody to potentially out a troll and

1009
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:49,079
social media so I've blanked out account

1010
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:51,439
names in this example but when you

1011
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:53,640
search for this account in question

1012
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,809
against some of these services that are

1013
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,089
online they're trained to be able to

1014
00:38:54,809 --> 00:38:58,710
tell you if an account is automated or

1015
00:38:57,089 --> 00:39:02,009
not you get a forty five percent rating

1016
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:04,079
which shows that this account is almost

1017
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:05,849
certainly involved in some trolling but

1018
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:09,980
it's not believed to be a bot it's not

1019
00:39:05,849 --> 00:39:15,319
believed to be automated so this is the

1020
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:18,930
test that this person applied on Twitter

1021
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:21,058
I guess it always an interesting further

1022
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:25,680
experiment our hands up if you know the

1023
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:27,569
answer to the question okay so yeah a

1024
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:31,200
few people so it's not evidence if you

1025
00:39:27,569 --> 00:39:32,940
were wondering okay so I apologize it

1026
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,669
apologies in advance for the bad

1027
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:38,160
language on this but um the account that

1028
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:39,800
posted the question is the the first one

1029
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,589
speaking here on the top left

1030
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:44,600
the person they're targeting is the one

1031
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:47,870
with the Chelsea flag as the profile

1032
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:49,730
picture so you can see there's are a

1033
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:51,470
pretty long conversation of where this

1034
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:56,150
person with the the Chelsea flag has

1035
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:58,939
refused to answer that question they get

1036
00:39:56,150 --> 00:40:05,270
increasingly hostile as the conversation

1037
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:07,250
goes on and what's particularly

1038
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:09,620
interesting in this exchange is the our

1039
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:11,600
response in the bottom left where the

1040
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:14,390
profile says I know who they both are

1041
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:17,360
I'm just not going to tell you which is

1042
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:18,470
interesting so an example of how

1043
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,330
potentially it could be used obviously

1044
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:22,549
this is used here in quite informal

1045
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:24,560
context but potentially it could be used

1046
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:26,480
for a more formal kind of verification

1047
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:30,170
system for accounts that have been

1048
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:32,750
reported as potentially suspicious so

1049
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:34,490
like normal captures work now people

1050
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:36,650
could be redirected to a kind of

1051
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:38,000
cultural capture question obviously

1052
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:40,520
there would be kind of caveats around

1053
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,870
that that people genuinely may not know

1054
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,130
the answer for whatever reason if they

1055
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:44,870
you know if it's a popular culture

1056
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:47,600
question and they don't watch much TV or

1057
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:48,620
something like that but an example of

1058
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,870
how it might work

1059
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:54,170
would be something like this this is I'm

1060
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:56,870
a really bad coder so this is going to

1061
00:40:54,170 --> 00:41:01,580
look awful but it's just to kind of show

1062
00:40:56,870 --> 00:41:02,930
you so you can have a website and if you

1063
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:06,100
try and access a resource on that

1064
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:13,190
website before completing the capture

1065
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:15,500
you get asked a question like that and

1066
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:17,090
then if you put in the raw answer you

1067
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:21,980
don't get access and if you put in the

1068
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:23,600
right answer the war then you pass so

1069
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,600
something like that has a really kind of

1070
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:28,160
crude example of how that could work

1071
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,660
other caveats is that it is really

1072
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,759
reliant on specific cultural knowledge

1073
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:34,759
and some of it may be age dependent as

1074
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:39,110
well so it's increasingly hard to find

1075
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:42,260
examples that more recent generations

1076
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:43,850
and put it politely might kind of know

1077
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:48,410
so things like mr. blobby

1078
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:51,430
for example know lemons kids born more

1079
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:52,720
recently might not know that at all

1080
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:54,279
saying that the Chuckle brothers saying

1081
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,410
with Fawlty Towers that kind of thing

1082
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:58,900
there's also the problem that the users

1083
00:41:56,410 --> 00:42:00,098
may genuinely not know the answer and

1084
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,809
you also have to make sure the images

1085
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:03,250
can't be searchable online so as I said

1086
00:42:01,809 --> 00:42:05,650
this is this is much more of a kind of

1087
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:06,730
suggestion it's an idea it would be

1088
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:08,650
interesting to see if someone want to

1089
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:11,859
kind of take it run with it and see if

1090
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:13,150
it can actually work at scale and that's

1091
00:42:11,859 --> 00:42:15,180
kind of what I've put for the you know

1092
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:18,400
what can I do now of this particular

1093
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:19,899
part of the talk is for people to come

1094
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,640
up with our own examples test them out

1095
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:23,200
and social media see how effective they

1096
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:25,779
could be ask our how resilient they are

1097
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,399
and a really interesting kind of side

1098
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:29,650
area of research I think for this this

1099
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,930
particular part is with things like

1100
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:34,900
clique farmworkers arm so people who are

1101
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:37,569
paid to run these kinds of social media

1102
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:40,300
accounts how much kind of research they

1103
00:42:37,569 --> 00:42:42,779
do into a particular country's culture

1104
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:45,339
and language how much are they kind of

1105
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:46,839
briefed by the people that are paying

1106
00:42:45,339 --> 00:42:48,940
them that kind of thing so potentially

1107
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:55,779
that could be a really interesting area

1108
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:57,730
for future work so to sum up human side

1109
00:42:55,780 --> 00:43:01,180
channels or at least the three that I've

1110
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:04,390
presented to you today are often under

1111
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:06,069
explored there's often a sense that tqe

1112
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:09,520
things are forensic linguistics and case

1113
00:43:06,069 --> 00:43:11,859
linkage analysis that you need at least

1114
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,390
a master's level degree in those

1115
00:43:11,859 --> 00:43:16,630
subjects to be able to understand them

1116
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:17,920
to be able to use them and as hopefully

1117
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:19,750
you've seen here that's not always the

1118
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,790
case that it can be just as simple as

1119
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:25,960
googling particular phrases or sentences

1120
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:28,390
or using a free downloadable tool to

1121
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:31,780
start testing stuff out similarly with

1122
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:32,920
case linkage analysis at first glance if

1123
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:35,230
you've never heard of logistic

1124
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:36,579
regression or forward stepwise logistic

1125
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:37,809
regression or any of that kind of stuff

1126
00:43:36,579 --> 00:43:39,849
it seems really intimidating but

1127
00:43:37,809 --> 00:43:42,640
actually it's not that difficult to do

1128
00:43:39,849 --> 00:43:43,809
it so if I can do it anyone can do it so

1129
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,839
they're often under explored they're

1130
00:43:43,809 --> 00:43:48,549
often unconventional so while a lot of

1131
00:43:46,839 --> 00:43:50,500
academic researchers for example have

1132
00:43:48,549 --> 00:43:52,119
suggested using forensic linguistics for

1133
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:54,099
threat intelligence or for instance

1134
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:56,770
response that kind of thing in practice

1135
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:58,119
it doesn't get used that much and I

1136
00:43:56,770 --> 00:44:01,000
think the fact that there are tools

1137
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:02,650
available to do it for free

1138
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,350
cost-effective potentially makes it a

1139
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:10,180
really interesting opportunity same for

1140
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:12,600
case linkage analysis as well so in

1141
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:16,060
terms of next steps and future research

1142
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:18,580
I'm hoping to expand the proof of

1143
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:21,160
concept for case linkage analysis to

1144
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:22,900
take in some real-world data I also

1145
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,670
think there's a case for arguing that

1146
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:26,050
more people should be trying out

1147
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:28,630
forensic linguistics and applying that

1148
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:30,430
different cases and scenarios looking

1149
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:32,740
into some other human side channels that

1150
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:35,680
could be used a particularly interesting

1151
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:37,870
one is people's patterns of typing so

1152
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,850
not the actual stuff that they're typing

1153
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:41,410
but they're the speed and pauses and

1154
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:43,150
that kind of thing which has proved

1155
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:45,399
really previously been suggested as a

1156
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:47,190
kind of biometric authentication

1157
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,830
mechanism but could be interesting

1158
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:53,640
taking that forward looking further into

1159
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:55,240
cultural CAPTCHAs and the scope of those

1160
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,830
automating some of this stuff

1161
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:58,569
particularly forensic linguistics and

1162
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:59,950
case linkage analysis so if you want to

1163
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:02,020
get in touch if you want to discuss any

1164
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:04,569
of that stuff then just drop me a line

1165
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:07,000
either by email or on twitter you can

1166
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:08,080
DML got open themes happy to chat

1167
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,010
through any of these you share the

1168
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:14,170
information I've got so just to revisit

1169
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:15,790
the aims from the start of the talk

1170
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:17,080
hopefully you know aware of three human

1171
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:18,520
side channels and how they work some

1172
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,870
practical takeaways for each one

1173
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,550
including some tools that you can use

1174
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:23,770
some implications for security and

1175
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:25,870
privacy and associated countermeasures

1176
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:29,710
and some future research ideas in those

1177
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:31,600
areas as well so it made me - thank you

1178
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:33,490
very much for attending contact details

1179
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:35,950
there again if you want them and if you

1180
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:38,859
are interested this slide deck has a

1181
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:40,960
whole load of references for pretty much

1182
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:44,800
everything I've discussed in great

1183
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:46,330
detail so yeah if you have any questions

1184
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,410
