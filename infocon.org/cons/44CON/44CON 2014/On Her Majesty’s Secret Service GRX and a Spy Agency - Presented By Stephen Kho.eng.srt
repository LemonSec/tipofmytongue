1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:04,230
good afternoon everyone hey thanks for

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:04,650
coming

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,670
hope you all had a nice Jean o'clock

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,740
right last talk of the day for for track

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,680
two and yeah I'm Steven Cove

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,039
my name is Rob Harris I'm an incident

7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,430
response and ler with the Cape with kpn

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,680
which is a large telco provider within

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,599
the Netherlands and my background is

10
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,420
specifically on mobile so this is what

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,470
this talk is all about well sort of

12
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,090
[Music]

13
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:43,170
so who we are when a little bit of talk

14
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,129
to Tory to the presentation actually

15
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:50,280
it's divided into two parts two big

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,129
parts I will help you run through the

17
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:56,399
mobile core network and what's all about

18
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,699
in there and Steven will follow up on

19
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:04,319
the research we did and why we came to

20
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:12,390
it so yeah so we'll cover all the some

21
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,280
background and architecture protocols

22
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,860
how it all hangs together how it kind of

23
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,040
works from that perspective so the GPRS

24
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,220
GPRS roaming exchange and how that

25
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,070
relates to your data roaming activities

26
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,930
when you when you're roaming on your

27
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,850
phone for example we'll talk about

28
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,240
protocols and then also on what we found

29
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,340
why it's why it's interesting and then

30
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,220
leading onto the actual research we did

31
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,220
the vulnerabilities attack vectors all

32
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,390
that interesting stuff and it will

33
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,310
obviously follow on follow up with

34
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,250
mitigation best practices as well as

35
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,549
some follow-on activities because we

36
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:53,729
first did the initial presentation a few

37
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:55,350
months back and we've got some follow-on

38
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,119
sort of activities and what we've been

39
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,680
doing right so okay we've done that very

40
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,259
much is that anybody former brought here

41
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,329
and it for me anybody who is roaming

42
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:11,510
currently anybody anybody that's not one

43
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,769
okay cool so yeah what's this

44
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:21,920
presentation so why this talk well

45
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,469
eventually or initially in 2013 there

46
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:33,030
was a large telco provider in Belgium

47
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,799
was allegedly hacked by the GHC queue

48
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:42,329
and that kept the interest was from

49
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:45,090
Stephen so since I have a mobile

50
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,540
background and Stephen was asking me so

51
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,220
what could be of interest for those

52
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:56,519
intelligence services in this GPS

53
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:01,829
roaming exchange so energy or X and then

54
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:04,400
we started talking about it and

55
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,859
discussing it and since we are a telco

56
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:10,829
provider we also have our own grx

57
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:14,250
connection so that made us thankful well

58
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,220
let's just find out what's running in

59
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,159
there because we don't exactly know just

60
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,750
put traffic in there and it comes back

61
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,870
but there must be something more to that

62
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,169
so that's how we discussed and started

63
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:36,780
our research so these are all the things

64
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,229
we found online what could be of

65
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:43,680
interest to to to the intelligence

66
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,060
services and Snowden then came with his

67
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,479
revelations and eventually it was for us

68
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:57,239
a little bit more clear why the GHC cube

69
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:00,229
wanted to target the G regs and

70
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:03,540
especially when you look at it when you

71
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,000
are in in the middle of the network you

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,069
can eavesdrop the traffic but then again

73
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:10,859
what could be of what can you get out of

74
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:13,370
the GX what could be of interest to them

75
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:19,699
so please next slide

76
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,530
yes what next corner doesn't doesn't it

77
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,919
so we still do what the there is so

78
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,110
much going on in there so let's focus on

79
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,479
that part of the network so I first take

80
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,560
you to how it actually works how the grx

81
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,800
is sitting in between and how a mobile

82
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,960
data connection is set up so what is the

83
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,720
interest why did it do it and how you

84
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,280
will get how because jaracz is a closed

85
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,340
network so how do you get in there so

86
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,100
and there are questions that we can

87
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,620
answer so that's why we started our own

88
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:07,510
research so a little bit of background

89
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:11,880
information a little bit on mobile core

90
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:19,030
protocols and how it's done so the

91
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:23,110
concept is when you have your mobile

92
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,680
phone you have your mobile data settings

93
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,800
in there so you're of course your

94
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,260
provider which you connect to and your

95
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,419
mobile data settings so which APN so

96
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:37,030
access point name you use and what kind

97
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:41,050
of mms proxy for example you use it's

98
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,169
only a mobile phone but how does that go

99
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:48,010
through the network first of all you

100
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,630
have your base stations in the network

101
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,780
and I don't know how big the networks in

102
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,449
the UK are but for the Netherlands per

103
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:58,979
example kpn has run at about 5,000 sites

104
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:03,520
where they put cells and each shell is

105
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,910
identified by its own identity

106
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,949
it's identified by its own unique number

107
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:12,010
and when you group them together you

108
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,050
have your routing area which is

109
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,919
controlled by either an RNC and 3G or a

110
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,000
base station controller for 2g or an LTE

111
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,949
it's somewhat different because each

112
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:26,380
base station has its own capability

113
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:30,039
control itself so when you put that

114
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:34,840
together you will have a mobile network

115
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,420
and each mobile network

116
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,840
across the globe has its own mobile

117
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,670
specific identifier which is called the

118
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,250
mobile country code for Netherlands is 2

119
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,540
or 0 in the UK it's 2 3 4

120
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,240
so each network in the UK is identified

121
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,130
by MCC 2 3 4 and each operator within

122
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,710
those countries has its own mobile

123
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,760
network code which is for KP n 0 0

124
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,820
I'm not know I don't know them by heart

125
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,950
for the UK but they all have their own

126
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:12,640
code and this is how your mobile

127
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,640
communicates with the network so you put

128
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,210
in your text but then again in

129
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:22,420
underneath it will be translated to

130
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,100
these kinds of information

131
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:30,820
this kinds of information if you compare

132
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,010
the size for the Netherlands to to the

133
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:37,240
UK I've I've looked up the the table for

134
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,620
the for the UK it's more or less the

135
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,840
same it's it's a little bit longer but

136
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,490
these are all the mobile networks in the

137
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,580
Netherlands and for a small country it's

138
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:56,380
quite a lot I can tell you so so this is

139
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,960
your setup in your mobile phone so you

140
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,430
put in your APN name your MMS instances

141
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:09,400
and it's on your in your mobile phone

142
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,700
you have your your MZ your your SIM card

143
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,460
and this is your unique identifier at

144
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,980
with this unique identifier you make a

145
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,140
connection to the network and then you

146
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,590
will be able you can see here the the

147
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,120
mobile network code mobile country code

148
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,250
dot GPRS or drop 3gpp networks org with

149
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,190
this specific code you will make a data

150
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,080
connection to the network and this and

151
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,990
at this point at this point in time the

152
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:44,850
network exactly knows what to do with it

153
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,610
so when you turn reform you make a

154
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,160
connection to the network

155
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,009
and you start browsing the mobile phone

156
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:58,079
will make a connection to the gateway in

157
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,930
the network and then the the gateway

158
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,350
strips off any specific mobile

159
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,810
identifiers and just and make sense of

160
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,519
the traffic out to the to the internet

161
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,139
or any pick a data network you're

162
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:12,630
connected to there are some some

163
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,100
companies who have their own specific

164
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:20,459
APNs for their to connect their company

165
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,850
networks to people just roaming around

166
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,649
in the country so they can easily

167
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:28,110
maintain stuff or something else or get

168
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:33,209
to the office network so the elements

169
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:36,839
used in setting up a connection are of

170
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:40,949
course your your BTS your notes your

171
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:43,680
home location register where every

172
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,690
subscription is held it's just like a

173
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,930
big database where every MZ is

174
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,209
registered with any kind of service you

175
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:55,230
are allowed to use serving the GPRS

176
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,139
support node is a node who translate the

177
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,980
radio signal to a core signal and the

178
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,589
Gateway is just for stripping if

179
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:06,439
everything off and getting to the

180
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,329
regular IP networks and then of course

181
00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:11,240
you have your domain name server

182
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,130
internally in the mobile networks we use

183
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:18,420
domain name service to to route our API

184
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,000
ends so every APN has a specific IP

185
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,980
address going along with that and then

186
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,959
you have something in between which

187
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:30,180
glues it all together which is of course

188
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:35,180
the network and your protocols so

189
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:40,970
getting to the specific parts for mobile

190
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:45,360
so the 3gpp invented the gtp protocol

191
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,459
which stands for GPRS tunneling protocol

192
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:53,430
and it's a UDP based protocol and it

193
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:57,000
only communicates between your sgsn and

194
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,670
your GDS and so you're you're serving

195
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,870
GPRS node and your

196
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:05,730
okay by GPS now so this is how it all

197
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,820
ties together so you put on your mobile

198
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,080
phone you send some data the BTS station

199
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,820
will make a connection to the serving

200
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,580
gate it's serving depress support node

201
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:22,890
serving GPRS support node will then ask

202
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,580
the HLR well is this subscriber allowed

203
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,830
to use the data service and if it does

204
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:34,050
then it's the missing the DNS here

205
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:38,339
somewhere the the GDS and we'll asked as

206
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:40,650
resemble a sturdiness so what kind of

207
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:44,210
gateways should I use and then the

208
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,950
Gateway will put on the package just out

209
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:47,960
on the Internet

210
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,650
so this is how it nationally works every

211
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:55,670
mobile operator has this kind of network

212
00:11:55,670 --> 00:12:01,890
more or less so when you look at the gtp

213
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:06,270
stack so the gtp protocol it was

214
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:10,020
introduced in 90-89 just before we

215
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,740
launched GPRS in 1990 and it has several

216
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,160
flavors you have up until now for with

217
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,400
4G included you have three different

218
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,020
types of dvdp protocols

219
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,870
this part is maintained by the mobile

220
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,050
operator and the upper level is just

221
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,360
your plain IP what you also would have

222
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,700
on the internet so your you user traffic

223
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,640
your whatsapp whatsapp messages your

224
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,740
Facebook your browsing your mail

225
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:46,770
whatever so what I just said the gtp

226
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:50,130
protocol has three versions the first

227
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,520
instance was udp-based and it was on

228
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,160
port 3306

229
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,339
version one introduced two new ports so

230
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:02,160
you will have your control plane so

231
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,740
which is telling the network what to do

232
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,260
with your virtual traffic and it resides

233
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,040
on port 21 23 and all your user data is

234
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,790
in

235
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,640
21:52 so all your your

236
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:19,640
male internet whatever is all on 21:52

237
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,220
for the 4G network they only decided

238
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,620
that then needed a new control plane so

239
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,579
they upgraded gtp to GDP version 2 and

240
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:32,670
its results also on the same port if

241
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,290
there are any questions in between just

242
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:38,010
ask by the way so this is the header for

243
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:41,610
the gtp protocol in the header you have

244
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,399
your specific type of protocol it can

245
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,430
either be gtp or GT P Prime and gtp

246
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,100
prime is mostly used for billing

247
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,250
services so internally because you are a

248
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,600
mobile operator we want to earn some

249
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,019
money and if you're putting data through

250
00:13:58,019 --> 00:13:59,610
the network we want to get something out

251
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,769
of that so that says it's their TTP

252
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:05,370
prime used for there's a version field

253
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:08,100
in the header could be either 1 or 2 and

254
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,720
this in this case because the gtp

255
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,640
version 1 it it's 1 then you have the

256
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:20,240
set of messages and that can be well a

257
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,310
whole bunch of messages

258
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:25,170
the most common are create delete and

259
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:28,709
update so when you put on your phone and

260
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:30,209
you make a connection it will create a

261
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:32,310
PP contact set into the division and you

262
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,410
will get a connection to the internet if

263
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:39,180
you are allowed the most used in this

264
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,310
case so what we see at this point in

265
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:45,230
time cause not that many operators are

266
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,660
having a live 4G network currently the

267
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,240
most gtp versions we see running across

268
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,279
the network is gtp version 1 and since

269
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,529
he need the network needs no which

270
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:02,329
teaches n2 to get its traffic to and

271
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:06,720
each tunnel or each header is also your

272
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,680
gtp eternal endpoint so from your mobile

273
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,690
phone throughout the network you have

274
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:16,860
your own specific user tunnel getting

275
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,480
through the DDA's N and then you're out

276
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,050
in the open and this is how it looks

277
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,390
like when you put why shock because why

278
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,930
shark is well aware of gtp so you will

279
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:28,200
see

280
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,130
the same identifiers here the type of

281
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:36,360
protocol you use the version which goes

282
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:44,220
along with that the port which it runs

283
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,550
on and also the the specific message

284
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,579
type in this case is just a transport

285
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:52,709
PDU so the connection is already set up

286
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:55,230
and it's the user data who's pushed what

287
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,670
she's pushed through the through the

288
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,550
network and there it goes your tunnel

289
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:04,560
endpoint identifier just below there yes

290
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,949
there there you go so white shark is

291
00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:11,970
quite aware of how gtp works that makes

292
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,940
it interesting these are all the

293
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,420
information elements which are in the

294
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,889
[Music]

295
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:24,240
gtp create p2p context message so what

296
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,240
could be of interest for an intelligence

297
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,269
service to look at well could be the APN

298
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:31,889
to the access point name if you would

299
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:35,690
want to know something about a specific

300
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:40,290
company which use GPRS of course you are

301
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,930
MZ because that ties in to you or to

302
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:47,070
your mobile phone and user address could

303
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:51,720
be of interest could be use a location

304
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:58,019
information hey so gtp is aware of your

305
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:02,790
user location I have to say user

306
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,849
location isn't a mandatory field in the

307
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:07,530
GDP in GDP

308
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:11,309
it's a optional field but I see many

309
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:16,679
providers use and use locations and your

310
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:20,099
mi u mi is like your MAC address for

311
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:22,010
your mobile phone so it's a specific

312
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:25,290
unique number for your mobile phone with

313
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:27,059
that unique number you can identify

314
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:32,510
which yep

315
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:39,090
yeah you're talking about a cell yep so

316
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:43,440
um is your your specific unique hardware

317
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,820
address for your mobile phone so how

318
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:52,890
does the TTP setup a connection so yep

319
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:57,060
the I Susan will ask the DNS I have this

320
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,550
a paean can you please give me a I P

321
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,940
address to root my traffic to the DNS

322
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,460
response back to the SEO Zen with the

323
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,800
correct gateway address the s and then

324
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,380
do does a create PDP context message to

325
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:19,320
the design decision checks the user it

326
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,440
also checks your per example quality of

327
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,230
service it's a slightly different

328
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,030
quality of service than we are used to

329
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,070
in the internet it if you'd been with me

330
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:32,670
you used to allow or use to get from

331
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,710
your subscription so how much been put

332
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,920
you are allowed to use and it will pass

333
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,200
it on to the G's and so okay that's fine

334
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,960
come on with the traffic and then your

335
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,270
start browsing and start what's

336
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,850
happening facebooking whatever and it's

337
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,720
possible pass through to the network and

338
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,540
I've also response of course otherwise

339
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,750
you'll screen will keep blank and as

340
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,370
soon as you're finished it will send

341
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,830
delete p2p contacts back to the DSN

342
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:05,850
which will tear down the connection this

343
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:08,280
is in essence how a mobile data

344
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,890
connection works in a mobile network or

345
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:16,410
the core part at least so and then you

346
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,350
start flying in getting abroad and you

347
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,730
will bring your phone you're going going

348
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,610
on holidays so where does the GPS

349
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:27,090
roaming exchange ties in then so you see

350
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:32,550
here - two mobile networks one in the UK

351
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:40,190
and bt has mobile fo called 776 IC and

352
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,290
yeah let's make connection to the

353
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,980
Netherland so I'm here I'm

354
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,650
roaming and I want to tell the wife you

355
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:51,570
know what's up how great it is here yeah

356
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:55,030
so the Sen from the from BT will

357
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:58,270
interrogate the HLR at kpn saying oh I

358
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,820
had this guy over at London and he wants

359
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,049
to make a connection is he allowed to

360
00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:09,370
and yes I am so then I said um then I I

361
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:12,130
put out my whatsapp message get to the

362
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,380
as user and a citizen so okay this is

363
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,630
just an internet connection this is the

364
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,540
gateway address I know but then it hits

365
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:24,130
the end of the BT network and it should

366
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:27,490
go through and then I get up but there

367
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,770
is a networking between which ties up

368
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,679
all the mobile network operators across

369
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:35,679
the globe and that network which carries

370
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,230
the traffic is the G or X so it's a

371
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:42,520
globally it's a global network and every

372
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,820
mobile operator who allows roaming has a

373
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,740
mobile data roaming has a connection to

374
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:53,380
the grx there's not one GX provider

375
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,080
there are several and they all have

376
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,570
their own specific to your X network and

377
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:04,870
mostly what they do is just they're

378
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:08,710
quite big till one carriers and they

379
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,590
just grab a part of the existing network

380
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:15,250
for that t-rex has evolved and

381
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,700
eventually the GSMA decided that it

382
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,010
shouldn't carry more than just only data

383
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:23,320
traffic so now they have a new set up

384
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:28,809
which is called IP X and it's the IP

385
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:31,000
exchange network for mobile operates and

386
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,330
you can carry on you can carry there for

387
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:38,340
example LTE signaling of force traffic

388
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,900
eventually because 4G doesn't have a

389
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,500
dedicated voice service it's all packet

390
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,230
switched and for every part you you

391
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,960
every which every service which a mobile

392
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,640
operator use you have a different part

393
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,690
of in the IPX network any questions on

394
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:58,179
this quick run-through to

395
00:21:58,179 --> 00:22:03,669
mobile core networks was that that clear

396
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:09,189
Wow with mark okay well this is a list

397
00:22:09,189 --> 00:22:12,369
of the biggest biggest directs providers

398
00:22:12,369 --> 00:22:16,059
and as you can see we also are Jewish

399
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:20,939
provided with our company I basis and

400
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,229
this is more or less location where

401
00:22:23,229 --> 00:22:28,469
there resides but like I basis they have

402
00:22:28,469 --> 00:22:32,799
around the globe for pops Singapore Hong

403
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:41,189
Kong States and in Europe so alright so

404
00:22:41,189 --> 00:22:44,469
Steven we will now get you to through

405
00:22:44,469 --> 00:22:47,559
our research how we took it on

406
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:53,349
ok thanks Rob for that right so so you

407
00:22:53,349 --> 00:22:56,049
now have some background on grx what's

408
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:58,929
about and how it hangs together so now

409
00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:01,149
we're gonna look at some gtp traffic so

410
00:23:01,149 --> 00:23:04,449
this is so going back to the main reason

411
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:09,849
why agh GCHQ allegedly hacked Bobeck on

412
00:23:09,849 --> 00:23:12,219
us to actually do a man in middle of the

413
00:23:12,219 --> 00:23:14,499
routers and the grx to get some

414
00:23:14,499 --> 00:23:17,679
information so from here we're gonna

415
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,259
have a look at what in it what's what's

416
00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:21,969
the really interesting information is in

417
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:25,179
it and and then from there on how we get

418
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:25,569
to it

419
00:23:25,569 --> 00:23:30,399
so why shark so this sort of traffic is

420
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:33,579
captured on the grx router itself okay

421
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:37,979
so if you have a look at it you've got

422
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,259
you've got the endpoints here so these

423
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:48,029
are the IP addresses of the ggs ends so

424
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:50,949
yeah where the tunnels are built right

425
00:23:50,949 --> 00:23:54,909
and then the user endpoints of these so

426
00:23:54,909 --> 00:23:56,829
the ten address is probably the handset

427
00:23:56,829 --> 00:24:00,309
of your mobile phone and the 66 thought

428
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:03,579
whatever is in fact the destination so

429
00:24:03,579 --> 00:24:05,829
if you in this case the use of payload

430
00:24:05,829 --> 00:24:09,759
is actually like a DNS query so it's

431
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:11,399
doing a dns request the

432
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:13,859
the sixty six point two eight is the DNS

433
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:16,409
server in this case that's where the how

434
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:18,919
it looks now

435
00:24:19,789 --> 00:24:24,289
right so sorry well it's traffic so then

436
00:24:24,289 --> 00:24:28,919
dump it on the some sort of network

437
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:32,309
forensics traffic software like you know

438
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:35,070
or minor in this case I can use others

439
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:39,859
and you can see that all the frames load

440
00:24:39,859 --> 00:24:41,909
but you can't really see a lot of user

441
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:47,509
day use a plane traffic this yeah so

442
00:24:47,509 --> 00:24:51,059
there's no yeah you don't see much at

443
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:53,429
all in fact it's all not no packets that

444
00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:57,839
it can recognize so what do we need to

445
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:01,320
do so because the traffic is within a

446
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,049
GDP tunnel you have to really strip the

447
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:07,409
gtp heather's to see it so I spoke to

448
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:10,739
garden team his name is Wesley he wears

449
00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:12,809
a black shirt with a different message

450
00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:15,479
every day like no kidding and this

451
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:19,639
anyone recognized what's on his shirt

452
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:23,580
yeah yeah yeah that's right it's it's

453
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:29,999
brain it's yeah so that's cool so

454
00:25:29,999 --> 00:25:31,080
he wears all these different black

455
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,999
shirts every day anyway so he basically

456
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:34,950
wrote G to be stripped which we'll share

457
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:39,029
out on yeah and distribute it basically

458
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:41,519
goes through the pika file gets for the

459
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:44,999
identifies different elements of the

460
00:25:44,999 --> 00:25:47,669
traffic and checks for different headers

461
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:50,489
and to make sure that it is the traffic

462
00:25:50,489 --> 00:25:52,499
then it strips it and rewrites it so

463
00:25:52,499 --> 00:25:53,989
just basically strips too

464
00:25:53,989 --> 00:25:58,529
so pretty cool and then now if I load

465
00:25:58,529 --> 00:26:01,799
the same traffic back onto network miner

466
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:05,129
I now see all sorts of information I get

467
00:26:05,129 --> 00:26:09,239
host details of the traffic I get

468
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:12,479
session information of course or where

469
00:26:12,479 --> 00:26:14,369
you been you know so it's it's like it's

470
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:15,690
just there right sis you know or the

471
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:19,820
clear tech stuff where you've been

472
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,309
obviously your images

473
00:26:22,309 --> 00:26:23,749
where you've been browsing what you've

474
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:27,679
been doing where you going to and of

475
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,450
course if you use clear text protocols

476
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,469
like FTP HTTP that's all in the clear so

477
00:26:33,469 --> 00:26:35,869
this is yeah so use the traffic

478
00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:37,429
information so whether you're on

479
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,609
Facebook or whatsapp or browsing some

480
00:26:40,609 --> 00:26:42,649
site and that's all basically basic you

481
00:26:42,649 --> 00:26:45,019
know network traffic that that's there

482
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:49,460
so that's interesting the other thing

483
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,169
that's interesting is location details

484
00:26:51,169 --> 00:26:54,700
so as Rob mentioned we're in the GTP

485
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,710
headers does the location details and

486
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:00,799
I'll go through them now so you've got

487
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:05,119
the MZ which which is there so that

488
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:09,559
identifies you your device anyway you've

489
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:11,960
got all the country codes and the mobile

490
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,119
network country codes and also the

491
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:17,109
location error codes so that pretty much

492
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:21,019
identifies where you are so within of

493
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:25,359
course the range of the the cell towers

494
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:28,549
and then of course you've got the IMEI

495
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:31,399
which is the as Rob said the unique sort

496
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,529
of MAC address for your device so that

497
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:35,989
is different obviously if you're an iOS

498
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:38,749
phone or a samsung phone and all that

499
00:27:38,749 --> 00:27:44,239
sort of stuff and so if I go sir so with

500
00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:49,489
the MCC MNC in in the local a location

501
00:27:49,489 --> 00:27:52,219
error code I found this website that you

502
00:27:52,219 --> 00:27:54,649
can basically plug the information in

503
00:27:54,649 --> 00:27:57,700
and that translates to coordinates

504
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:02,599
location so this is doing in it gives

505
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:05,119
you GPS coordinates GPS coordinates of

506
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:07,940
exactly where you are within that that

507
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:12,979
range so so now with this traffic once

508
00:28:12,979 --> 00:28:14,330
you once you're in there and you've

509
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:15,769
captured it you can see what you're

510
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:18,139
doing and where you are and and of

511
00:28:18,139 --> 00:28:25,789
course what what device you have so yeah

512
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:28,749
well you're in a Samsung your iOS phone

513
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:31,700
for example then it becomes very

514
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,499
interesting from a specific payload

515
00:28:33,499 --> 00:28:34,510
attack respect

516
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:37,240
so I know where you are I know what sort

517
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,919
of fun you're running then yeah I'm

518
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:40,720
gonna try if I'm gonna own you then I'm

519
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,640
gonna try some payload that's

520
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,970
appropriate so that's that was

521
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:52,390
interesting okay so that's why that's

522
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,730
why this information since was

523
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:57,820
interesting and we know what it is we

524
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,220
know who the grx providers are so the

525
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,290
next bit of our sort of thinking was

526
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:05,590
okay how easy would it be would be to

527
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:08,710
get to this to access this network so in

528
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:12,010
theory this is a closed Network this is

529
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:14,950
operators only accessible but in any

530
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:18,280
case we'll do some sort of landscape

531
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,110
sort of overview of it so let's see

532
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:22,740
what's out there

533
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:26,320
for the purpose of this research what we

534
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,130
did was essentially did the

535
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:31,450
reconnaissance part of his hope he'll

536
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:34,720
chain so it was pretty much Banach

537
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,190
grabbing and also yeah some limited port

538
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:45,700
scanning to identify systems okay so how

539
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,280
we started was we basically went into

540
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,640
the grx core and dumped the routing

541
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,970
table okay so it's fairly big well it's

542
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,370
the four point eight K subnets all up

543
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:00,340
with with about 10 to 20,000 address

544
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,370
space overall ok so that's how big that

545
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:08,020
looks like and then using mass mass can

546
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:11,290
anyone use it much yeah yes cool it's

547
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,990
it's a sink and it's pretty fast I

548
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:16,750
selected a few ports and started just AC

549
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:20,640
or what's open and what's out there

550
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:25,200
so I found we found it there's about

551
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,190
yeah

552
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:29,159
42,000 live house the combination of

553
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:32,850
open ports and ping requests ICMP and so

554
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:38,730
out of four point eight KS / 42 K that

555
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:39,600
doesn't make sense

556
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,679
oh yeah out of three hundred and twenty

557
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:49,499
thousand sorry yeah okay yes right let's

558
00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:54,779
look at this so gtp traffic is between

559
00:30:54,779 --> 00:31:01,109
GSN so if you look at the to identify gg

560
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:06,899
ehhhhh sense so gtp endpoints I sent we

561
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:11,700
can crafted the basic echo and reply out

562
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,940
basically a gtp request echo to send to

563
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,879
sense the GS ends if you have a look at

564
00:31:17,879 --> 00:31:21,720
it essentially the that's the request

565
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,440
the message type request and the reply

566
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,200
the response is that so I've got the

567
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,169
payload and yeah you send it off and of

568
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:33,059
course you get the reply to look that's

569
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:35,249
how we look look for the gtp endpoints

570
00:31:35,249 --> 00:31:40,619
and yeah to make it fast

571
00:31:40,619 --> 00:31:43,769
they use that map because anyone also

572
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:48,929
use that map it's it's very fast as they

573
00:31:48,929 --> 00:31:53,070
sink and it it can is ask this ability

574
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:55,799
to generate a --then it frames directly

575
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:57,659
and it sort of bypasses your IP stack so

576
00:31:57,659 --> 00:31:59,850
it's really fast it'll go gigabit so

577
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:03,179
wire speed yeah so using these

578
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:06,149
parameters it all except the probe

579
00:32:06,149 --> 00:32:10,879
arguments for UDP and then away it goes

580
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:14,609
so using this technique we found a whole

581
00:32:14,609 --> 00:32:18,809
bunch of G GSN and gtp ports and just to

582
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:21,809
confirm that it is talking as in if you

583
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:23,340
were to remember back what the Rob

584
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:27,059
showed you on the GT GPRS or gtp sort of

585
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:31,349
tunnel setup once you've identified the

586
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:34,289
end point you send a p2p context request

587
00:32:34,289 --> 00:32:36,570
and so

588
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:40,099
I used the protocol open G GSN and

589
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:44,539
within that there's a sgsn emulator

590
00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:48,359
which allows you to then query and test

591
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:50,639
the GS ends so it's pretty handy yeah

592
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:54,239
look it up if you're interested that's

593
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:56,549
the sort of command the default command

594
00:32:56,549 --> 00:32:59,099
you would send it there's a lot of

595
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:01,079
defaults or the parameters you send it

596
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:04,699
and in the first phase if it's a valid

597
00:33:04,699 --> 00:33:08,999
GG sent it'll respond with a right

598
00:33:08,999 --> 00:33:11,969
response so so from there at that point

599
00:33:11,969 --> 00:33:14,399
you know it's ready to talk and if you

600
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:15,809
have the right parameters whether you

601
00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:17,989
brute force it or have a legitimate

602
00:33:17,989 --> 00:33:21,239
parameters then you can establish the

603
00:33:21,239 --> 00:33:23,969
gtp tunnel so that's pretty much as far

604
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:28,919
as we got to verify the GS ends so

605
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:34,259
that's one thing there the other element

606
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:37,049
of the grx that's important is the dns

607
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:39,239
server because whenever you try when

608
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:41,609
you're about to create a connection it

609
00:33:41,609 --> 00:33:44,489
will clear your DNS lookup what the IP

610
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:45,719
address is and then go from there

611
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:48,359
so the NS is important so let's just

612
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:52,499
quickly go through that the the query

613
00:33:52,499 --> 00:33:55,199
looks like that so they the globally

614
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:58,679
agreed APN is internet dot with your MNC

615
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:01,909
for your network and your embassy

616
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:05,339
country code and then the response if

617
00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:09,480
it's a grx DNS server will look

618
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,199
something like that

619
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:13,049
and the IP address are all the rest of

620
00:34:13,049 --> 00:34:17,569
your G gSN's endpoints okay so that's

621
00:34:17,569 --> 00:34:19,918
yes so similar so you know what the NSS

622
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:25,799
was but just a little different ok so

623
00:34:25,799 --> 00:34:30,299
now we start thinking okay so we've we

624
00:34:30,299 --> 00:34:33,899
expect these systems to be there how

625
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:36,179
vulnerabilities so are they up to date

626
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:38,579
they're running all versions so we start

627
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:41,668
doing this bit of profiling in that

628
00:34:41,668 --> 00:34:45,018
perspective so purely based on banners

629
00:34:45,018 --> 00:34:49,049
from a DNS perspective normal that a big

630
00:34:49,049 --> 00:34:50,830
command to get

631
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,600
we found a whole bunch of DNS running

632
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,380
these versions and yeah they fell the

633
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,930
old this band versions got those for

634
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,230
those vulnerabilities this one versions

635
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:05,590
of Dawson and some overflow so yeah not

636
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:09,910
great but um gives you an idea of some

637
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:13,540
vulnerabilities there so that's the the

638
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:17,560
DNS servers now so so we thought what

639
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,320
else might may be there because in

640
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,020
theory you know in a you know ideal grx

641
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,990
network that's pretty much it right

642
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:27,490
Gigi's ads and DNS that's all we really

643
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:29,440
need to establish GTP channels for

644
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,990
arming but we started looking for normal

645
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:35,530
common services we found a whole lot of

646
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:39,100
mail service set it to make you this

647
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,010
this makes you wonder what does an SMTP

648
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:47,230
server doing in a transit network this

649
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,670
is no good

650
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:51,220
yes we're only a mobile specific

651
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,250
equipment should be in actually okay so

652
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:57,630
in terms of learner abilities that's

653
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:01,240
right we'll explore that's both code

654
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:06,730
execution that's also confusion that's

655
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,320
got overflow and some are really all

656
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,080
drive so some of these that send mail

657
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:16,630
893 is really old so that's no good so

658
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,490
we looked at some we also found some FTP

659
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:20,890
servers running around and they think

660
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:23,710
wow you know well that shouldn't be

661
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:26,140
there and certainly shouldn't be on grx

662
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,450
now yeah and it shouldn't be so old so

663
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:31,170
this remote remote core exact their

664
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:39,280
overflow now this is so it's on the G or

665
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:45,460
X network so inside inside okay so more

666
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:49,020
dos for that old ftp server version

667
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:53,860
overflow is there yeah and that so it's

668
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,410
it's pretty old again some dating back

669
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:59,830
to 2001 so that's kind of worrying of

670
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:01,920
course we didn't verify this

671
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,640
would exploits web servers at least

672
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,110
we're not telling you a lot of Pacis

673
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:13,050
some Microsoft is old again a little

674
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:16,830
code exec for that for Red Hat based

675
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:20,990
Apache code exact obviously for our is

676
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:28,790
5/6 old old very old HTTP brush server

677
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:33,090
yeah so it should yeah that becomes

678
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:35,730
fundamentally disturbing because they

679
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:38,280
shouldn't be here at all right we also

680
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,260
saw a lot of talent demons and you can

681
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,090
see this Alcatel stuff the sister

682
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:44,820
obviously Cisco far away away quickly

683
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:48,600
yeah then if you know them this when is

684
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:56,030
2k Windows XP nice old Solaris yeah so

685
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:59,490
it's starting to look like yeah really

686
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:03,600
mixed up then of course there's uh

687
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,420
there's a lot of SMB stuff as well right

688
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,600
so I just look so if we should

689
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,080
definitely not be there those who may

690
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,030
not know so we you know there's no

691
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:17,280
sessions you can enumerate information

692
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,410
without anonymously without real

693
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:23,340
credentials for it shares the various

694
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:27,360
versions of Samba and Windows and some

695
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:31,650
quite vulnerable and more

696
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:38,430
vulnerabilities there okay so yeah it's

697
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:43,530
it's really really mixed up just just an

698
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:47,340
example of null session enumeration so

699
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:50,580
if you have a sort of fairly bad to

700
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:53,790
configure SMB server you can get

701
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:57,570
password policies and and that's from a

702
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:00,600
real machine out there and and of course

703
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,310
share informations then from there on

704
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:03,720
you can start Bruce forcing and getting

705
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,410
at potential and authorized access right

706
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:10,770
so the other thing we thought was SMP is

707
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:13,210
interesting because that's

708
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:16,670
around and can reveal a lot of

709
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:20,350
information so with the private string

710
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:23,300
you can do a lot right you can start

711
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,950
things you can shut things there and you

712
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:29,120
can get all sorts of information so this

713
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,000
sort of stuff we found and just to make

714
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,170
it easier there's a host of iOS is

715
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:37,880
Rattus probably switches as well

716
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,270
thirty-five hundred twenty nine hundreds

717
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:44,510
you can get ways ericsson are my boss as

718
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:47,720
well so then that's using the private

719
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:51,610
string so presumably i could write to it

720
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:58,330
with with public string into it oops god

721
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:03,620
yeah windows hallway routers more

722
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:07,640
hallway stuff OS 5.0 this kind of

723
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,640
Solaris eight isn't it yeah so some

724
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,240
nitrous

725
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,990
so really badly misconfigured systems

726
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:18,620
out there right and Tandberg that's

727
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,730
interesting because that's kind of like

728
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:25,070
a conference phone so and some types of

729
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:28,150
modems okay

730
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:33,530
so this as a summary these are the

731
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:37,310
things that that we quickly found during

732
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:40,850
this light the survey these are a number

733
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:44,120
of instances of different services it's

734
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,770
out there and really the worst thing is

735
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:51,590
this is oops all across the internet and

736
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:55,820
so presumably lyrics should be a closed

737
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,580
network shouldn't have any connection to

738
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:02,630
the outside world and we verify this

739
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,910
house from within the grx as well so we

740
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:07,070
had to go through this permission to the

741
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:09,560
data center get all the checks limited

742
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,230
access and then we find the same host is

743
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:14,930
listening on the same service so really

744
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,300
it they're really mixing it up so

745
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:21,880
they're advertising routes in sorry yeah

746
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:34,550
yeah you were service no yeah just just

747
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:40,880
ban the base yeah alright so well

748
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,820
internet yeah so that's that's that's

749
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,820
actually really bad and so out of to the

750
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:50,390
42,000 live host is about five and a

751
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:52,430
half thousand house from over to and

752
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:55,090
operators reachable for the internet so

753
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:58,010
and then that's across all the different

754
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:01,820
kinds of services that's exposed and

755
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:05,570
well over 15 operators had gtp ports

756
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:08,090
expire so these are live G gSN's

757
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:12,710
accessible from the internet and we did

758
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,480
a responsible disclosure directly after

759
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:21,020
we we saw it so we all know them with

760
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:24,770
our findings from this research and from

761
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:28,660
this I think it was over run about 30

762
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:31,070
operators who were exposed on the

763
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:34,580
internet and how many operates do you

764
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:38,900
think responded no no that's not true

765
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:42,560
it some some are very responsive but no

766
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:48,980
it's not zero close fourth so from these

767
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:51,530
four operators or at least from the

768
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:52,940
third emails we sent four only four

769
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,440
responded with thanks for the

770
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,630
information we're gonna under down and

771
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:01,520
shut it down yeah so it doesn't bode

772
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,480
well for the the telco community is I

773
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,200
think there's a lack of awareness may be

774
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:11,030
certainly in how you configure things

775
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:13,070
how you divide your networks how you

776
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:15,580
harden things how you patch things so

777
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:19,850
yeah it's a bit scary so the message

778
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:22,640
really is that yeah you don't even have

779
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,790
to be in grx you can just hack something

780
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:28,280
pivot through and then you're in g RX g

781
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,820
RX o potentially

782
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,380
so I've got a quick conclusion then

783
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,000
we've got some follow-up stuff as well

784
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,660
so okay so jerks traffic is definitely

785
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,270
interesting there's a lot of data and

786
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:45,000
location information that yeah that's

787
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,910
really valuable for everyone

788
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:51,360
grx is really not that close due to

789
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:55,110
mainly miss configuration I imagine it's

790
00:43:55,110 --> 00:44:00,750
a lot lower operators exposed a little

791
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:03,450
house there mainly miss configuration is

792
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:06,030
all the old stuff that we used to see in

793
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:10,310
IT infrastructure many years ago and

794
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:13,680
yeah the lack of filtering and and this

795
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,650
best best practices just slacking from

796
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:18,990
that perspective yeah

797
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,600
need more testing more awareness more

798
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:25,500
coming to these conferences I think okay

799
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,170
some best practices you would all know

800
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:32,090
this just you know patch update hardened

801
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:36,890
and for bgp specific you really need to

802
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:40,380
they're not advertised grx routes to the

803
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,420
internet so they can't get to it from

804
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,369
the internet

805
00:44:43,369 --> 00:44:46,830
yeah use bgp identification except

806
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:49,820
routes only from your from your

807
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,660
providers that you have roaming

808
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:54,270
agreements with because then their use

809
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:55,890
can wrong with you and you know really

810
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:58,590
restrict it in terms the ingress

811
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:01,440
filtering yeah so the two you really

812
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,130
only need gtp in you need dns in and you

813
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:09,320
need ICMP for troubleshooting that is it

814
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,210
block everything else and the other

815
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,730
thing is which we're looking at as well

816
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:17,580
is the application specific firewalls

817
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:20,970
that's does GT PSEG you know Damodar

818
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:22,859
where so that you can do payload

819
00:45:22,859 --> 00:45:26,460
inspection validation all that sort of

820
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:30,090
good stuff okay follow-up actions so

821
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:33,210
since the original talk as Rob said we

822
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:37,130
spoke to a few the operators exposed

823
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:39,300
we're still working with some to help

824
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,300
them understand why you need to filter

825
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,710
things off while you mr. Harlan things

826
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:47,680
and then we also did a rescan to see you

827
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,930
know what's what's changed the last

828
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:55,210
three months the pluses mean that there

829
00:45:55,210 --> 00:46:00,250
are actually more ports exposed so

830
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:03,310
there's more DCP ports exposed there's

831
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:06,400
more telco processed so clearly people

832
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,740
are installing more GTS ends and you

833
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:11,430
know mobile software for T networks yeah

834
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:15,390
but the minuses mean there are less so

835
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:18,750
this is actually nearly like oops

836
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:23,680
60% yeah nearly over 50% less instances

837
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,020
across the protocol so maybe the last

838
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:31,359
talk had some effect we don't know in

839
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,339
terms of gtp exposure I sort of plotted

840
00:46:33,339 --> 00:46:35,589
the operators that are concerned the

841
00:46:35,589 --> 00:46:40,000
mostly Africa Asia couple in Central

842
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:40,510
America

843
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:44,980
oops yeah sorry here yeah there's only

844
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:49,060
one in Germany that I saw and then the

845
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:51,040
one in the middle is kind of Kazakhstan

846
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,150
but yeah so Western Europe's pretty good

847
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:56,740
but yes that's kind of distribution of

848
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:59,619
miss configurations for GTP's would you

849
00:46:59,619 --> 00:47:02,710
two be ports right what else have you

850
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:05,980
been doing we're working with testing a

851
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:08,230
GTA sense we're doing fuzzing we're

852
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:10,510
doing exploit development because to

853
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:12,369
help the vendors there are research so

854
00:47:12,369 --> 00:47:15,609
we'll have follow-up activities on that

855
00:47:15,609 --> 00:47:17,890
this is not a lot of research and

856
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:21,130
testing done for GGO sense and in that

857
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:23,920
and those sort of mobile sort of telecom

858
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,330
tell the equipment so we're doing that

859
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:30,970
watch the space we're talking to a few

860
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:33,190
vendors who have telco specific

861
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:35,320
firewalls so it's on the checkpoint and

862
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,550
40 net who say they have all these

863
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:41,290
application filtering they'll do

864
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:42,970
validation so we're testing that and

865
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:46,119
make sure the claim is right so yeah and

866
00:47:46,119 --> 00:47:48,700
if it's good we'll we'll work with them

867
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:53,080
so definitely we're writing yeah some

868
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:56,200
auxilary modules so you'll be it will

869
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,490
release our soon

870
00:47:57,490 --> 00:47:59,260
we're getting that checked yes so you

871
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:03,400
can look for GTV with yourself and I

872
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,830
will put some payload and so be easier

873
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:09,490
to find and test so we'll watch out for

874
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:15,850
that as well and yeah so this is the GX

875
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:21,400
is actually a part which is provided by

876
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,170
the G as an adjacent I stands for GSM

877
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:27,160
Association so every or all mobile

878
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,110
providers grouped together in this

879
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:33,310
association - to make the the networks

880
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,710
better and to be more secure and to

881
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:39,060
provide more services for the customers

882
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:43,740
we've looked into the RS 77 as it was

883
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:47,800
when we did the tests so actually it

884
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:53,350
states thou shalt take care of its from

885
00:48:53,350 --> 00:49:00,240
2007 you see - it take care of integrity

886
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,609
confidentiality and availability that's

887
00:49:03,609 --> 00:49:07,930
actually in in a in three words what

888
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:10,240
this document was all about it doesn't

889
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,450
give you any specific directions any

890
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:18,190
pacific requirements so as a mobile

891
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:22,869
operator I think you get lost so we had

892
00:49:22,869 --> 00:49:24,970
this conversation also with the GSMA so

893
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:27,130
what guys you know we did some testing

894
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,350
and we found this what do you think of

895
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:32,200
it well there were they were very eager

896
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:36,220
to listen to our presentation so that we

897
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:42,130
did and if it's coincidence I don't know

898
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:43,660
but there's going to be a revised

899
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:45,940
version of the RS 77 so new and improved

900
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:49,540
and actually when you look in the

901
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:51,520
document they really made an effort to

902
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:55,740
to make it more understandable for

903
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:58,690
mobile operators who don't know very

904
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:03,369
much of of IP so they really made an

905
00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:05,350
effort to get real good work

906
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:07,770
instructions in there so the pros are

907
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:11,060
also the old Arya 77 was

908
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:14,330
binding so you can around as a

909
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:18,380
mobile operator and they won't hunt you

910
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:21,110
down and let you fix your so what

911
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:23,870
to do now is it they have a large

912
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:26,930
section in the r77 which is binding so

913
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:28,730
they will come up with binding security

914
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:30,500
requirements every that every provider

915
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,380
has to comply to and they also included

916
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:36,740
best practices eventually so that's good

917
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:40,820
the cons is it's still not as detailed

918
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:42,740
as you would like it to be so people who

919
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:45,590
don't understand IP directly or in that

920
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:48,170
sense the bits and bytes they still can

921
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:51,410
make mistakes and there are no testing

922
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:54,320
guidelines which could be which con can

923
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,880
come in handy if you want to test your

924
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,910
network yourself and there is no

925
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:02,540
monitoring or enforcing so I have have

926
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:05,450
to tell the GSMA well this is an

927
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:07,700
operator who doesn't do his work

928
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:10,280
correctly as you stated in your RNA 77

929
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,230
so I don't think many operators will do

930
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:17,530
that we we are now in discussion for the

931
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:21,610
second bullet so we'll put in our own

932
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:25,190
testing what we did ourselves to put in

933
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:28,040
there so people are other mobile

934
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,960
operators are also capable of doing

935
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:34,700
their own tests so yeah we are slowly

936
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:38,650
getting there but we're not there yet so

937
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:45,080
yeah some questions yeah yeah that's

938
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:49,029
that's us thank you and any questions

939
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:07,890
if for your understanding

940
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:11,880
BTSs are not on the durricks so only

941
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,979
mobile core equipment so your essays and

942
00:52:13,979 --> 00:52:15,809
your titties and your dns you should be

943
00:52:15,809 --> 00:52:25,979
in there no no no no no there is an

944
00:52:25,979 --> 00:52:28,709
agreement between the Jews and mobile

945
00:52:28,709 --> 00:52:30,839
oppressed we didn't tell you that but

946
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:33,779
there is an agreement with mobile

947
00:52:33,779 --> 00:52:37,410
operators energies ma that you identify

948
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:42,660
a specific piece of IP space for grx

949
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:46,559
purposes that you have to write down in

950
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:52,410
your roaming agreements so you have to

951
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:54,299
tell the GUI and your other roaming

952
00:52:54,299 --> 00:52:57,029
partners this is a specific IP range are

953
00:52:57,029 --> 00:52:57,900
used for grx

954
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:02,869
nothing else which should be in there so

955
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:20,940
by office explain why

956
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:35,080
these range extenders essentially there

957
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,750
should be no radio equipment connected

958
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:44,350
to GX so so that's the range extenders

959
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:52,780
you would find there any questions no

960
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:56,050
more questions okay yeah thank you very

961
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:56,900
much for your attention

962
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,790
[Applause]

963
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:03,029
