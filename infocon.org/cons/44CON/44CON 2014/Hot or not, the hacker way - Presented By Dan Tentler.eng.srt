1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,500
so yeah I don't hack away so last week I

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,150
had this epiphany which basically

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,099
information security is like monkey

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:09,599
island for anybody that's played any of

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,969
those like old-school lucasfilm or

6
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:12,690
LucasArts

7
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,849
point-and-click adventure games where

8
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,590
basically the solution to the game is to

9
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,880
rub it everything against everything

10
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,430
else to find the solution and I was like

11
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,840
holy that's exactly what we do an

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,430
InfoSec we just like take everything and

13
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,830
robertiello look shells right so I

14
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:31,349
thought so short bio my name's Dan I'm

15
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:33,989
vist on Twitter I'm a co-founder of a

16
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:35,670
small company called Carbon dynamics we

17
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,640
do like Red Team pen test stuff I did 10

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,620
years has assisted men architect person

19
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,960
and then ragequit how to InfoSec I've

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,239
been doing InfoSec for like eight years

21
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,440
I've done some talks I've gotten some

22
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,629
press but you guys aren't here for me

23
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:50,340
you're here for this thing so we'll get

24
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,550
to it right so who who didn't think that

25
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,469
was cool like who who hasn't seen

26
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:57,090
predator right everybody saw this in the

27
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,879
80s and was like that's right

28
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,609
so you know you go and you look and it's

29
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:05,670
barrier to entry he's like 30 grand like

30
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,229
well you can't really mess around with

31
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:09,840
it and how do you come up with 30 grand

32
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,790
and like this was three or four years

33
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,710
ago I'm like what do you do so I figured

34
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,360
well you know I ran BarCamp San Diego

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,830
for like seven years and part of my

36
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,210
duties for running BarCamp was to

37
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,979
contact sponsors and basically beg for

38
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,780
money so I tried to put some of that

39
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,990
skill to use and I emailed Fleur and I

40
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,990
said hey you know I'm this no-name

41
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,909
random guy in San Diego and I want to

42
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:30,869
borrow one of your really expensive

43
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:32,850
cameras and do a bunch of security

44
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,020
research with it I want to see how it

45
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,189
applies to different things I have this

46
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:37,530
long list of like two dozen tests I want

47
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,409
to try would you be you know you know

48
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:41,759
would you be kind enough to loan me a

49
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,950
camera for the purposes of the research

50
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,880
and a very kind of very friendly lady

51
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,590
named Haley responded to me and

52
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,909
basically told me I don't know if you

53
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:52,439
can read probably can't read that it

54
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,450
basically says the important part is a

55
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,130
second line well we're in discussion on

56
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,210
whether or not the camera would be able

57
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,070
to see heat from computers sorry Haley

58
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:04,290
like they tell sorry Fleur Fleur tells

59
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,180
me that I can't do that so here's a

60
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,890
picture of me doing that with Fleur

61
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,090
right so great

62
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,550
good job so how do you do that well

63
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,810
that's kind of cool

64
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:17,130
in on in November of 2013 this guy I

65
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,410
think his name is Mike did this article

66
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,319
where he's an eevblog guy so he's his

67
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,580
whole thing is like oscilloscopes and

68
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,930
hardware stuff like him in my Cosman

69
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,270
probably get along really well and he

70
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,170
bought one of these things and he took

71
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,819
it apart he realized it's just a tiny

72
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:34,160
little embedded window seee device and

73
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,510
they took it apart and they did a whole

74
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,560
bunch of hacking to it and they found

75
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,580
out that it's got a whole bunch of

76
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,739
horrific ly bad security and floor

77
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:42,450
basically phoned it in no it's not to

78
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,890
say that you know a device like this

79
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,090
really needs a lot of security because

80
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,140
outside of the photos that are on it

81
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,340
there's not really a lot of sensitive

82
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,630
stuff there but it was an interesting

83
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,269
thing to be sure so I read about it and

84
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:58,170
then on eevblog like 400 or something

85
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,019
500 pages into the single thread on this

86
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:04,290
device was a guy had basically figured

87
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,489
out that hey they used the same sensor

88
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:10,709
on this model as they do in the $8,000

89
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:20,400
model that really do they now so I had

90
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,670
to have one right so essentially yeah a

91
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,859
bunch of nerds like showed up the info

92
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:27,209
sucked communities like what GE nerds

93
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:30,750
that and I I say that lightly right I'm

94
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,859
friends with a lot of you a lot of these

95
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:33,959
guys but they don't have any background

96
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,730
and security there their objective here

97
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:36,959
was not to like break things and get

98
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,790
shells and like circumvent security

99
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:39,989
controls they were just playing around

100
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:43,920
so props to these guys however this is

101
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,180
how I imagine what Fleur was doing

102
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,150
because the first hack was basically

103
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,130
editing a text file you download like

104
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,959
you plug this thing in via USB and it

105
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:53,549
gives you an FTP interface like

106
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:56,040
hilariously you can FTP into it and once

107
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,109
you FTP in it's a Windows environment

108
00:03:58,109 --> 00:03:59,549
and you have to PN you pull off one

109
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:01,680
config file you change some texts in the

110
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,650
config file like literally you change

111
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,150
ee4 which is this model number to e8

112
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,739
which is the fancy model number and send

113
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:09,569
the text file back to the thing pull the

114
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:11,040
battery out put the battery back in and

115
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,150
now you have 16 times the resolution so

116
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,709
I have screenshots of that in a minute

117
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:21,060
but basically the the hack was changing

118
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,099
a text file and and the sensor they use

119
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:24,479
in this it was the same sensor they use

120
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,509
in the EA

121
00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:27,490
which is 320 by 240 and this is

122
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,870
advertised to be an 80 by 60 sensor so

123
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,430
it's going back and forth since they

124
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,389
Fleur found out that the eevblog people

125
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:40,449
had hacked the device and they went and

126
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:43,330
got all the stock and inventory out on

127
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,250
shelves and brick-and-mortar stores back

128
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,199
they had to ship it all back to Sweden I

129
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,479
guess wherever Fleur is to read to be

130
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:51,849
retrofitted with new firmware so they

131
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:53,409
reflashed it to try and make it more

132
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:54,819
secure in the way they try to make it

133
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:57,460
more secure to take that one text file

134
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,560
that has the configure name and CRC it

135
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,000
against the serial number of the device

136
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,979
and that didn't take them long to figure

137
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:05,020
out they figured out the text file just

138
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,789
needed to be tweaked a little bit to be

139
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:07,900
a certain file size and to have a

140
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,729
certain CRC and then somebody put a

141
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:12,669
Python script on the on the forum to do

142
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:14,199
that to fix it and that's when I jumped

143
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:16,090
in and I was like okay cool Reesey rc8

144
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,610
BAM unlocked happy and since then it's

145
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,750
gotten a little bit more complex but

146
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,550
it's really obviously that it's really

147
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,199
obvious that Fleur is kind of phoning it

148
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,870
in they're just adding these tiny thin

149
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,759
layers of like I guess you could call it

150
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,560
security like the next fix that they try

151
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,780
to do is to try and obfuscate the config

152
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,940
files that it wasn't plaintext anymore

153
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,979
and it was like it encoded in some way

154
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:37,900
and then just found out a way to decode

155
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,169
it

156
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:39,580
it wasn't even encrypted it was like

157
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,979
straight up not quite base64 but it was

158
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:44,199
not readable text so to the best of my

159
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,659
ability to guess and make Fleur is not a

160
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:47,770
poor company if you go back and look at

161
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,080
these like screenshots of like the stuff

162
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,270
that goes on eBay but that's a hundred

163
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,560
thousand dollars for a single thing

164
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,880
right so they're making a hundred grand

165
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,289
off of one piece of equipment like

166
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,630
they're not poor they don't have to

167
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:02,310
phone it in if they don't want right so

168
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,479
my guess is they're just stalling for

169
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,849
some reason so needless to say when I

170
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:08,560
got my hands on it was basically this I

171
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,360
mean a little bit more walking than that

172
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,529
but yeah it's basically me walk around

173
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:12,729
everything carrying this thing a river

174
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:13,960
for two months just pointing at it all

175
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,169
sorts of stuff I do find it very

176
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:18,819
hilarious oh that was crippled in in

177
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:20,469
software though so that was like yay for

178
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:21,969
Fleur for crippling and software instead

179
00:06:21,969 --> 00:06:24,099
of like doing it properly but yeah I

180
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:25,270
basically just brought it everywhere and

181
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,099
pointed at everything for a while so the

182
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:28,719
first finding of note was like the

183
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:31,659
difference between 80 by 60 and 320 by

184
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:33,699
240 like I did I changed the resolution

185
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:35,259
here a little bit hopefully it's not

186
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:36,789
affecting it too much but like it should

187
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:38,000
be a very egregiously

188
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,700
obvious different difference in

189
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,910
resolution between 80 by 60 and 320 320

190
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,710
by 240 because mathematically it's a 6

191
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:49,490
16 times more resolution so the second

192
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,840
finding of note was that there is a lot

193
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,910
of extra modes that get set up on the

194
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,680
thing and this mode in particular is a

195
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,230
mode that detects condensation so this

196
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:02,120
is a glass of beer and the green section

197
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,550
of the photo is anything that's below 48

198
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,930
point seven degrees which I guess is

199
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,280
some temperature that they've figured

200
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,870
out that's when hard services condense

201
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,210
so essentially what you get when you

202
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,100
hack this device is you get a new

203
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,680
menuing system some extra modes 16 times

204
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,530
resolution there's some there's some

205
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,000
extra stuff in there I'll get to later

206
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,950
that that you don't have like the book

207
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,620
they use the same PCB and this as in the

208
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,810
e8 but in the e8 they have like you get

209
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,970
Wi-Fi and get some other stuff this one

210
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,200
can't do video and the other one can

211
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,360
things like that so TL DR and that is

212
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,830
this one cost a grand the other one cost

213
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,930
8 grand so buy this one and hack it

214
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,550
instead of paying a grand for the big

215
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,270
one so anyway on to the meat right so

216
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,979
the first thing I decided was these are

217
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:48,770
some of the items from the list that I

218
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,000
submitted to Fleur when I wrote them in

219
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,040
2010 I said hey I want to do a bunch of

220
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,270
these things and a lot of it worse you

221
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,740
know can you detect if somebody's been

222
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,810
messing with a lock can you see if

223
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,010
somebody's injecting packets into

224
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,960
wireless which is kind of mood at this

225
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,260
point because who uses WEP right like

226
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,380
all the attacks now don't deal with

227
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:10,520
spamming packets much so like here's a

228
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,050
great example so this is my gaming rig

229
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,590
like which one is doing the evil but you

230
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,700
can't really tell all right so you're

231
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,660
looking at these two pictures and you

232
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,620
like well the one on the right is

233
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,490
obviously brighter

234
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,380
that means it's obviously hotter and you

235
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,210
can tell by the temperature indicators

236
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,380
on the right-hand side of both frames

237
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,240
that yeah one's several degrees hotter

238
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,290
than the other and there's a little bit

239
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,940
of change there but you can't tell if

240
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,210
I'm just playing games or hacking

241
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,580
something or cracking passwords or what

242
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,919
the U key there's no you'd have to take

243
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,780
a baseline for every device and if you

244
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,070
have to do that it sort of defeats the

245
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,570
purpose of using it as a forensics tool

246
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,849
all right same kind of things like oh

247
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:45,530
that's kind of neat but it's kind of

248
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,270
disappointing right so here's a

249
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,940
Raspberry Pi

250
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,480
it's a Raspberry Pi

251
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,730
that's it you can't tell what it's doing

252
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,020
their temperature stays the same no

253
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,700
matter what the load is like

254
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,610
great thanks appreciate that another

255
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,660
thing I'll get to a little later in the

256
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,400
talk is there are people that have made

257
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,870
like lens attachments that you can

258
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,130
attach another thing like they 3d

259
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,620
printed a bezel that goes in here into

260
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,490
the front and you can buy zinc selenium

261
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,500
I think lenses and stick them in there

262
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,870
to get to turn it into a macro lens so

263
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,210
you can see up close and do PCB work I

264
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,710
thought the same thing with lock-picking

265
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,990
it's like here's this really fickle

266
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,820
master lock that I have that usually

267
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,440
takes me 15 minutes to get through an

268
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,440
average cuz it's like six pin and all

269
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,930
pins are spool pins so it's kind of a

270
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,940
pain in the ass to get through so once I

271
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,620
got the lock open I took it and I just

272
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,000
put it down on the couch next to me and

273
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,220
said oh I should take a picture and so

274
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,630
that's what a lock looks like after

275
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,100
you've been your picking at it so it's

276
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,440
obviously warm but that's all you can

277
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,720
tell and under normal circumstances a

278
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,580
lock would never be warm like that

279
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,380
unless somebody was holding it so I

280
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,930
don't know if that's good or bad but you

281
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:54,360
know if you're gonna bump a lock or if

282
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,380
you're gonna pick a lock and the lock

283
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,940
doesn't take 15 minutes to get through

284
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,470
like you're not gonna see any of this

285
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,350
for it there's no you can't friends if a

286
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,840
Kate locks with a Fleur gun it's just

287
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,050
just no then you know my alpha my my two

288
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,650
wot you know a BG n alpha that you know

289
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,570
the brand everyone uses to do like Wi-Fi

290
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:17,550
hack sorry again it looks cool but you

291
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,680
can't really tell what's going on I even

292
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,390
have a look at 24 you can barely see it

293
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,280
like I have a 24 DB I yeah gee it's like

294
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,460
this big and I'm pointing it out the

295
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:26,760
window

296
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,740
it's sitting on a baker's rack and I

297
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,510
have it like spamming packets just I had

298
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,280
attached to some random Network just to

299
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,990
start hemorrhaging ARP ARP spoof traffic

300
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,340
that you normally see when you do like

301
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,740
web cracking with air crack just to see

302
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,220
if the exacerbating the the interface

303
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,380
and trying to get you know electrons out

304
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,910
the front would change the temperature

305
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,110
like this and go for like six hours

306
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,260
nothing so so here I am I guess I'm like

307
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,600
damn it right I came up with this huge

308
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,340
list of all this cool stuff that that

309
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,530
you know you should be able to do and

310
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:02,370
like so I kind of gave up right and and

311
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,230
I stopped considering it as a security

312
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,170
tool but I still care

313
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,279
around a pointed us stuff because it's

314
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,899
just a fun toy you turn it on and hand

315
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:09,300
it to people and watch them go whoa

316
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,060
right so some surprises I started taking

317
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,790
it to the client at which I'm stationed

318
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,050
at the moment we're doing like this big

319
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,430
pen test or mediation thing at this

320
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,899
client this big fancy office building

321
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:21,250
and I'm pointing it at like security

322
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,500
systems and walls and cameras and doors

323
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,449
and stuff and I'm going hey wait a

324
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:27,430
minute this is actually more interesting

325
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,570
than the stuff I was considering before

326
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,790
originally right so as it turns out this

327
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,550
thing is like gold for Red Team like

328
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,850
this isn't easy I'll get into it but I'm

329
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,529
trying to contain my excitement this is

330
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:40,089
a really awesome toy if you're a Red

331
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:42,430
Team person so you're doing physical

332
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,630
security assessments this thing this

333
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,620
thing is awesome so like first and

334
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,630
foremost cameras the cool thing about

335
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,130
cameras from the from the biz for

336
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,389
anybody that's familiar with the stuff

337
00:11:49,389 --> 00:11:50,470
that I've done in the past was like

338
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,910
going and attacking cameras on the

339
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,290
Internet this is the business end of the

340
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,639
camera this time not like the internet

341
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,560
like the admin section that isn't

342
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,240
supposed to be on the internet side of

343
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,310
the camera so these things stick out

344
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,540
like a sore thumb like they look like

345
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,949
that when you point at the ceiling or

346
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:04,180
like I looked at a camera look there's

347
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,490
another camera so the cool thing by here

348
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,320
is you know you can you can

349
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,820
differentiate them from fake ones

350
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,140
because the real ones have power going

351
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,110
to them and all the transistors and

352
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,779
resistors and those boards generate heat

353
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:19,000
and they do that so these things have

354
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,620
been sitting on place on for you know

355
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,910
months or weeks or whatever and they

356
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,730
pretty neat stuff right so I went around

357
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,140
and took lots of pictures of them and

358
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,269
they're really obvious and like this is

359
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:32,230
like I think all of these were the top

360
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,910
two and the one on the bottom left were

361
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:36,070
all indoors and a movie theater in San

362
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,959
Diego and the one on the right on the

363
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:41,290
bottom is an outdoor dome camera so you

364
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:44,019
can really really tell like camera it's

365
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:46,029
really obvious right so here's another

366
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:48,579
screen shot like it's the one from the

367
00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:50,140
bottom left on the last slide

368
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,140
they put an access point Cisco I asked

369
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,430
the access point right next to the

370
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,620
camera and I'm looking at that through

371
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:02,410
the floor going wait a minute hold on

372
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:05,199
yeah you're gonna tell me that the

373
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:06,579
access point is on the same network is

374
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:11,050
the camera right so I think back to like

375
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,089
you know last year I found nine hundred

376
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:14,319
and seventy thousand publicly

377
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:16,449
addressable cameras and I was told by

378
00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:18,220
Liam the guy the bro IDs guy was here

379
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,249
really

380
00:13:19,249 --> 00:13:21,529
that there should be whale well over

381
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:23,119
that number and I was gonna try and go

382
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:25,549
break a million but yeah same thing like

383
00:13:25,549 --> 00:13:27,139
oh this ties into other researcher that

384
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,729
so same thing for the outside mounted

385
00:13:28,729 --> 00:13:30,439
cameras like this is a outside of the

386
00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:32,809
building in the same mall you can see

387
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:35,239
these are two mounted cameras that are

388
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:37,069
pointed different directions like once

389
00:13:37,069 --> 00:13:38,509
towards the parking lot ones out towards

390
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:40,309
like the quad in the mall they stick out

391
00:13:40,309 --> 00:13:41,869
like short Dom's it's super easy to see

392
00:13:41,869 --> 00:13:43,609
especially against the sky in the

393
00:13:43,609 --> 00:13:45,499
background because you can see on the

394
00:13:45,499 --> 00:13:47,149
temperature scale like if it's overcast

395
00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:48,799
and it's a night you're gonna see the

396
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:49,999
temperature of the clouds and the clouds

397
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:52,999
where they were with 43 degrees so even

398
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,189
if the cameras at 60 degrees which is

399
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:57,229
still not super warm the diff like this

400
00:13:57,229 --> 00:13:58,399
thing you'll see half a degree in

401
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,529
difference and it'll register it so it's

402
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:03,109
super easy to see cameras that stick out

403
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:05,389
that are legit cars are a really

404
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:06,619
interesting thing because they totally

405
00:14:06,619 --> 00:14:07,999
don't behave like you think that they

406
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:11,089
would like obviously the car has an

407
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:12,499
engine compartment with an engine in it

408
00:14:12,499 --> 00:14:15,919
normally and that engine generates heat

409
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:18,469
normally and that he takes forever to

410
00:14:18,469 --> 00:14:20,209
dissipate like you'll go out and point

411
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:22,369
at a car and you'll see the hood of the

412
00:14:22,369 --> 00:14:23,419
car and the whole front end of the car

413
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:25,339
will still be warm six hours after it's

414
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:27,439
been parked so like the one on the

415
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:28,879
bottom right here was driving like I

416
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:30,619
actually caught that cars of driving and

417
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:34,099
and in some cases the scale I I you know

418
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:36,979
you can take a picture before it adjusts

419
00:14:36,979 --> 00:14:38,449
itself because it's sort of auto I'll

420
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:39,829
show you guys in a minute but like it

421
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:41,989
auto regulates itself in terms of scale

422
00:14:41,989 --> 00:14:43,729
and color if you catch it too quickly

423
00:14:43,729 --> 00:14:45,229
you'll have like the same thing with a

424
00:14:45,229 --> 00:14:47,689
camera where it'll blow out the stuff

425
00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:49,759
that's too bright so like in this in

426
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:52,009
this frame you can see on the very far

427
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:55,399
left you can see a camera that still has

428
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:57,319
its exhaust and brakes are still warm

429
00:14:57,319 --> 00:14:59,089
which means it is just parked recently

430
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:00,639
and then you have other cars that

431
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,259
they're exhausting brakes are not warm

432
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:06,470
and but there's still a huge bright area

433
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:10,879
underneath the car which would either

434
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:13,609
mean something on the bottom side of the

435
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:16,219
car is causing the pavement to become

436
00:15:16,219 --> 00:15:18,349
warm or that it's and this is I guess

437
00:15:18,349 --> 00:15:20,959
this is the the cleanest thing that I

438
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,669
could come up with was that it the car

439
00:15:22,669 --> 00:15:25,219
acts as an insulator so once you park a

440
00:15:25,219 --> 00:15:27,739
car during the day and then the Sun Goes

441
00:15:27,739 --> 00:15:30,349
Down the car will insulate the pavement

442
00:15:30,349 --> 00:15:32,150
and you can tell how long

443
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,070
the car has been there based on the

444
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,530
surrounding environment of the

445
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:37,880
temperature of the asphalt so if the

446
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,220
asphalt under the car is still hot it's

447
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,480
been there since before the Sun went

448
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,550
down which is really interesting right

449
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,320
and then it's other frames that's a car

450
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,160
that's been there for I don't know how

451
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,250
many hours but the rest of the car is

452
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,140
you know ambient temperature that car

453
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,430
has probably been there six seven hours

454
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,620
and it's still like the radiator still

455
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,760
squirting heat out of River so it's

456
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,430
pretty neat here's a fun one we start

457
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,120
getting into the really interesting

458
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,860
stuff like this is the back of my note

459
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,720
three can anybody like feel free to

460
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,300
shout point and stuff like is there

461
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,440
anything interesting that you can point

462
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,910
out the back of this phone buddy yeah

463
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:14,270
well sort of so the big red rectangle

464
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,650
towards the bottom that's the battery

465
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,800
which means the battery is warm enough

466
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,620
to be seen through the the back lid of

467
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,180
the phone which means either the phone

468
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,800
the phone is consuming a lot of power

469
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,060
for some reason and the power

470
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,380
consumption is causing the battery to

471
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,690
get warm the other thing that you can

472
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,130
see is that there's a little shape on

473
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,770
the key and that shape is actually a

474
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,210
handcuff shim it's a Sarah pick

475
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,620
handcuffs shim I used to keep in my

476
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,670
phone and one of the other one of the

477
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,650
other modes you can do is it's called

478
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,300
high contrast and you turn the high

479
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,040
contrast on and the slight

480
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,860
differentiation between the degrees and

481
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,320
temperature here we'll you can see it

482
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,180
even better there and basically this was

483
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,040
a that's what it looks like so it's a

484
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,480
handcuff shim that's in the back of my

485
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,390
phone and the shim is touching the

486
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,790
battery it's conducting heat from the

487
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,700
battery and then like a diffuser putting

488
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,709
it on to the plastic surface of the back

489
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:08,780
of the phone when the plastic surface

490
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,540
acts as the insulator so it's like a

491
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,369
series of lenses except with plastic

492
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:14,540
which is kind of a weird thing to

493
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,609
consider so if anybody has anybody

494
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:18,410
familiar with the Fleur one that new

495
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,750
iPhone attachment really heard of that

496
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,849
thing so recently some guy posted a

497
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:24,920
video to YouTube like flipping a

498
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,440
about how you can steal people's pins

499
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,390
and you can capture people's financial

500
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,820
information with this Fleur one and I

501
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,230
had a barrage of people on Twitter

502
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,360
message you can be saying this look look

503
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,740
what this guy did I'm like he's he's

504
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,350
high so he drank too many paint he no

505
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,560
you can't so this is a screenshot during

506
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,580
that same outing where I got all the

507
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,860
cameras

508
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,900
I walked up to so I walked up the ATM

509
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,220
five seconds after somebody finished

510
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,080
using it I took a picture of the of the

511
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,890
PIN pad and I can't tell that there's

512
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,440
any buttons like I can't say anything if

513
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,150
you guys can see something rad your eyes

514
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,740
are better than mine but I can't I can't

515
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:04,060
tells me nothing so the there's this

516
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,470
whole concept now that Fleur is becoming

517
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,210
super available to people and they can

518
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,220
buy it like the the floor one device is

519
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,420
three hundred dollars or something and

520
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,040
this guy's a grand so it's like within

521
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,170
the realm of normal people that don't

522
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:15,520
have thirty thousand dollars to spend on

523
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,020
a fun toy to buy these things and play

524
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,720
with them to try and capture financial

525
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,040
information and try and capture stuff

526
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,450
from from pin or pin pads and other

527
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,010
places you can type in numbers like

528
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,420
security doors and things like that and

529
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,810
it's with pins and specifically like on

530
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,090
ATMs you can't it doesn't work the

531
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,890
buttons aren't the right texture they're

532
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,930
not the right they're not the right

533
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,480
plastic or rubber most ATM PIN pads are

534
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,420
either very hard like enameled plastic

535
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,010
or they're metal and you can't really

536
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,230
see anything and with the other PIN pad

537
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,430
the one up in the top left from the

538
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,780
screenshot it's one of those like

539
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,950
rubberized ones you see at the grocery

540
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,840
store or like the kind that they bring

541
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,340
to you like when you're out to eat and

542
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,710
if you're gonna point a camera at one of

543
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,850
those things it's not gonna matter

544
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,230
whether it's Fleur or not because the

545
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,220
only way you're gonna capture any

546
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,080
information is to like look over the

547
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,910
shoulder of the waiter with the camera

548
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,530
which defeats the whole purpose of doing

549
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,300
the thing in the first place so I kind

550
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,260
of like some of these people and you

551
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,300
need a bit of a slap right so they yeah

552
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,980
they get excitable sure I like I can

553
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,960
relate I get excitable too but just know

554
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,110
um however the really interesting thing

555
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:20,260
that I noticed was you can see

556
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,400
footprints in carpet like here like you

557
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,650
can trail people through hallways and

558
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,870
through lobbies and through places that

559
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:31,990
are carpeted based on footprints and the

560
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:34,000
footprints stay for like 10 to 20

561
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,380
seconds depending on the temperature of

562
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,640
the room the temperature of the bottom

563
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,610
of the person's foot and the density of

564
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,410
the carpet and the longest I've seen is

565
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,120
you can get about twenty thirty seconds

566
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,280
of time of hang time from somebody's

567
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,840
footprints so you can you can trail

568
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,950
somebody like if you're doing the Red

569
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:48,910
Team assessment you need to follow

570
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,190
somebody you can follow them through a

571
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,830
hallway or a room for up to thirty

572
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,300
seconds without ever actually seeing

573
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,520
them you can just follow the footprints

574
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,020
it's it's pretty neat so like here's

575
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,510
another one right so the footprint stick

576
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,590
around for a while I think this was Def

577
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:05,649
Con it's pretty neat it doesn't work on

578
00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:09,039
concrete it doesn't work on tile or

579
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,390
metal floors or anything like that but

580
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,279
predominantly concrete around the sonic

581
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:13,929
lucky carpet

582
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:17,020
carpeted floors interesting stuff this

583
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,450
is an hid badge reader like for

584
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:22,299
proximity cards when I took this picture

585
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:23,950
I thought I'll be really cool to do the

586
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,049
same examination with a badge reader

587
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:29,260
that's fake or one that's been planted

588
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,299
for purposes of capturing RFID

589
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:33,520
information I don't have that hardware

590
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,570
unfortunately but I think it'd be really

591
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,279
fun test so if you know anybody that

592
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:38,049
would be willing to like let me borrow

593
00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:39,640
some like that'd be cool it'd take some

594
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,880
pictures other things you can do with

595
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,159
this is in some cases attackers will put

596
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:48,039
skimmers on top of these readers to

597
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:50,440
capture hid card information and I

598
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,899
believe that the actual hid reader will

599
00:20:52,899 --> 00:20:55,870
be emitting more power than the skimmer

600
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,340
because the skimmer just needs to listen

601
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,080
because this thing is generating the

602
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,419
field and not the skimmer so if you put

603
00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:02,919
a skimmer over this thing I have a

604
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:06,850
suspicion that this thing's a thermal

605
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,919
readout wood or like this it's image

606
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:12,370
would go a lot colder right physical

607
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,570
security wise like if you're looking at

608
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,490
this thing and you realize there's a lot

609
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:18,010
of heat coming from behind this door

610
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,190
like maybe it's a server room maybe it's

611
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,980
a punchdown closet maybe maybe it's not

612
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,299
supposed to be a server room but it

613
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:28,330
really is maybe it's a room where and I

614
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,529
think that's what that was the case here

615
00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:32,740
where there's the audiovisual Department

616
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,750
of an organization tends to work and

617
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,549
they have like four huge 60-inch

618
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:38,799
televisions that are he's dropping on a

619
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,409
multitude of meetings that are going on

620
00:21:41,409 --> 00:21:42,820
in the company and that would be a

621
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,710
really fun room to like lockpick into if

622
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,090
you're doing a Red Team assessment to

623
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,830
sit and Hey look there's for displays

624
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,830
plugged into all the places where the

625
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,270
board members have their meetings about

626
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,500
what they're gonna do with stock and

627
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,990
insert insider trading much right so

628
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,779
that's pretty cool another one that I

629
00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:01,049
noticed was that occasionally you'll see

630
00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:04,690
the bezel of a door of a glass door lit

631
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,460
up like this and it's it looks like it's

632
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,980
gold it's not actually gold this is just

633
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,830
it's really warm

634
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,550
why would that be so as it turns out if

635
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,050
you look at it from the side only one

636
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:18,510
side is hot and that's even that even

637
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,680
more interesting because then you have

638
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,740
to think ok well why is only one side

639
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,330
warm that's bizarre

640
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:27,570
so this door is a access door that gets

641
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,550
you to the elevators in this building

642
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:34,680
and that warm side is electrified

643
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,300
because it's magnetically controlled

644
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,610
it's an electronic door where you swipe

645
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:41,550
your badge against the reader and then

646
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,200
the door clicks and you can open the

647
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,330
door but from the other side of the door

648
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,220
the office side of the door it's not

649
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,730
secured so you can just walk in which

650
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,170
also there's you know it's vulnerable to

651
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:55,500
the whole you know stick a a piece of

652
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,540
paper on a coat hanger under the door

653
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,830
because there's an inch of space and

654
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,420
wave it around so the motion sensor

655
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,330
notices it and the door will open but

656
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,890
you can tell from a distance again if

657
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,090
you're doing an assessment you can tell

658
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:08,220
from a distance what you're dealing with

659
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,110
based on the temperature of the bezel

660
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,750
the door I thought was pretty cool

661
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,700
here's another another fun one for any

662
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,400
Mac people in the audience if your Mac

663
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,190
generates a lot of heat you'll notice

664
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,860
that when you pick it up off the desk a

665
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,030
lot of times you put your hand where

666
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,560
your laptop just was that space is

667
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,420
really warm so you can do the same thing

668
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,500
with the floor gun except it's a lot

669
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,210
more visual obviously you can walk up to

670
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,590
a desk and you can tell how long

671
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,970
somebody's been there or how long

672
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,460
somebody's been gone so somebody picks

673
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,260
up the laptop and walks away the heat

674
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,320
signature stays on the on the desk and

675
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,180
all the the vent exhaust and you can

676
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:45,990
tell like the little connector there on

677
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,640
the left side of the frame is still warm

678
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,110
that's probably my guess is that's the

679
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,610
first thing that'll cool off because

680
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,650
it's small and plastic so you can tell

681
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,420
how long somebody's been away from their

682
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:58,050
desk with their so they go you have a

683
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,790
little bit of an Intel there based on

684
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:03,750
what what people have done this is a 3G

685
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,870
or 4G USB cell dongle they generate a

686
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,280
lot of heat because they have radios in

687
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,480
them and the radios are like when your

688
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,040
phone gets hot it's the same concept

689
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,260
except it's a USB stick I thought this

690
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,550
was an interesting finding though I have

691
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,010
yet to have a real practical use for how

692
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,680
to measure something using it maybe in a

693
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,720
case is like other pieces of security

694
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,730
research I've done involved devices that

695
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:24,300
are connected

696
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,400
you know they shouldn't be like signs of

697
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,440
various kinds and skated devices and all

698
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,030
sorts of stuff that way and those things

699
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,800
tend to be connected to the Internet by

700
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,970
way of typically Verizon hockey pucks or

701
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:38,180
USB modems like this so if you can

702
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,550
potentially fife you're trying to find

703
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,510
how something is connected to the

704
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:45,120
Internet and you know where it's gear

705
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,670
lives if it's gear is warm it could be

706
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,950
one of these this is a fun game to play

707
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:52,100
is where's that guy keep his cell phone

708
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:57,660
so a little obvious there but you can

709
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,010
anything that generates a lot of heat

710
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,620
that you know you can you can see

711
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,810
through other objects so in this case

712
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,850
this would be you know you can tell what

713
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:07,500
maybe what make and model the phone is

714
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,080
depending on its size and shape or how

715
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,580
often it's been used or what's going on

716
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,900
so in a lot of cases you'll have like a

717
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,840
guy wardriving or a guy doing like a

718
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,540
port port scan or a security audit with

719
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,640
this phone and it's in this pocket and

720
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,520
it's super hot super warm so if you're

721
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,620
doing incident response and you're and

722
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,790
you know that the device that's

723
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,680
connecting to the network is a phone you

724
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,120
know where it is physically that's one

725
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,500
way that you can find it's probably a

726
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,680
little fringe but you know it's it's

727
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:38,310
more more ways to use a fun toy so at

728
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,810
the SCADA village at Def Con this year

729
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,940
turns out SCADA is actually kind of warm

730
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,700
the big thing is obviously television

731
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,020
but those three devices on the bottom

732
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,080
there are SCADA equipment and they're

733
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,480
controlling a panel which you can't

734
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,100
really see because you can't see paint

735
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,930
or anything like that with with thermal

736
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:58,590
but it turns out SCADA runs pretty warm

737
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,360
and SCADA is essentially like the

738
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,710
easiest way to think of it is it's

739
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,510
basically a really buff Raspberry Pi or

740
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:06,720
a small you know embedded computer but

741
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,120
they do deal with a lot of power and a

742
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,890
lot of them are essentially like relays

743
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:13,230
and switching relays so you can spot

744
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,220
those things pretty quickly here's a

745
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,500
closer view of the same the same devices

746
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,470
right so now for something completely

747
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:22,110
different there's a lot of stuff that

748
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,000
you can use this device for that isn't

749
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,890
directly security related that I found

750
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,240
out while I was walking around pointing

751
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,070
it pointing it at everything you can get

752
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:33,840
readings of how well cooling equipment

753
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,430
is working for example this was me

754
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,590
turning a air like a

755
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,630
a can of air duster upside down and

756
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,730
spraying it against the water cooling

757
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,590
radiator of my gaming computer and you

758
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:45,630
can see there I went down a minus 1.7

759
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,730
Fahrenheit in the center and actually

760
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:50,030
work pretty well for about a minute

761
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:52,650
coffee is it's fun to watch cuz it kinda

762
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:53,910
looks like you're drinking the lava you

763
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:57,540
can see how poorly your exhaust fans and

764
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,860
your kitchen work and you can see that

765
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,210
like there's keep coming off the stove

766
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,640
and it's spreading along underneath the

767
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,920
stove and the vent fans are supposed to

768
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,010
be picking it up sunburns like before

769
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,540
they're obvious if you think you have a

770
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,360
sunburn like you can check and yep you

771
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,390
actually have a sunburn making English

772
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:18,450
muffins you can tell if the giant they

773
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:20,190
call it cast iron skillet you're using

774
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:22,860
is heated in the right places you can

775
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,960
tell your cat used to sit so I thought

776
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,950
this was a fun one I'm like what the

777
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,740
hell is oh so yeah that's like fine

778
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,880
finer of your cat sitting and take a

779
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,020
picture it's like yeah that's my cat's

780
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,950
butt rad the latest craze right now is

781
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,590
quad rotors and they get very very warm

782
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,900
because those batteries will spike to

783
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,090
like 30 amps a hundred amps and when

784
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,980
you're piping that kind of power through

785
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,690
little you know quarter-inch thick

786
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,940
cables or H eight inch thick cables and

787
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,710
you have a short or you have some kind

788
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,300
of problem you know it sticks out like

789
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:55,320
crazy in this case this was a quad that

790
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,430
was on the ground that had just started

791
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,230
to take off and in the first few seconds

792
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,550
and I had taken off you can see that the

793
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,620
motors and the speed controllers are

794
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,320
just bright white so fun stuff if you

795
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,720
have if you're into quads and what you

796
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,770
have one that's misbehaving it's

797
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:08,940
probably not a bad idea to have a look

798
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,000
at this um weird biological differences

799
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,570
between guys and girls this was bizarre

800
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,010
and I have no idea how to explain it

801
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:19,020
like the legs on the left were from like

802
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,090
friends of mine that are female and you

803
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,590
can like distinctly see veins and their

804
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,000
legs and the one on the right is mine

805
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,580
and it's just like blobs it's as bizarre

806
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,230
and I don't know what the deal is maybe

807
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,980
it has something to do with

808
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:46,270
Oh interesting science that's cool huh

809
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:48,900
that's neat so see I learned something

810
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,230
another one is you can tell like you can

811
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,980
like you can't really see through

812
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,470
clothing but you can tell like what

813
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,000
state the closing clothing is in so like

814
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,740
on the left that was me at Def Con after

815
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,540
the goon swim I went into the pool with

816
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,309
my kilt on and then I got out of the

817
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:05,410
pool and my kilt was I was like flapping

818
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,179
it around so it was really cold and on

819
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:09,940
the right a friend of mine came up after

820
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:10,690
we got back inside

821
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:13,300
and after seeing the floor GaN her first

822
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,530
question was can it see through clothing

823
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:19,240
so yes kinda in this case like she was

824
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,380
wearing a padded bra and that's all I

825
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,850
could tell but no I can't really see

826
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:24,190
through clothing this is a really fun

827
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:24,520
one

828
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,840
it couldn't anybody point out what I

829
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,190
think that might be like I want you guys

830
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:30,870
to try and guess this is a good one

831
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:35,770
nothing what

832
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:38,290
no pancake no it's actually um this is

833
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:41,980
an 8 8 8 gallon brew kettle and this is

834
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,980
beer brewing this is during the boil the

835
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,260
hot fluid comes up from the bottom hits

836
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,030
the top cools off and goes back down and

837
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,470
it kind of looks like the surface of the

838
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:52,270
Sun it looked really cool in video and I

839
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:54,840
really wish this thing took video but

840
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,270
yeah it looked it looks pretty amazing

841
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,650
seeing it live like bro blow up to the

842
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,059
top and then sink again and come back up

843
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:04,059
this really fun I should probably take

844
00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:05,440
video and put that and put that online

845
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,210
later but like so this is the actual

846
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,890
intended purpose of the device like the

847
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,390
reason that flare manufacture this was

848
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:13,059
to go into people's houses and do things

849
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:15,040
like look and see where insulation

850
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,640
wasn't working or where there was water

851
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,890
damage or if the stuff was condensing in

852
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:23,320
the wrong places or if like termites and

853
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,000
other like insect infestations will

854
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,770
generate heat and black mold will

855
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:27,760
generate heat and things like that so

856
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,679
like in this case this was a hot day in

857
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,290
San Diego last week of the week before

858
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:34,570
where a friend of mine took this up into

859
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,309
his attic and while his air conditioner

860
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:38,710
was running like you can see the top of

861
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,210
the air conditioning unit is a hundred

862
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:42,340
and seven degrees the surface of the

863
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,950
ceiling that's touching the Sun is 134

864
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:47,220
degrees so it gives you an idea of

865
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,909
what's working and what

866
00:30:48,909 --> 00:30:50,470
on really hot days or really cold days

867
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:51,519
and you're trying to deal with the

868
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:52,570
heating and the cooling this is pretty

869
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:55,119
cool so like I mentioned before the

870
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,549
add-ons you can do you can go and buy

871
00:30:57,549 --> 00:31:00,129
the zinc selenide lenses and you can

872
00:31:00,129 --> 00:31:02,889
attach them to the front of the camera

873
00:31:02,889 --> 00:31:04,419
now that wasn't designed to do that so

874
00:31:04,419 --> 00:31:05,440
you're gonna have to build your own

875
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,159
little attachment ring like in some

876
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:12,609
cases like this guy he used just a piece

877
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:14,919
of cardboard that he cut out and another

878
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:19,090
person 3d printed a nose for the front

879
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,460
of the camera that fits this particular

880
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,470
style of lens and the result is

881
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,389
something like this who are you now

882
00:31:25,389 --> 00:31:28,389
focusing on a PCB and you can tell if a

883
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:30,099
trace is working or not working or if a

884
00:31:30,099 --> 00:31:31,869
chip is like in this case it looks like

885
00:31:31,869 --> 00:31:35,409
a tram a transistor that's getting

886
00:31:35,409 --> 00:31:36,940
really warm and by the design of the

887
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,840
board it looks like that's what that's

888
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,979
supposed to do so you can tell whether

889
00:31:38,979 --> 00:31:42,039
it's supposed to be working or not yeah

890
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:43,539
so I got to give props to the robot room

891
00:31:43,539 --> 00:31:45,909
comm guy he he's the one that took these

892
00:31:45,909 --> 00:31:49,629
two pictures but it's it's a very

893
00:31:49,629 --> 00:31:51,609
interesting device the people that I've

894
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:53,909
didn't seeing that use it more

895
00:31:53,909 --> 00:31:55,659
predominantly are people that do a lot

896
00:31:55,659 --> 00:31:57,279
of electronics engineering I'm guessing

897
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,679
because eevblog is that's what they do

898
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,710
and we refer this exact reason to do

899
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,690
electronics work and to check on traces

900
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:07,479
and to check whether hardware is doing

901
00:32:07,479 --> 00:32:09,429
what it's supposed to be doing so that's

902
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:12,029
pretty much about it
