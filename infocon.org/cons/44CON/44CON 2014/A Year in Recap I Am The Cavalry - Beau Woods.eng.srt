1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,179
all right so uh thanks to Adrian I don't

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:05,040
have have to be the person who says

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,649
cyber first tonight which means he has

4
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:09,240
to do my drinks for me because I'm going

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,859
to say cyber a few times there we go

6
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:20,820
we're getting set up here so thanks

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,890
everybody to come for coming out tonight

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,019
I am I'm very honored to be the first

9
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:26,250
person to speak to your other than

10
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,130
Adrian at this event and I'm happy to be

11
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,900
the first person speaking at the first

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,250
community night at 44 Khan I'm gonna

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,380
talk a little bit about that I am the

14
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,620
cavalry initiative just by show of hands

15
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,090
and I'm a little bit blinded here but

16
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,530
how many people have heard of I am the

17
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,129
cavalry okay good probably thirty

18
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:52,199
percent or so so I'll go through a quick

19
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:55,170
overview and it'll be very quick for

20
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,270
those of you don't know about what's

21
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,149
going on you'll be able to find out then

22
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:03,270
recap what we call year zero because

23
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,099
we're all computer people in here right

24
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,720
we understand that zero is the first

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,140
number then what's the next year gonna

26
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,560
look like and finally kind of introduce

27
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,979
our 5-star Auto cyber safety framework

28
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:19,170
and now I've said cyber for the first

29
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,570
time in the talk so it's a good time to

30
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,299
get started so I am the cavalry for

31
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,790
those who haven't been around haven't

32
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,640
seen it the idea started from the

33
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,340
problem statement that our society is

34
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,280
adopting connected technology faster

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,740
than we can secure it and what that

36
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,350
means is that we're kind of plugging in

37
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,590
a bunch of different devices that didn't

38
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,090
used to have computers in them and that

39
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,950
didn't used to be connected to the

40
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,890
internet now they are and so what does

41
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,180
that mean our mission statement then is

42
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,189
to ensure that connected technologies

43
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:58,799
with the potential to impact Public

44
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,079
Safety and human life are worthy of our

45
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,149
trust and we thought that that part was

46
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:07,530
really especially grabbing because most

47
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,179
of the people out there who are not in

48
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,250
this room are putting their trust in

49
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,800
these technologies

50
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,630
whether or not we feel like they're

51
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,910
worthy of that so what we wanted to do

52
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,620
is to kind of rectify the trust that's

53
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,750
being placed in them with the trust that

54
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,220
they deserve we focus on four critical

55
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,530
areas medical devices automotive

56
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,510
connected home and then public

57
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,860
infrastructure and again these are all

58
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,450
things that have the potential to impact

59
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,670
human life and public safety and those

60
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,670
areas so we're you know somebody might

61
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,000
lose medical data that's not necessarily

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,200
what we're concerned with we're

63
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,460
concerned with the device itself

64
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,010
potentially killing someone or doing

65
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,600
something negative to impact their life

66
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,760
why we want to do this again should be

67
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,090
clear from the problem statement from

68
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,590
the mission statement and the devices

69
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,180
that we're looking at it's really to

70
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,300
ensure trust to ensure high level of

71
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,340
Public Safety and a preservation of

72
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,220
human life and we do this primarily

73
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,520
through education outreach and through

74
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,890
supporting research and I think that

75
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:23,239
those are three key ingredients to kind

76
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:25,989
of call out is we don't want to

77
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:29,300
necessarily do the research ourselves we

78
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,100
want to allow other people to be better

79
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,360
at doing the research that they're

80
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,130
already doing to take the research

81
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,020
that's already been done and connect it

82
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,840
to to others who can benefit from it and

83
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,970
we see outreach is a key part of that

84
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,180
going outside of the echo chamber and

85
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,400
the security community and industry and

86
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,980
into the manufacturing industries into

87
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,560
the public policy arenas into you know

88
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,830
the legal areas and under helping them

89
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,380
understand what cyber security really

90
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,120
means in these aspects we are a global

91
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,830
grassroots organization we have several

92
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,840
folks who are on our discussion list who

93
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,720
are in Europe not too many in Asia but a

94
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,000
few not too many and other geographies

95
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,610
but we are growing and trying to expand

96
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,709
again outreach trying to get out there

97
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:18,950
get the word out and we are primarily

98
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,529
made up of people from the InfoSec

99
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:24,350
industry the InfoSec community security

100
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,210
researchers right the people in this

101
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:30,110
room so you are the target group that we

102
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,470
need as resources to help make the world

103
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,030
a better place and hopefully that

104
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,890
doesn't sound too much unicorns and

105
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:40,160
rainbows and we really want to have a

106
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,650
long-term vision for what cyber safety

107
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,650
means so it's one thing to fix a

108
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,570
particular vulnerability such as the

109
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,640
heartbleed vulnerability it's another

110
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,250
thing to make sure that those types of

111
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,600
issues don't come up in devices that we

112
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,850
depend on and rely on and if they do

113
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,820
that they are fixable so that if you

114
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,190
have an MRI machine that costs 10

115
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,729
million pounds to procure that you don't

116
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:09,440
have to either throw that away

117
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,800
to buy a new one or look at just going

118
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,450
with a completely vulnerable exposed

119
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,850
piece of equipment for the rest of its

120
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,260
expected lifetime and the way that we're

121
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,720
doing this is we're looking at

122
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,270
collecting existing researchers and work

123
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,400
that's been done this is extremely

124
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,740
helpful in making sure that the next bit

125
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,930
of research that's done is maximally

126
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,060
effective so that you don't have to go

127
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,390
back and relearn how to decode the

128
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,430
protocol that's being used for instance

129
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,830
so that you can continue on with the

130
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,870
research you want to do that's already

131
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,000
been done before someone knows how to do

132
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,550
it it's important to connect those folks

133
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,530
together connect the past work that's

134
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:55,430
been done connect the output of certain

135
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,410
research to the people that it affects

136
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,599
whether that's public policymakers

137
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:01,760
whether that's manufacturers themselves

138
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,470
whether that's you know a healthcare

139
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,930
procurement organization we want to

140
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,450
connect those people together we also

141
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,490
want to collaborate with all of these

142
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,440
different stakeholders bring them

143
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,150
together in a room and have them talk

144
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,849
out the issues you know if you go as we

145
00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:18,440
haven't talked with a lot of the

146
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,050
manufacturing organizations sometimes

147
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,419
they know a lot of the issues that that

148
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:25,190
we're bringing to them it's not a matter

149
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,470
of them not knowing it's a matter of

150
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,610
maybe them not being able to get that

151
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,879
safety feature done

152
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:36,159
if you bring public public policymakers

153
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:38,379
into the room sometimes they can help

154
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:40,020
get that done in a better way so

155
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,669
bringing all those folks together you

156
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:45,610
catalyze action before it might have

157
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,669
happened otherwise so one of the things

158
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:53,830
that we kind of fear is I won't say

159
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,330
cyber Pearl Harbor because that's

160
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:59,050
overused but in the 1970s there was a

161
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,610
river in the United States called the

162
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,800
Cuyahoga River and if you don't know

163
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,779
that River caught on fire several times

164
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:08,439
now just imagine the scene of a body of

165
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:10,719
water burning and you can imagine how

166
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:14,259
bad the pollution was that situation

167
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:16,899
kicked off the American Environmental

168
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:21,550
Protection groups and it was a heavy

169
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,269
reaction to an environmental problem it

170
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:27,099
was a situation where the issues had

171
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:29,169
gotten way past the point of a

172
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:31,629
reasonable rational solution implemented

173
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:34,089
over time it was something that had to

174
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:37,029
happen and had to be a heavy reaction if

175
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:39,219
we're able to make these good things

176
00:07:39,219 --> 00:07:42,069
come out of of what we're doing sooner

177
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:46,139
then we avoid those overreactions and

178
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:49,779
the whole idea is that if the cavalry

179
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:51,759
isn't coming if no one's coming to solve

180
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,579
these problems we have to stand up and

181
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:56,709
be the people to solve it I am the

182
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,589
cavalry is not I and the cavalry it's

183
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:03,779
all of us we are all the cavalry

184
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:08,740
so to recap kind of year zero it all

185
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,740
started at besides Las Vegas and DEF CON

186
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:16,209
last year 2013 that was when Josh Corman

187
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:18,849
Nick Percoco got up they gave an initial

188
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:21,369
talk to try and pull together people who

189
00:08:21,369 --> 00:08:23,409
were like-minded who were interested in

190
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:25,749
the same things and who believed that

191
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:27,249
they could make a difference that they

192
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:29,259
they needed to make that change that

193
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,869
they needed to be the leaders they

194
00:08:31,869 --> 00:08:34,419
outlined three planks of the basic

195
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:38,890
platform body is public good

196
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:42,250
and public safety the idea that medical

197
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,769
devices cars these other things could

198
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:46,720
actually have a kinetic impact they

199
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,240
could hurt harm kill people

200
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,360
another area was the mind and primarily

201
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,070
this was around criminalization of

202
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,680
research in the u.s. there are some

203
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,350
pretty draconian laws that are really

204
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,029
just outdated they're from like the

205
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:04,360
1980s regarding things like authorized

206
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,480
versus unauthorized use and those laws

207
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,690
are shutting down or in many cases

208
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:13,209
stifling and silencing researchers who

209
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:15,880
are trying to act in good faith so the

210
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,040
idea was we have to to safeguard our

211
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,240
right to research and then sole civil

212
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,940
liberties the snowden stuff that adrian

213
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,690
talked about to start to show off these

214
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:32,079
are things that impact us that reach

215
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:35,320
really deeply into the roots of what it

216
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,959
is to be human and you know going back

217
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:40,630
to like Hobbes and Locke and these

218
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,649
really enlightened thinkers of the 1700s

219
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:46,360
they define some of these things that

220
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,100
are now shifting and they're changing

221
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,990
for the better or for the worse

222
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:55,779
based on technology and again one thing

223
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:57,670
was clear when we looked around we

224
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,529
realized that there weren't a lot of

225
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:01,600
people talking about this that there

226
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,820
wasn't anybody really in charge of

227
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,800
making sure that these things didn't

228
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,990
really harm us our society and our

229
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:11,410
individuals so it falls to us and again

230
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,860
it falls to you and they introduced I am

231
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:19,959
the cavalry the goals what we wanted to

232
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:22,630
start to do was to do feasibility

233
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,640
testing is this something that's gonna

234
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,810
work I don't know

235
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,209
you know maybe nobody's ever tried this

236
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:29,980
before maybe they have maybe will find

237
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,779
that you know just by talking about it

238
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:33,880
there's this whole body of work that's

239
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,490
been done that people will point us to

240
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,769
and we can say alright well somebody's

241
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:40,120
working on this we don't necessarily

242
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,480
need to exist we wanted to fail fast and

243
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,399
iterate we wanted to find out what

244
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:47,230
didn't work as well as what did work

245
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,329
repeat the things that work to work well

246
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:51,780
and discard the things that didn't

247
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,880
we wanted to make sure we fully

248
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,190
understood the problem space talking to

249
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,450
people in industry so we could

250
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,730
understand their perspective

251
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,860
understanding what the what we call the

252
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,470
chain of influence is so that we could

253
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,380
map it out know what we needed to do how

254
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,410
to effect that change to get the result

255
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:14,460
that we ultimately wanted to see we also

256
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,960
wanted to gather like-minded people

257
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,360
together folks like ourselves folks who

258
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,400
thought we could do something to make a

259
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,650
difference maybe frustrated with our day

260
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,150
jobs because we felt like it wasn't

261
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,170
important enough or that it didn't solve

262
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,400
some of the most important critical

263
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,370
problems it was only trying to stop you

264
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,710
know credit card from getting breached

265
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,230
which was going to happen anyways and we

266
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,810
wanted form plans for how we took this

267
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:42,330
action how we move forward what's the

268
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,250
best way to actually impact the change

269
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:49,200
that we want to see so in year one we

270
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,020
did a lot of talking to people I've had

271
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,690
dozens maybe hundreds of phone calls

272
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,330
with folks met them in person talked to

273
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,550
people at conferences like this again

274
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:03,089
this is the outreach and the education

275
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,339
piece of how we're going to accomplish

276
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:07,500
this we found that there were a lot of

277
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,830
people who were just like us who saw

278
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,050
these issues who knew that something had

279
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,120
to be done and who wanted to jump on

280
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,980
board and make sure that it wasn't a

281
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,980
critical issue that had a long-lasting

282
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,380
negative problem that it got fixed

283
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,400
before that happened we also again went

284
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,620
and and investigated the research

285
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,540
community we found a lot of people that

286
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,220
have been researching these issues right

287
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,500
in automotive space it's not just

288
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,460
Charlie Miller and Chris valasek it's

289
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,290
Donna Bailey who's talking here at this

290
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:43,050
conference as well it's several other

291
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,990
folks who are really shy and quiet a lot

292
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,730
of times they don't go speak at industry

293
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:50,550
events there's a guy Craig Smith who he

294
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:54,470
runs a small group called open garages

295
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,850
it's just a bunch of hackers we like to

296
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:00,700
get a dinky get-together taker with cars

297
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,710
he's one of the smartest guys in the

298
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,090
automotive space that I think I know

299
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:07,150
because he can explain things so well to

300
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,860
an audience that's not security people

301
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,860
because that's who's been working with

302
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,720
we found multiple examples like that

303
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,790
where it was quiet people who wouldn't

304
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,830
stand up and talk at a conference but

305
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,390
they had a lot of the knowledge they

306
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,520
knew what was going on and they were

307
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,890
very very powerful allies and folks to

308
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,860
get to know the government in in the

309
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,390
u.s. that's kind of a dirty word right

310
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,280
now but we found a lot of really good

311
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,190
people in government even people who

312
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,370
were policymakers people who were in

313
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:39,820
regulatory agencies people who may be

314
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,800
doing different things maybe in the

315
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,290
dependent Defense Department we found

316
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,910
really good folks really good

317
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,330
connections that helped us understand

318
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,180
more of the lay of the land when you get

319
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,560
into that area which is something that

320
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,510
you know frankly most of us probably

321
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,730
most of you in this room don't know the

322
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,590
government space very well some of you

323
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,770
may but I'll tell you I didn't before we

324
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,280
started talking to these folks we also

325
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,450
found that manufacturing industries you

326
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,700
know the target organizations were

327
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,770
really receptive to this in a lot of

328
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:19,360
ways we've talked to probably just about

329
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,540
every car maker you can think of many of

330
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,850
the medical device makers we've had a

331
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,520
lot of traction in those two areas it's

332
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,200
been really really good really positive

333
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,580
I can only think of maybe one or two

334
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,960
calls that I've had or discussions that

335
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,600
I've had that didn't at the end of it

336
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,150
have some positive next step or positive

337
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,760
action to come out of it sometimes they

338
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,810
were a little bit afraid to engage

339
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,220
because they weren't sure where we were

340
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,380
coming from you know you guys just a

341
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,910
bunch of hackers who are gonna try and

342
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,410
you know make me look bad in front of my

343
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,140
boss we had to overcome that stereotype

344
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,300
a little bit but it wasn't hard once we

345
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,070
started talking to them you know they

346
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:00,760
were people were people we talked to the

347
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,920
press quite a bit it was a story that

348
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,350
was pretty compelling and engaging and

349
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,970
there's some some press people maybe in

350
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,560
this room right now but certainly at

351
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,280
this conference

352
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,390
who

353
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,520
engaged with us wanted to learn more

354
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,410
wanted to talk about it because it's

355
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,540
something that's important it has a good

356
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,850
angle from a public relations standpoint

357
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,220
and they helped get the message out they

358
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,020
helped us get the message out to many of

359
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,720
the people who we wanted to talk to who

360
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,580
otherwise we couldn't have gotten an

361
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,420
audience with we had several

362
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,220
manufacturers public policymakers lots

363
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,740
of people call us up write us emails and

364
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,840
say hey I saw your your story in the

365
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,170
newspaper I want to know more what can I

366
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:41,890
do to help

367
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,990
I want to engage with you that was

368
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:47,140
really really good very positive and

369
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,900
then we had several deliverables that we

370
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,580
were able to get out I'll talk about one

371
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,280
of those later on in the talk but it was

372
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,350
the open letter and five star automotive

373
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:59,590
cyber safety framework that was a really

374
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,180
good positive thing that fed back into

375
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,160
the press and we were able to get a lot

376
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,380
of carmakers that called us up on the

377
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,320
phone and wanted to talk it was we got a

378
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,260
lot of good feedback we also had several

379
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:15,220
workshops a couple of opportunities to

380
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,950
sit down and go through some of the

381
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:20,650
issues that we're facing and have the

382
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,690
community tell us what their opinions

383
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,000
were get a diversity of opinions those

384
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,070
came through and some of our positions

385
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,760
we put out a website that if you haven't

386
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,400
seen it it's I am the cavalry org and

387
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,780
you can go there and see some of our

388
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,040
position statements some of the

389
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,200
directions that we've taken there's a

390
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,640
lot of good thinking a lot of good

391
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,680
content that's starting to be generated

392
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,660
by the work that we've done over the

393
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:48,460
past 12 months in terms of conference

394
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,500
activities you can see here we've been

395
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,300
to a lot of different conferences we've

396
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,830
talked to a lot of different folks just

397
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,750
a few highlights really quickly besides

398
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,180
DEFCON last year that was where the

399
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,640
concept was introduced at Derby con

400
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,290
which is a conference that takes place

401
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,940
in Louisville every year we had a

402
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,099
two-day Congress where we got a bunch of

403
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:07,959
security researchers together a lot of

404
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:09,640
people flew into Louisville not to go to

405
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,680
the conference but to sit in a room with

406
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,869
a bunch of stinky geeks for a couple of

407
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:16,780
days and trying and flesh this out and

408
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,589
figure it out there was a TEDx and if

409
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:22,619
you don't know what Ted is it's a very

410
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:26,400
very broadly watched series of short

411
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,760
presentations to a general audience that

412
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,260
was a way for us to really get outside

413
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,970
of the echo chamber to talk to people

414
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,920
and what we found is that they were very

415
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,800
receptive to the message you can go out

416
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,350
and watch that that one done by Josh

417
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,040
Corman in Naperville Indiana I believe

418
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,430
that shmoocon we held another day-long

419
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,950
symposium just again getting folks

420
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,320
together what can you contribute what do

421
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,970
you know that we don't know how can we

422
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,700
refine and polish our message and we had

423
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,970
some smart folks from government circles

424
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,550
from inside the beltway as we call it in

425
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,700
the US who really knew that space well

426
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,890
and a lot of them had been funded by

427
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,590
research grants from the government to

428
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,050
go and work on these things from you

429
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,910
know aviation standpoint or automotive

430
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,550
standpoint or Internet of Things because

431
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,380
the government does recognize that this

432
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,780
is one of those fringe areas that's

433
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,110
growing we went and we were invited by

434
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:28,620
RSA to come and have a booth there we

435
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,120
got a booth in there emerging

436
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,610
technologies and emerging projects Bay

437
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,380
Area and it was really good we're there

438
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,380
for three days and that was great and

439
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,830
our at besides San Francisco we held

440
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,690
another two-day workshop to bring the

441
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,580
security community in San Francisco and

442
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,740
they had a lot of crazy ideas as you

443
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,929
will out in San Francisco but some of

444
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:49,860
them were really good

445
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,179
and we incorporated a lot of the

446
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:54,270
information we got at thought Kahn and

447
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,820
b-side Chicago each of these we ran a

448
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,070
workshop for several hours a day three

449
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,110
to four hours at each one of those

450
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,840
events we were able to again get people

451
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,720
in the room talk about the issues and

452
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,300
have some good output from that just

453
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,880
recently at the one-year anniversary we

454
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,920
were back out of besides Las Vegas we

455
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,570
did an event that was a day-long event

456
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,240
bringing in security people at b-sides

457
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,210
and talking about some more

458
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,590
non-technical skills non-technical

459
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,750
muscles that we need to build in order

460
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,610
to make sure that our message gets out

461
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,470
and is effective so that we're not

462
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,870
speaking in geek language we're speaking

463
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,160
in the language that

464
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,740
the recipient needs to hear it in in

465
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,220
order to make that impact we also were

466
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,520
at Def Con we did an invite-only event

467
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,290
where we got a bunch of car makers a

468
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,450
bunch of security researchers medical

469
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,730
device makers Internet of Things and

470
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,460
public infrastructure folks in the same

471
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,160
room and the biggest thing we learned

472
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,800
was they already knew the issues they

473
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,210
already knew that they needed solutions

474
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,040
but it was making the connections that

475
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,960
was really really helpful to that group

476
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,060
it was an excellent event and we hope to

477
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,760
recreate it at least once or twice over

478
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:15,060
the next year so what worked well what

479
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,600
did we learn we found that our problem

480
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,520
statement our mission statement went

481
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,410
over really really well with most people

482
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,030
we weren't sure whether it was gonna

483
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,280
fall on deaf ears but it turns out it

484
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,640
didn't turns out most people when we

485
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,360
spoke clearly and in a general language

486
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,690
even you know like my hairdresser knows

487
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:39,570
now that this is an issue public

488
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,310
policymakers I've explained this to my

489
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,710
mom and if anybody can get anything she

490
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,480
you know she's the last person I can

491
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,670
usually reach and she understood why it

492
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,950
was needed we also found that the timing

493
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,830
was really fortuitous a lot of people

494
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,330
have tried similar things in the past

495
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:57,000
but just the timing hasn't been there

496
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,380
and we had a lot of people coming to us

497
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,570
saying look you guys are gonna crash and

498
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:02,100
burn I don't want to see that happen to

499
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,680
you well we'll try it anyways we'll fall

500
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,360
on our face and we'll get back up maybe

501
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,840
and go do something different but as it

502
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,500
turns out a lot of people it was just

503
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,080
that moment that right moment to be able

504
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,270
to hear it and to accept it

505
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:20,670
collecting connecting collaborating

506
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,130
catalyzed I already mentioned what that

507
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:26,310
is we discovered that as we went through

508
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:29,310
it we needed different roles even among

509
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:32,220
ourselves right if there's somebody

510
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,440
who's out there doing research that's

511
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,500
great but when he goes and presents that

512
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,810
research to a manufacturer they yell at

513
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,340
him they tell him he's a horrible person

514
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,230
for you know making all these problems

515
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,690
for them somebody needs to be there to

516
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:46,730
pick

517
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,590
to make sure that you know he doesn't

518
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,450
quit what he's doing that he's

519
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,690
encouraged by any forward progress so we

520
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,370
found that and there was a great great

521
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,050
presentation that a guy named Brian

522
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,000
Kiefer he goes by short zero and Twitter

523
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,650
he did out it beside San Francisco and

524
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:07,580
as well at Derby con and it was on

525
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,430
comparing World of Warcraft guilds to

526
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:13,460
what we do so you start out in World of

527
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,770
Warcraft and you're gonna do the

528
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:18,080
learning module you get up to a certain

529
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,340
point and then you can go out into the

530
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,110
world you can start doing things solo

531
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,690
once you get done with that you can't

532
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,820
progress unless you team up with

533
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,100
somebody else to trade to go and fight

534
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,930
together and then you can get to a

535
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,420
certain level after you get to that

536
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,400
level you really can't go any farther

537
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,500
unless you have a guild unless you have

538
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,840
a group of people that work together for

539
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,720
a common goal and mission and can take

540
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,690
on roles of each other and whatever

541
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:48,380
needs to be done so that was something

542
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:51,560
that that really was it seemed to have

543
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,570
worked well when we got together and did

544
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:56,300
that we also went and we sought out

545
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,390
other people to make us smarter we went

546
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,640
to the automotive industry and we talked

547
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,870
to them and they told us that their

548
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,790
problems were sometimes there were

549
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,990
problems that we didn't know that they

550
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,580
had that we just assumed that they were

551
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,590
done right but we found out that they

552
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,720
were smart but that we didn't know what

553
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,640
their problems were we talked to people

554
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,140
who are doing research in the medical

555
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,850
device field we found out that they

556
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,650
actually knew a lot they knew a lot of

557
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,510
people they knew a lot of the problems

558
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,190
but they needed someone else who could

559
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:25,460
help them do something else with it we

560
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,620
got lots of really good outside interest

561
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,080
feedback and participation from people

562
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,770
we wouldn't have expected necessarily so

563
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:37,760
going into the Senate staff finding some

564
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,580
really smart you know people about 25 to

565
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,040
30 who generally we always think that

566
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,050
the Senate staff is is old folks who

567
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:48,500
don't understand technology found some

568
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,060
really good people who do understand

569
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,250
technology at a level that's actually

570
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,320
surprisingly detailed and surprisingly

571
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,870
effective we found a lot of good people

572
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,730
out there willing to come to us

573
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:04,490
to help make the situation better where

574
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,440
did we fall in our face and we did quite

575
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,809
a lot we had a really broad initial

576
00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:09,260
scope

577
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:12,770
you know the body mind soul what we

578
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,900
found is that when we started talking

579
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,179
about the criminalization of research

580
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:19,160
the right to research there were already

581
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,410
some organizations working on it it was

582
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,299
already something that was known as a

583
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:26,809
general problem not just among us but

584
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:29,150
also among some of the some of the folks

585
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:32,750
in legislature and the legal practice in

586
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,610
the civil liberties arena we found that

587
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,169
there were tons of people working on it

588
00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:39,799
especially post Snowden everybody came

589
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:41,929
to realize that this was a civil

590
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:44,840
liberties problem and so where we were

591
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,080
gonna contribute our time and energy

592
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,790
that was just going to either get in the

593
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:52,100
way or not contribute as meaningfully

594
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,850
and it is impactful so we went and

595
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:57,919
shortened that condensed it down to just

596
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,299
the body aspect Public Safety human life

597
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:04,520
we also had some fairly bad project

598
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,809
management

599
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:08,929
we've all got day jobs and a lot of the

600
00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:10,220
stuff that we're doing is nights and

601
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:10,910
weekends

602
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,280
and as such we dropped a bunch of

603
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,500
threads so if you've sent us emails or

604
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,110
reached out for contact or had a project

605
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:20,929
and we didn't get back to you or it kind

606
00:25:20,929 --> 00:25:21,830
of fell by the wayside

607
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,020
I apologize come back to us help us work

608
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,690
work it out again we want to keep going

609
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:29,600
we had some really not-so-great

610
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,900
communication one of the things that we

611
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,730
say we need to do better is to

612
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,980
communicate with others to talk about

613
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,100
what we're doing to share what we know

614
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,320
and then we got so wrapped up in doing

615
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,540
things that we forgot to talk about what

616
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,760
we'd been doing we really want to

617
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,590
improve that in this next coming year

618
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:53,530
we initially had some folks who are

619
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,750
going into Congress and getting access

620
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:58,900
to the congressional staffers to try and

621
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,870
plead the case on especially right to

622
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:06,370
research we found that when we went into

623
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:08,559
them and said hey listen we have people

624
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,030
who are going to jail for finding

625
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,770
legitimate vulnerabilities and acting in

626
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,429
good faith with the manufacturers said

627
00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:17,799
I've got a budget crisis I've got Wars

628
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:19,710
going on I've got all these other things

629
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,419
you sound like you just whining right

630
00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:27,220
what do I care we found that if we went

631
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,650
in instead with the public safety human

632
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:31,360
life message but they were actually

633
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,700
really eager to listen and then after we

634
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,400
got done demonstrating that there was a

635
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,980
problem to solve and they said you know

636
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,020
how can we help then we could bring in

637
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,880
the criminalization of research the

638
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,190
right to research and that was very very

639
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:45,790
effective

640
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:48,520
that kind of one-two combination it

641
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,559
helped us be better than we would be

642
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,919
alone and the name we've had countless

643
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,690
times of explaining what does I am the

644
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:00,669
cavalry mean is it you're gonna save us

645
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:02,770
all is it what is the cavalry are you

646
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,450
guys gonna shoot us ride horses like

647
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:10,450
what no the idea is if no one else is

648
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,790
coming to do this if no one's gonna come

649
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:15,940
in and save us then we have to stand up

650
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:20,049
and save ourselves it's a very American

651
00:27:20,049 --> 00:27:23,410
specific reference in metaphor it might

652
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:26,049
work a couple of other places but we

653
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:27,580
found that we got a very mixed reception

654
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,130
especially across Europe and Asia so

655
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:32,799
we'll probably be working on doing

656
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,460
something about that

657
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,470
we found that there were a lot of things

658
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:41,040
we didn't know going into this we were

659
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,960
maybe a little bit naive but we knew

660
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,700
that we were naive and we were open to

661
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,040
learn and we were happy to learn so we

662
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,140
found that a lot of the things we needed

663
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,790
to be doing we didn't really know how to

664
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:55,660
do KT Missouri's for instance convinced

665
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,430
us that one of the things that was

666
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:00,940
really missing and necessary was empathy

667
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,160
the ability to listen to people and

668
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,770
understand their perspective in order to

669
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:08,830
make your argument or your case stronger

670
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,810
when you go in and talk to a medical

671
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,760
device manufacturer and you listen to

672
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,240
why they're not making security a better

673
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,340
stronger feature they really have some

674
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,100
good reasons such as if they did that

675
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,260
they might not be able to sell that

676
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,140
product anymore which sounds kind of

677
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,480
screwed up but you know there are

678
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,910
certain realities that they have if they

679
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,890
change a product too much and add

680
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:35,350
security they have to go through the

681
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:38,230
rivetting process which means that for

682
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,330
the next six to nine years they can't

683
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,310
sell that product so you have a

684
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,440
situation where there's a life-saving

685
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,720
product out there and because there's

686
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,510
maybe a default password in it it's not

687
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,980
going to be saving lives for six to nine

688
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,070
years that's not a real reality I mean

689
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,990
that's costing lives it's doing the

690
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:58,030
opposite of what we're trying to do that

691
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:01,780
was a big surprise understanding that

692
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,970
being able to speak clearly and

693
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:07,660
concisely to non-technical people that

694
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,210
was a huge thing that we need to learn

695
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,280
and get better on so as we're going

696
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,780
through we're actually trying to help

697
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:17,110
folks build those muscles at besides Las

698
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,270
Vegas that was what the entire day was

699
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:22,680
about trying to give insight on to

700
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,180
putting together a cogent presentation

701
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,970
on being able to understand the public

702
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:30,400
policy frameworks that are out there so

703
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,750
that you can engage with them the right

704
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,300
way one of the things we found too is

705
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,000
that when we built those muscles to get

706
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,920
better at this we also got better at our

707
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,260
day jobs now you know you can put

708
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,730
together a business case you can speak

709
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,170
to an executive in a language that they

710
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:49,130
understand so it's kind of a synergistic

711
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:51,380
overlap with what we do for money and

712
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:55,660
what we do for doing the right thing

713
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,460
taking some some different approaches

714
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,059
than we typically take in this and

715
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:03,470
inside the echo chamber as we say you

716
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,690
know we tend to be pretty down on people

717
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:07,100
oh this will never work

718
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,990
that won't work well how do you know did

719
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:11,360
you try it some cases you have some

720
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,460
cases you have it if you have maybe it's

721
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,630
a different scenario and it actually

722
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:15,440
does work

723
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,710
we found that quite a lot we also found

724
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:19,910
that we have to reach out to other

725
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,830
people we can't just sit back and wait

726
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,929
for somebody to come to us we have to

727
00:30:23,929 --> 00:30:26,030
get outside of our echo chamber and go

728
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:28,130
talk to folks who have the power have

729
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:30,559
the access who are the ones who can

730
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:35,690
actually influence and change things we

731
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,309
were really surprised like I said in the

732
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:39,789
public policy folks that we ran into

733
00:30:39,789 --> 00:30:44,710
they were very very smart maybe weren't

734
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:47,570
seeing things from our perspective but

735
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:49,280
at that point you know going back to the

736
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,720
first bullet it's just a matter of

737
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,520
talking to them in a way that they can

738
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,770
understand and then all of a sudden they

739
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,679
applied their logic to our problem and

740
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,030
we came to some really really good

741
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:01,789
conclusions there was one conversation

742
00:31:01,789 --> 00:31:05,440
where we were talking to a public policy

743
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,020
staffer and talking about the risks of

744
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,730
medical devices and if somebody could

745
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:13,580
get access and shut them down and they

746
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,960
asked well what about the Russian mob

747
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,429
would they do that it's like well no

748
00:31:16,429 --> 00:31:19,520
probably not and then they asked well

749
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,500
what if they wanted to extort the

750
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,820
hospital huh you know that's a crimeware

751
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,650
scenario that I haven't really heard but

752
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:30,799
it's not you know unreasonable to some

753
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,659
degree but at that point they're coming

754
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:34,549
up with those they're able to take the

755
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:36,169
knowledge that we've empowered them with

756
00:31:36,169 --> 00:31:38,780
apply it to a new situation for them and

757
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,240
come up with some good ideas it proves

758
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,440
that they're thinking that they're

759
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:48,380
actually willing to make that stretch in

760
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,940
talking with the manufacturing industry

761
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,270
we got lots of contacts from folks who

762
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,590
they've been saying some of these things

763
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,450
inside the organization for

764
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:59,300
for years sometimes you know more than

765
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,330
10 years and we found that we could

766
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:05,530
actually help them whenever some new

767
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:09,530
medical device problem came out they got

768
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:12,170
money to go and fix that right to

769
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:15,950
actually improve the problem that was a

770
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,420
really good thing that was surprising to

771
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,430
us you know we didn't necessarily think

772
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,840
that they were the folks out there who

773
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,370
were doing these things but we found

774
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:25,540
that they were they were fighting very

775
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,790
valiantly in organizations just like

776
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:31,400
many of us have but to no avail so we

777
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,080
were able to provide them air cover and

778
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,210
support to get the things done that

779
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:39,020
needed to be done we also found that a

780
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,460
lot of people really liked the mission

781
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,260
they liked the mission they understood

782
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,450
it it was clear to them and they could

783
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:47,060
then understand why we were doing what

784
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,740
we were doing why we were talking about

785
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:51,290
this why it mattered to us I think one

786
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,670
of the problems we have in this industry

787
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,100
too often we draw out the word

788
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,920
vulnerability and exploit and while we

789
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,350
understand the impact of those to the

790
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,690
general public they don't have that same

791
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,520
level of understanding they might

792
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,140
understand it in a different way

793
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,790
even though we all think we're speaking

794
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,980
English we're actually talking past each

795
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,930
other and so there's a lot of

796
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:14,300
miscommunication but when you talk about

797
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,420
it in a clear unambiguous language then

798
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,310
other people can understand it the same

799
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,050
way that you do at least from a high

800
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:23,240
level at least to the point where it

801
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,190
gets them engaged and gets them to care

802
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:27,770
and then they invite you in they ask you

803
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:31,340
questions not just sit back and try and

804
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,930
pay attention while you're putting them

805
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:35,300
to sleep the way maybe a CPA would an

806
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,900
actuarial guy and we found that one of

807
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:44,450
the biggest opponents we have is giving

808
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:47,000
ourselves permission to go out and do

809
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,550
that for a long time in this industry

810
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:52,220
and in this community we've been doubt

811
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,650
casts of the business world of the

812
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:56,510
technology world we've been the guys who

813
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,190
are in the way or women who are in the

814
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:01,700
way but at this point I think that the

815
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,700
general public is willing to bring us in

816
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,480
we just have to give ourselves

817
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,950
permission

818
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:09,980
to allow that to make a difference to

819
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,750
work with them sometimes on their terms

820
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,099
sometimes on our terms

821
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:15,139
but we can't just give up we can't say

822
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:17,780
well they'll never listen there is a

823
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:23,889
good TED talk done by Karen Eleazar E

824
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:26,810
and it was on hackers as the Internet's

825
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:28,790
immune system she said when she was

826
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:31,310
building up for that talk she was afraid

827
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,629
that the general public the people

828
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:34,969
sitting in the audience who were you

829
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:37,219
know somewhat technology-driven a lot of

830
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:39,530
them that they would hate it they would

831
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:41,060
absolutely refuse to believe that

832
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:44,300
hackers could be anything bad she said

833
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,429
what she found when she got off stage is

834
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:48,829
that everybody was highly receptive to

835
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:50,929
that message that they loved it that

836
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:53,270
they were were asking for more how can

837
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:54,829
we get you guys more involved how can we

838
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:56,149
help you solve the problems that you're

839
00:34:56,149 --> 00:34:58,730
seeing out there and then she took the

840
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:01,910
same message to a group of security

841
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:04,040
people they said oh they don't listen I

842
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,230
don't believe what you said so at Def

843
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:09,290
Con she did a talk on giving yourself

844
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,270
permission on empowering hackers to

845
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:15,079
change the world it was a good talk so

846
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:17,410
what's the next year gonna look like

847
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,910
much much better communication and

848
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,460
transparency into what we're doing again

849
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,560
one of the criticisms that we got was

850
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,849
that we weren't talking about the

851
00:35:25,849 --> 00:35:28,190
activities we were going through we're

852
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,510
actually planning on putting out a

853
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:33,290
regular newsletter a regular update so

854
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,819
that you can track it so you can see

855
00:35:34,819 --> 00:35:35,900
what we've been doing so that you can

856
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,640
hold us accountable if we say we're

857
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,200
gonna do something we need to do it

858
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,250
because these are things that are

859
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,170
important right and if it's important

860
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:44,380
enough to do it's important to track it

861
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,160
we want to have a much broader

862
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,339
international reach being here at 44 Con

863
00:35:49,339 --> 00:35:51,470
in London is great getting to talk to

864
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:53,359
folks who may not have heard the message

865
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,390
before or being able to tailor our

866
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:58,460
message differently to impact a

867
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,260
different part of the world making us

868
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,450
all better from that reaching out and

869
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:04,040
from getting more international and we

870
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,900
have more international trips planned

871
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,010
more international work planned as well

872
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:12,500
we want to provide more information so

873
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,109
that security researchers and others can

874
00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:17,119
come and figure out themselves how to go

875
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,390
and do something

876
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:20,460
so that we're not holders of the

877
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,020
knowledge keepers of the knowledge or

878
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,850
even seen as that we want to be able to

879
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,830
have people connect on their own to just

880
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:28,380
connect to each other spontaneously to

881
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,570
make good things happen without us

882
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:34,200
having to be a bottleneck we want to

883
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,200
have one cavalry summit per year in each

884
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,510
of the industries that we've outlined

885
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,680
bring smart people together the

886
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,660
researchers and the Indust industry

887
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,310
people and have them make those

888
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:47,430
connections talk things through and we'd

889
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:49,890
also like to have one event ourselves so

890
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:51,300
we can come together and say all right

891
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,270
we hear what you know the industry press

892
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,910
says this is what you have to do you

893
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,680
know any virus everything firewall

894
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,560
everything IDs but how do you have an

895
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,710
IDs on a pacemaker just it doesn't work

896
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,750
right so we've got to rethink what

897
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,240
actually works and how to apply it to

898
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,030
these new areas so that we when we get

899
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,430
asked for our advice we're able to give

900
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:20,150
good applicable and reliable advice and

901
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:23,370
we're gonna be filing a legal entity or

902
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:25,440
become adopted by another entity that

903
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,690
wants to bring in our mission into part

904
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:29,850
of theirs this allows us to get into

905
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:33,210
other places we'll file as a 501 C 3

906
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,760
which is a u.s. entity it's basically a

907
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,740
non-profit educational institution or

908
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,080
foundation and it means that we'll have

909
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,620
an independent voice that then we're not

910
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,060
representing a company we're

911
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,100
representing a group of security

912
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,120
researchers and hopefully the community

913
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:54,420
that allows us to be more trusted more

914
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:57,180
of a trusted adviser and less of a kind

915
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,650
of a jaundiced like what are you trying

916
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:01,250
to sell me now

917
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:04,410
so the 5-star automated automotive cyber

918
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:06,150
safety framework has anybody seen this

919
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,540
anybody familiar with it three folks

920
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:13,590
okay so we've published an open letter

921
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:17,040
to the automotive industry and our goal

922
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,460
was to get them to or our goal was to

923
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,140
communicate that we recognize their

924
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:25,650
safety record of innovations right if

925
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:27,360
you look at airbags if you look at

926
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,780
backup cameras if you look at

927
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,320
you know adaptive cruise control these

928
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,850
are all safety innovations that are

929
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:38,710
driven by connectivity and by computers

930
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:41,600
it's important to call that out because

931
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,220
I think that a lot of us in this in this

932
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,930
room think that computers are always

933
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:46,820
gonna be a bad thing they only put

934
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,410
vulnerabilities into a system

935
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,270
well they do put vulnerabilities into a

936
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:52,280
system but they can also make the system

937
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:52,970
safer

938
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:54,680
you just have to balance that you have

939
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:58,460
to make the vulnerabilities not as bad

940
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,850
at least get over the the part of that

941
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:04,670
that's an immediate negative response to

942
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:07,760
new software going in somewhere we also

943
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,290
wanted to call on the automakers to

944
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,640
publicly talk about what they're doing

945
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,720
as well as commit to safety in a way

946
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,010
that allows people to buy smartly so a

947
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:21,320
lot of the automakers we found are doing

948
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,300
really good things it turns out they

949
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,770
just don't talk about them much because

950
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,600
maybe they don't feel like it's a buying

951
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,300
decision criteria or they don't want to

952
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,630
publish trade secrets but it's about

953
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:34,580
getting them to open up just a little

954
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,820
bit to give a peek into it and the

955
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:41,240
example we often cite is Tesla they put

956
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,670
out a coordinated disclosure policy if

957
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,890
you do research on their cars you find

958
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:48,230
bugs you report it to them and give them

959
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:50,450
the chance to fix it and work on it they

960
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:52,130
won't take you to court right they

961
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,450
actually a DEFCON they released they've

962
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:56,420
got a bug bounty so hey you know go out

963
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,070
and make yourself some money maybe make

964
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:01,480
enough to afford to buy a Tesla to test

965
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:05,180
we also recognize that there are

966
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,370
different domains of expertise at work

967
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:09,620
here right there's the cybersecurity

968
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,930
domain of expertise it's also the

969
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:14,450
carmaker domain of expertise I don't

970
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:16,220
know all the things that they've gone in

971
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:18,890
and done to make these things safer to

972
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:21,290
make them more secure the decisions that

973
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:23,270
they've made to not connect multiple

974
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:25,310
systems together because they're

975
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:26,990
fighting hard against some of the

976
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:29,210
security issues that we're fighting hard

977
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:31,220
against so how do we bring these two

978
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,660
groups together so that we can support

979
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,970
each other and go get through this with

980
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:37,820
a better decision and then to introduce

981
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,860
the framework

982
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:41,260
so quickly I'm just gonna run through

983
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,450
this you can see lots more detail on the

984
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:46,210
website or we've got a some documents

985
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:50,020
out there but we have five capabilities

986
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,700
and in the US there's what we call a

987
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,430
five-star crash rating system and they

988
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:56,800
have different attributes as to whether

989
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,310
you get a one versus a five but we

990
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:02,110
wanted to call out specifically safety

991
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,960
by design to you know have a secure

992
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,120
development lifecycle to make sure that

993
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,280
when you're going through the process of

994
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,990
putting in something that's computerized

995
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,550
and connected that you're thinking

996
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:14,590
through what that means so that you

997
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:18,630
build it safely from the start

998
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:21,010
third-party collaboration how do you

999
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:22,390
work with other people who report

1000
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:24,970
vulnerabilities and issues and this is

1001
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:28,480
an important one obviously to us it

1002
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,690
invites others contributors who find

1003
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:35,020
things to submit them rather than being

1004
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,680
ostracized and trying to make those

1005
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,440
folks feel like they're doing bad things

1006
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,550
they should be feeling like they're

1007
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:44,590
doing good things for reporting them in

1008
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:46,720
a coordinated manner so that they can

1009
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,970
get fixed and understand it that they're

1010
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:52,480
willing allies not adversaries having

1011
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,940
some form of evidence capture so that if

1012
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:57,640
the braking system fails you know why it

1013
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,860
failed right it's not just a random

1014
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,560
spontaneous act if it happened from a

1015
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,840
computer system or over the computer

1016
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,750
area controller area network you want to

1017
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:11,500
know that right so that the the process

1018
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,020
can be fixed once you identify issues

1019
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,610
that need to be fixed how do you fix

1020
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:18,550
them right so if you have let's say

1021
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:20,890
heartbleed in your braking system

1022
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:23,290
you shouldn't have to replace the brakes

1023
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,720
to fix the heartbleed issue right you

1024
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,250
should be able to have some secure way

1025
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:29,020
to patch with you know full

1026
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,540
cryptographic signatures to make sure

1027
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,130
that the patch is what it's supposed to

1028
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:37,840
be and how do you segment or isolate

1029
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,720
different systems from each other your

1030
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,460
radio should never be able to cause your

1031
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,070
airbags to go off but if they're

1032
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:48,390
attached there's always that possibility

1033
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:51,550
and a lot of this work came from

1034
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:53,740
collaborations with other people we

1035
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:56,140
talked to dozens of folks over several

1036
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,579
months it wasn't just a bunch of

1037
00:42:57,579 --> 00:42:59,380
ignorant security researchers sitting in

1038
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,150
a room writing things down that were

1039
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:03,309
pie-in-the-sky dreams we actually got to

1040
00:43:03,309 --> 00:43:05,349
talk to automakers we talked to people

1041
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:08,109
who have jobs in the auto industry who

1042
00:43:08,109 --> 00:43:10,809
said well we can't really do this but if

1043
00:43:10,809 --> 00:43:12,579
you pitched it like that that would be

1044
00:43:12,579 --> 00:43:14,500
really good and that is in line with

1045
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,910
some of the other initiatives in the

1046
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:17,800
industry no all right we'll go back and

1047
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,800
rejiggered this we talked to policy

1048
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,390
makers who are really interested in

1049
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:23,559
something like this they're always

1050
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,230
interested in self regulation rather

1051
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:28,150
than imposing a new regulatory regime

1052
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:29,829
because that's hard they have to burn

1053
00:43:29,829 --> 00:43:31,540
political capital there's a new industry

1054
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,880
or a new organization that you've got to

1055
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,670
stand up it's just a pain so they always

1056
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:38,619
prefer something more like this where

1057
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:41,410
you can get smart people from the

1058
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,609
industry in a room and solve their own

1059
00:43:42,609 --> 00:43:43,990
problems then they don't have to worry

1060
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:46,660
about it we talked to accident

1061
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,280
investigators we talked to a lot of

1062
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,390
different people's standards

1063
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:50,950
organizations about how do you do this

1064
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:52,480
the right way

1065
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,030
so again the point of this is not to

1066
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:56,500
belabor the fact that we talk to a lot

1067
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,990
of people it's just make sure everybody

1068
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:03,599
understands it was something that was a

1069
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:07,780
collaborative effort and what we were

1070
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:09,609
really hoping to gain from this is just

1071
00:44:09,609 --> 00:44:11,440
to address concerns everybody in the

1072
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,390
room to kind of bring these topics up

1073
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:14,770
and say this is something worth talking

1074
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:17,530
about here's a start let's put it out

1075
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,990
there see what happens we got a lot of

1076
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,160
good feedback from a lot of

1077
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,700
manufacturers from OEMs people who were

1078
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:26,049
desperate to talk to us because they had

1079
00:44:26,049 --> 00:44:28,210
been trying the same things and this

1080
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:30,309
helped them do what they needed to do

1081
00:44:30,309 --> 00:44:32,530
and actually some of these slides were

1082
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:34,630
created for a couple of car companies

1083
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,869
who specifically asked for a few very

1084
00:44:37,869 --> 00:44:39,579
short slides that they could present to

1085
00:44:39,579 --> 00:44:41,799
their executives internally to say this

1086
00:44:41,799 --> 00:44:44,980
is what we need to start doing we also

1087
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:47,349
wanted again to call out the industries

1088
00:44:47,349 --> 00:44:49,690
recognize the industries practices of

1089
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:52,020
innovating safety over the last 50 years

1090
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,309
it's not a new thing for them they've

1091
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:56,160
been doing this a long time

1092
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,999
so give them credit where credit is due

1093
00:44:59,999 --> 00:45:01,979
and again work together with them to

1094
00:45:01,979 --> 00:45:03,059
make sure that we come to the right

1095
00:45:03,059 --> 00:45:07,729
solutions across a wide suite of

1096
00:45:07,729 --> 00:45:11,459
vehicles and they get just a wider

1097
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:14,729
adoption of cyber safety principles and

1098
00:45:14,729 --> 00:45:17,609
if you haven't already go here bit dot

1099
00:45:17,609 --> 00:45:20,279
Lee slash 5-star auto and we have a

1100
00:45:20,279 --> 00:45:22,529
petition on change.org it's a five

1101
00:45:22,529 --> 00:45:24,599
hundred and thirty signatures I think

1102
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:26,160
something like that somewhere around

1103
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,880
there of folks a lot of them from

1104
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,440
conferences that we've gone to talk to

1105
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,019
as well as a lot of them from people who

1106
00:45:34,019 --> 00:45:36,119
have seen this in newspapers or heard on

1107
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:40,190
the radio who have gone and signed it

1108
00:45:40,219 --> 00:45:42,029
getting involved I think one of the

1109
00:45:42,029 --> 00:45:43,499
biggest things that I learned this year

1110
00:45:43,499 --> 00:45:44,910
was that there were a lot of people who

1111
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:48,509
quit their the job that they had to take

1112
00:45:48,509 --> 00:45:50,670
a new job in an industry that was

1113
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:53,880
affected by these types of things people

1114
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,920
went and worked for for instance the

1115
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,190
Mayo Clinic in the United States to

1116
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:01,109
bring a good security research

1117
00:46:01,109 --> 00:46:03,900
background into a buying organization of

1118
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,299
some of these technologies that's great

1119
00:46:06,299 --> 00:46:08,160
people want to make went to work for car

1120
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,680
makers people change their jobs from

1121
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,029
working in a healthcare organization

1122
00:46:12,029 --> 00:46:14,489
where they couldn't do anything to

1123
00:46:14,489 --> 00:46:17,099
security research groups where they had

1124
00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:21,180
a strong background in finding flaws and

1125
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,160
medical devices and now they're able to

1126
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,719
go out and do that not just for one

1127
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:25,920
organization but for multiple

1128
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,749
organizations go in and look at target

1129
00:46:30,749 --> 00:46:32,309
technology so if you are already a

1130
00:46:32,309 --> 00:46:35,069
security researcher maybe instead of

1131
00:46:35,069 --> 00:46:37,489
trying to find the next Android malware

1132
00:46:37,489 --> 00:46:40,019
you spend some time just poking around

1133
00:46:40,019 --> 00:46:42,479
with a car system or a medical device or

1134
00:46:42,479 --> 00:46:45,650
you know something else something that

1135
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:48,269
maybe has a little bit more impact than

1136
00:46:48,269 --> 00:46:50,160
credit card numbers or just commodity

1137
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,979
malware that's always a good thing that

1138
00:46:52,979 --> 00:46:56,849
people may be overlooked I pitch it this

1139
00:46:56,849 --> 00:46:58,859
way you know it's probably going to take

1140
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:02,420
you an hour to find malware on Android

1141
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:05,059
it's not hard then you're gonna spend

1142
00:47:05,059 --> 00:47:06,859
the next two-three weeks trying to

1143
00:47:06,859 --> 00:47:09,799
justify why it's a big deal to the you

1144
00:47:09,799 --> 00:47:11,660
know media group that you work with to

1145
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:14,390
media outlets to your boss so you can

1146
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:17,000
work on it more if you spend the same

1147
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,500
amount of time you're probably going to

1148
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,450
find a vulnerability in a medical device

1149
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:22,849
but at that point it's really apparent

1150
00:47:22,849 --> 00:47:25,250
why that has an impact right so

1151
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:28,099
selfishly you're just saving yourself a

1152
00:47:28,099 --> 00:47:29,480
lot of the time that you'd have to spend

1153
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,339
trying to think up reasons to keep doing

1154
00:47:31,339 --> 00:47:33,440
this and people will turns out give you

1155
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,930
more stuff to work on if you're able to

1156
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:38,980
make that case it's really really easy

1157
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:41,599
go to events talk about what you're

1158
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:46,549
doing speak to not us in this room but

1159
00:47:46,549 --> 00:47:49,099
go to a car event if you're doing car

1160
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:50,930
research if you're in the medical

1161
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:53,690
industry go talk at a medical conference

1162
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:56,180
or maybe they haven't heard the security

1163
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,500
message or they haven't heard it in a

1164
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,710
way that makes sense to them and just

1165
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:02,990
help educate folks you can always join

1166
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:04,520
the discussion we've got a discussion

1167
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,170
list up it's a google group so you can

1168
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:07,700
go back and look at the archived emails

1169
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,920
you can also sign up it's a mailing list

1170
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,619
so get the emails as they come out and

1171
00:48:12,619 --> 00:48:14,569
then follow us on twitter and give us

1172
00:48:14,569 --> 00:48:17,420
feedback either here in person and I'll

1173
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:19,010
be around the rest of the week or

1174
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:22,270
through email it's good way to reach us

1175
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:25,910
and so part of the point of the cavalry

1176
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:28,819
is just to kind of recognize that it's a

1177
00:48:28,819 --> 00:48:31,880
personal responsibility that each of us

1178
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,849
is the cavalry that we're not just

1179
00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:37,790
security researchers we're not just just

1180
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:39,980
security folks we're also a lot of other

1181
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:41,839
things we also have other

1182
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,599
responsibilities and those are the

1183
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:48,170
things that I think drive us all to want

1184
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:51,109
to achieve something that is good we are

1185
00:48:51,109 --> 00:48:53,569
powerful we can carry a voice of reason

1186
00:48:53,569 --> 00:48:57,020
and we can't be the cavalry so thank you

1187
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,100
very much

1188
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:03,630
