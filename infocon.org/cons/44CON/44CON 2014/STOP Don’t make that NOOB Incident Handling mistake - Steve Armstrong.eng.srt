time I'm gonna talk about and isn't

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,800
having mistakes looking at it from the

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,810
management and trying to stop you making

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,250
nood nood

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,150
newb that was last night new instant

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,849
having mistakes a little bit about me so

10
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:28,650
you know where I'm why I'm talking to

11
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,170
you and what my background is I'm ex Air

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,130
Force I spent 18 years in the RAF

13
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,300
helping them build secure systems

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,040
accrediting them penetration testing

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,160
them and running various aspects after I

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,930
left the Air Force I went and set up a

17
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,390
security consultancy and we work for

18
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,950
people in the military we work for

19
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,930
defense contractors we were flibberty

20
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,850
government we also work for gaming

21
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,120
companies and music companies which is

22
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,160
kind of extremes sort of like complete

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,960
government lockdown sort of environment

24
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,699
or you get the other one which is the

25
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,859
music industry which is very relaxed

26
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:03,780
very sort of like don't encrypt our

27
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,060
stuff we don't like encryption things

28
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,760
like that and we're doing instant

29
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,869
response for over eight years

30
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,119
and throughout that when you're working

31
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:13,409
with some of the biggest game companies

32
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:15,270
in the world you tend to find that

33
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,430
Russian hackers love to try and get

34
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,049
credit card details user accounts

35
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:20,850
passwords etc so they're quite a big

36
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,040
target so we've spent a lot of time

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,840
doing inter response right down at the

38
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,140
both at the sort of wide international

39
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,110
you know large dispersed networks and

40
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,479
also trying to find fight people off

41
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,040
desktops trying to fight people out of

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,040
databases etc the likes of the apt one

43
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,380
were all over the likes of some of our

44
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,320
customers all of their URLs etc featured

45
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,020
in all of the reports most of sounds

46
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,460
instructors so if you ever doing science

47
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,049
courses and computers you're a see me

48
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:50,100
hanging around the sounds environment

49
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,720
and I'm also one of the guys who helped

50
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,250
design and come up with a concept for

51
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,899
cyber CPR which is a product that we are

52
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,850
sort of releasing later on today in beta

53
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,310
and it's free ad for smaller

54
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,619
organizations right enough that

55
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,880
corporate stuff okay end of corporate

56
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,820
mode

57
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,960
welcome to the morning after okay

58
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,000
I thought of doing her like a really big

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,950
white screen type stuff but some of you

60
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,420
just gonna be like awful some of you're

61
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,590
probably from last night so what I'm

62
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,790
gonna talk about no talk about actually

63
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,170
what instant response is because a lot

64
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,820
of people have a misconception about at

65
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,170
you what it is and what it's about

66
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,460
I'm gonna talk about our issues with

67
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,810
management cuz a lot of this problem

68
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,250
comes down to management and I'll talk

69
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,580
about my my problem with people so I'm

70
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,960
okay with some people but other people

71
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,060
I'm just not happy with then we'll talk

72
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,680
about some of the fundamental ir

73
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,050
problems some of these will be easy for

74
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,400
you to pick up but some of them you'll

75
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,810
see will actually trace back to the

76
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,280
people problem and to the management

77
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,900
problem I'm not saying that management

78
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,720
is the root cause of all evil but we'll

79
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,760
see how this goes I might get a chance

80
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,290
to get a demo working and then at the

81
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,490
end if there's any time left and I

82
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,890
haven't been zapped by the by the gun oh

83
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,690
and we'll do some organized heckling in

84
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,040
the form of some sort of questions and

85
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,280
baiting etcetera right what is instant

86
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,380
response why do we care

87
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,390
it's responses like the new it's you

88
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,010
know right nice trendy sort of word

89
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,220
these days it's picked up from cyber

90
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,450
those of you who know me and know the

91
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,100
fact that I'm an I'm an old fart another

92
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,690
fact that you know I was in cyber before

93
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,459
it was cold cyber you know cyber was

94
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:20,530
just some sort of cliche sort of word it

95
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,330
still is but we were there rapport is

96
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,230
invented why are we an instrument to why

97
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,670
we care actually because if you look at

98
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,830
these facts have taken from the PWC

99
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,590
UK biz survey from this year and they

100
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,300
look at the number of organizations that

101
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,709
have been compromised and this is one of

102
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:37,360
the driving factors behind people

103
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,090
wanting to be in insta response and deal

104
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,310
with in certain spots you know to 81

105
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,170
percent of large organizations have had

106
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,690
a breach Wow 60 percent of small

107
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,270
businesses okay if you look at actually

108
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,120
the number of breaches okay six for a

109
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,000
small business 16 for a large business

110
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,760
that's a sizable amount when you look at

111
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,180
the actual cost per breach it gets scary

112
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,090
okay 1.15 million for a large

113
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,100
organization some of those can take that

114
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,680
kind of hit smaller organizations less

115
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,780
than 250 employees at a hundred and

116
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,910
fifteen thousand that's a major hit on

117
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,150
their bottom line that's like two staff

118
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,200
for staff of your a manufacturing

119
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,070
company that's the kind of cost of your

120
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,620
looking out now tell what what is it

121
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,450
what is in stress balls I love people

122
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,190
say all in response it's like this like

123
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,500
this Jess game it's you versus the other

124
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,660
people you go no no no no no no it's not

125
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,030
it's not because Jess has rules

126
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,060
jess has a board I have pieces you have

127
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,500
pieces week we say three o'clock let's

128
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,660
play chess we arranged that we have tea

129
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,770
or in English we have tea we play chess

130
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,250
that's fine

131
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,240
but I'm a consultant I'm playing on

132
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,100
somebody else's network you know my

133
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,710
chessboard is your network that makes me

134
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,990
uncomfortable the fact is as well as you

135
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,270
know everybody's never n't and I don't

136
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,030
know which network we're playing on the

137
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:02,210
attacker gets to choose the board he

138
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,830
gets to choose the time of day he

139
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,120
doesn't for male to say Steve let's play

140
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,400
let's play chess he phones me up by

141
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,290
quite happily compromising one of my

142
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,670
customers at three o'clock on a Saturday

143
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,830
morning my customer for example said

144
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,610
Steve let's play chess so that's the

145
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:17,120
problem

146
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,940
I also the magazine you don't get the

147
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,820
textbook network and anybody's worked in

148
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,260
IR who knows what when you arrive and

149
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,840
you say have you got the net flow they

150
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,980
go net to that flow no you got a 90s no

151
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,670
you got logs you're playing with a

152
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,890
non-standard Network you've got to try

153
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,260
and work out what they have first the

154
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,450
other thing is the bad guys got way more

155
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:47,000
plate pieces you're just you're fighting

156
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,740
an endless battle they've got the time

157
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,260
the resources you're limited by the time

158
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,210
and effort that your customer or your

159
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,430
organization can afford you to spend on

160
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,990
the incident it's an unfair advantage

161
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:01,030
you don't even know where they are

162
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,230
you try playing chess when you don't

163
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,370
know where the other players places are

164
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,020
how can you plan your strategy

165
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,050
how could you deal with this thing the

166
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,490
only time you know that the game is

167
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,290
started is when they start knocking over

168
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,180
your servers they started compromised

169
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,680
you know you started losing pieces on

170
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,350
your board okay and the problem is

171
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,820
you're looking at the fact that your

172
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,770
systems have gone down but it might take

173
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,780
you days or weeks to work out the fact

174
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,060
that actually you've lost data what have

175
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,240
you lost where has it gone so saying

176
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,650
that instant response is like a game of

177
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,590
chess

178
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:35,490
now one thing I'm gonna focus on is this

179
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,080
concept in this doodle-loop

180
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,580
and those of you who are ex-military

181
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,910
will look nothing who delivers this

182
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:46,290
concept put together by Lieutenant

183
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,700
Colonel John Boyd

184
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,980
it was quite fundamental to u.s.

185
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,590
military thinking it's this concept that

186
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,110
you in any attack situation and if

187
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,640
you're in sort of you know instant

188
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,070
response you're fighting an attacker the

189
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,870
concept is that you must always observe

190
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,030
what's happening you know and that means

191
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,470
you need some sort of indicator as to

192
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,120
what's changed on the network or what's

193
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,560
happening on the network you need to

194
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,780
then orientate yourself to what the

195
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,970
attacker is trying to achieve you need

196
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,320
to understand what his capabilities are

197
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,720
what his goal is because once you

198
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,610
understand that then you can actually

199
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,720
decide what you're gonna do I want

200
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,290
you've decided you can then act for

201
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,580
those of you who are into your military

202
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,970
hardware this is why the f-16 and the

203
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,330
f-18 looked nothing like the f-14 and

204
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,480
the f-15 big heavy fighters that the

205
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,340
Americans used to have they decided that

206
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,270
faster and nimbler was better and that's

207
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,730
why if you have a coup de loop as we

208
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,470
call it feel that doodle-loop then is

209
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,930
faster and tighter than that of your

210
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,900
opponent you can outmaneuver him it's a

211
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,810
whole concept of maneuverability in

212
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,250
military speak we talk about the person

213
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,080
with the tightest lip has a higher

214
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,020
operational tempo they're working faster

215
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,880
than you they can out thank you they can

216
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,220
do whatever they wish because they can

217
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,430
out think out plan and out act what

218
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:16,620
you're trying to do this guy Chuck Chuck

219
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,860
Norris is 74 years old people are gonna

220
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,080
have any get me slow Oh it'll be too

221
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,180
slow who would like to fight Chuck why

222
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:32,010
not he's old slow because he's actually

223
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,140
still able to see what you're doing

224
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,360
Chuck Norris is experienced in martial

225
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,789
arts so you can actually anticipate what

226
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:39,539
you're gonna do

227
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:42,240
he can still decide based upon his huge

228
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,460
experience in martial arts as to

229
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,620
to do so yes he might be a couple of

230
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,839
milliseconds slower but he's still got a

231
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,880
tighter you de loop than you have

232
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,010
it's about management

233
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,510
I love management problem management in

234
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,420
two responses - we'll have a very

235
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,310
black-and-white viewing things you go on

236
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,170
an insulin response course you must know

237
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,060
about this response you know it you've

238
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,339
been on a course because for some reason

239
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:14,250
in six or day days or five days or how

240
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,810
loving you spend on the course somebody

241
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,520
can inject you with 20 years of

242
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,200
experience somehow I don't know how it

243
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,450
happens I know I've been on some courses

244
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,800
where there is some kind of injection

245
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,830
but it's not necessarily the experience

246
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,149
then they have this this assumption than

247
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,529
actually everything that happens on TV

248
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:31,200
is real okay which is all fault doesn't

249
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,310
take this long in television of course

250
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,450
it doesn't it's only 50 minutes long

251
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,209
your programs in 50 minutes

252
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:37,290
okay then they look at how much to be

253
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,620
paying him how much we paying these guys

254
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,490
what Sherlock do you know we've got

255
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,740
these urgent urgent priorities we need

256
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,209
you to work on all of these priorities

257
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:49,860
because they're all urgent these are all

258
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,380
the highest priority all six of them how

259
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:57,720
does that work classic one but we bought

260
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,410
them the best tools why why can't you do

261
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,430
this job you've got the best tools CSI

262
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:10,320
wasn't this slow the problem I say is

263
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,010
with management

264
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,630
it's not the people it's not just the

265
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,640
people it's actually part of what the

266
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,160
good management to provide you

267
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,700
capability it enables your staff bad

268
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,130
management these people in disarray it's

269
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,330
all the end of doing is clicking around

270
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,690
the tools tools do not equal capability

271
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,220
and when you're right there I'm not that

272
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,990
I'm against vendors anybody who says

273
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,620
this this magic box will do all anti apt

274
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,089
kind of stuff just plug in your network

275
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:37,950
switch it on pay us the 100,000 pounds

276
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,620
and it'll all be great that does not

277
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,120
equal capability that just means you've

278
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,990
spent 100,000 pounds okay and I love I'm

279
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,690
back to my martial arts thing I've been

280
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:53,310
doing Taekwondo knife for cracky mmm 30

281
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,709
plus years I love teaching

282
00:10:55,709 --> 00:10:57,660
new people martial arts

283
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,490
because new people have come to any sort

284
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,470
of martial arts class in their head they

285
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,149
are Bruce Lee there are only three

286
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:05,399
lessons in but they're in their head

287
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,680
there Bruce Lee and therefore when they

288
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,410
start to actually try and do anything

289
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,269
they try and take the basic tools you've

290
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:14,880
given them and they try and in their

291
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,029
head they can do anything this is a

292
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:21,060
beautiful set of walnut handled chisels

293
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,920
you can buy these from being cured about

294
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,870
eighty-five pounds they're beautiful

295
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,670
you give the person the best tools that

296
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,410
they can you said I need you to do this

297
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,389
in sir small I need you to build me this

298
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,490
tool build me this network secure this

299
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,050
environment and the guy comes up with

300
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:37,170
this you didn't quite get it we give you

301
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,670
the best tools what was the problem

302
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,740
he doesn't experience it wasn't for

303
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,810
techniques the problem in our industry

304
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,060
is what's the difference between a guy

305
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,860
who's got twenty years of experience and

306
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,259
a guy who's just at a university who's

307
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:51,300
done two or three courses they both pick

308
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,250
up with the same laptop they both pick

309
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,649
up with the same tools in interview they

310
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:58,339
both talk the same kind of language and

311
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:00,360
then you get the old guy in the network

312
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,740
and he rolls up his sleeves and gets on

313
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,019
with it and you guy comes in and goes oh

314
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:08,130
no I can't get my tool to install I'm

315
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,470
kind of stuck and it's always depressing

316
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,939
if you speak to anybody who's doing any

317
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,439
recruitment in our industry it's

318
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:16,050
depressing about how new people in the

319
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,670
industry think that just by trotting off

320
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,069
tool names get you a job that demands

321
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:22,230
forty five fifty thousand pounds even

322
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,430
when it comes back to using the tools

323
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:26,209
they have no idea

324
00:12:26,509 --> 00:12:29,730
actual capability I guess a my kids

325
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,639
doing Taekwondo I love the fact that

326
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,680
when you take a new guy who's just out

327
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,079
of university he sits there and he gets

328
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:38,550
the tool he bears the tool up and he

329
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,769
clicks ran the same buttons that he

330
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:43,649
thought he saw on the course he sits at

331
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:46,649
and in his head he is Bruce Lee on that

332
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:49,290
tool and the expert sitting back there

333
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,149
going dude you're just not getting it at

334
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:51,569
all

335
00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:55,829
maybe the tool breaks okay I love these

336
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:59,160
guys but in their head they are both

337
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,290
Bruce Lee they are they are kicking to

338
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,079
the head they're punching so fast and

339
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,699
this is the problem we have people will

340
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:07,470
oversell our skills they were oversell

341
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,160
the capabilities

342
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,120
and that's the problem that we fix the

343
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,980
industry and management don't recognize

344
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,540
that and they don't help us by giving us

345
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,769
some of the better tools the better

346
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:18,839
people etc the better skills so that's a

347
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,570
problem we face as I've said you TV

348
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,820
doesn't represent real life okay

349
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,279
fifty five minutes or 50 minutes of CSI

350
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,380
gets you two investigations a

351
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,690
well-equipped team that can reverse

352
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,610
engineer based upon one single pixel

353
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:35,910
image a whole investigation okay and

354
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:39,110
that is what our bosses think happens

355
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,640
but most of our teams they're not even

356
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,829
like this the boss thinks I bought the

357
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:45,660
tool I spent half a million on tools

358
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:49,110
you've got the right surely we've got a

359
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:52,560
CSI team you don't know we're more like

360
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,120
this now I like I like scooby-doo

361
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,930
showing my age let's look at the mystery

362
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,670
machines team composition okay what have

363
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,519
we got we got Dahmer hey you know Velma

364
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,800
she is the Guru she's one of sorts

365
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,839
everything out what we do do without

366
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:10,410
Velma

367
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,180
then we have I think Fred and Daphne

368
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,149
they are management they smile way too

369
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:15,779
much

370
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:17,940
they don't actually add anything other

371
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,110
than a little bit of decoration to the

372
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:21,750
whole episode and then we have the

373
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:27,420
colony duo Shaggy and Scooby how many of

374
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,040
you just mapped your whole team into

375
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,640
these five people how many Velma's have

376
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,339
you got how many Shaggy and Scooby's

377
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:40,820
have you got it's kind of bad isn't it

378
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,760
not instant responses a new thing

379
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,680
cybers a new thing let's go back to the

380
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,250
original apt since sooo what did he ever

381
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,709
say about IR we asked him in a webcast

382
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:57,180
we had last week and he said if you know

383
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,459
you know your enemy you know yourself

384
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:00,630
hey great

385
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,610
you know your tools you know your team

386
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,430
you can work well your amateur instant

387
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,339
response team okay if you know yourself

388
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:10,380
hey you know we've got the best tools

389
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,450
we're well skilled we have no

390
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,829
intelligence we have no idea what the

391
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:17,160
enemy's doing sort of developing do you

392
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,779
have them got it if you haven't got you

393
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:19,920
know if you've got a team full of

394
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,200
shaggy's and that means you haven't got

395
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,140
a Scooby then you're gonna lose every

396
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,300
time and the worst thing is you would

397
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,760
even know that you're losing because

398
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,649
you'll be the four year old doing the

399
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:34,950
martial arts doing the moves and the

400
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,660
only person who's standing watching you

401
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,839
fail is the attacker

402
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,480
how about so it's not about management

403
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,470
so it's just about management it's

404
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,510
actually my whole process management

405
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,190
enables you and gives you the right

406
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,720
tools to be able to do the right job if

407
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,339
you understand what your goal is and on

408
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:51,899
some of your attackers goal is you can

409
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:54,089
actually do a good job you need to

410
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:57,570
understand who your attackers are who is

411
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,660
attacking you why they've done the

412
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,390
analysis why is it important well the

413
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,950
boss'll Turenne say yeah you know I

414
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:08,160
don't care what I gave you taxes you

415
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,350
know then we have let's ask about that

416
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,270
what do you think little Zowie MO and

417
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,620
she goes well you know if you don't

418
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,390
understand the attacker how are you

419
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:18,810
gonna try and outmaneuver somebody the

420
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:23,880
second o is orientate if I know that I

421
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,160
will have a good suspicion that it's a

422
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,190
denial of service because somehow some

423
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,930
hacked off kid is annoyed because we

424
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,660
suspended as a count I know the kind of

425
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,540
mitigations that we can do if I think I

426
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,730
own this is an apt this is a targeted

427
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,110
phishing attack that's trying to install

428
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,880
malware that I can take different steps

429
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,070
by simply understanding exactly what's

430
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,709
happening if you don't do this but how

431
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:49,740
can you actually try an i mover that's

432
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,300
why people selling thrill and threat

433
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,500
intelligence are doing such a good job

434
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,240
let's think of the kind of people we

435
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:00,400
have very briefly the first group my

436
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,080
favorite good shits and giggles why do

437
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,660
you do that why not you know you wanna

438
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,550
hang out in 4chan look at them there

439
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:09,660
look let's have some fun okay those guys

440
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,680
they're not gonna do any permanent

441
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,450
damage might have you hid your

442
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,069
reputation and we have our hacktivism

443
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,720
you know our anonymous people who taking

444
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,460
up a calls the type thing they gonna

445
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,780
have a different tool set a different

446
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,630
plan okay then we have our cyber

447
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,069
criminals you know when cyber criminals

448
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,420
are in there for multiple reasons you

449
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,040
know the old Cebu there was he just

450
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,980
trying to make me pay rent payment rent

451
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,780
don't I want to do then you end it was

452
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,940
like track to stall an estimated two

453
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,620
million two million dollars one hundred

454
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,300
and forty thousand credit cards with an

455
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,550
organized infrastructure to sell credit

456
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,120
card details he was in it for the money

457
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,970
then we are big third cyber espionage

458
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,690
people are after a competitive

459
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,730
intelligence and to get access to your

460
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,940
secrets look at the tool sets your

461
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,350
giggle screws what are they after

462
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,850
yeah but a dose of it a command

463
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,890
injection secret injection I do really

464
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,660
want to overly penetrate their network

465
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,940
because there's a chance based upon

466
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,500
historic that I might actually go to

467
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,040
jail

468
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,490
okay so the brave but they're not stupid

469
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:09,400
all of them not all of them okay isn't

470
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,720
gonna try and do some you know denial of

471
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,580
service kind of stuff so interruption it

472
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,720
gets a bit of press get a bit of

473
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,970
reputational stuff but nothing to jail

474
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,430
time II you start with criminal as he's

475
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,930
looking for a bit more persistence a

476
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:23,260
little bit of covert stuff okay browsers

477
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,150
droppers malware trying to hide what

478
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:29,160
he's doing you cyber espionage will

479
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,240
there wasn't on a really what they what

480
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,920
they're trying to achieve this look

481
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,940
needs the same kind of tools

482
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,670
rootkits stolen credit card are not

483
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,410
serve carrying out stolen certificates

484
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,180
code signing certificates to enable them

485
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,660
to go over so if you understand the kind

486
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,160
of even in the early stages of an

487
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,660
incident the early indications as to

488
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,550
what the tool is where it's been

489
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:51,130
targeted against and take an overarching

490
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,690
view of that you can actually start an

491
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,040
understand the kind of attacker group

492
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,630
that you're after and therefore you can

493
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:58,180
start to observe orientate and make a

494
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:02,140
decision go into the sort of the basics

495
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,540
then any of the sort of a lot of places

496
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,890
quote this six stages we sort of a min

497
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,390
it's fighting put an extra stage in

498
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,580
there because the six stages of instant

499
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,050
response was actually designed at a time

500
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,780
when cloud putting your data on somebody

501
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,550
else's network what some really a thing

502
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:19,460
now it's commonplace so as well as our

503
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,080
sort of standard of six stages we have

504
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,640
this assessment and engagement actually

505
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,000
understanding where is our data and it's

506
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,440
quite surprising when you go into some

507
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,210
organizations to say them so where is

508
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,220
this box they're like oh it's in our

509
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:35,620
source data center and where's that

510
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,960
pretty sure which country is it in I'll

511
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,970
get back to you so it's interesting to

512
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,470
get that involved let's look at some of

513
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,810
the stages first one it's a classic one

514
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,760
not having an insulin response plan

515
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,020
several people have highlighted this

516
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,390
what do you do if you having a plan you

517
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,320
just wing it

518
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,050
you let Shaggy and Scooby go and run

519
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,360
around and get chased by mummy that's

520
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,590
what you're holding to response plan

521
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,210
comes down or you end up this horrible

522
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:02,480
on the end of this this tomb of paper

523
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,190
that nobody reads and the only person

524
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:06,680
actually looks at it is the author the

525
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,720
guy quality checked it may be your

526
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,080
auditor and the defense counsel who say

527
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,610
that you didn't actually follow the

528
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,620
policy in the process because you didn't

529
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,050
actually read the document to actually

530
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,470
follow what it says you must do so

531
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,390
having overly overly complicated large

532
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,390
documents is it's not a great idea

533
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:29,120
things like asset registers basics no

534
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,220
having no build station information no

535
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,080
server build station and this comes back

536
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,940
to another management thing if you go to

537
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,770
the network administrators and they're

538
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:40,310
there execs under this c-level network I

539
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,170
go I'm looking for network diagram and

540
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:45,350
he goes we haven't got one how can you

541
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,750
manage what you can't measure how can

542
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,150
you be in charge of anything if you

543
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,010
haven't actually good understanding what

544
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:56,390
you've got we went did some IR work for

545
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:00,140
an organization and their head of IT

546
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,910
security came out we were talking about

547
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,140
I said can I get him like a network

548
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,960
guard on it's like mmm he said I could

549
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,620
draw them for you like okay well there's

550
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,360
a whiteboard go draw so after five

551
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,100
minutes it goes away it comes back in

552
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,300
with it with a piece of paper and starts

553
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,940
drawing this network diagram I sort of

554
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,050
looked over his shoulder and looked at

555
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,170
the network diagram the

556
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:22,410
it was actually a picture of the same

557
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,470
whiteboard that he was curtly writing on

558
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,910
like where'd you get the picture from

559
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,559
well I'm only in the job three months

560
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,960
when I left I asked for a networked or

561
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,100
when I arrived I asked for a network

562
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,140
diagram - and this is what my

563
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,370
predecessor gave me

564
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,350
he drew network diagram it's like dude

565
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,700
you've been in job three months and you

566
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,350
haven't actually got an idea what's in

567
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,600
your network thank ya I'm getting around

568
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,400
it

569
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,690
how can you Itemizer how could you

570
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:48,210
actually understand what you've got the

571
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,280
other one is documents I mean we all

572
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,549
love to read detailed documents doing

573
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:55,290
and we all love robbing the kind of

574
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,090
document we want have like loads of

575
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:00,270
information really easy to read we don't

576
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,320
ride those we're an IT

577
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,380
why use one word when 600 will do okay

578
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,270
and then who likes riding them when your

579
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,530
boss says you need you to document all

580
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,980
the security policies in the system it's

581
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,010
just not what you ought to do so

582
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:16,110
knowledge transfer is is like only by

583
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,809
experience and if you haven't got

584
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:20,580
anything written down what do you have

585
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,880
left well you have tribal knowledge you

586
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,280
asked the guy who built it you ask the

587
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,200
guy who's been there for three months

588
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,820
longer than you have who's been there

589
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,710
for four years you say dude what's wrong

590
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,000
with this he says Olive Oyl when I

591
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,150
arrived we had this this strange method

592
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,470
of building servers right I think this

593
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,640
is one of these servers that we built

594
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,070
strange but always going to the tribal

595
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,600
leader is always a weird sort of

596
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,220
experience because they're like pay

597
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,919
homage to my power and knowledge you

598
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:49,140
have to always bow down to the person

599
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,450
who's God that he says the I am the only

600
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,160
person who knows that I am the most

601
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,059
valuable person in the organization so

602
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:59,460
people don't like to share other things

603
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,380
we have his identification is is if you

604
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,910
don't understand what your network is

605
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:05,940
how do you know what it's changed basics

606
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,280
comes back to preparation and management

607
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,850
I have when we've seen incidents where

608
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,520
the attackers promoted another domain

609
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,860
controller why compromise one when you

610
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,770
can make your own you know the guys go

611
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,880
there look we've got 27 too many

612
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,970
controllers I am very silly stuff 26

613
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,380
where did this one come from they had no

614
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,720
concept okay

615
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,800
and the problem is with this is you end

616
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,929
up doing a lot of forensic spinning of

617
00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:32,710
your wheels because you end up analyzing

618
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,360
systems that you thought were actually

619
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,830
compromised when they weren't would you

620
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,630
note standard bill documents you've no

621
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:40,809
standard basics have you got a complete

622
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:44,020
hash of all the files that are in a

623
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,929
standard bill for your environment how

624
00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:49,330
long does that take to make an hour how

625
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,980
much time will it save an investigation

626
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:54,279
a week that's an easy thing and updated

627
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:56,049
every time Microsoft could cite patches

628
00:23:56,049 --> 00:23:57,610
every time you change things ah sherry

629
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,740
[ __ ] that easy because if you have

630
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,080
identification of an incident you go

631
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,250
yeah that's fine

632
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,340
a false negative a PT's love that they

633
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,809
want you to be in false negative land

634
00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:10,149
they want you to miss everything that

635
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:11,649
they've done because you're either

636
00:24:11,649 --> 00:24:13,299
overworked you don't have the

637
00:24:13,299 --> 00:24:15,990
information or you make a bad decision

638
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:18,580
remember this there's another management

639
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,120
fail trusting the guy who's just arrived

640
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,909
to have the best knowledge oh yeah you

641
00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:26,980
want to see the CV he's got you want to

642
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,120
see the write-up that his previous

643
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,220
organization gave him going we've just

644
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,740
taken another skooby on Evan Lee because

645
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,020
he hasn't got a Scooby because he's

646
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,279
sitting on night shifts there and he's

647
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:38,320
just accepting what he has and therefore

648
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,640
you end it with a false negative

649
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,470
based upon somebody who have never

650
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:45,070
tested have you ever tested your new

651
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:47,950
insulin Hunter's take an old incident

652
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,870
saw some Dereham said what do you think

653
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:53,020
about okay good thing to do so you

654
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,010
actually understand the capabilities

655
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:55,299
because otherwise you won't know what

656
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:56,529
people just going yeah yeah sure you

657
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:58,960
know SMB going over HTTP that's right

658
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,770
why would that be bad oh so we have is

659
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:08,169
assessment okay not understanding where

660
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:12,880
your IT is you're gonna call you know

661
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,440
whether when the system goes down

662
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,450
how would your phone do you have the

663
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:19,090
speed Darfur Rackspace do you know who

664
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,649
to speak to have ya actually spoken to

665
00:25:20,649 --> 00:25:22,419
them in the flesh actually know some

666
00:25:22,419 --> 00:25:24,460
sort of contact over there if you if it

667
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,990
involves credit card information or PII

668
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,870
do did you tell legal do you tell legal

669
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,399
where the system is where the server is

670
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:33,120
do you actually understand what's their

671
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,500
classic ones in containment well you

672
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,000
know if you know bill document you've

673
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,460
known Network diagram how do you

674
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,470
actually know where the attacker might

675
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,809
be how you know if you don't know the

676
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:45,510
fact that you have six servers that

677
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,550
all have exactly the same kernel level

678
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,650
exploit but actually you've got another

679
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,360
4,000 of those as well we don't know

680
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,120
that that changes your whole perspective

681
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,520
of so how faster to containment how fast

682
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,640
to move through an environment other

683
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,080
things within your within your

684
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,760
organization does your instant response

685
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,260
him do they sit on the network they

686
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,560
actually sit in the domain do you

687
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,880
actually have Europe I mean this is

688
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,260
quite a common environment you have an

689
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,520
organization says yeah our domain

690
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,510
administrators have been heavily

691
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,980
targeted many of them have been

692
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,140
compromised in the last year you look at

693
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,730
the internal spawns team you go guys

694
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:20,130
your own on the domain yeah well we have

695
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:22,020
to be it's part of corporate policy like

696
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,700
so you're on the domain that's been

697
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,100
targeted by the attackers and they had

698
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,730
two main admin yeah you don't see a

699
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,980
problem with that integrity integrity of

700
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,960
your data it's an easy way for an

701
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,640
attacker to monitor exactly what you're

702
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,740
doing by simply watching what changes on

703
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,330
your system you know those of you play

704
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,890
Windows and things like this you look at

705
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,780
the default see dollar share strain on

706
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,400
the network just copy your emails copy

707
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,750
the PST file it's very easy to do then

708
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,690
we look at the cleaning up you know the

709
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:54,300
attacker comes along finds old export

710
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,000
code we actually spent about three weeks

711
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,310
doing an incident it was nice sort of it

712
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:02,550
was it was it was good fun in a sort of

713
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,950
masochistic kind of way but as we were

714
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:09,380
going through we found you know c99 PHP

715
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,910
basically chucko nice little shellcode

716
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,080
in there was like oh look at this we

717
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,350
find this maybe the attackers used this

718
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:18,120
spoke to the local admins and we find

719
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,800
this PHP shell code on here they're like

720
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,210
oh yeah that's from there from the last

721
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:26,220
time excuse me yeah last time what do

722
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,810
you mean it well yeah well we had it we

723
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:31,410
had a compromise and we found this and

724
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:32,850
we thought we'd what we thought we

725
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:33,840
should keep it but didn't know where to

726
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,670
put it so we just moved into a different

727
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:38,250
directory so you left it on the web

728
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:38,610
server

729
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,710
you left it accessible means hacker just

730
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:42,300
basically step through all of us look

731
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,410
through all the other directories did

732
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:45,000
they move it oh yes they did I'm just

733
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,560
able to pull it down you know so the

734
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,090
shellcode was there when I got there it

735
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:50,790
makes it easy for an organization but

736
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,250
also things like restoring them you know

737
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,410
when you do the recovery

738
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:56,690
seshu restoring a previously vulnerable

739
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:58,790
version or previously compromised

740
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,770
version okay if you look at them the

741
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:02,270
Mandans reports they were talking about

742
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:06,050
in 2012 that the average time between a

743
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,760
system being compromised and had been

744
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,020
detected was 416 days how far back to

745
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,440
your backups go 30 days 60 days are you

746
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,870
just restoring a previous version of the

747
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:20,900
compromised system comment this is so

748
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,060
common people say oh I've got I've got

749
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,440
malware on my laptop in the IT

750
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,940
department they bring it in will flatten

751
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,560
it will give it back to you and that's

752
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,390
what they do they flatten it and give it

753
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:32,570
back to you in an unpatched state I've

754
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:34,190
seen people going in with you know

755
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,850
up-to-date laptops and coming back with

756
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,140
laptops that are six months out of date

757
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,000
missing you know hundred windows patches

758
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,680
thinking you're making the problem worse

759
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,580
not better

760
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:47,320
okay that's a basic thing you can do

761
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,180
other things we've got is afterwards

762
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,650
after you actually have an instant do

763
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:54,380
you go back and look through some people

764
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,870
told us those lessons identified I don't

765
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,760
because if you're doing it for the third

766
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,730
time you know yeah young learned

767
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:03,290
anything you know we say so what

768
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,270
reviewing what you've done see if you

769
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,490
can improve you know as car mark says

770
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:10,610
you know once is bad ice is getting into

771
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:12,410
force you could hit by the same people

772
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,090
with the same malware and you're not

773
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:15,560
tracking and monitoring it then it's

774
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:21,230
getting ridiculous how do you defend

775
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,030
your tempo how do you defend what you've

776
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:26,060
got good to people good management and

777
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,950
not just on the team but actually the

778
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,630
network giving you the right information

779
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:31,160
so you can actually detect and

780
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,610
understand what's actually out there you

781
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:36,020
know what's on the network you know what

782
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,270
should be on the network well once

783
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:43,820
you're in there how do you talk how do

784
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:48,290
you actually plan an incident the amount

785
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,730
of times we get introduced to an

786
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:53,060
incident because the customer emails you

787
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:56,330
a really big email there's like hundreds

788
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:59,900
of you know threads long you think wow

789
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,990
that's that's your whole incident you

790
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,490
know at the top they might have put in

791
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:06,560
sort of you know client sensitive

792
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,960
that's their only mitigation because the

793
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,030
whole incidents played out in this one

794
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:13,190
email and send about 50 or 60 people on

795
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,780
distribution groups and you thinking wow

796
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,310
this is how we're actually communicating

797
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,680
we've received emails from clients

798
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,900
saying we think an attackers compromised

799
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,080
our email server I think do you think do

800
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,490
you think he knows that you know he's

801
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:25,970
there

802
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:30,020
do you think he's reading your email so

803
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,220
think about how you communicate if

804
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:35,210
you're a UK company Skype american-owned

805
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,920
Google Apps american-owned

806
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,260
do you know that you're pushing your

807
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,570
instant handling information over to the

808
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:44,270
US making it open to all US

809
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:46,610
investigation type stuff okay how do you

810
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:49,490
communicate face chart based on anything

811
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:52,790
how do you manage it how you actually

812
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,560
manage what you're doing do you do the

813
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,890
classic Windows operating system

814
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:02,270
Microsoft Office and Excel who's still

815
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:04,340
managing instance with Excel yeah you

816
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,950
know you want to get handle yet it's I

817
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,990
can understand it you know all your

818
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,130
information is there but is that

819
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,930
seriously as good as we get in this day

820
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:14,660
and age of apts when they're using you

821
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,520
know stolen code signing certificates

822
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,000
using DLL you know rhyming of other

823
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,670
malicious files into signed executables

824
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:27,410
and we're fighting them with Wireshark

825
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:31,640
and Excel but we've got the best people

826
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,380
you know there's no exact what they're

827
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:36,860
doing in their heads they obviously so

828
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,850
it's interesting when we talk about

829
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,020
people actually you know how you

830
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,250
communicate these things you know and

831
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,480
I've seen people using a variety of

832
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,520
different tools throughout their way

833
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,380
making them various boards and stuff so

834
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,790
we've we've been working in IR for a

835
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,710
long time and we decided that she that

836
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,060
was a bit of it was a bit of a pain so

837
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,070
we came up with her own idea we came up

838
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,690
with her own little we call it Lego

839
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:56,600
cyber crisis planning room it's sort of

840
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,880
taking for the American concept of you

841
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,080
know when they have out wasn't they

842
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,150
called a house breach I think or a

843
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:05,420
burglar they have this strong room in

844
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,620
the middle of a house where they can go

845
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,420
and hide there until the law enforcement

846
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:11,000
comes so you call this this cyber crisis

847
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,500
planning room where you actually go and

848
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:17,240
talk and communicate share files in a

849
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,880
safe place it's not on the domain

850
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,190
there will never be a single sign-on

851
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,920
option for it separate user name several

852
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,200
dedication okay

853
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,750
as we were uk-based and we're all I see

854
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:32,660
clear we got se cleared developers so

855
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,880
it's not coded in India not that I have

856
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,340
anything against Indian developers but I

857
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,020
like things to be coded in UK yeah

858
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,700
British company I like British people

859
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,740
let's get pretty sure the dollars okay

860
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,090
we've got to beat a version act today um

861
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:46,850
and the nice thing is because those

862
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,530
people are know me and we run a small

863
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,960
shop and I know how expensive good tools

864
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,960
can be so it will always be free if

865
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,990
you've got three users or less you two

866
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,010
can have your own instant management

867
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,990
Italy you know portal that we have I'll

868
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:02,570
show you a demo shortly and you have the

869
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:04,160
ability to install this either on a

870
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,260
cloud if you want to put your data on

871
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,300
somebody else's server you can do it

872
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:08,630
locally

873
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:11,990
Barocci planning you can put on like

874
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,930
these little mini computers you can take

875
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:18,050
around as a consultant okay that's an i7

876
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:21,950
processor in a small box 16 gigs of

877
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:24,410
memory and these things fly and it's all

878
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:25,700
quite happily managed your whole

879
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,890
incident in a method that you can

880
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,570
actually just shove in your rock sack

881
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:32,630
and go to the customer ok so that's

882
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:33,530
we're trying to do make it nice and

883
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:36,620
small and easy and like what does it do

884
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,380
well initially we come over this idea

885
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,760
about well we just want someone to put

886
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,030
some data because if you've ever done IR

887
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,010
you've done I are in a fast Network you

888
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:48,290
ask an admin for a packet capture and he

889
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,640
goes cool y'all on your packet capture

890
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,310
alright I've got this 8 gig packet

891
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:55,370
capture how do you only get it to you

892
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:59,030
like ah right where are you I'm in I'm

893
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,240
in Washington DC

894
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,310
hmm I'm in UK it's what do we use

895
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,060
Dropbox

896
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,370
we can't email it although I've seen

897
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:10,010
people try what do you do so we have

898
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,750
this port this concept of this ability

899
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,489
for everybody who's involved in

900
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:14,929
incidents to actually be able to log in

901
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:16,250
and upload files and store them

902
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,530
centrally now when legal get involved

903
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,330
they all say there but where's the data

904
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:23,389
the data is in the database we keep the

905
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:25,520
dead in the database we encrypt every

906
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,800
file that we get we hash every father we

907
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,290
get so the moment that you send it you

908
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:33,199
can also do a quick local sha-256

909
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,239
check the signature check it again

910
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,280
Schwartzman uploaded and received and

911
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,079
then say yeah what I sent has been

912
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:41,599
received you've got the best evidence

913
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,270
and you've got one copy of it and

914
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:46,280
anybody else has got access to the

915
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,629
instant can then actually download that

916
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:49,849
file and work on it and if they need to

917
00:34:49,849 --> 00:34:51,679
change it modify it they can do so and

918
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,349
they could upload their results they're

919
00:34:54,349 --> 00:34:56,059
derived evidence for the initial

920
00:34:56,059 --> 00:34:57,700
evidence I thought would be kind of cool

921
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,020
we also the ability at the moment

922
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,460
ability to you know look things up

923
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,930
against bias total if you have a

924
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:04,309
connector to the Internet we are allow

925
00:35:04,309 --> 00:35:05,950
you to extract the strings of a file

926
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:09,589
this is done automatically okay which is

927
00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:11,000
nice because you know you can run this

928
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,640
on a tablet not the whole thing to do

929
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,349
it's a web interface so you can be

930
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:17,180
standing there you know doing some

931
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,390
support to your client in Costa looking

932
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:22,849
at the strings of a log file that he's

933
00:35:22,849 --> 00:35:24,619
uploaded you're doing it on tablet

934
00:35:24,619 --> 00:35:25,700
because you've actually got the same

935
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,440
access to the same infrastructure and

936
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,240
accessing the device okay

937
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,069
does leave a nice ability to pull out

938
00:35:31,069 --> 00:35:32,390
from peek you said at the peak app

939
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:34,220
actually what's the first things people

940
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,930
do when you give them a peek up maybe

941
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:38,210
just far out Wireshark yeah what are you

942
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:41,140
gonna look for stuff what kind of stuff

943
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:45,260
mmm I know through snort well why did

944
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,609
you have it actually that the moment you

945
00:35:46,609 --> 00:35:48,230
give it to the tool it says why don't I

946
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,940
put it through snores why don't I see

947
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,440
soon as you give it to me I'll put it

948
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,000
through snort I'll pull out the IP

949
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,470
addresses I'll pull it all the DNS

950
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,150
information and I'll give it to you and

951
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,280
live interface because why should you

952
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,920
have to do that why did you have to go

953
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,339
through this this pain let me just see

954
00:36:04,339 --> 00:36:06,109
if I can run this if this is gonna work

955
00:36:06,109 --> 00:36:08,180
I have this bad reputation with demos

956
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:12,109
because they just always fail right let

957
00:36:12,109 --> 00:36:17,290
me see yeah that's looking good ready

958
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:22,250
right we also within this we separate

959
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:26,119
out incidents because we all know that

960
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:27,980
you don't want every incident handler

961
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,290
knowing everything that's happening okay

962
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:33,220
hey I have two users okay this is a

963
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,059
because of the screen resolution of

964
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:37,640
having to narrow this down normally this

965
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,619
would be if we know this will let you

966
00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:42,020
this would be a nice big display with

967
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,630
lots of other bits of information on it

968
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:46,970
okay but at the moment I'm on 1024

969
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:51,290
68 it's like so it's a sort of kind of

970
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:52,730
reduced display but this is actually the

971
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,319
kind of view you would get if you're

972
00:36:54,319 --> 00:36:56,480
running it on an iPod or Nexus tablet so

973
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,000
it's quite well okay so here I have a

974
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,910
general user who's got access to still

975
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,319
dashboard and here I have an

976
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:06,430
administrator who has an admin dashboard

977
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:09,230
we've separated out users from incidents

978
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:12,619
so I can be an admin on this system and

979
00:37:12,619 --> 00:37:14,240
I could be looking at a particular

980
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,710
incident say this one down here

981
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,569
I can say all I won't see this incident

982
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:20,930
here this test incident even though I'm

983
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:23,240
an application admin I don't have any

984
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:28,569
rights to it because you sometimes

985
00:37:28,569 --> 00:37:32,180
sometimes don't trust the admins so I

986
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,280
know the admins go bad so sometimes you

987
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,510
need to keep things away from them but

988
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,099
it's easier to do it in a standard

989
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:39,109
process so I have a couple of users

990
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:40,940
about in my in my little interface here

991
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,560
it's quite nice and easy to see I've got

992
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,970
a quick how many instance if I got a

993
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,800
couple of mediums hello

994
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,240
how much activities happened over the

995
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,740
last couple of hours and which

996
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,760
activities all happened over the last

997
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,550
couple of days isn't easy if I go into

998
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,589
any one of my incidents I'll go into

999
00:37:54,589 --> 00:37:58,579
this one here okay I've got my up a

1000
00:37:58,579 --> 00:37:59,839
little alert up there it's popped up

1001
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:01,579
recently I've got the ability to look at

1002
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,530
what's actually happened I've got the

1003
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:05,839
ability to see who's accessing you know

1004
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,030
I've got access to this Bob's got access

1005
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,589
to this as you can see over here Bob

1006
00:38:09,589 --> 00:38:13,220
won't be good access yeah Bob's got

1007
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,290
access to this system Bob I don't think

1008
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:16,460
you should really have access to this

1009
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,650
system I think I should take your access

1010
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:21,170
away when Bob goes oh but what I need to

1011
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:26,150
be able to see ah instant no access but

1012
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,829
the beautiful thing is and you might

1013
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:29,150
have seen this on some systems where you

1014
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,530
give somebody access and they go and

1015
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:31,819
pull down a load of files then you go

1016
00:38:31,819 --> 00:38:34,790
but what he access did Bob download all

1017
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,260
that stuff that we didn't want him to I

1018
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:39,349
can actually see what actually happen my

1019
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:41,599
time line so when it was started

1020
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,849
automatically generated who generated

1021
00:38:43,849 --> 00:38:45,740
the alert or who generally they are out

1022
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,329
of the various entities to the system

1023
00:38:47,329 --> 00:38:48,980
who got added to the incident

1024
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,470
time-stamped Amy put him on then we took

1025
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:53,630
him off let me put them all again then

1026
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,859
we added some more information then we

1027
00:38:54,859 --> 00:38:56,510
added some comments what did Bob say Bob

1028
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,319
said he's gonna have a look at the

1029
00:38:57,319 --> 00:38:58,310
server excellent

1030
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:59,640
what'd I say who

1031
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,070
can you owe me a packet capture Bob said

1032
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,810
yeah I have a some more service

1033
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:05,550
oh look Bob uploaded a packet capture

1034
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,890
thanks Bob okay then I out of there

1035
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:09,420
because Ed's gonna give me a little bit

1036
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,860
of a hand then we added some more

1037
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,930
information so I can see this hey

1038
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:15,230
dynamically automatically generated I

1039
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:17,430
can look at that information here's my

1040
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,960
various service that were uploaded or

1041
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,780
added into the system okay variety of

1042
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,100
different systems I've got my packet

1043
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,660
capture I think that looks kind of cool

1044
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:27,360
what if I got well just look at it in

1045
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,560
the background now it's gonna go and

1046
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,140
parse that file the first time it'll

1047
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,220
take a couple seconds because I don't

1048
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:35,360
parse everything every time everything

1049
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,440
so now I've got looking at the IP

1050
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,290
addresses I can crab me skim round like

1051
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:45,390
a look at the lurtz Oh slightly reduced

1052
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:47,280
screen size but you can see that quite

1053
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,960
clearly and how easy is that to be able

1054
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,710
to look at the number of external IP

1055
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:58,800
addresses where they've come from index

1056
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,900
some kind of easy stuff to make your job

1057
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,240
better noise so we ran in beta this is

1058
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:09,210
kind of cool let me go back to my

1059
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:09,840
incident

1060
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,850
we've also saved on the ability if we

1061
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:14,940
take maybe I upload one of us oh we've

1062
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,800
got a text document okay text documents

1063
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,410
quite nice we convert them to PDF to

1064
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:20,820
make them safe is if you're uploading

1065
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,290
shellcode we also have the ability to

1066
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:26,160
search it dynamically I can do that on

1067
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:26,820
an iPad

1068
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,900
they haven't be starting their own

1069
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,590
acosta let me just have a look accident

1070
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,880
I'm doing work for you all the time

1071
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,560
and that's nice because I don't have to

1072
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,820
start opening your things up I don't

1073
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,380
have to start moving things around it's

1074
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:37,950
kind of cool

1075
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,990
plus we got there I've got pictures and

1076
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:43,650
a few pictures yeah nice easy everything

1077
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:46,590
is sharp every single thing we also load

1078
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:48,630
up loaded okay uploading stuff is quite

1079
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:57,990
easy we just bring this across right for

1080
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,130
my desktop let me just put this up a

1081
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:01,590
little bit of not nice and easy ball I

1082
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:07,590
call it strange photo this is easier

1083
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,380
that we don't in my evidence it's my

1084
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:10,830
fault

1085
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:12,100
that's my hash

1086
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:20,320
is it impossible yes nice okay

1087
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,710
we're also looking at integrating some

1088
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,600
of the other malware databases who

1089
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,740
actually have a local malware database

1090
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,180
that lets you automatically do it I'm

1091
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,310
also moving towards fuzzy hashing so we

1092
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:31,390
actually look at comparisons between

1093
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:34,450
systems okay so that's a nice easy to

1094
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,500
use interface we've got a workshop on

1095
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:35,860
this

1096
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,080
Terk lot today so please do come along

1097
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,850
and have a look and see what you think

1098
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:42,550
of it and give us some feedback the next

1099
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:44,050
things we have I flick back into my

1100
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:47,680
presentation next stuff that we have in

1101
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,840
the next couple of months we're gonna

1102
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,280
start and take all of the information

1103
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,870
that you've uploaded into it we're gonna

1104
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:54,400
actually index it and start

1105
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,620
cross-checking it because we want to get

1106
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:58,690
away from tribal knowledge because when

1107
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:00,070
you're incident handlers leave you'd

1108
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:02,740
lost all of that information about what

1109
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:05,440
they found that you and I've seen out so

1110
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,640
many times when you go back into an

1111
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,080
organization after two years and they go

1112
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,580
we've got this attacker he's coming from

1113
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,860
this IP address and you go isn't it sad

1114
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,470
when you recognize IP addresses and

1115
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:16,420
assign you're like I know that I know

1116
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:18,910
that I almost know the air snubber for

1117
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:21,490
that okay but why should you have to do

1118
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:22,690
that when the system can do it

1119
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:24,100
automatically so in the background we're

1120
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,630
gonna take clues we're gonna look at IP

1121
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,520
addresses a SN number sort of like a DNS

1122
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,080
we're gonna look at passwords usernames

1123
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,310
and things that were used in the

1124
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:31,240
incident we're gonna pull them together

1125
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,450
and talk caller a campaign so therefore

1126
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:36,580
you can link possible incidents together

1127
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,720
to see whether or not it's the same

1128
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,460
attackers we're gonna put in workflows

1129
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:42,010
because what do you guys actually do

1130
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:45,210
when you say go do deep dive forensics

1131
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:48,400
what does he do Parker he goes see you

1132
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,250
in two weeks boss what stages does he go

1133
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,020
through how do you standardize that if

1134
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,910
you get to give it a Felmy this year I

1135
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:56,230
got eyes this could be great in she

1136
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:58,060
comes out with great stuff or the shaggy

1137
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,490
stay there go mmm

1138
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:01,660
what do you get out of it let's actually

1139
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,910
have it a find workflow that says here's

1140
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:05,800
what you should do here's the steps that

1141
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,570
you should do and actually if you've a

1142
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:10,000
workflow that the user says I have done

1143
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,860
this stage I have done this stage and

1144
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,930
the system automatically feeds it back

1145
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:16,480
to the incident manager well now you

1146
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,290
have visibility of team workload you've

1147
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:22,900
got management ability you've got the

1148
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,119
ability to go oh look Thelma's got like

1149
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,849
600 weeks of work to do and Shaggy's got

1150
00:43:27,849 --> 00:43:30,220
none you know do we need to retain

1151
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,440
retrain Shaggy do we need to move some

1152
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,880
of the work across do I need to move

1153
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,859
some of the low priority stuff across

1154
00:43:35,859 --> 00:43:37,990
CPR we have priorities of incidents

1155
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,630
nothing like 75 different layers high

1156
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:44,259
medium low because that's that's three

1157
00:43:44,259 --> 00:43:46,150
fingers I can work with execs they can

1158
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:47,710
work without give them too many levels

1159
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:50,049
and they get they get confused all the

1160
00:43:50,049 --> 00:43:52,329
things we do we were bringing in virtual

1161
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:55,509
machines support because you get a piece

1162
00:43:55,509 --> 00:43:56,529
of our what's the first thing I want to

1163
00:43:56,529 --> 00:43:56,849
do

1164
00:43:56,849 --> 00:43:59,589
steno machine doing well why should I

1165
00:43:59,589 --> 00:44:01,180
have to do that why should I go on let

1166
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,190
me just spend up a virtual machine how

1167
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:04,690
wouldn't be cool of you just when you

1168
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:07,299
see that suspect file why don't you spin

1169
00:44:07,299 --> 00:44:08,980
me a virtual machine why don't you get

1170
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,960
the machine to actually build you a

1171
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,890
virtual machine and say what kind of

1172
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:13,539
networking do you want join connect to

1173
00:44:13,539 --> 00:44:15,880
the internet no no no isolated only cool

1174
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,099
put that in a virtual machine build it

1175
00:44:18,099 --> 00:44:20,819
same with the login when it's ready and

1176
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:22,809
then when you finish with it you go

1177
00:44:22,809 --> 00:44:25,539
destroy but before it does that it says

1178
00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:27,190
do you have any good evidence that

1179
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:29,920
you've now derived from this you go yeah

1180
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,869
well put it in this folder this little

1181
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:34,239
upload folder and I'll automatically put

1182
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:35,470
it back into the incident

1183
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:37,809
you've not got traceability you've now

1184
00:44:37,809 --> 00:44:39,910
got derived evidence you're like oh this

1185
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:41,650
is kind of cool and it's not on the

1186
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:45,069
analysts laptop it's centralized it's

1187
00:44:45,069 --> 00:44:48,400
indexed it's we're now building an

1188
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,460
actual corpus body of information about

1189
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:54,220
people who attack you and it's archived

1190
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:57,160
and it's there and once it's in CPR you

1191
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,950
can't delete it you can hide it but you

1192
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:02,230
can't delete it finally we're gonna

1193
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:03,910
bring in better GUI because the GUI is a

1194
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,470
bit clunky at the moment it's it's it's

1195
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:06,819
okay because we're in beta

1196
00:45:06,819 --> 00:45:08,650
it's to show you the back edge

1197
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:10,809
functionality the fact is that this

1198
00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:12,670
system encrypts every far the fact that

1199
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:14,140
we have separate authentication we have

1200
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:15,700
authentication logs we have the full

1201
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:17,259
tracking we've built a whole environment

1202
00:45:17,259 --> 00:45:20,440
from the ground with se clear developers

1203
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,170
we're giving it to you free the new GUI

1204
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:24,489
is gonna have better alerting it's gonna

1205
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:26,289
have the ability to background tasks

1206
00:45:26,289 --> 00:45:27,460
because if you're uploading a five

1207
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,410
gigabyte pcap you don't be sitting there

1208
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:33,069
looking at a web browser going you'll be

1209
00:45:33,069 --> 00:45:33,789
doing other things

1210
00:45:33,789 --> 00:45:35,780
okay so bringing back panicky

1211
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:37,250
that's all coming in the next six to

1212
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:38,810
eight months depending on how the

1213
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:41,390
workload goes so there we go

1214
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:46,430
hammered over time I think I've covered

1215
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:49,400
most of its base the the noob stuff as a

1216
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,100
sort of headline to talk about I think

1217
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,290
you see now it's not the obvious silly

1218
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:56,090
mistakes are not actually the analyst

1219
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:58,130
problem it's actually management giving

1220
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,000
them the right tools and understanding

1221
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,180
the whole problem themselves Norris you

1222
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,530
always have to get a since who quote in

1223
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:06,590
there better Simpson stuff ghostbusters

1224
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:08,360
I think that's definitely achieving the

1225
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,730
Lord

1226
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:11,860
if you only get hold of any of us

1227
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:13,730
there's the details become to the

1228
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:19,910
workshop but coming back to this who is

1229
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:28,040
the best person to be and I'll throw

1230
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,040
this into you go back and watch any

1231
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,150
episode of hanna-barbera scooby-doo and

1232
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:38,150
tell your wife it's research but it's

1233
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:40,730
research and watch her Felmy interacts

1234
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:43,420
with people the answer is she doesn't

1235
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:45,890
because found the solves all the

1236
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:49,220
incidents but actually she's a lone

1237
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:51,740
worker she gets other people to do

1238
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:54,410
things but she comes in has Aoi moment

1239
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:56,840
and tells her like ah this is what we

1240
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,990
need to do that's cool but she shared

1241
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:02,510
nothing okay

1242
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:04,820
personally I think the best people

1243
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:08,440
Shaggy and Scooby they work as a team

1244
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,180
they work well with management they'll

1245
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:12,920
do what they need to and I'll give her

1246
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,020
their best and if you've got lots of

1247
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:16,760
shaggy's and Scooby's because they're

1248
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,670
all so fun to be with then actually you

1249
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,500
can train that you can develop that you

1250
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,690
can get yourself a good team a team full

1251
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:26,450
of Velma's actually is a team full of

1252
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:28,610
isolationist loners who hoard

1253
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:31,580
information and that means the apt guys

1254
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:34,310
will win because you have an ood a loop

1255
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,620
that doesn't actually go all the way

1256
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:39,050
around thank you very much

1257
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:40,990
you

1258
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:45,040
[Applause]
