1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,060
okay so welcome back after lunch they've

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,400
turned up the house light so apparently

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,580
this is last call um you know you you

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:08,940
can

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,500
no no not really we're not kicking you

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,210
out of the bar

7
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,269
so welcome to a talk that I was

8
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:16,949
originally told was going to be thirty

9
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:20,130
minutes long and now is suddenly one

10
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,630
hour long so we are gonna have a

11
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,570
conversation my name is Katie my Saurus

12
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,119
I am the chief policy officer for a

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,519
company called hacker one I have been at

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,740
this company since the beginning of June

15
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,500
and prior to that I spent seven years as

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,450
a security strategist at Microsoft

17
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,460
before that I spent seven years as a

18
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,250
penetration tester among some of you who

19
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,270
are part of my at stake mafia family in

20
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,270
this room so and once upon a time I was

21
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,850
a Linux developer so a lot of those

22
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,710
experiences for me translate into

23
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,670
empathy across being a bug hunter and

24
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,100
being among the hunted and creating

25
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,440
response programs for open-source

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,199
software and some of the biggest closed

27
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,140
source software in the world last year I

28
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,270
launched Microsoft's first ever bug

29
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,920
bounty programs anybody heard of those

30
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,430
all right who's the guy who got $100,000

31
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,200
is he in the room right now or is he

32
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,390
still sleeping it off I think he's

33
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,299
sleeping it off okay well James Porsche

34
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,520
who is here at 44 Khan was the very

35
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,689
first recipient of the largest single

36
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:30,900
bounty given by a major vendor which was

37
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,090
a hundred thousand US dollars and that

38
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,479
was for a mitigation bypass technique

39
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:38,220
against the latest software it was not

40
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,829
for a single bug an individual bug it

41
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:44,369
was for a technique so today I was gonna

42
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:46,460
actually talk to you guys about

43
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,229
relationship advice which if you know me

44
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,390
personally this is hilarious actually

45
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,810
yeah okay yes yeah I'm divorced that's

46
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,270
why this is funny but it's relationship

47
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,850
advice between the hunters and the

48
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,270
hunted

49
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,119
right so between the bug hunters how

50
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,020
many bug hunters in the room okay how

51
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,560
many of you feeling hunted okay

52
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,440
so in terms of where

53
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,450
I skew the conversation of how we're

54
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,920
gonna spend our time today I'm hoping

55
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,780
that a lot of you will have questions I

56
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,720
might have some audience plants you know

57
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,450
never know but I'm hoping that you guys

58
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,370
have a lot of questions because really

59
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,530
it you know I can talk about the subject

60
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,940
for hours which is probably why they

61
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,800
felt okay about just suddenly doubling

62
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,420
my talk time because they know I'll just

63
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,420
keep talking but I think that what we

64
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,310
really need to have around this is a

65
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,380
conversation about how you can make it

66
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,810
work for you as a bug hunter and how

67
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,760
organizations who are thinking about

68
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,620
doing a bug bounty might be able to

69
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,360
structure their programs so that it is

70
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,240
mutually beneficial so first and

71
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,040
foremost how many of you are at

72
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,410
organizations that host a bug bounty

73
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,890
program of some kind okay all right a

74
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,440
little bit how many of you are thinking

75
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,360
or at organizations that are thinking

76
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,730
about hosting a bug bounty okay a lot

77
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,800
more so it took my former employer about

78
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,920
three years two and three years of my

79
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,860
time to figure out how to structure a

80
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,800
bug bounty program for them there were

81
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,540
bug bounty programs certainly were in it

82
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,310
in existence for quite some time you

83
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,200
know a brief history of bug bounties

84
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,900
what it was Netscape you know back in

85
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,380
the mid 90s starting with about $500 we

86
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,450
didn't see a whole lot of new bug bounty

87
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,330
activity Under the Sun from vendors

88
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,450
themselves until about 2010 there were

89
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,040
certainly third-party vulnerability

90
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,650
brokers out there and whatnot but pretty

91
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,170
much the the way that as a pen tester

92
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,620
bug finder you would make money is

93
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,330
ideally you would actually work for a

94
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,400
consulting company and be a professional

95
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,110
pen tester certainly you could always

96
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,360
make money doing crime crime always you

97
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,700
know is an option but most of us who

98
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,650
have the skills to do that made a choice

99
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,390
at a certain point and decided that

100
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,519
actually we we just want to do this

101
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,220
legitimately and get get paid for it

102
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,410
the industry has grown and matured and

103
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,580
changed and I think the 2010 was really

104
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,738
the turning point and so that was when

105
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:18,690
other vendors like Google started

106
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,680
offering bug bounties and again it was a

107
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,110
pretty much straight up bounty program

108
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,270
these are the bugs that are in scope and

109
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,100
this is how much we're willing to pay

110
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:35,740
for them and go at it when I read the

111
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,480
ones for Microsoft the the

112
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,520
considerations that I had to take into

113
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,680
account was that there was a really

114
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,740
broad product portfolio right mixed

115
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,070
hardware software services deciding what

116
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,630
was in scope and deciding what the right

117
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,970
targets were oh in over 800 supported

118
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,630
products so you couldn't just offer a

119
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,920
bounty and be done with it so what did I

120
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,110
do I used some of the empathy that I had

121
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,050
for the business units to structure

122
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,870
something that would work for them so if

123
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,330
any of you recall there was a true bug

124
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,220
bounty program running for 30 days at

125
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,110
the beginning of the ie lab and beta

126
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,180
period and that was that was actually

127
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,620
looking for individual bugs and paying

128
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,460
for those so the reason it was

129
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,800
structured that way is because it was

130
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,050
actually looking at the pattern of bugs

131
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,630
that the company was getting anyway

132
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,330
right they would get the bugs typically

133
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,370
a big spike of bulletins class

134
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,940
vulnerabilities would come in after the

135
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,280
code was locked and released to

136
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,690
manufacturing that is kind of the worst

137
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,240
time for an organization to get a whole

138
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,430
bunch of critical vulnerabilities so

139
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,220
what was the bounty program structured

140
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,830
to do it was an incentive program to

141
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,210
drive the researchers eyes who are

142
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,680
already gonna be looking at the product

143
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,480
already gonna be turning in some bug's

144
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,930
drive them to turn them in earlier so

145
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,730
you as bug hunters when you're thinking

146
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,280
about participating in somebody's bug

147
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,770
bounty program first rule is make sure

148
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,870
that you read what it is that they're

149
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,380
looking for

150
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,870
you know we actually got a lot of

151
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,370
submissions that were outside the scope

152
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,840
and people were asking well can I get

153
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,290
money for this well it is a real bug but

154
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,360
it's not in the scope because the

155
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,520
purpose of creating an incentive program

156
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,180
is to actually incent researchers who

157
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,130
will be looking at your stuff anyway or

158
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,480
maybe not maybe looking at somebody

159
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,180
else's stuff incent them to look where

160
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,510
you want them to look so as a bug hunter

161
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,930
the way to make this work for you is to

162
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,039
one read the rules

163
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,729
right don't give the unsolicited bug to

164
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:45,639
a vendor who is not necessarily prepared

165
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,369
or willing to accept it whether they

166
00:06:48,369 --> 00:06:51,180
have a bug bounty program or not right

167
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,099
we'll see these things all actually a

168
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:57,099
lot where researchers will come in and

169
00:06:57,099 --> 00:06:59,680
they'll say but but I you know I could I

170
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,629
can do this I can Doss you know I can

171
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,479
Doss your your entire system well if you

172
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,249
read the rules DOS is actually not in

173
00:07:06,249 --> 00:07:08,740
scope and we're not paying for it and

174
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,999
then the researcher gets really upset

175
00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:12,249
because they spent time on it they spent

176
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:14,649
time trying to look for it and in the

177
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:18,580
end it's about managing expectations in

178
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,490
this bi-directional relationship that

179
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:26,039
you have right so researchers themselves

180
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:28,870
you're if you're making an investment in

181
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,990
your time and your skills and why would

182
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,839
you waste that on a vendor who either

183
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:38,259
doesn't want to receive the bug or if

184
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:40,959
you're expecting to be paid for it

185
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,969
you know there are other options right

186
00:07:42,969 --> 00:07:45,399
so you can actually look at the vendors

187
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:49,379
who have who have proper programs and

188
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:52,719
have the ability and the desire to

189
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:56,949
receive your vulnerability reports okay

190
00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:02,289
so I have a couple notes here but first

191
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:04,029
and foremost I want to ask the audience

192
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:08,830
so does anybody have any particular

193
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,509
questions that they wanted answered

194
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:13,330
during this conversation anyone have a

195
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:20,159
question so far okay hold on

196
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:27,280
I think there's a fundamental hurdle

197
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,570
that companies have to jump over if

198
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:29,680
they're going to start bug bounty

199
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,349
program if you go break into someone's

200
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:34,719
car and then you go to them and say hey

201
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,250
look I can break into your car give me

202
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,229
money they're not gonna do that

203
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:40,719
breaking into software you break into an

204
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,700
azure web service that's probably

205
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,299
illegal

206
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:46,899
at least unlawful in the same way so how

207
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:49,320
do you persuade companies that

208
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,120
encouraging and paying for illegal

209
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,529
behavior is something that they want to

210
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:57,010
be doing okay so there's a couple

211
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,980
questions in there online services is a

212
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:04,300
great example of legal gray area so back

213
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,300
in 2007 Microsoft was actually the first

214
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,410
major vendor to put just one line up on

215
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,260
an FAQ around online services and said

216
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,570
if you privately disclose

217
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,850
vulnerabilities to us and give us a

218
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,200
chance to fix it we will not pursue

219
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,510
legal action against you that was hugely

220
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,160
significant other companies followed

221
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,880
suit so first things first a company has

222
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,140
to actually be willing to define what

223
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,570
those rules are for what what they

224
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,820
consider to be acceptable behavior so if

225
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,770
you look at you know if you go to a

226
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,480
hacker one.com slash programs there's a

227
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,550
list of all the programs that my company

228
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,260
supports and when you go to their

229
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,120
individual pages you kind of you read

230
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,279
their rules of engagement right and

231
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:50,260
before you're hunting bugs for anybody

232
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,930
you should probably read what read what

233
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,520
it looks like acceptable behavior to

234
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,510
them so the online services bit a

235
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,220
company has to decide what is important

236
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,160
to them usually the common threads that

237
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,690
I've seen in companies as they say no

238
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,270
DOS don't don't deliberately try to

239
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,310
degrade the service though that is live

240
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:12,459
and running and to do your best to not

241
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:15,790
have a privacy violation so if you think

242
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,520
about it they may feel free to incent

243
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,529
the research community to look for bugs

244
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:22,690
and their online services but they've

245
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:26,020
made a commitment to their users to try

246
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,910
and protect their privacy so they can't

247
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:31,000
on the one hand say you know go ahead

248
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,250
and break privacy of our users and we'll

249
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,150
pay you for it

250
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,139
so I

251
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:37,779
a case like that came up last year how

252
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:40,389
many of you remember the Facebook case

253
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,939
where somebody posted to Zuckerberg page

254
00:10:42,939 --> 00:10:44,859
right you guys remember this and they

255
00:10:44,859 --> 00:10:47,439
didn't pay him because he violated the

256
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:50,410
rules and a lot of people got mad about

257
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,239
that and there was a crowd-sourced

258
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:55,689
funding for paying this guy because

259
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:58,959
Facebook wouldn't but if you think it

260
00:10:58,959 --> 00:10:59,649
through

261
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:03,009
how could Facebook pay him you know

262
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:04,419
there are there are discretionary

263
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:05,619
elements when you're running a bug

264
00:11:05,619 --> 00:11:07,989
bounty program where you can you can at

265
00:11:07,989 --> 00:11:09,879
your discretion decide to pay a little

266
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:11,980
more or pay outside of the scope that

267
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,579
was one that the vendor really couldn't

268
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:18,069
break their own rules about that and

269
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:20,259
still continue on you know with their

270
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:21,999
program because essentially that would

271
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:23,859
be saying yeah it's okay to

272
00:11:23,859 --> 00:11:25,989
intentionally violate the privacy of our

273
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:28,269
users so the guy did get paid I think he

274
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:29,889
got crowdsource the bounty of about 12

275
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,449
grand so it worked out actually much

276
00:11:31,449 --> 00:11:33,189
better for him you know in that one

277
00:11:33,189 --> 00:11:36,489
particular case but I think your

278
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:38,379
original question was how do you

279
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:41,709
convince a company to allow that kind of

280
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:44,110
testing well I think one of the things

281
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,410
is there has been you know a lot more

282
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:50,579
organizations who recognize that this is

283
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:53,439
being open to security researchers

284
00:11:53,439 --> 00:11:56,589
telling you about vulnerabilities is not

285
00:11:56,589 --> 00:11:58,899
only a good thing it actually might save

286
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:00,790
you and your customers a whole lot of

287
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,559
headache so I think there's been a

288
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:03,699
tipping point

289
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:05,949
you know achieved in the last couple of

290
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:07,239
years where more and more organizations

291
00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:09,399
are being convinced of this how would

292
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:11,309
you as a researcher convince them

293
00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:17,319
probably not directly so let me take a

294
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:20,709
step back so two things that I had done

295
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:22,569
in my career that taught me a lot about

296
00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:26,619
how vendors are prepared to receive

297
00:12:26,619 --> 00:12:28,600
vulnerability reports was starting two

298
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,799
different vulnerability research

299
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:30,970
programs I started Microsoft

300
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,589
vulnerability research and I started

301
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:34,209
Symantec vulnerability research and

302
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:37,389
those two programs were designed for our

303
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,429
own employees who found vulnerabilities

304
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:41,709
and third-party products to be able to

305
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:44,019
report them safely you know to the

306
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:46,839
organization in question you wouldn't

307
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:48,380
believe how many times

308
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,530
even wearing the Cape of a giant

309
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:53,870
mega-corporation if we came to a vendor

310
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,880
who was sort of uninitiated in the Dark

311
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,780
Arts how many times they accused us of

312
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,720
trying to sell them something trying to

313
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,760
extort them even we weren't asking for

314
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,830
any money this was this was just giant

315
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:10,420
mega corporations vulnerability you know

316
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:15,699
finding program just reporting above

317
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,080
what that taught me was that even if you

318
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,780
are well represented and well shielded

319
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,120
by your parent organization in reporting

320
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,800
a vulnerability to a third party if that

321
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,250
third party is uninitiated in the art of

322
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,990
vulnerability response and being

323
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,870
gracious and accepting these gifts from

324
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:38,420
you they you're gonna have a bad time

325
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:42,200
and so are they so the answer to that

326
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,150
question is as an individual I would not

327
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:47,000
waste your time trying to convince an

328
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,740
organization that has not figured this

329
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,620
out yet you can there are a number of

330
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,750
options there are educational options

331
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,450
you can point them to there are ISO

332
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:59,750
standards that I sacrificed years of my

333
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,600
life and helping to make there are that

334
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,040
have been published this year so there's

335
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,680
an ISO standard on vulnerability

336
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,790
disclosure that was published in

337
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:11,540
February of this year ISO 29 one four

338
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,990
seven and there is another one on

339
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,520
internal vulnerability handling

340
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,950
processes and that's ISO 3-0 one one one

341
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:21,710
also published this year you can point a

342
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,150
vendor who doesn't know what they're

343
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,010
doing in terms of Volm response to those

344
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,070
two ISO standards a lot of vendors will

345
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,110
will just say okay you know what if

346
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,310
there's a standard on it I should

347
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,560
probably read it and this probably means

348
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,610
this is something I should pay attention

349
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,740
to you we didn't have these tools as

350
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,170
researchers before this year to educate

351
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,960
some of those vendors so I hope that did

352
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,130
that answer all of your questions are

353
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:46,670
only one of them all right okay see this

354
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,030
is good more questions yes thank you I

355
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:53,180
know that you had significant well I

356
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,700
guess it took a while at Microsoft to

357
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,070
develop the bug bounty program primarily

358
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,690
because you had to make a business case

359
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,370
for it I'm just wondering now that

360
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,209
you've switched over

361
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:05,269
- hacker one how difficult is it to show

362
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:07,220
a business case to third-party companies

363
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,779
that are kind of sitting on the fence

364
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:10,850
and aren't quite sure whether or not

365
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:14,839
it's right for them okay that is a great

366
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:19,879
question so you know in if we take it

367
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:22,699
back to the relationship metaphor it's

368
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:25,279
much better when the parties are both

369
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,679
willing and consenting right let's let's

370
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:35,869
just put it that way trying to trying to

371
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:39,170
unlock the vendors desire to receive

372
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,230
vulnerability reports it can be a subtle

373
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:46,160
seduction you know and you do you have

374
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,869
to be you you have to be convincing but

375
00:15:47,869 --> 00:15:49,279
you have to actually be prepared to

376
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,639
listen so coming from the hacker

377
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,259
background coming from the researcher

378
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:56,119
background of course you're you're

379
00:15:56,119 --> 00:15:58,699
basically thinking security purist right

380
00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:00,379
you're thinking this is a security

381
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:02,569
vulnerability you should fix it maybe

382
00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:04,879
you should pay me but or maybe you know

383
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:06,949
my company if your pentest company maybe

384
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:09,339
my company we'll get work based on it

385
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:12,019
this was certainly you know before there

386
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:14,480
were large bug bounty programs this was

387
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,089
certainly how security researchers would

388
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:19,369
build their reputations right get

389
00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:21,649
credited in ten point Arial font and a

390
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:23,299
Microsoft bulletin that was actually

391
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:25,759
worth a dip that was a different kind of

392
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,360
currency right that currency has been

393
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,259
depreciated don't fall asleep in the

394
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:34,699
back row stop it I see you you're not

395
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:38,619
the only ones with jet lag anyway but uh

396
00:16:38,619 --> 00:16:41,449
being willing to listen to what the

397
00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:45,079
business actually needs is really

398
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:47,360
important if you are inside of an

399
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,879
organization that is on the fence and

400
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:52,089
thinking about doing a bounty program

401
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:54,139
understand what is it that the business

402
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:55,970
wants so I gave an example earlier

403
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:58,730
talking about the IE bounty they were

404
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,949
going to get those bugs anyway they were

405
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:01,939
just gonna get them in a very

406
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:06,109
inconvenient time so tipping the fence

407
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,569
in or tipping the the scale on whether

408
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,459
or not to offer a bounty in that case

409
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:14,089
was well you're not going to get you're

410
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:15,829
not going to be flooded out

411
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,990
with more bugs than than you anticipated

412
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,569
getting you'll still get those bugs but

413
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:23,269
timing is the thing that is of value to

414
00:17:23,269 --> 00:17:26,419
you in the business so getting them

415
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:27,919
earlier was one thing you have a chance

416
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,929
to fix them earlier but getting them

417
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:32,000
earlier also served a purpose in that it

418
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,140
allowed you to redirect internal testing

419
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,480
efforts during that beta period right

420
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,760
because that is that is the period that

421
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,710
the company that the business had

422
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:46,519
dedicated to fixing bugs what better

423
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:49,789
time what better time to align with the

424
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:51,889
business needs then a time that they had

425
00:17:51,889 --> 00:17:58,100
already earmarked fixing bugs ok so so

426
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,049
yeah the long-winded answer to your

427
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:03,740
question is pretty much be prepared to

428
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,230
listen to what the business needs if you

429
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,440
think of it in terms of security purism

430
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,149
you are going to be talking past the

431
00:18:11,149 --> 00:18:15,200
business owners one thing to keep in

432
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,450
mind and I think I've tweeted this

433
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:20,090
before it's pretty short it's you know

434
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:23,330
hackers gonna hack but vendors can event

435
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,570
right they need to make money so if you

436
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:29,870
think about it in terms of am I am I

437
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,210
aligning with what the actual business

438
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,490
is supposed to be doing which is

439
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:38,830
building software to make money or am I

440
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,809
you know am I reporting a vulnerability

441
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:43,850
in an older piece of software that's

442
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,860
almost gonna go out of out of support

443
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,880
why in your head why would the business

444
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,419
care about that kind of vulnerability

445
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:55,880
versus one in a product that is new that

446
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,669
they are trying to to get customers to

447
00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:00,320
deploy right so when you're thinking

448
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,389
through what your targets are for

449
00:19:02,389 --> 00:19:05,029
security research try and see it from

450
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:06,500
the vendor's perspective what are they

451
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,409
going to be the most interested in now

452
00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:10,460
switching gears is probably a good time

453
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,289
to switch gears to talk about some of

454
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:14,659
the factors that vendor would need to

455
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:16,789
think about in terms of structuring a

456
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:20,419
bug bounty program so I mentioned one

457
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:23,149
example which was going for bugs in beta

458
00:19:23,149 --> 00:19:26,059
at the beginning of the beta period why

459
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:28,520
would that be useful will one to kind of

460
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,510
shift that

461
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,370
bike it's traffic shaping essentially

462
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,260
shift that spike to a time that's very

463
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,760
convenient for the vendor but the other

464
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,970
reason is that ideally you have you have

465
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:41,480
tried your best to code more secure

466
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,420
software each time so the latest version

467
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,040
of your software in theory should have

468
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,220
all of the toasty caramel goodness of

469
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,620
your security development lifecycle at

470
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,130
its best right ideally you will have

471
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,710
shaken out as many bugs as you can and

472
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,510
not even deliver them in the in the

473
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:04,480
product even in beta so why would why

474
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,250
essentially what a vendor would might be

475
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,620
trying to do is try to learn about new

476
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,890
vulnerability vulnerability types or

477
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,740
classes or instances that they're STL

478
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,010
missed so it's not just about the bug

479
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:20,450
it's about what in their security

480
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,970
development lifecycle can be improved

481
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,670
upon and ideally it's happening in real

482
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:28,400
time when I used to work at my former

483
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,550
employer one of the ways to introduce a

484
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,080
new security development lifecycle

485
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,360
requirement was you know you described

486
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,920
what the requirement the new requirement

487
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,480
was you described what type a

488
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,630
vulnerability it was designed to prevent

489
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,150
and then you would actually have to cite

490
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,960
real cases that came in from the outside

491
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,400
that would never have happened if you

492
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,240
had that control in place so ideally you

493
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,440
know when you're structuring a bounty

494
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,390
program you were thinking through some

495
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:00,170
of these things like you know do I do I

496
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,180
have enough confidence in my security

497
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:05,000
development lifecycle that I think where

498
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,770
I can learn the most from the security

499
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,600
community is in the latest versions of

500
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,990
the software but you might try something

501
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:12,590
different

502
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,930
you might try something like you know

503
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,040
what the latest version of the software

504
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,560
we think is pretty good will offer you

505
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,210
know a bounty there but actually we also

506
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,280
want to offer a bounty for the most

507
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,070
deployed version of our software so if

508
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,590
you think about it you know you might be

509
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,660
thinking well you know what my customers

510
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,880
actually don't upgrade that often or

511
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,950
they're stuck on this one version that's

512
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,290
three versions back because of business

513
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,030
other business dependencies that means

514
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,400
that's where my customers most of my

515
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,950
customers are exposed so maybe

516
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,900
even though I've I've learned better and

517
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,180
the newest version is the most secure

518
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,890
maybe I want to bounty that version as

519
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,320
well so these are all different ways

520
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,540
that a vendor might structure their

521
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,910
bounty programs that make sense for them

522
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,280
and translate into making sense for

523
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,580
their customers I want more questions

524
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:10,010
you've got more questions oh okay so

525
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,840
you've you've talked about sort of the

526
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,170
the way that bug bounties can inform an

527
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,720
SDLC but what do you feel like the

528
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,760
long-run potential is for bug bounties

529
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,470
are like the role of bug bounties in the

530
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:26,990
future is question okay so something I

531
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:29,060
used to say a lot is you can't pen test

532
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,480
your way to secure software the internal

533
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,310
code name that I had for the bounty

534
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:37,100
programs that my former employer was ad

535
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,950
hoc pen testing because that's what a

536
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,780
bug bounty is you're basically instead

537
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,390
of hiring a pen test firm at a certain

538
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:48,130
point you are opening it up and saying

539
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:51,440
anybody anybody who finds a bug anybody

540
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,450
over here so where do I think bug

541
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:56,780
bounties fit in you know the balance

542
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,880
breakfast of software security I think

543
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,020
it belongs as part of a vulnerability

544
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:06,590
response plan because you know even with

545
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,770
the best security development life cycle

546
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:11,330
humans write code codes gonna have bugs

547
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:13,540
you're gonna miss something and

548
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,310
essentially having just the ability to

549
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,930
receive vulnerability reports and

550
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,940
process them that's actually a pretty

551
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,000
good win having a bounty program on top

552
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,150
of that that's a way for you to direct

553
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,430
what you would like the researchers to

554
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,470
look at another really important data

555
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:34,070
point from past experience we used to

556
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,810
receive former ways sorry it's an old

557
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:38,330
habit hard to break seven years anyway

558
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:43,700
um used to receive bugs for all

559
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:47,660
different versions of the browser what

560
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,920
do you think happened during that month

561
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,310
that Microsoft was offering money for

562
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,650
one version

563
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,140
pretty much all of the other version

564
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,230
reports dropped to zero what did that

565
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:02,110
mean that meant that essentially the

566
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:05,050
incentive was working the researchers

567
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:08,200
were like wait why okay finally

568
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,000
Microsoft is offering money for bugs

569
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,040
okay we'll go look for the bugs they're

570
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,559
actually offering money for worked great

571
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,820
so in terms of where does it fit part of

572
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:21,670
a response program that's at the end of

573
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:24,460
a ideally a proper software security

574
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,550
development lifecycle a way to feed back

575
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:32,080
into the lifecycle and as another you

576
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,720
know another form an evolution of

577
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,020
penetration testing now somebody else

578
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,830
had a question over it so relatively

579
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,780
simple question but you must have seen a

580
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,950
wide variety of quality in the reports

581
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:51,270
of bugs from people submitting bugs and

582
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,200
obviously the amount of money you offer

583
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,000
makes a difference to that but is there

584
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,559
anything else that you think makes a

585
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,940
difference to quality of the bug

586
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:03,610
reporting from random people so you you

587
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:06,970
make an interesting point about how much

588
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:09,940
money you offer and essentially quality

589
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:13,390
of report what you expect to get out of

590
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:16,270
the research community we we went

591
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,760
through a lot of iterations on how to

592
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,460
describe what it was former we was

593
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,990
looking for because essentially you're

594
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:29,640
paying a certain premium to outsource

595
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,900
validation so you if you have a full POC

596
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,809
that is pretty much going to be a

597
00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:40,630
validated bug so the language that is

598
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,400
used and the price that you set for

599
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,960
something like that is gonna be higher

600
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,179
than for example saying oh I'll just

601
00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:48,429
take your fuzzer crashes whatever I'll

602
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:50,230
do all the investigative work myself

603
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,510
we had debated all this it's like

604
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,760
somebody could you know potentially

605
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,420
flood out the program by just sending a

606
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,179
whole bunch of crashes over so it was

607
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:04,960
carefully worded saying that not only it

608
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,539
was first bug first one first

609
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:09,970
person to report the bug likely to get

610
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:12,879
the bounty but we actually gave it a

611
00:26:12,879 --> 00:26:15,009
little wiggle room and said quality of

612
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:18,850
report will affect the time that we take

613
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:21,909
to analyze it so if somebody came in

614
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:23,559
with the exact same bug but somebody

615
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:26,190
just threw over a crash hump

616
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,749
versus someone who threw over some POC

617
00:26:28,749 --> 00:26:30,369
we're gonna look at the one with PFC

618
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:32,979
first and Wow

619
00:26:32,979 --> 00:26:35,529
that even if it's timestamp differently

620
00:26:35,529 --> 00:26:37,239
the one with the POC it was already

621
00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:40,479
validated for us so when you're thinking

622
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:43,659
about what it's worth to you as a bug

623
00:26:43,659 --> 00:26:47,229
hunter think about what is it that I

624
00:26:47,229 --> 00:26:49,419
might be trying to exploit how hard is

625
00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:50,440
it to do the POC

626
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,389
is it worth my time to do that much

627
00:26:52,389 --> 00:26:54,039
extra effort to get that much extra cash

628
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:56,259
you can do the cost-benefit analysis as

629
00:26:56,259 --> 00:26:59,200
a bug hunter yourself when you are the

630
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,599
hunted you can do the cost-benefit

631
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:05,019
analysis of how many people do I have to

632
00:27:05,019 --> 00:27:06,970
receive and analyze these vulnerability

633
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,950
reports how much do I want to structure

634
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:12,909
you know tiered payouts for additional

635
00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:14,769
work it's different with web stuff web

636
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:17,950
stuff you know POC is pretty much the

637
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:20,979
bug reporting itself is the POC but when

638
00:27:20,979 --> 00:27:22,509
you talk about them you know more of the

639
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:24,309
memory corruption issues that becomes

640
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,409
very important okay there was another

641
00:27:26,409 --> 00:27:28,570
wait there was another one here before

642
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:35,789
you okay somewhat related to your

643
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:39,789
question so how do you classify the

644
00:27:39,789 --> 00:27:42,700
payment for type of bugs and the

645
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,679
severity of it so you may have networks

646
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:48,190
web stuff so you know is this your ISO

647
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:50,169
standard to cover that guy there's a

648
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,929
guideline so the ISO standards do not

649
00:27:52,929 --> 00:27:55,570
cover paying for bugs right they also

650
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:58,239
actually do not cover not suing the crap

651
00:27:58,239 --> 00:28:00,879
out of researchers mostly because

652
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:03,070
international standards have to be

653
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:05,700
compatible with international laws and

654
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,070
keep it trying to keep track of what all

655
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,809
the international laws are around

656
00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:12,940
hacking and finding bugs and stuff would

657
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,950
have been complicated what the standards

658
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:18,820
do say are things like a good idea to

659
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,418
express gratitude

660
00:28:22,429 --> 00:28:29,030
so yes be nice and great and grateful

661
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:32,100
but pricing pricing is a tricky thing

662
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,370
right when I was mentioning the 2010

663
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,740
advent of more vendors offering bug

664
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,860
bounties what did we see we saw January

665
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:44,730
a doubling of the going rate for for

666
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,500
bugs you know because I had been 500

667
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,990
dollars from from Netscape and then

668
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,559
Mozilla for a very very long time and

669
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:55,220
suddenly it was a little over a thousand

670
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:59,280
1337 dollars by Google right so there

671
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,320
was a price jump and then there was

672
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,940
another price jump in June of that year

673
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:07,040
when it went up to 3,000 wait 3 1 3 3

674
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:11,429
point 7 dollars right so there was

675
00:29:11,429 --> 00:29:14,790
another price jump I think when it comes

676
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,250
to setting the prices for for

677
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,960
vulnerabilities that you're looking for

678
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,400
think about it in terms of am I am I

679
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,740
basically doing the best I can

680
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,049
secure coding wise and I'm looking at

681
00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:29,640
certain vulnerabilities real

682
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,320
vulnerability classes like cross-site

683
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,110
scripting or whatever as yes I want to

684
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:36,480
fix them when the public finds them yes

685
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,280
I want to pay out something but it's

686
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,890
it's fairly easy to find those bugs

687
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,870
relatively easy to find those bugs the

688
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:46,710
skills required are are you know more

689
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,900
broadly known by a larger set of people

690
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,570
so you begin to get into a little bit of

691
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:53,820
the of the basic economics supply and

692
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,410
demand there are many people who are

693
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:57,030
capable of finding cross-site scripting

694
00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:00,179
bugs so we'll see how the market plays

695
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:02,760
out but just things to keep in mind are

696
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,010
you know the easier something is to find

697
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:07,080
the less expensive it's really going to

698
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,240
to be on any market whether we're

699
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:15,630
talking white market or others looking

700
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,760
at the spectrum of researchers right

701
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,490
let's say there's 10% that are gonna be

702
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,960
black market black market is gonna sell

703
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,340
black like that's just what's gonna

704
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,960
happen you've got 10% on the other end

705
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,570
that white market they're going to give

706
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,760
their bugs away because they're goody

707
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,900
two-shoes and that's what they're going

708
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,540
to do right so you've got this 80% in

709
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:33,920
the middle

710
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,870
that lean one way or the other but

711
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:38,390
they're capable of doing both do you

712
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:42,320
think if numbers could be published for

713
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,850
the black market to actually show how

714
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:47,630
much money you would get for that that

715
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,280
because like right now there's this

716
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,930
mythical assumption like every bug is a

717
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,490
million dollar bug right we we know

718
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:54,230
that's not true but if you could publish

719
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,430
those do you think it would get more

720
00:30:55,430 --> 00:31:00,620
people going to the white so my

721
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,660
interpretation of your question is if we

722
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:06,260
published that those very very large

723
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,240
numbers that we hear reported in the

724
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,620
media for you know basically selling

725
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:15,110
vulnerabilities to the highest bidder if

726
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:17,720
it's really not that seven-figure wet

727
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,660
dream that we've all heard about we'll

728
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,570
more of the on the fence researchers

729
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,310
just decide it's not worth their time in

730
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,890
trouble is that the interpretation I

731
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:32,660
think okay don't raise your hands

732
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,210
or you can if you want how many of you

733
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:37,790
used to pirate music nobody's raising

734
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:41,890
their hands no okay what happened when

735
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:46,870
iTunes came about music piracy went down

736
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:49,190
because there was a very easy and

737
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,920
convenient way for people to legally

738
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,380
purchase music basically for people to

739
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,750
do the right thing who just wanted to do

740
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,690
the right thing what I think in terms of

741
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,670
more and more of these incentive

742
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,380
programs becoming mainstream more and

743
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,670
more of these bounty programs becoming

744
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,620
mainstream is it's essentially the I

745
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:10,100
tunas ation of vulnerability hunting it

746
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:14,000
is making it not be this black and white

747
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,130
choice for the researcher of saying I

748
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:19,160
can either make money or I can do the

749
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,510
right thing it's I can do the right

750
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,890
thing and make a little money it's not

751
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:25,790
gonna be as much but I think most people

752
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:28,970
I think it's more it's gonna be more a

753
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,470
factor of more and more of these

754
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:33,080
programs becoming the norm and it just

755
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,000
being the easy thing to do to do the

756
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,820
right thing and it's not complicated as

757
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,650
opposed to learning about these kind of

758
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,150
pie-in-the-sky numbers and wondering

759
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:46,450
well how can I get my hands on that yep

760
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,940
okay so coming back to what you just

761
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,920
said don't you think that by

762
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,830
democratizing the price for the buck the

763
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:56,050
people reports for the bugs eventually

764
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:56,890
is gonna go down

765
00:32:56,890 --> 00:33:01,240
well more reports coming in what do you

766
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,880
mean by democratizing critizing meaning

767
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,650
that for example the more bug bounties

768
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,860
they are right probably the price for

769
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:12,990
bugs may actually come down you know

770
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:17,730
supplying a minute it might be however

771
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:24,070
it it's still it's still not going to be

772
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,020
the most cost-effective way for an

773
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,870
organization to address or to find as

774
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:31,570
many vulnerabilities as possible what it

775
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:36,130
really should be is organizations should

776
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:39,190
be striving to make their bugs instances

777
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:42,430
of their bugs rarer and rarer so ideally

778
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:45,040
if this is working the way that it

779
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,810
should towards towards more secure

780
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:50,020
software the vendors who are offering it

781
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:54,010
are not doing it as a lazy skip a few

782
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:55,720
internal testing steps and just

783
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,780
outsource it ideally and that would that

784
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,570
would be huge numbers of bugs easy to

785
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:05,440
find prices go down right instead

786
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,790
ideally they should be getting better

787
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,889
and better and those bugs should be

788
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:11,199
rarer and rarer and it might keep the

789
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,110
prices relatively steady we could go on

790
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:16,389
and on about the economics here but we

791
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:17,440
are running out of time one more

792
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,670
question from you and then I gotta take

793
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:26,920
some other questions so I'm interested

794
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,230
in how you sold this to Microsoft

795
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,730
obviously you've had experience in this

796
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:32,260
before and you've got a phenomenal

797
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:35,980
business case but you're talking to a

798
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:38,139
bunch of suits who are interested in

799
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:40,090
business and are probably not technical

800
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:43,239
what they were okay so what challenges

801
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,560
did you have back from them and how did

802
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:51,040
you solve them so three years of my life

803
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:57,700
um three years of my life I think

804
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,750
I think the biggest thing that I had to

805
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:07,839
do to make that work was take about five

806
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,020
steps back from my original idea of how

807
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,920
I would convince them so I thought I

808
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,510
thought that it was a data-driven

809
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:19,780
decision that I just show some data and

810
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,730
I just do this you know some charts and

811
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:24,970
some graphs and they will see the data

812
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:27,640
and they will say yes the mathematics

813
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,500
make sense on this yes who shall do this

814
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:34,000
but in fact getting folks who had always

815
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,540
said no and publicly said no to suddenly

816
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:43,540
say yes well it was a matter of taking a

817
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:46,299
step back and helping those business

818
00:35:46,299 --> 00:35:49,540
owners understand why this would be

819
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,880
advantageous to them and their goals

820
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,500
which meant I had to listen to what

821
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,630
their goals were I would never have even

822
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:59,049
looked at when the bugs were typically

823
00:35:59,049 --> 00:36:01,569
coming in for that product because when

824
00:36:01,569 --> 00:36:03,250
I originally started it was okay we

825
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,270
should buy the bugs and here's how we

826
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,530
can structure their programs and here's

827
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,240
what kind of things here are some of the

828
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:11,049
you know attack basically some of the

829
00:36:11,049 --> 00:36:13,150
threat modeling of a bug bounty program

830
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:15,160
that I'm going to do and everything we

831
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,180
we don't want to get flooded with

832
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,130
crashes so we'll set criteria here and

833
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:21,099
tended at all of that stuff I was I was

834
00:36:21,099 --> 00:36:24,010
being very literal whereas I had to

835
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,200
actually take so many steps back to

836
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,460
understand what's in it for them they

837
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,170
had been getting bugs for free for so

838
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:35,470
long so one of the factors was actually

839
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,030
looking at the reporting trends of

840
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:40,540
direct reporting to the vendor versus

841
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,609
going through a white market broker like

842
00:36:42,609 --> 00:36:47,680
ZD IRI defense and the first years data

843
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,599
that I showed I was a strategist so it

844
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:50,950
was my job to tell the you know

845
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,839
basically be Cassandra doomed to know

846
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:55,020
the future no one believes her right

847
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:58,859
scratching my own eyes out but uh the

848
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:01,569
the the data that I showed showed that

849
00:37:01,569 --> 00:37:03,280
over ninety percent of vulnerabilities

850
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,010
were being reported directly to

851
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:08,799
Microsoft for free but I was postulating

852
00:37:08,799 --> 00:37:10,510
that actually this trend is going to

853
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:11,350
change

854
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:14,340
and more and more of the vulnerable

855
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,180
don't want to have to make a choice

856
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,040
between doing the right thing and

857
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,460
getting paid so I predicted this and

858
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,920
they say we'll come back to us when it's

859
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:29,740
happening we don't believe you so that's

860
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:32,200
why it took two more years I needed two

861
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,980
more years of data long answer to that

862
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,420
question but hopefully that answered

863
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,010
your question in that particular case

864
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:42,700
above above all don't take it for

865
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,890
granted that everybody is on that same

866
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:47,020
mental journey that you are in terms of

867
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,310
your logic and your graphs and your

868
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:50,620
charts and your numbers they need

869
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,110
something that translates to what they

870
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:55,510
actually want I had done an

871
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:58,930
improvisational speaking class and they

872
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:02,140
had us running around the room tracking

873
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,760
each other and you're not supposed to

874
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,080
tell the person that you're tracking

875
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,310
that you're tracking them and you have

876
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:08,770
to keep this other person between you or

877
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,180
you keep yourself between this other

878
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,010
person what that was actually trying to

879
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,600
teach us is that everybody has their own

880
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,090
goals as we're milling around like

881
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:17,680
molecules bouncing off of each other in

882
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,230
a boiling pot right that's exactly what

883
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,220
you're doing when you're trying to

884
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:26,710
negotiate some of these strategy shifts

885
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:34,540
in an organization okay I have no idea

886
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:43,060
how much time I have okay I really

887
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:46,450
understand the bring your own bag hunter

888
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:50,380
business model however in the future if

889
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:53,230
it is if it does work it's great but how

890
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,970
will be smaller vendors being able to

891
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:57,070
compete with Google or Microsoft in this

892
00:38:57,070 --> 00:39:00,070
case with the money they're offering to

893
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:02,890
hunt bad on their products I mean it

894
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:04,720
will be difficult for them to catch up I

895
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,400
mean to offer like around ten hundred

896
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,300
thousand dollars for a month for them to

897
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,010
look for bugs it will be very difficult

898
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:17,590
I think so I think if I'm to distill

899
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:21,400
your question it's you're asking how two

900
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,620
smaller vendors compete for researcher

901
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,670
eyes if they can't afford

902
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:28,980
the bigger bounties so right okay

903
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,069
again I think bug bounties are you know

904
00:39:33,069 --> 00:39:34,900
they're an evolutionary form of

905
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,780
penetration testing so I think an

906
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,400
organization that has a smaller budget

907
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,319
to spend on activities like penetration

908
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:43,869
testing needs to look at where their

909
00:39:43,869 --> 00:39:45,369
security investments make the most sense

910
00:39:45,369 --> 00:39:49,089
if an organization is having trouble

911
00:39:49,089 --> 00:39:52,119
coming up with bug bounty money they

912
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:54,069
probably should actually take whatever

913
00:39:54,069 --> 00:39:55,660
money they were about to put into a

914
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,900
bounty program and invest in better

915
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,970
tools training threat modeling for their

916
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:02,859
developers because that's gonna actually

917
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:04,150
pay off for them more so if they're

918
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:07,630
actually if money is an object invest in

919
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,490
a proactive security part first

920
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,750
that doesn't exactly answer your

921
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:15,599
question but it is my honest advice I

922
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:20,140
would say that you know the researchers

923
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,579
have a choice about what they're gonna

924
00:40:21,579 --> 00:40:24,910
look at sometimes it's not about the

925
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:26,770
money per se sometimes it's about the

926
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:29,280
attractiveness of the target the

927
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,349
recognition that you can get the

928
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:36,670
exposure yes right right you know so the

929
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:41,140
recognition is it is a currency it is a

930
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:46,240
form of currency another question I know

931
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:46,990
you're out there

932
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:52,780
I planted a few of you come on wait can

933
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:56,109
you imagine a future where bug bounties

934
00:40:56,109 --> 00:40:59,470
might be on a national scale looking at

935
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:01,359
components for infrastructure for

936
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,980
example rather than at a corporate scale

937
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:09,160
as in imagine a country some random

938
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,230
country elbonia

939
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:15,089
offering a bug bounty for you know

940
00:41:15,089 --> 00:41:17,619
components used in its transport system

941
00:41:17,619 --> 00:41:21,549
or something like that okay so what

942
00:41:21,549 --> 00:41:24,390
you're really asking about is

943
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:30,549
some sort of central bug buying for an

944
00:41:30,549 --> 00:41:34,779
industry as opposed to vendors

945
00:41:34,779 --> 00:41:38,819
themselves offering their own huh

946
00:41:38,819 --> 00:41:45,160
or an infrastructure right remember how

947
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,809
I said an organization needs to be

948
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:48,130
perpetrate prepared to receive

949
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,749
vulnerability reports before this is

950
00:41:49,749 --> 00:41:52,420
gonna work it's not gonna work you know

951
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,589
what you can buy all the bugs you want

952
00:41:53,589 --> 00:41:55,900
if they have no way if they don't have

953
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:00,219
the resources to invest in investigation

954
00:42:00,219 --> 00:42:02,609
triage remediation decisions you know

955
00:42:02,609 --> 00:42:05,680
actually creating a fix and if they have

956
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,369
no means to distribute that fix critical

957
00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:14,049
infrastructure you can buy all the bugs

958
00:42:14,049 --> 00:42:16,900
you want it's not gonna help right so do

959
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,910
I do I envision this world in which that

960
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:21,460
that makes sense I envision a world in

961
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,739
which people will try it I don't think

962
00:42:23,739 --> 00:42:28,329
it's gonna work out to sort of lead on

963
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:30,279
from that and this diverts like very

964
00:42:30,279 --> 00:42:32,289
kind of far off off the beaten path but

965
00:42:32,289 --> 00:42:34,569
do you think that in the future there

966
00:42:34,569 --> 00:42:36,099
will be legal frameworks that will

967
00:42:36,099 --> 00:42:38,019
require that sort of thing or that

968
00:42:38,019 --> 00:42:39,700
that's like something that we could try

969
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,619
and realize for sort of the betterment

970
00:42:41,619 --> 00:42:48,880
of critical infrastructure so a legal

971
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,509
framework

972
00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:02,680
okay so so an ISO standard type of thing

973
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,259
with requirements or like you said a pci

974
00:43:05,259 --> 00:43:07,299
type of thing with fines if you don't do

975
00:43:07,299 --> 00:43:12,249
it do I envision a future in which this

976
00:43:12,249 --> 00:43:21,369
this may occur again I think we've seen

977
00:43:21,369 --> 00:43:24,940
where PCI has not really done what it

978
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:27,609
promised to do right is it better than

979
00:43:27,609 --> 00:43:30,670
nothing probably perfect is the enemy of

980
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:32,680
the good is what an old boss of mine

981
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,849
used to say Dave shout outs to Dave

982
00:43:35,849 --> 00:43:40,420
perfect is the enemy of the good do I

983
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,219
think that imperfect you know sort of

984
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:45,969
regulatory thing is is how how this is

985
00:43:45,969 --> 00:43:47,529
going to shake out I think

986
00:43:47,529 --> 00:43:49,900
the ISO standards themselves the way

987
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,459
that ISO standards actually have teeth

988
00:43:51,459 --> 00:43:55,569
just FYI is usually they're they're

989
00:43:55,569 --> 00:43:57,640
voluntary for an organization to say yes

990
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,140
I comply with this ISO standard

991
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:02,829
voluntary to the extent that if they're

992
00:44:02,829 --> 00:44:05,499
a global business that needs to do

993
00:44:05,499 --> 00:44:08,440
business with let's say governments or

994
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,499
other very large buyers with very large

995
00:44:11,499 --> 00:44:13,509
purchasing power they will have a set of

996
00:44:13,509 --> 00:44:17,739
requirements so I can see the existing

997
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:19,690
ISO standards being leveraged in that

998
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,880
way where they become part of the

999
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,940
necessary purchasing requirements of

1000
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:28,329
very very large buyers with that I don't

1001
00:44:28,329 --> 00:44:31,449
actually see a need to necessarily make

1002
00:44:31,449 --> 00:44:33,339
additional ones or make it you know

1003
00:44:33,339 --> 00:44:34,989
legally required or whatnot

1004
00:44:34,989 --> 00:44:37,869
or impose fines it's the fine will be if

1005
00:44:37,869 --> 00:44:39,789
you don't comply with the standard well

1006
00:44:39,789 --> 00:44:42,670
then we're not going to buy from you so

1007
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:45,219
I would love to see you know kind of

1008
00:44:45,219 --> 00:44:47,319
commercial pressure come up to at least

1009
00:44:47,319 --> 00:44:49,599
say organizations need to have a means

1010
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,670
to accept vulnerability reports from the

1011
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:52,989
outside even if they don't offer a

1012
00:44:52,989 --> 00:44:54,609
bounty just accept vulnerability reports

1013
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:57,549
from an external party whether it's a

1014
00:44:57,549 --> 00:45:00,670
individual hacker a vendor who you know

1015
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:03,339
has some hackers on staff and actually

1016
00:45:03,339 --> 00:45:07,150
need to bookmark talking about companies

1017
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:08,829
that employ people who are capable of

1018
00:45:08,829 --> 00:45:10,180
finding vulnerability

1019
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:13,210
and those people taking part in other

1020
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,190
people's bug bounty programs remind me

1021
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:17,040
to talk about that in a second

1022
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,770
but I think you know at the very least

1023
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:22,420
what we have now in terms of those ISO

1024
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,970
standards as tools to drive this this

1025
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:27,700
behavior I think driving the awareness

1026
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,290
to organizations who have very large

1027
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:31,270
purchasing power like governments and

1028
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,640
what not if you have government friends

1029
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,220
talk to them about asking their vendors

1030
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:39,490
do you have do you comply with ISO 20 29

1031
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:43,660
147 do you comply with ISO 3 0 1 1 1 do

1032
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,130
you even know what those are you know

1033
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:47,430
that kind of thing that will help

1034
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:49,560
another question before I talk about

1035
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:56,190
internal policies on bug hunters I

1036
00:45:57,150 --> 00:46:00,280
suspect that some thoughts that crossed

1037
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,440
the minds of senior management is

1038
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,280
something like yeah we know we're not

1039
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:09,700
perfect with security and we are

1040
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,160
concerned that maybe if we offer a bug

1041
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,740
bounty program some of the hackers will

1042
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:17,800
come to find something and probably they

1043
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,650
will decide to exploit it and win some

1044
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:25,770
money illegally then compared to

1045
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:32,410
disclosing yeah so anybody who is going

1046
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:36,130
to go after your stuff to exploit it

1047
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:38,920
they're doing it already they're already

1048
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,340
doing it so even without a bug bounty

1049
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:45,250
program any organization who just says

1050
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:48,850
look anybody who finds something we do

1051
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:51,610
want to hear about it that's that's a

1052
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:52,720
good thing

1053
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,240
so yeah if you offer a bounty program

1054
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,890
it's not gonna change the behavior of

1055
00:46:56,890 --> 00:47:00,430
criminals the to Josh's point earlier

1056
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:01,780
there are there are people who are

1057
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:04,750
always going to you know kind of go the

1058
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:06,250
mercenary route try to sell to the

1059
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:09,460
highest bidder etc not gonna not gonna

1060
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:15,280
win those guys over guys and gas ok any

1061
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,510
time for maybe one more question or

1062
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:20,950
should I should I talk to you a little

1063
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:23,859
bit about internal policy for the

1064
00:47:23,859 --> 00:47:26,230
hackers that work for you that'd be

1065
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:28,630
helpful all right okay

1066
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:35,349
so 2010 bounty programs were growing in

1067
00:47:35,349 --> 00:47:39,309
the world as I said had a lot of people

1068
00:47:39,309 --> 00:47:41,349
inside the company that were capable

1069
00:47:41,349 --> 00:47:43,749
finding vulnerabilities in third-party

1070
00:47:43,749 --> 00:47:46,749
products should we or shouldn't we let

1071
00:47:46,749 --> 00:47:49,450
them participate in other people's body

1072
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:52,029
programs essentially should we let them

1073
00:47:52,029 --> 00:47:58,480
sell bugs hmm interesting question so I

1074
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,529
drafted something that was became you

1075
00:48:02,529 --> 00:48:05,589
know an actual corporate policy not my

1076
00:48:05,589 --> 00:48:10,269
former employer that said if you find a

1077
00:48:10,269 --> 00:48:11,799
vulnerability in a third party product

1078
00:48:11,799 --> 00:48:14,259
and you feel like disclosing it

1079
00:48:14,259 --> 00:48:16,599
we have Emma sphere which was Microsoft

1080
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:18,910
vulnerability research come check by us

1081
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:20,769
so we can make sure that first party

1082
00:48:20,769 --> 00:48:22,720
products you know are not also affected

1083
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,960
it would be kind of bad form if you owed

1084
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,539
aid us because out of somebody else's

1085
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:31,660
advisory and some other product right so

1086
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:33,039
we do that quick check

1087
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:35,470
we'd coordinate if it was a multi vendor

1088
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:37,420
issue if it was actually affected us and

1089
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,819
others you know etc we'd coordinate it

1090
00:48:39,819 --> 00:48:41,470
for you so you as the researcher could

1091
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:42,910
just get back to your job do whatever

1092
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:43,509
you want

1093
00:48:43,509 --> 00:48:46,029
coordination pain part would just be up

1094
00:48:46,029 --> 00:48:49,450
to us but then there was a clause in

1095
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:50,410
there that said if you find the

1096
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:51,880
vulnerability on your own time using

1097
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,650
your own equipment using no proprietary

1098
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:59,499
tools technology or knowledge then you

1099
00:48:59,499 --> 00:49:02,109
may participate in a certain set of

1100
00:49:02,109 --> 00:49:07,239
approved bounty programs and they did

1101
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:08,650
have to check with us right because

1102
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:10,119
there's a certain set of approved ones

1103
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:12,940
basically we weren't saying go ahead and

1104
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:17,259
sell to the highest no right but what we

1105
00:49:17,259 --> 00:49:20,499
were saying was yes it is possible for

1106
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:22,329
you to participate in pone to own and

1107
00:49:22,329 --> 00:49:25,779
keep the money it is possible for you to

1108
00:49:25,779 --> 00:49:28,180
report a vulnerability in a third party

1109
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:30,180
product if you followed these rules and

1110
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:33,880
get money from zdi there's possible for

1111
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,309
you to collect the bounty from Google

1112
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:37,100
right

1113
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:39,560
why did we do this why did they let me

1114
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,990
do this I asked my question that

1115
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:43,490
question of myself all the time I just

1116
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:48,620
kept going because if you think about it

1117
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:51,560
how many of you are parents how many of

1118
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,900
you plan to be parents how many of you

1119
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:56,390
have been born right yes all of you yes

1120
00:49:56,390 --> 00:50:00,050
so what you know how did it work if your

1121
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:02,870
parents said you're not allowed to do X

1122
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:06,230
under any circumstances ever with me it

1123
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:07,910
was you're not allowed to date that

1124
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:12,170
explains a lot of things they'll sneak

1125
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:15,650
out behind your back right so what did

1126
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:18,080
this what did this this set of

1127
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,540
acceptable behaviors that was codified

1128
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:23,600
in corporate policy do it allowed

1129
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:27,530
something that was surprising right but

1130
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:29,000
it actually surprised a lot of the

1131
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,620
researchers a lot of them just donated

1132
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:32,150
their their bounteous to charity because

1133
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:33,680
they qualified for a bounty with Google

1134
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,240
or something like that no donate it to

1135
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,620
charity because I know I can't keep it

1136
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,480
actually you totally could have kept

1137
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,320
that oh really

1138
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:43,160
yeah so but it allowed visibility into

1139
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,190
what we knew was already possible and

1140
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:47,990
already potentially happening the other

1141
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:49,880
thing it allowed was us to retain top

1142
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,670
talent if they wanted to look at bugs

1143
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:54,530
and make a little cash on the side or

1144
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:56,690
get recognized and whatnot that's all

1145
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:59,180
fine just let us know so that one you

1146
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:02,210
don't cause our customers pain by

1147
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:04,940
accidentally OD'ing our customers if

1148
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:07,940
it's a multi vendor issue you know and

1149
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:11,510
the fact of the matter was MS VR started

1150
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:13,160
publishing advisories for certain

1151
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,440
serious issues that employees of the

1152
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,230
company had found gotten over to the

1153
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:21,740
vendors and fixed so this was all just

1154
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:24,170
part of essentially service to our own

1155
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:25,850
customers if you think about it in terms

1156
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:29,050
of the broader ecosystem of the platform

1157
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:32,750
very happy everybody's happy okay so we

1158
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:34,070
have time for one more question or is it

1159
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:35,860
done

1160
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:38,960
five five minutes that's time for one

1161
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,150
more question all right who wants to be

1162
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:43,630
the last question

1163
00:51:55,330 --> 00:51:59,090
so I'd like to ask what do you think of

1164
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:02,060
Google project zero and if you think

1165
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:08,120
other companies would follow Google

1166
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:11,150
project zero so that is where they are

1167
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:14,330
looking for vulnerabilities in a lot of

1168
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:20,180
third-party software right -

1169
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:21,860
vulnerability research programs that

1170
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:23,660
I've founded in my career Symantec

1171
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:25,400
vulnerability research Microsoft owner

1172
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,280
ability research these were designed to

1173
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,470
find allow the employees of the company

1174
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:32,660
I worked for to find vulnerabilities in

1175
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:35,240
third-party products to make the

1176
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,420
internet a safer place so what do I

1177
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:41,360
think about project zero I think it's

1178
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:48,860
awesome I'm I'm happy that I'm happy

1179
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:51,920
that smart people are working on trying

1180
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:57,890
to drain the swamp swampy out there okay

1181
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:01,520
so I'm gonna actually be round are there

1182
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,230
any other one last question maybe a

1183
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:06,650
short one quick one I do talk a lot

1184
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:08,510
you see they knew I could talk for an

1185
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:10,160
entire hour about this I could keep

1186
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:14,210
taught okay one more so after hacker one

1187
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:18,520
takes over the world what's next for you

1188
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:21,640
[Music]

1189
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,480
kids

1190
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,840
no I don't you know I'm really I tend to

1191
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,420
stay at companies for a very long time

1192
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:31,460
so I can't I can't even imagine what's

1193
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:36,080
after this but anyway if you want to

1194
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,800
come find me after this I will be around

1195
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,900
not leaving this country for another few

1196
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:45,050
days so and hopefully eventually the jet

1197
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:48,650
lag will wear off but if you have other

1198
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:50,330
questions definitely don't hesitate to

1199
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:53,750
come ask and thank you very much for

1200
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:54,830
your time and attention in your

1201
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:56,720
questions Thanks

1202
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,779
you
