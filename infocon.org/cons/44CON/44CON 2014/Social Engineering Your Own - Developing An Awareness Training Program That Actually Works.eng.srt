1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,929
we are gonna get started now for those

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:06,930
of you don't know me this is actually my

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,900
first time in the UK so it may a lot of

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,759
you probably don't know me my name is

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,190
Valerie I work for a company called

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,310
secure con we're based out of Washington

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,160
DC so we do a lot of cool stuff at

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,500
secure con so we do a lot of pentesting

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,519
services Network web app mobile whatnots

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,230
we're also very heavily involved in the

11
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,480
SCADA environment so we do a lot of

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,790
critical infrastructure work and a lot

13
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,309
of federal stuff as well which means

14
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:36,690
that I just get to play with all

15
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,120
different kinds of toys so it's very

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,420
awesome I just got promoted to principal

17
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,030
consultant last week so if you get my

18
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,129
business card and it says senior I'm not

19
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:47,850
lying

20
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,309
it just happened Friday so I didn't have

21
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:52,949
time to get everything set up I've been

22
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:55,020
doing this for a while right around ten

23
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,879
years having a great time don't plan on

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,760
stopping anytime soon

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,160
we just released a book bill Guarnere

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,438
myself on creating an information

27
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:07,890
awareness program that is available on

28
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,229
Amazon and the UK somebody tweeted me a

29
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:11,610
picture the other day that they finally

30
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,250
got their pre-order so I think that's

31
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,700
all good to go so in addition to doing a

32
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,009
lot of pen testing and playing with the

33
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:22,500
skater devices social engineering is

34
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,479
kind of my thing if you've seen any of

35
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,030
my videos online or some of my articles

36
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,700
and my blogs and whatever you'll see

37
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,939
that I I like to do a lot of that so not

38
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,829
only do I include that in my assessments

39
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,079
I teach people how to be social

40
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,509
engineers who want to learn and then I

41
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:41,250
do the flip side of that as well I teach

42
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,610
defense against social engineering so

43
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,560
the second isn't nearly as fun as the

44
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,520
first all right let's get some

45
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,470
expectations out there really quick this

46
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,290
is what this talk is not I'm not here to

47
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,969
sell you on the idea that awareness

48
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:59,040
training is the best thing ever and it

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,590
will fix everything if you find a

50
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,570
solution that fixes everything in

51
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,729
security please let me know because I

52
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:09,568
haven't found one yet so when bill and I

53
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:11,520
started to put the book together we

54
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,660
really started

55
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,940
to look at an audience of folks that

56
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,770
worked in corporate security or federal

57
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,470
security that were a little technical

58
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,980
maybe not overly technical and they were

59
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,450
in charge of putting together the

60
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,730
awareness program well if you've never

61
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,230
done it before that's a pretty large

62
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,810
undertaking so that was the basis in the

63
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,510
foundation of how we decided to put the

64
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,320
book together

65
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,480
so this talk kind of goes along with the

66
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,200
book same kind of basis and foundation

67
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,910
there is a little spin since you know I

68
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,830
have a security audience it's a little

69
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,740
bit easier to to intro everything since

70
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,640
I don't have to explain all these terms

71
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,270
so what's an awareness program anyway

72
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,880
training is not an awareness program so

73
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,530
I don't know about you guys but because

74
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,060
I'm a consultant I go in and out of a

75
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,910
lot of organizations I see a lot of

76
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,210
training training training usually

77
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,120
consists of some really badly written

78
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,540
CBT in a little pop-up window that

79
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,870
requires ie like seven so I always have

80
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,760
to roll back an old VM to get this thing

81
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,320
to work and then it's text that's it 50

82
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,630
slides of text do you think anybody's

83
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,030
reading that I know I'm not reading that

84
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,300
I'll tell you it's it's okay nobody's

85
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,220
reading 50 slides of text because it's

86
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,110
not interesting and it's not relevant

87
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,930
and if it hasn't been updated since ie 7

88
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,090
I'm pretty sure it's not up-to-date with

89
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,100
the latest technology and the latest

90
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,130
threats so what does that mean

91
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,360
that means that we're doing a lot of

92
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,080
stuff wrong when we put together an

93
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,690
awareness program it's not just about a

94
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,390
CBT it's about incorporating different

95
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:57,150
kinds of delivery methods and making

96
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,800
those work for your target audience so

97
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,620
it's just one part of our little pyramid

98
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,570
here so we have hacker pyramid at DEFCON

99
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,550
right so we decided to put together a

100
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,610
little security pyramid it's just part

101
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,830
of the foundation training will not

102
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,380
alone will not save you technology alone

103
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,660
will not save you you have to combine

104
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,820
them together to get the best return on

105
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,839
investment so back to like really bad

106
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,889
training we've all seen it everywhere

107
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:28,830
so how do we fix it one of the biggest

108
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,120
holes that I see in training is normally

109
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,650
there's no social engineering training

110
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,479
in there and because that's my niche

111
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,360
area I'm always looking for it if I find

112
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,789
it it's usually like a sentence like

113
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:43,289
buried at the bottom

114
00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:45,180
something about beware of social

115
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,669
engineers well do anybody outside the

116
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:50,159
security industry that's not gonna make

117
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:54,229
any sense we don't know what that means

118
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:57,330
so I started explaining it to folks that

119
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,789
aren't necessarily security involved

120
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:03,870
about this is how this works so you have

121
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,879
awesome technology you patch everything

122
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:08,430
every month everybody's got the latest

123
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,740
and greatest you've got a next-gen of

124
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,870
firewall because that's the new sexy

125
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,460
right it's just being recorded gotta be

126
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,060
careful anyway we've got all this great

127
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,849
technology but we're still vulnerable to

128
00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:25,830
social engineering attacks because we're

129
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,020
not properly arming our people with the

130
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:33,000
knowledge that they need so like why

131
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,319
does social engineering work in the

132
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:35,819
first place I mean we have this awesome

133
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:38,430
technology it shouldn't it shouldn't

134
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,759
affect us at all as an organization well

135
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,310
it works because it works on people not

136
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,009
on technology social engineering isn't

137
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:49,199
just a people problem or a technology

138
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,449
problem it's the combination of both

139
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:54,389
together most people just want to be

140
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:56,580
helpful especially in organizations

141
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,289
where they haven't had a lot of

142
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:01,139
awareness and a lot of training they

143
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,180
don't know that social engineering is if

144
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,460
I try to tailgate behind somebody into a

145
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,379
building they'll let me they'll hold the

146
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:09,810
door you know some of your other

147
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,279
organizations who are a little bit more

148
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:14,219
mature that person will turn around hey

149
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:15,930
can I see your badge or you need to

150
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,750
swipe there so it's it's very prevalent

151
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,990
especially in in mid-sized companies

152
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:26,460
once you get around the 75 to 200 person

153
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,650
mark it's too big for everybody to know

154
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,409
each other and then once you go 200 plus

155
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:33,750
it's obvious that nobody knows each

156
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,339
other so it's a little bit more

157
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:37,080
difficult for your folks to keep track

158
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,000
of who should be where

159
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,650
and a lot of folks they provide free

160
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,200
information so when we do some social

161
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,320
engineering attacks as part of a pen

162
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,130
test a lot of times we'll target a help

163
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,140
desk because they're they're good

164
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,670
targets right let's face it

165
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,770
because they're there to help they're

166
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,010
very helpful so usually when that

167
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,810
happens one of us will call up it's

168
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,400
usually me because I can do the best

169
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,710
dizzy voice the other guys they're still

170
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,130
working on it but it's just not there

171
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,450
and I'll call and somebody from the help

172
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,580
desk will answer I usually do this like

173
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,680
right at the end of shift so right at

174
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,930
the end of the third shift right around

175
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,940
like 6:45 a.m. we're on to the third

176
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,770
shift guy just wants to get out of there

177
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,810
he doesn't care what he has to do to get

178
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,320
you off the phone and I told them this

179
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,590
is Mary from accounting or wherever I

180
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,540
just got back from vacation I can't get

181
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,490
logged into my computer it says that my

182
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,620
unit isn't even passwords incorrect but

183
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,600
I mean I know the passwords right

184
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,160
because I use the same one for

185
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,860
everything in the ditzy voice this works

186
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,700
very very well so then I say okay well

187
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,580
I'm tryin to log in as M smith at bla

188
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,280
bla bla and then they'll correct me

189
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,560
because their job is to help right and

190
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,560
they'll say oh no it's Mary dot Smith so

191
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,940
don't make some banging noises on the

192
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,460
keyboard and oh you know what that works

193
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,340
thanks so much see you guys already know

194
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,440
when you're brute-forcing accounts you

195
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,360
knew two pieces of information the

196
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,250
username and the password

197
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,460
so now I've got the username schema I

198
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,830
can take that data and I can start to

199
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,830
look on social media LinkedIn loved

200
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,110
LinkedIn LinkedIn is the phone book for

201
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:24,530
social engineers like this job it was so

202
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,410
hard before LinkedIn but not now it's

203
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,030
just a phone book of everybody who works

204
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,830
in that company first-name lastname

205
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:36,469
that's all I need so how do we stop all

206
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:39,740
this I put together a little piece

207
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,140
called the social engineering defensive

208
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:47,540
framework preview about it besides dfw a

209
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,630
while back we're not gonna go over all

210
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,350
of that today

211
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,360
as you can see educating the workforce

212
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,640
are you making your awareness program

213
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,870
it's a bullet in there but there's a

214
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,899
whole lot more to it you know first

215
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:05,310
you've got to understand how the attacks

216
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,550
work and understand your exposures if

217
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,070
you've never had we call this an

218
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:14,700
exposure assessment where we basically

219
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,649
go out and just gather information the

220
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:18,810
way that a social engineer would if I

221
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,399
was going to target this company if I

222
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,190
wanted to hack them social engineering

223
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,230
is involved how would I do it

224
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,360
and we basically crawl through their

225
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,130
website we look for pieces of

226
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,810
information that that's out there that

227
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,390
probably shouldn't be we look to see how

228
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,250
many email addresses they have exposed

229
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,440
we look to see how many people they

230
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,060
actually feature by name on their

231
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,839
website

232
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,820
those folks should go in a higher risk

233
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,700
category their name spaces and contact

234
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,050
information is out there for the world

235
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,300
to see so it's very easy for just

236
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,130
anybody to get a lot of information on

237
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,110
them because that's their job their job

238
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,649
is to face the public and then we move

239
00:09:55,649 --> 00:09:57,480
on from the website and look at things

240
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,450
like pastebin and things like jigsaw and

241
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,550
really get a good idea of how much data

242
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,490
is out there do they have documents all

243
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,370
over the place they have usernames and

244
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,959
passwords that we can extract from

245
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:14,160
metadata so doing that really gives them

246
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,529
a nice overview of hey here's all the

247
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:18,480
information that's out there on you that

248
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,510
shouldn't be without actually attacking

249
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,880
them so if you've got a newer client or

250
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,380
if your company hasn't really done a

251
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,240
whole lot with social engineering or pen

252
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,730
testing and they're a little bit nervous

253
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,130
that's a really great place to start

254
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,050
because it doesn't they assume no risk

255
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,520
at that point everything that we're

256
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,050
gonna find is already on the internet

257
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:42,630
evaluating defenses so that's what it

258
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,490
sounds like right so we take all that

259
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,730
information and then we decide to map

260
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,470
out the attacks that make the most sense

261
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,380
and that's one of the things in social

262
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,730
engineering that I think a lot of folks

263
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,670
get a little confused so if I have a

264
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,290
client that comes to me and they say Val

265
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,510
we really want a social engineering

266
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,550
assessment we want you to do these three

267
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,000
tests

268
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,260
and that's great that they think that

269
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,810
they know what they want but the best

270
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,640
way to do social engineering attacks is

271
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,490
to gather the data first and then you

272
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,620
determine your attack based on the data

273
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,400
that you get

274
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,130
so phishing may not be the best attack

275
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:21,830
for them that may not be where their

276
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,050
money should be spent maybe their

277
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,490
physical perimeter looks really really

278
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:31,370
immature there's a nice word you know

279
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,740
maybe that's a better attack vector what

280
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:37,160
about phone calls so it's better to

281
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,350
gather the data first and then determine

282
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,450
the path that you want to take unless

283
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,180
they're they've got their heart set on

284
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,980
these three scenarios are try very hard

285
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,490
to steer them in a different way and

286
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,350
like I said that does include cyber and

287
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,839
physical so we have a great security

288
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,830
divide still in most corporations you've

289
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,480
got cyber security and you've got

290
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,420
physical security well guess what they

291
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,500
protect the same assets the same stuff

292
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,140
except they don't talk to each other

293
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,580
cyber security is usually very highly

294
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,440
respected and physical security is

295
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,260
usually not so much you tell somebody

296
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,760
that you have an entry-level physical

297
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,880
security job they look at you and go

298
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,130
that's nice you'll get a better job one

299
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,830
day though you tell somebody the

300
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,110
entry-level cybersecurity and I think

301
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,520
you're the smartest person in the world

302
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,310
but yeah you protect the same data the

303
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:34,880
same people the same assets so you need

304
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,800
to work on kind of closing that divide

305
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,760
educating the workforce we're going to

306
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,870
talk about that today

307
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,670
so we're not going to go into that right

308
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:47,540
now existing technologies streamlining

309
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,850
existing technologies we're not buying

310
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,040
anything in this process all right we're

311
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,330
going to take the technology that

312
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,459
already exists in the environment and

313
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:58,279
really evaluate it and see how we can

314
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:00,470
use this to minimize the impact of an

315
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,500
attack okay somebody clicked the link in

316
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,100
the phishing email now what how far can

317
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,110
they get well tools that we have in

318
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,120
place that can tell us that something is

319
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,150
wrong what do we have on the endpoint

320
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,370
is there something there that can tell

321
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,740
us besides antivirus so there's some

322
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,720
heuristics that happen at the endpoint

323
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,970
if you're using something like a McAfee

324
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,880
like an EPO kind of thing there's a lot

325
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,610
of stuff you can do with that needs if

326
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,980
you have it maybe we should tune that up

327
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,770
a little bit and so on so the point of

328
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,630
that step is not not to go out and buy

329
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:38,930
the the latest greatest red box with the

330
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:42,529
blinky light because that's the growing

331
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:44,300
trend right we have the the latest

332
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:48,080
greatest red box so we must be secure so

333
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,820
it really takes a look at what you have

334
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:54,350
and how to use that better and then a

335
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,450
response plan this sounds a little silly

336
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,970
for folks like us that work in security

337
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,130
we just assume that everybody has an

338
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,420
incident response plan

339
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,990
a lot of places don't and this includes

340
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,960
cyber and physical what happens if

341
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,210
somebody gets into the building and

342
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:14,390
plugs into the network well we know back

343
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,880
to the technology if they do how do we

344
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,390
address it incident response plan so

345
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,670
we've got a bunch of disconnects and the

346
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,290
social engineering defensive framework

347
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:28,160
just works to provide a roadmap for

348
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,540
organizations to really get a better

349
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,360
handle on how they can minimize the

350
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,310
impact of social engineering attacks and

351
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,400
prevent them in the future so I do blog

352
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,430
on information security buzz if you want

353
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:44,829
to read more about it feel free to visit

354
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:49,220
but what if we the security people are

355
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,470
part of the problem and I know that they

356
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,390
disarmed somebody over there with a dart

357
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:57,410
gun so if you see me lose this eye it's

358
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,640
because I've said something to offend

359
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,490
the guy with the dart gun but security

360
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,860
people right we work really hard we're

361
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,390
working so hard we're updating our

362
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,370
firewalls or patching we're doing this

363
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,050
we're doing that but we still have

364
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:11,060
instance and it's because of the stupid

365
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,160
users it's obviously the stupid users

366
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:18,980
fault well maybe maybe it isn't maybe

367
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,360
it's time to take another look at how we

368
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,160
do things so I know that I'm only a

369
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,850
quarter of the way in but this

370
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,169
this is where we're gonna get to the

371
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:31,319
secret sauce of how if you're gonna make

372
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:33,299
an awareness program these are the keys

373
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,889
that you really need to look at if you

374
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:37,139
take nothing else away from this talk I

375
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:38,759
want you to remember the points on this

376
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:42,959
slide don't try to make your users

377
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,249
security experts that's your job you are

378
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:48,779
not gonna be able to make Marian

379
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:51,299
accounting a cybersecurity expert she's

380
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:53,369
not supposed to be she's supposed to

381
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,799
work in accounting just like you're not

382
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,419
going to be an accounting expert just

383
00:15:57,419 --> 00:15:59,429
because you cash your paycheck each pay

384
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:04,019
period same thing applies we don't want

385
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:05,910
to make everybody cybersecurity experts

386
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,399
when you try to do that you overwhelm

387
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,199
people with so much information and so

388
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:12,449
much data it puts so much pressure on

389
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:13,709
them that they don't know what to do

390
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:16,259
with it so they either lock up because

391
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:18,289
they get nervous or they just ignore it

392
00:16:18,289 --> 00:16:21,209
so we want to give people a nice

393
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:23,189
foundation to understand some of the

394
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:25,739
basics of the do's and don'ts but we

395
00:16:25,739 --> 00:16:27,299
really just want to give them the

396
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:31,829
opportunity to say hmm this doesn't look

397
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:35,879
great oh I know we're supposed to send

398
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:37,979
suspicious emails to this address or

399
00:16:37,979 --> 00:16:39,509
we're supposed to call the security desk

400
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:42,539
if we have a question that's what you

401
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:43,859
need to do in your security awareness

402
00:16:43,859 --> 00:16:44,549
program

403
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:46,919
you're not making little cyber security

404
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:49,289
experts you're making little human

405
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:52,079
detection sensors this doesn't look

406
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,539
right I got a phone call it didn't it

407
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:56,339
didn't sound right this email I think

408
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:59,759
something's wrong so we're the culture

409
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,389
change comes in there is you as the

410
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,789
security department you've got to handle

411
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:08,279
that properly and that's gonna take some

412
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:09,898
time this is definitely not an overnight

413
00:17:09,898 --> 00:17:13,859
process so a great example my husband

414
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:16,378
works security as well for a privately

415
00:17:16,378 --> 00:17:19,019
held firm they're pretty large her about

416
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:21,869
4,000 people all over the states in the

417
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:25,230
world and one of the secretaries there

418
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,628
she knew that he was security and she

419
00:17:27,628 --> 00:17:28,950
called him one day and a really big

420
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,259
panic she's oh my god I think

421
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,759
something's wrong with my computer can

422
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:35,490
you please come down here so he you know

423
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,679
rolls his eyes right because that's what

424
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,090
security people do when they get this

425
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:39,760
kind of call

426
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,490
and he trudges down the steps and she's

427
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,080
sitting there biting her nails looking

428
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,130
at a Google search page he's like well

429
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:51,160
it still works okay I don't I don't see

430
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,840
anything wrong what's the problem

431
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,429
she Scrolls to the bottom and she says I

432
00:17:56,429 --> 00:17:59,260
did a Google search and then all these

433
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,570
extra OHS showed up at the bottom and

434
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:05,470
Google on this page what does that mean

435
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:08,620
did somebody hacked my computer and

436
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,140
those security folks you know we deal

437
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,940
with technology so much every day we

438
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,200
don't think about little things like

439
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,590
that so right there was a very opportune

440
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:21,190
moment so he could have rolled his eyes

441
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:24,250
and said wow that's really dumb I can't

442
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,690
believe you called me down here to do

443
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:28,210
that - look at this this is this isn't a

444
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,530
security problem this is how it's

445
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:33,160
supposed to work but instead he took the

446
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,470
30 seconds that it takes to explain to

447
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,720
her this is how Google works and this is

448
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,669
when it adds a no that means that it's

449
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:41,470
another page that you can click on for

450
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,780
search results yeah but if you're gonna

451
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,890
look for things that look a little

452
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,720
strange you should look up here in the

453
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,580
address bar you should look down here in

454
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,940
the the icon tray you know 30 seconds of

455
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:55,240
his time now because he took the time to

456
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,010
explain it to her like she wasn't an

457
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,559
idiot she'll call the next time she has

458
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:02,020
a problem maybe the next time she's

459
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,970
suspicious it might be something really

460
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:07,140
bad had a have not handled it that way

461
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,640
had a have just rolled his eyes and told

462
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,049
her how stupid she was and then just

463
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,880
walked away do you think she's gonna

464
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,450
call again ever if she's suspicious that

465
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,320
there's something wrong with her

466
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,500
computer but she doesn't know what no so

467
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,600
we as the security industry need to do

468
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,299
our due diligence and starting to create

469
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:27,580
a corporate culture that has really

470
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,140
opened a more communication with our

471
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,970
folks that use these machines every day

472
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,130
because unless you're communicating

473
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,559
you're not going to know what what's

474
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:40,419
going on I have a small pet peeve that

475
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:42,340
goes along and with this it's a piece of

476
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,860
it's a technology piece and it sounds

477
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,770
silly but I hit it on all of my all of

478
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,530
my internal reports where I see this

479
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,580
folks with these internal websites the

480
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,260
they have an SSL certificate that's

481
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:58,640
either self signed expired invalid what

482
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,610
happens puts the red bar up there pops

483
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:04,450
up the dialog box doesn't it says hey

484
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:07,220
this is a secure web page but it doesn't

485
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,450
look right you want to load it anyway

486
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,110
and they always click yes so when you

487
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,060
don't configure your SSL certificates

488
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,610
properly on your internal website you

489
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:19,310
are training your users to ignore all

490
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,140
those prompts and just keep clicking yes

491
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,570
until they get what they need so small

492
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,640
pet peeve take it for what it's worth

493
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,890
but you're training them to do it wrong

494
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,300
if you're doing it that way

495
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,970
it doesn't take very long to produce a

496
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:35,560
proper SSL certificate

497
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,020
one more thing make it matter to them

498
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,550
and this is really where social

499
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,680
engineering your own starts to come into

500
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:47,210
play so as an example the secure con I

501
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,750
mentioned we do a lot of obscure work

502
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,240
with critical infrastructure we also do

503
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:58,550
a lot of let's call it pre audit work so

504
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:02,030
with the infrastructure folks they have

505
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,490
to have an assessment each year by a

506
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:07,010
third-party vendor for the security of

507
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:11,870
their not-so-hot devices so devices that

508
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,570
run power plants aren't like the devices

509
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,160
that we use every day they don't have

510
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,230
up-to-date servers they've got some

511
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:20,360
things with serial to IP converters on

512
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,650
them you know they have a lot of

513
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,210
non-traditional things in their

514
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,710
environment that they need to protect

515
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:27,110
that they don't know how to do so it's a

516
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,980
very hands-on kind of paper-like process

517
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,260
nobody likes it nobody likes it at all

518
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,140
but they have to do it so when we come

519
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,090
into this we try to do we try to put a

520
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,160
little security spin on this right yes

521
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,770
its compliance yes I will help get you

522
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,900
ready in case you get audited I will

523
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,310
show you what the auditor is going to

524
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:50,240
look for however we can do better from a

525
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,150
security perspective so this was a

526
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:55,100
long-term client it's a power plant

527
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:59,060
actually generation plant really really

528
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,670
large on the East Coast and we've been

529
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:02,930
doing their assessments for about five

530
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,970
years now so we were familiar with most

531
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:05,520
of the staff

532
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,200
if they were ready for us but they had a

533
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,260
new router guy new router guy didn't

534
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,480
like me all right he didn't like me at

535
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:12,840
all

536
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,060
because I'm here talking about this

537
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,400
audit crap and he's got stuff to do and

538
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,090
this is just a waste of his time so we

539
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,800
get through about the first half of the

540
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:27,150
day and we're at lunch and because the

541
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,920
guys know that we do a lot of consulting

542
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,630
in other places they'd asked if I had

543
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:33,260
done any fun physical pen tests lately

544
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,700
so I started to describe a more recent

545
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,920
one where we attacked the RFID system

546
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,380
and cloned the cards and router guys

547
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,620
still over there like this angry at

548
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,720
lunchtime until I said something about

549
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,240
cloning RFID cards and then I almost saw

550
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,940
like his ears perk up and he literally

551
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,940
just stopped me he said what did you say

552
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,740
simple ID cards like the one that you

553
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,250
have

554
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,440
I can make duplicates of those and enter

555
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,600
the building as you and the system won't

556
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,000
know the difference that was all I

557
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,910
needed to say so after that he was

558
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:08,940
completely fascinated because I made

559
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,160
security about him this could happen to

560
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,050
me what do you mean this could happen to

561
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,990
me how do you do that like well I've got

562
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,060
the equipment of the car do you want to

563
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:21,110
see so we gave him a quick little RFID

564
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:23,610
demonstration showed them some defensive

565
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,770
techniques they could use that guy was

566
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,900
my best friend the rest of the week so

567
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,270
once I took the time to find something

568
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,890
that really mattered to him and that

569
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,570
that really wasn't on purpose it just

570
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:36,300
kind of happened I made security matter

571
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:40,050
to him not to the company to him because

572
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,010
that's something that could have

573
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,470
happened to his card somebody could have

574
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,180
entered the power plant using a clone of

575
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:48,450
his ID you don't want that on you I told

576
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,010
that to all the new interns it scares

577
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,140
them to death and you know what they use

578
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,300
the RFID blocking sleeves that I give

579
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,680
them after that so once I made it

580
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,460
important to him he was much more

581
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,770
receptive about all of the audit things

582
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:04,680
that we needed to work on so and I

583
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,870
understand from the flip side you know

584
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,790
I'm coming in on this auditor I don't

585
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,010
know anything right and I'm sitting here

586
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,210
telling you how to how to run your

587
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:13,950
switches and how to configure if our

588
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:17,310
walls but once once we got past that

589
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,440
smaller

590
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,909
he couldn't get enough advice he would

591
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:22,620
ask us about this he would ask us about

592
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,149
that stuff that wasn't even really

593
00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:26,909
skater related so when you make it

594
00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:28,409
matter to your folks they're gonna start

595
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:30,750
paying more attention to you so it's

596
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:34,309
it's kind of like training in disguise

597
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:37,889
each and every one of you work in a

598
00:24:37,889 --> 00:24:41,009
different kind of environment sure to a

599
00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:42,750
point we're all security people we all

600
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,639
kind of work in an office but not

601
00:24:44,639 --> 00:24:47,070
necessarily all those offices are

602
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,259
different all of those offices have

603
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:51,840
different threat models you know what

604
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,360
what are we defending against it just

605
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,149
depends on who we are as an organization

606
00:24:56,149 --> 00:25:00,659
who's targeting us you know I don't

607
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:02,210
really know about that last one but

608
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,610
anyway that's another story

609
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,750
before we can really create a good

610
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,320
awareness program we need to understand

611
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,679
what's important to us as a business who

612
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,659
is looking to attack us as a business as

613
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:19,919
an organization once we've got a good

614
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,870
handle on that then we move on to stuff

615
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:24,870
that we should cover okay there's a lot

616
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:27,779
but remember we're not making little

617
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:29,970
cybersecurity experts out of merry and

618
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,279
accounting we aren't we're teaching

619
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:35,009
Marriott accounting the basics the rules

620
00:25:35,009 --> 00:25:37,500
of the road and then what to do next if

621
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,759
she comes into something that looks

622
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:45,049
suspicious understanding your audience

623
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:49,470
so it's not just about Marion accounting

624
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:52,019
it's also about the SCADA operator the

625
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:54,120
guy that works in the power plant he's

626
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,740
not sitting around looking at his email

627
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,399
all day

628
00:25:56,399 --> 00:25:58,740
yeah the threats that are against him

629
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,539
are very different than the threats

630
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:02,159
against Marion accounting

631
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,620
against your IT organization against

632
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,110
your helpdesk so really understanding

633
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:09,210
how security matters to each one of your

634
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:11,159
organization's gives you a really good

635
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:13,799
perspective on how you can start to spin

636
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:15,480
that to make that important to them as

637
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,429
individuals and to them as an

638
00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:22,200
organization now when I teach social

639
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,509
engineering classes I always stop to

640
00:26:24,509 --> 00:26:26,909
talk about communication styles and

641
00:26:26,909 --> 00:26:28,950
everybody rolls their eyes and they say

642
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:31,140
Val this is dumb

643
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,850
why are we learning about communication

644
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,160
styles we want a social engineer people

645
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,480
we don't we don't want to do this

646
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,280
well communication styles are really

647
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,740
important to social engineering but

648
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,390
they're also really important to people

649
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,880
who need to teach how are you going to

650
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,080
teach somebody if you don't quite

651
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,370
understand how they communicate so folks

652
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:52,830
for the most part fall into three basic

653
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:57,049
buckets and we've got visual folks

654
00:26:57,049 --> 00:27:00,929
auditories and kinesthetics so the next

655
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:03,330
few slides are based on content from a

656
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,100
book by an author called Nicholas booth

657
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,340
men and his book is called how to get

658
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,200
somebody to like you in 90 seconds or

659
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,679
less

660
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:13,320
so his thing is all about building rapid

661
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,870
rapport and quickly identifying what

662
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:18,360
kind of communicator that person is and

663
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:22,049
then using words or phrases or body

664
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:24,179
language to appeal to that communication

665
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:29,070
style to do a little bit of it's almost

666
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:33,030
like a nonverbal kind of bonding so

667
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:35,429
visual folks we're gonna go through this

668
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:37,710
pretty fast but I want you to have an

669
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:40,559
idea of who these folks are visual

670
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,780
people they think in pictures so if I

671
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:45,540
start describing you know the ocean to

672
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,130
you the first thing you do is it pops

673
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,580
into your mind you see a picture of it

674
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,410
folks that are visuals they usually look

675
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,419
up and to the left of the right when

676
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:56,520
they're talking because that's when your

677
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,799
brain is creating or recalling an image

678
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,240
it's a little psychology in there

679
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,470
they're usually in professions that

680
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:07,710
require quick judgments high-ranking

681
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:10,590
military officials folks in upper

682
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,929
management things that require a

683
00:28:12,929 --> 00:28:19,080
constant stream of input and output they

684
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:23,309
use a lot of tag phrases like these this

685
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:26,640
is just a few I won't read them all to

686
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,990
you I'll just let you glance really

687
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:32,640
quick I want you to kind of think about

688
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,020
as we're going through these like which

689
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,970
one you think that you are and then you

690
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:38,730
can take the test it's in his book I

691
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,260
don't know if it's on his website it's

692
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,750
like ten questions to kind of give you

693
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,720
an idea of what your community

694
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,070
style is so the auditory folks I really

695
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,930
sound is really important to auditory

696
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:53,180
folks they'll kind of tilt their head

697
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:57,110
when they're talking to you for visual

698
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:00,380
folks this drives them crazy because for

699
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:03,020
visual folks eye contact is is paramount

700
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:06,430
in a conversation for auditory folks

701
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,210
when they tilt their head like that

702
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:10,460
they're actually leaning their ear in

703
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,870
closer to you so that they can

704
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:14,030
understand what you're saying better so

705
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,650
they'll look off in the distance because

706
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:16,910
they're not really focusing with their

707
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:18,670
eyes they're focusing with their ears

708
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:20,840
but to a visual person and that's

709
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,150
offensive because you're not looking at

710
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,290
me when you're talking to me you're

711
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:26,780
obviously not paying attention little

712
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:30,710
things like that I'm split down the

713
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,420
middle between visual and auditory but I

714
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,740
think that I kind of lean more toward

715
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:38,360
auditory and the reason for that is you

716
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,360
know I travel a lot as a consultant but

717
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,620
public places and noise like I just

718
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,900
can't do it if I get on a plane without

719
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,060
my noise-canceling headphones somebody's

720
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,490
gonna die but that's that's just all

721
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,230
there is to it screaming babies on

722
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:54,410
planes just can't do it background noise

723
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:56,840
I don't like background noise I can't

724
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,220
have the TV on when I'm trying to do

725
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,980
things it just it bothers me my

726
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,200
husband's a visual guy so and I kind of

727
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,910
knew this already but I gave him the

728
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:07,640
test anyway just to just to see what he

729
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,960
said and he went down through there and

730
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,510
he said this test is dumb all these

731
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:15,020
answers are a yeah okay that's what I

732
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:19,640
thought so and that's that's just a good

733
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,020
example of how different folks have

734
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,760
different communication styles and once

735
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,290
you kind of identify these in your

736
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:26,840
co-workers as well as other folks in

737
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,730
your life you can start to pick up on

738
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:30,470
phrases that they use in little habits

739
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:32,210
that they do and then you can start to

740
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:34,550
speak their language whether that's

741
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:37,220
using more describing images or using

742
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,950
more describing sounds or using the

743
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:42,860
pitch of your voice or the tone or the

744
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:46,610
speed so what about these kinesthetic

745
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:49,450
folks kinesthetic folks are all about

746
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:52,070
kind of like the right look and feel of

747
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:55,570
things they're usually more laid-back

748
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:58,520
it's not so much about appearance it's

749
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,340
not so much about sound they kind of

750
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,860
kind of roll with things they look down

751
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,540
a lot when they're speaking because

752
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:08,750
they're they're recalling feelings so

753
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,550
you look up when you're recalling images

754
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:12,920
you down when you're recalling feelings

755
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,990
so the next time you're in a heated

756
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,850
debate with somebody gonna watch their

757
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:19,130
eyes you it'll it's kind of a tell to

758
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:21,440
see if they're maybe telling you the

759
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,950
truth or not

760
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:29,170
kinesthetic folks they speak very slowly

761
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:34,910
they really think about what they're

762
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:37,880
trying to say if you're a visual or an

763
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,920
auditory person that drives you insane

764
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,870
because you just want it out with come

765
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:44,450
on let's go let's go my son is a

766
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:46,850
kinesthetic guy I asked him how his day

767
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:50,750
was I get 500 words about you know how

768
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,430
Sally did this at school and then

769
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:55,510
whatever I asked my daughter visual good

770
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:59,870
that was cool good done that's all she

771
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,310
needs to say it was good I don't need to

772
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:04,070
know anything else my boss is a

773
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,890
kinesthetic so you know I know when I go

774
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:09,110
into his office like it's gonna take a

775
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,970
while all right there are no quick trips

776
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,430
into his office so I can kind of plan my

777
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,710
day around that so little life hacks in

778
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,360
here to things that'll make your life a

779
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,970
little bit easier once you identify you

780
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:22,340
know kind of what folks lean toward is

781
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,230
communication you can start to use that

782
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,150
to your advantage

783
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:28,580
but this also matters in training all

784
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,130
right so posters are cool they work

785
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,920
sometimes for some people they're not

786
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,120
gonna work for everybody

787
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,040
somebody's standing up here giving a

788
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,930
lecture that's not gonna work for

789
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:41,210
everybody so you kind of need to blend

790
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:44,960
your learning environment to appeal to

791
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,130
all three of these types of folks I call

792
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,470
this people patching so when it gets

793
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,330
down to really training and teaching

794
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:56,030
folks how things are it's all about

795
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:58,250
describing how attacks work once you

796
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,950
demonstrate something it really starts

797
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,090
to bring it home

798
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:04,309
sure we can tell people don't click on

799
00:33:04,309 --> 00:33:05,869
this don't click on that it does bad

800
00:33:05,869 --> 00:33:07,869
things

801
00:33:07,869 --> 00:33:10,429
what are bad things and actually I

802
00:33:10,429 --> 00:33:12,609
forgot I was gonna put a slide in here

803
00:33:12,609 --> 00:33:16,219
about that awesome hacker 4chan I'm sure

804
00:33:16,219 --> 00:33:17,599
you guys have heard about that over here

805
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:19,129
to the league nude photos from the

806
00:33:19,129 --> 00:33:22,729
iCloud so I think that the leaked nude

807
00:33:22,729 --> 00:33:24,739
photos from the iCloud might actually be

808
00:33:24,739 --> 00:33:26,899
like the Gateway to really opening up

809
00:33:26,899 --> 00:33:29,269
awareness training to folks because it

810
00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:31,509
matters to them yes

811
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,700
so my next talk I think that I'm gonna

812
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,139
do at a user level it's gonna be called

813
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,369
cloud security

814
00:33:37,369 --> 00:33:39,979
where are your dirty bits to try to

815
00:33:39,979 --> 00:33:41,690
teach folks about cloud security and

816
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,999
when you put things in the cloud where

817
00:33:43,999 --> 00:33:46,039
is it going it's going on somebody

818
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:47,869
else's computer alright stop calling up

819
00:33:47,869 --> 00:33:49,609
the cloud just call it somebody else's

820
00:33:49,609 --> 00:33:53,269
computer but but doing comparisons like

821
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:54,710
that and explaining in a different ways

822
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:57,139
really helps them understand oh wait I

823
00:33:57,139 --> 00:33:58,940
don't really want to hand this photo

824
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,509
album full of incriminating pictures to

825
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:06,049
strangers that would be silly so if you

826
00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:08,299
can adjust your style to match their

827
00:34:08,299 --> 00:34:10,159
style you'll really start to make a lot

828
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,039
of progress commuter based training is

829
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:17,089
cool it has its uses there are some cool

830
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:19,639
programs out there they use really short

831
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:22,639
modules that are nice the whole like

832
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,539
hour plus CBT nobody gonna listen to

833
00:34:26,539 --> 00:34:30,710
that I don't I I have ADHD when it comes

834
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:31,579
to CBTs

835
00:34:31,579 --> 00:34:33,168
I click through the first three slides

836
00:34:33,168 --> 00:34:35,869
and I'm good start to pay attention all

837
00:34:35,869 --> 00:34:37,899
right okay okay and then I'm done like

838
00:34:37,899 --> 00:34:40,250
ten minutes in like if you haven't told

839
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,659
me what I need to know in ten minutes

840
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:44,869
I'm just I'm not listening anymore and

841
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:47,779
especially the ones where they read it

842
00:34:47,779 --> 00:34:49,339
to you because they're trying to appeal

843
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:51,529
to auditory folks so you've got the

844
00:34:51,529 --> 00:34:53,899
slide up there and it's literally

845
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:56,929
reading the slide word by word so for

846
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:59,900
visual people you're like I know I can

847
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,420
see it shut up but you can't

848
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,970
fast-forward it so something to keep in

849
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:07,099
mind when it comes to choosing your CBTs

850
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:10,250
choose them wisely don't go with a

851
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,650
one-size-fits-all go with something that

852
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,150
fits your environment

853
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:16,009
that really appeals to the folks that

854
00:35:16,009 --> 00:35:18,829
work for you all those threats aren't

855
00:35:18,829 --> 00:35:20,480
gonna be the same so they're not

856
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,849
one-size-fits-all use them where you can

857
00:35:22,849 --> 00:35:26,839
don't rely on them exclusively little

858
00:35:26,839 --> 00:35:29,509
things like this all right well this is

859
00:35:29,509 --> 00:35:31,849
all basic stuff to security people this

860
00:35:31,849 --> 00:35:34,960
is not basic stuff to other folks I

861
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,369
still show this at government agencies

862
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:40,069
and get tons of questions I don't need

863
00:35:40,069 --> 00:35:42,680
to teach them about what SMTP spoofing

864
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,660
is they don't need to know how it works

865
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,640
they just need to know that it's

866
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,559
possible to change this to make it say

867
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:50,619
whatever it is that I want it to say

868
00:35:50,619 --> 00:35:53,150
don't rely on this as a key indicator

869
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:56,359
that this is legitimate little things

870
00:35:56,359 --> 00:35:59,799
like this build them into your program

871
00:35:59,799 --> 00:36:02,690
shorten links anybody know where that

872
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:05,180
goes yeah me either

873
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,910
so you know how can you expect one of

874
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:10,009
your users to know they may not even

875
00:36:10,009 --> 00:36:12,529
know what shortened links are if their

876
00:36:12,529 --> 00:36:14,720
social media folks they're clicking on

877
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,920
those things all the time and Twitter

878
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,739
they don't know where they go you need

879
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:20,720
to teach them about tools that can help

880
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,999
them track where those actually go QR

881
00:36:25,999 --> 00:36:27,109
codes

882
00:36:27,109 --> 00:36:30,380
hahaha QR codes social engineering

883
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:34,579
exercise we make pizza flyers for the

884
00:36:34,579 --> 00:36:36,410
whatever the local pizza shop is and we

885
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:37,819
put that you know you get a free coupon

886
00:36:37,819 --> 00:36:40,190
if you scan the QR code if their parking

887
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:42,049
lot isn't patrolled or it isn't

888
00:36:42,049 --> 00:36:43,579
controlled we'll just go out and slap

889
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:46,730
those on everybody's car and then just

890
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:48,410
watch the shelves roll in from all the

891
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:50,749
phones and then you can use that as your

892
00:36:50,749 --> 00:36:52,640
jumping point into the environment

893
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,859
because it's already partially trusted

894
00:36:54,859 --> 00:36:58,339
yes so little things like this little

895
00:36:58,339 --> 00:36:59,690
things that we don't think about I think

896
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:01,309
there was one of these actually in the

897
00:37:01,309 --> 00:37:02,960
in the goodie bag that we got at least

898
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,640
there wasn't the speaker bag I dumped it

899
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,009
out last night to dig through it I don't

900
00:37:07,009 --> 00:37:08,269
know where it goes I didn't scan it

901
00:37:08,269 --> 00:37:10,789
maybe somebody can tell me cuz I'm not

902
00:37:10,789 --> 00:37:16,390
gonna look Java

903
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:20,980
teach your users about Java bless you

904
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,940
they don't need to know how to ah the

905
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,039
works they just need to know when it's

906
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:26,930
appropriate to click this button and

907
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:29,930
when it is not if there are applications

908
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,970
you use in your environment that require

909
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:35,630
Java applets teach them those there

910
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:38,170
shouldn't be more than a handful maybe

911
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:40,759
outside of that they really shouldn't be

912
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,440
clicking on anything that looks like

913
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,200
this everybody that knows social

914
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,579
engineering and the social engineering

915
00:37:46,579 --> 00:37:48,950
toolkit knows the Java applet attack

916
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:52,940
it's Dave Kennedy's baby why because it

917
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,970
works really really well and that works

918
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,559
really really well because folks don't

919
00:37:57,559 --> 00:38:00,529
understand what this thing is and they

920
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:02,180
just keep clicking until something

921
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:02,720
happens

922
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,410
so again we're not teaching them to

923
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,999
understand how Java works we're teaching

924
00:38:07,999 --> 00:38:10,789
them to pick up the phone and say got

925
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,279
this email clicked on this link I'm not

926
00:38:13,279 --> 00:38:14,029
sure this is right

927
00:38:14,029 --> 00:38:17,509
and then you as the security team take

928
00:38:17,509 --> 00:38:23,619
over from there all right the website

929
00:38:23,619 --> 00:38:26,359
this is kind of important and I think

930
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:28,460
this gets overlooked in a lot of places

931
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:31,819
I don't see this very often if you're

932
00:38:31,819 --> 00:38:34,190
gonna tell folks about security you need

933
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,569
to give them a really nice reference

934
00:38:35,569 --> 00:38:37,970
point to go to if they have questions

935
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:39,680
about it that they may not want to call

936
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,440
about right away

937
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,970
does anybody have a copy of their

938
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:46,989
encryption policy for their environment

939
00:38:46,989 --> 00:38:52,400
saved to their desktop I don't I'm not

940
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,779
gonna save all those policies why

941
00:38:53,779 --> 00:38:56,269
because I need a centralized location

942
00:38:56,269 --> 00:38:58,609
where I can do a few clicks and get to

943
00:38:58,609 --> 00:39:00,829
what I need instead of digging through

944
00:39:00,829 --> 00:39:03,049
email to find it because if somebody's

945
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:07,029
gonna dig through email to find it and

946
00:39:07,029 --> 00:39:08,989
they're gonna spend so much time looking

947
00:39:08,989 --> 00:39:10,489
for it that they're just gonna give up

948
00:39:10,489 --> 00:39:12,529
and do whatever they want anyway so

949
00:39:12,529 --> 00:39:15,019
giving them a central hub to really get

950
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,339
their hands on everything that they need

951
00:39:16,339 --> 00:39:18,920
to know especially the numbers and the

952
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,359
email addresses if they have questions

953
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:22,880
or they need to report something cyber

954
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,910
and physical if they notice something

955
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:28,170
that looked off you know in physical sea

956
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,670
why's they need to be able to report

957
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:33,180
that as well scaredy tip of the day you

958
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,590
know just just small little things

959
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:36,210
things that we don't think about that

960
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:39,090
make a big difference for folks external

961
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:40,890
topics all right you don't have to blog

962
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:42,150
all this stuff you don't have to

963
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:44,850
recreate the wheel send them to blogs

964
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:47,570
about identity thefts and blogs about

965
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:51,660
RFID security how it works you don't

966
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,520
have to write it all most of its already

967
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,900
been written you just need to point them

968
00:39:54,900 --> 00:40:00,240
in the right direction give folks the

969
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,160
right tools to make good security

970
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,240
decisions I love this one this is going

971
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,220
in all of my presentations from now on

972
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:12,840
some folks have a real problem with

973
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,310
password safes and password generators

974
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:18,600
depending on what your company view is

975
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,640
on that I can tell you that that

976
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,680
password generator is going to come up

977
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,810
with a password that's far more complex

978
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:26,340
than what your users going to come up

979
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,830
with on their own they don't have to

980
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:31,340
remember it if they use a password safe

981
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,810
if you make them come up with complex

982
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:35,490
passwords that they have to remember

983
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:37,350
then they're just going to increment

984
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,660
them by one or they're going to reuse

985
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:43,410
them everywhere that's not really

986
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:47,250
helping is it so consider giving your

987
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,400
your users tools to really help them

988
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,330
like I mentioned before with the

989
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:53,430
shortened links give them a few websites

990
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:54,840
to hit where they can paste that

991
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,490
shortened link in there to check it if

992
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:59,130
they're if they're worried about it and

993
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:01,080
that's other great material that you can

994
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,650
put on your website there all right so

995
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:07,710
we got a bunch of material we understand

996
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:10,320
our audience a little bit better now

997
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:14,940
what do we do with it presentation is

998
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:20,730
everything absolutely everything so this

999
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:24,440
is an example last year I think it was I

1000
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,690
was asked to give a talk for a defense

1001
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:29,610
client a government client of mine I

1002
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:32,790
said hey we're doing security day you

1003
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,650
know you like tear our network up all

1004
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:36,600
the time can you come and talk to our

1005
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,060
users and talk to them about like basic

1006
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:41,280
security things

1007
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,470
I can do that no problem so the director

1008
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:49,140
of security was also giving their annual

1009
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:54,090
awareness training the same day later on

1010
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:57,510
in the day so his the only thing I've

1011
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:59,790
changed here is I just I just changed

1012
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:02,160
the logo for theirs I had their you know

1013
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,980
their government logo on there so which

1014
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,270
one of these sessions would you rather

1015
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:08,880
attend if you were only going to spend

1016
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,550
an hour at security day and you got

1017
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,440
credit for either one of those as your

1018
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,820
annual awareness training which one

1019
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:18,360
would you go to probably not the boring

1020
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,900
one so my talk was actually first in the

1021
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:26,280
day and the room filled up and then they

1022
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,230
started lining chairs up up along the

1023
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:30,870
edges and then they started standing and

1024
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:31,740
then they started standing in the

1025
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,530
doorways and hafter words the director

1026
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:36,330
of security comes you know scurrying up

1027
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:37,860
to me he said what did you do

1028
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,900
we've never had this many people show up

1029
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,430
before how did you get them to show up

1030
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:43,980
who did you tell said I didn't tell

1031
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:48,090
anybody it's that's just my title it's

1032
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:49,830
been on the posters and it went out in

1033
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:52,620
the emails so then I felt a little bad

1034
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,210
it was a little bit embarrassing for him

1035
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:55,920
because everybody came from my talk and

1036
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,630
then there were like six people in his

1037
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:00,270
liquor we covered a lot of the same

1038
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:04,830
material but they didn't know that so

1039
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:06,390
you have to social engineer your own

1040
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:08,700
make it interesting people are not gonna

1041
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,500
pay attention otherwise that's why I

1042
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,180
have funny cat pictures in my slides

1043
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,710
because if I just showed a bunch of

1044
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:14,220
words

1045
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,140
you damn innocently 20 minutes ago

1046
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:17,820
probably thirty actually we're getting

1047
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:20,430
into the forty minute mark here all

1048
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:22,380
right moving beyond the PowerPoint I'm a

1049
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:25,050
big big big fan of this PowerPoint is

1050
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:27,600
cool it has its place in very limited

1051
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,640
areas when it comes to awareness

1052
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,070
training bring some folks in to do some

1053
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:35,250
demos have a little mobile lab set up is

1054
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:37,320
a Lunch and Learn show folks about

1055
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:41,660
mobile security tap and pay credit cards

1056
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:44,370
again we're making this matter to them

1057
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:47,370
because once you start the habit of

1058
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:50,280
people thinking security related things

1059
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,070
security wise then they'll start using

1060
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,450
that every day and

1061
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:56,760
work and life so you make it matter to

1062
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,180
them at home it'll matter to them at

1063
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,820
work as well so social engineering your

1064
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,440
own probably make it important to them

1065
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,079
those behaviors will carry across in

1066
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:10,920
your environment I'm a big fan of the

1067
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,440
video stuff so there are some really

1068
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,750
cool programs out there that have short

1069
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:21,270
videos with different security topics so

1070
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:24,420
and I didn't put these guys in because

1071
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,520
their their media sponsor restricted

1072
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,680
intelligence they are a media sponsor

1073
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,869
they are out there they've basically

1074
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:35,670
taken a sitcom approach to to security

1075
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:38,130
videos so they developed this cast and

1076
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:39,540
they've developed these characters and

1077
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,710
they put them in different situations

1078
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:44,520
that talk about removable media safety

1079
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,520
and shredding documents and things but

1080
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,470
it's funny and it's entertaining and

1081
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:53,070
people like it because it makes them

1082
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:55,260
laugh and it's always great to laugh at

1083
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,030
somebody else making a mistake you're

1084
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,320
not gonna laugh at yourself when you

1085
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,319
make a mistake so if you're looking for

1086
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:03,410
something like that they have some very

1087
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:06,359
affordable plans go check them out they

1088
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:09,030
have some cool stuff Stan's securing the

1089
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:11,550
human they didn't really take a comedy

1090
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:13,380
approach they don't use the same cast

1091
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,079
everywhere they they make a bunch of

1092
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,920
short clips about data encryption and

1093
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,660
all kinds of various topics I think they

1094
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:25,650
have like 40 or 50 usually two to

1095
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:28,140
three-minute clips and I'm not sure

1096
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,520
about the pricing on that I think that's

1097
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,369
on a subscription-based service but if

1098
00:45:32,369 --> 00:45:33,569
you're looking for something to kind of

1099
00:45:33,569 --> 00:45:35,250
liven stuff up a little bit you know

1100
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:37,500
beyond the CBT beyond the PowerPoint

1101
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,690
beyond the lecture tying that all in

1102
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:41,339
together these are some great places to

1103
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:45,150
look contests I know it sounds like

1104
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:47,310
great school but you'd be amazed how

1105
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:49,230
motivated people get when you start

1106
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:53,119
making things a contest small things

1107
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:55,500
right awareness posters those things

1108
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,130
that people don't really read that often

1109
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,359
have a competition to see who can make

1110
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:02,940
the best one have a homemade video clip

1111
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:04,589
contest that's always fun

1112
00:46:04,589 --> 00:46:05,580
depend

1113
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,950
the folks that you work with and how you

1114
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:10,260
know technology verse they are they can

1115
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:14,130
really get into this folks that report

1116
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:17,310
phishing that they hit that forward

1117
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:19,350
button and they send it to the spam you

1118
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:22,050
know whatever your company domain is put

1119
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:23,940
them in a drawing for something doesn't

1120
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,610
have to be anything great $10 gift card

1121
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:31,260
here something larger small electronic

1122
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:34,890
device parking space you get a parking

1123
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:37,230
space close to the door people will be

1124
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:39,030
very much more motivated to report

1125
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:43,020
phishing trust me okay I'm running out

1126
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,000
of time based on my timer and the

1127
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,500
clapping from the other room so we're

1128
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,780
gonna go through this a little quick a

1129
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,960
little bit of psychology so we're still

1130
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,670
social engineering our own yes we're

1131
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:55,350
using psychology and social engineering

1132
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:58,350
for good NLP has been around for a while

1133
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:00,870
some folks say that it works some folks

1134
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:03,600
say that it doesn't it was really

1135
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,810
designed as a therapy method for folks

1136
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:09,780
undergoing they didn't have the term

1137
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:12,390
post-traumatic stress back then but a

1138
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:18,380
tragic event who else uses this

1139
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:20,880
marketing people use this they use this

1140
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,870
to sell you stuff all the time they use

1141
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:28,410
pretty women yes right I mean that's how

1142
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:29,850
they can get you to buy like really

1143
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:31,620
crappy hosting service cuz otherwise

1144
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:34,590
nobody's gonna buy GoDaddy stuff you

1145
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:35,940
know they use it to sell you like

1146
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:38,610
motorcycles and sports cars and a really

1147
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:41,970
really bad food really bad for nobody

1148
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:44,970
goes there for the food right because it

1149
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:48,870
uses NLP and NLP basically we'll take

1150
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:51,720
what we call an anchor and that's where

1151
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,060
you are attaching a feeling or an

1152
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:58,440
emotion to a certain state so nobody

1153
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,140
goes to Hooters for the food they go for

1154
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:03,570
the visuals yes so when you see that

1155
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:07,380
orange and white that you'll start to

1156
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:10,440
recall that logo they use colors for

1157
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,060
this they use music let's write their

1158
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:15,830
little jingles right and slogans and

1159
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:19,830
that's they're using NLP to tie those in

1160
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:22,590
triggers I don't have time to show the

1161
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:25,770
video today I'm gonna do it on the

1162
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:27,300
workshop tomorrow I'm gonna workshop

1163
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,850
tomorrow with the same thing basically

1164
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:31,110
but we're gonna build this out it's two

1165
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:34,620
hours so to be a lot more reference

1166
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,600
material and things in there but I have

1167
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:41,670
a video that demonstrates NLP in not

1168
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:45,600
quite real life but TV life so for those

1169
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,460
of you who can't make it tomorrow I

1170
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,740
don't really think I need to explain who

1171
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:55,050
Darren brown is here do i no yes yes no

1172
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:58,170
I can't see you I'll just go over it

1173
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:00,690
really quick so Darren Brown is uh what

1174
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:03,530
they call a Mentalist she's a performer

1175
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:06,570
he does a lot of hypnosis and very

1176
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:09,120
awesome things based in the UK I was

1177
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,100
very very sad that he's not touring

1178
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:13,440
right now during my first visit here but

1179
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,710
he has a program he's got a lot of

1180
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:19,610
programs there's a specific episode

1181
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:23,430
called the heist and you can get it I

1182
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:24,330
think it's on YouTube

1183
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:29,070
pretty sure check it out it's 45 minutes

1184
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:32,280
but basically he uses NLP and he uses

1185
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:35,810
these anchors that I'm talking about to

1186
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:38,730
convince these people to rob the bank of

1187
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:41,820
England with it without actually saying

1188
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:45,480
anything about robbing a bank so those

1189
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:46,680
of you that are gonna come out tomorrow

1190
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,170
will watch that after we talk about NLP

1191
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:51,690
some more those of you that can't check

1192
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:56,430
it out and I am two minutes away from my

1193
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:58,920
time slot so I can do quick questions if

1194
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,020
I can see you otherwise I'm just going

1195
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:03,150
to hang out over here outside in the

1196
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:05,720
common area

1197
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:15,539
[Applause]
