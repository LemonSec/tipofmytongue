1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,710
afternoon everyone welcome to the talk

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,980
first thing I'm going to say is there is

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,080
another talk on Hadoop for reverse

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,940
engineering which is going to be a lot

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,200
more technical than the one I'm giving

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,509
so anyone who is looking for the ins and

7
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:17,369
outs of the technology that's probably a

8
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:18,750
better talk I'm just saying that right

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,350
now so expectations I'm going to be

10
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,660
laying out I'm sorry it's just a few

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,470
hugging straws Freiberg I have been

12
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,019
working with a number of companies over

13
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,300
the last year and a half around security

14
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,219
analytics whether that be a strategic

15
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:36,840
level whether that be planning the

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,290
implementations whether that be maturing

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,059
their existing capabilities I'm going to

18
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:46,379
talk a little bit about Big Data and

19
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,090
cyber the two buzzwords that I'm sure

20
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,030
everyone's really happy to hear a little

21
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,129
bit about situational awareness and and

22
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:56,789
how this is all being tied together and

23
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,890
then some of the opportunities I see on

24
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,469
the horizon that we need to make sure we

25
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:02,850
don't back ourselves into a corner and

26
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,000
we can't take advantage of ask questions

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,110
as we go along

28
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:13,140
heckles wait to the end yeah well you

29
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,310
know well I'm here but I won't listen so

30
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,330
big data massively overused buzzword

31
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,770
everybody and their dog big data's

32
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,080
everything now there were a few useful

33
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,240
definitions Doug Laney came up with the

34
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,860
free V's originally I'm sure everyone's

35
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,049
heard it volume velocity variety it's

36
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:36,600
worth bearing that in mind a lot of what

37
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,850
we see is probably more to do with

38
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,130
variety than volume in a lot of the

39
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,560
analytics we look at we've also seen a

40
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,000
couple of other V's because everyone

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,090
likes adding on more words value and

42
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,079
veracity and the important thing here is

43
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:53,909
are we getting return on investment are

44
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:55,829
we making good investments when we're

45
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:59,369
doing this sort of thing and can we

46
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,259
trust the answers these platforms are

47
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:03,119
giving us there's a lot of really

48
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,009
interesting and fun ways you can play

49
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:06,540
with data you can learn from it you can

50
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,149
make predictions do you want to bet your

51
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:11,129
business on it then there's this some

52
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:12,870
real interesting conversation to have

53
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,170
about

54
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,470
that so first thing I'm gonna use the

55
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,349
term big data I don't like it I think

56
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:22,800
there are better terms and I think this

57
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,050
is a more useful way of thinking about

58
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,110
the topic data engineering and this is

59
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,430
putting together the platform's this is

60
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,989
some of the pre-processing of the data

61
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:35,550
putting it into a format we can use

62
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,010
moving it at the right time making sure

63
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,330
it's backed up making sure it can be

64
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,709
trusted data science which is much more

65
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:45,840
the analytics making sense of what's in

66
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,600
the data and then data-driven management

67
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,370
which is taking that output and actually

68
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,780
doing something as a result of it not

69
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,130
just saying hey I've got this fantastic

70
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,569
visualization and everyone should be

71
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:57,630
really pleased of it that is a much more

72
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,250
useful thing the same big data and if

73
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,810
you wanna say big data these days I

74
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,730
would say that's much more what people

75
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,980
talk about in data engineering data

76
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,709
science has kind of edged into that but

77
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:09,090
a lot of people get a lot more excited

78
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,500
about the platform's a lot more expect

79
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,410
excited about the under put the the data

80
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,970
into one big part and think about it

81
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,500
rather than actually trying to

82
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,820
understand what it can tell us and try

83
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:23,820
and make some value out of it two things

84
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,709
I've seen happening and they both have

85
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:27,480
the same reason why they're happening

86
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,120
there's a concept bouncing around a

87
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,459
whole bunch of especially the large US

88
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,019
banks right now who are sort of in the

89
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:35,850
vanguard of this following the

90
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:36,930
intelligence agencies getting there

91
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,760
about 10 years ago is the data Lake and

92
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,310
the data Lake is effectively a single

93
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,079
platform it may have some sort of

94
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,609
multi-tenant technology on it you might

95
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:48,810
be using acumen or something like that

96
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,090
to split up the data but it's a single

97
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,650
platform somewhere in the business that

98
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,870
all that data goes onto and a variety of

99
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,480
use cases are deployed on and the reason

100
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,239
data lakes are turning up is that nobody

101
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,440
can hire anybody that knows anything

102
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,319
about this this is a unicorn topic this

103
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,970
is even more of a unicorn topic than

104
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,329
cyber security cyber data scientists

105
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:10,799
brilliant they're they're like pink

106
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,370
unicorns so what what's happening is

107
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,079
that they're building centers of

108
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,250
excellence in the business they're

109
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,988
putting that data engineering and data

110
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:21,450
science talent in one place so that the

111
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,830
various bits of their very large

112
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,240
businesses can make use of it and

113
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,490
they're giving them one platform so that

114
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,169
the various parts of their business can

115
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:29,550
put their data in there and that one

116
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,520
team can use it very common to see this

117
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,220
now as an organization what is happening

118
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,949
is these Centers of Excellence are that

119
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:39,449
I've spent the last year in my

120
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:40,889
experience hunting round their

121
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:42,810
businesses looking for use cases you

122
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,699
know somebody in senior management an

123
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:45,900
exec has heard that everyone else is

124
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,759
doing big data they friend some money at

125
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,590
a proof-of-concept platform now they

126
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,110
need to prove enough value that they can

127
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,819
get some more money and actually build

128
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:56,250
something that scales out so they've

129
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,479
been hunting around the business for use

130
00:04:57,479 --> 00:04:59,849
cases a large part of that process is

131
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:01,050
going to various bits of the business

132
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,150
and saying let me explain to you what

133
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,729
Big Data or what data sites can do for

134
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:07,560
you go away and have a think for a month

135
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,849
and then come back and we'll talk about

136
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:11,039
how what we might be able to do the

137
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,500
really interesting thing here is

138
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,759
security has been a data problem for a

139
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,190
long time you come to the security team

140
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,409
and say we've got this brilliant

141
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:21,150
platform we can take loads of data we

142
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,650
can do loads of analytics across it and

143
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,909
the security team when I meet lis gobril

144
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:25,590
I've got used case one use case to use

145
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,479
case three use case for uses fine and in

146
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:29,039
every organization they're building

147
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,810
these platforms for business value but

148
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,820
invariably some of the first use cases

149
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,310
they're deploying as security because

150
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,930
frankly we've already got the problem

151
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:37,979
we've just been waiting for a solution

152
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:41,039
to come along the other thing that data

153
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,289
lakes have been providing is enrichment

154
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:45,599
opportunities so traditionally in

155
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,430
monitoring platforms we've been pulling

156
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,099
in filtered datasets looking for

157
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,330
specific problems I'll talk about in a

158
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,400
minute and it's all from security

159
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,979
sources so we're taking security data my

160
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:58,979
look at security problems the issue the

161
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:01,110
the opportunity that the data lake

162
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,300
provides to us potentially the threat as

163
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,919
well is that you're putting all that

164
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:06,270
data into one place you can start

165
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,849
enriching from unexpected sources so

166
00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:10,259
suddenly it's not just enough to know

167
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:13,440
that somebody's risky web browsing

168
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,620
behavior or link clicking behavior but

169
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,750
that same person is popping up in an HR

170
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,819
workflow somewhere well maybe I want to

171
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:21,990
pay a bit more attention to that I

172
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,610
wouldn't have seen the HR workflow

173
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,889
beforehand and so there are these

174
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:28,500
opportunities for cross business reuse

175
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,940
of data and bringing data together

176
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,710
you've got a plan for that because if

177
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,240
you're in a very strict multi-tenant

178
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,710
environment you can't break those

179
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,080
barriers you've also got a plan for the

180
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,130
fact that if you can break those

181
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,540
barriers they

182
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,190
and so you need to understand what data

183
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,750
in there is particularly sensitive and

184
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,670
you don't want your marketing team going

185
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,500
I wonder what we can do with the HR data

186
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,300
so where we are at the moment I think I

187
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,580
said cyber is increasingly a data

188
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,770
problem we're getting we're collecting

189
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,540
more and more data there's more data

190
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,270
flowing around probes all over the place

191
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:05,340
it's useful it's really useful we've had

192
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:09,000
SEM for a long time the value in SEM we

193
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,310
can now understand a lot of places

194
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,800
aren't getting it but they do you know

195
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,380
that it is now a known quantity we know

196
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,730
what we can get out of a seven we know

197
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,080
what benefit we can get if you do it

198
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,060
right you get that benefit we also know

199
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,860
pretty much now what it can't give us

200
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,690
because it's failed several time to do

201
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:27,090
it we're looking for known Freight

202
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,530
indicators so we're looking for

203
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:31,440
something that we know to be bad we're

204
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,330
taking targeted subsets of monitoring

205
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,850
data so we're saying I want to look for

206
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:38,640
particular a web application attack so

207
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,800
I'm gonna take my web application logs

208
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,930
I'm going to filter for that particular

209
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,460
string and then I'm going to analyze it

210
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,200
I'm not going to look at any of the

211
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,370
other logs that came off that web server

212
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,150
I'm not going to look at any of the

213
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,080
other logs that came off of that

214
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,190
infrastructure because actually I'm

215
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,780
looking for that particular signature in

216
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,020
that particular place which limits the

217
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,590
ability to go wider in the analysis that

218
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,850
means you have to know in advance what

219
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,830
risk you're worried about it makes it

220
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,920
very hard also to go back in time so

221
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,540
near real time you're going to get

222
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,530
alerts not far off the point it happens

223
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,490
you're getting them there or someone

224
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,410
else more likely phoned you up and tells

225
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,510
you you've been popped you want to go

226
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,150
back and look at five months ago you

227
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,890
might have to take your SEM offline in

228
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,120
order to be able to go back into an

229
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,190
archive to rather dig through and find

230
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,480
out what happened assuming you've got

231
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,820
that data still archived so there are

232
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,980
limitations around semi it has benefit

233
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,830
has value but I think we've worked out

234
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:35,909
where that top boundary is so what we're

235
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:37,799
seeing especially around the big data

236
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,929
analytics is there's a couple of very

237
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:41,990
key use cases that people are adopting

238
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,490
the first one is Network behavioral

239
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:48,240
analytics and you know everyone the

240
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,300
other big catch phrase which I haven't

241
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,470
actually written any in the deck

242
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,960
apt target attacks sophisticated

243
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,690
attackers nation-states you shall remain

244
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:01,710
nameless all the rest of it those guys

245
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,110
you know we know what's happening there

246
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,940
we've got a bunch of attackers who go as

247
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,860
sophisticated they need to get we've got

248
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,260
a bunch of guys who take undertake

249
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,200
campaigns of activity and generally they

250
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,430
put their getting straight pass on

251
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,540
monitoring solutions because they work

252
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,360
out what they are and they deliberately

253
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,230
avoid them they also in in the more

254
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:26,100
advanced and the more important attacks

255
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,170
they conduct they are using zero days

256
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,200
not anywhere near as much as they led to

257
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,850
believe but that sort of stuff is

258
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,890
happening that is really hard to pick up

259
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,360
in your same more or less impossible you

260
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,630
don't know what you're looking for their

261
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:41,130
net we're behavioral analytics takes a

262
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,560
lot more data it looks at stuff outside

263
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,120
of what we know to be bad it looks at

264
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,430
everything it does a certain amount of

265
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,110
anomaly detection but it also looks for

266
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,490
behavioral footprints regularity the use

267
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:57,350
by individuals I'll come back to that

268
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:00,300
and it does probable matches so it's

269
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,740
coming back to you and saying at the top

270
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,480
of this list is something we really

271
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,490
think is a bit worrying at the bottom of

272
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,750
this list is something that may or may

273
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,000
not be worrying you still need an

274
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,320
analyst to sit there and go through that

275
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,750
list and say at this point I stopped

276
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,820
because this isn't starting to be really

277
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,550
obvious and not particularly dangerous

278
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,440
but at the top here actually that's

279
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,080
interesting stuff I need to pick up on

280
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,280
it's all the monitoring data it's over a

281
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,290
larger period of time we're seeing some

282
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,700
of these analytic platforms reaching

283
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,640
back six twelve months of live data and

284
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,340
then summarize data for as long as

285
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,910
they've been up and also we're seeing

286
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,710
the ability to run retroactive analysis

287
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,080
in intelligence feed so more and more of

288
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,330
us are subscribing to intelligence feeds

289
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,100
we're bringing in open source feeds

290
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,960
we're bringing in commercial

291
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,120
subscriptions people are giving us these

292
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,460
indicators compromised your competitors

293
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,870
been popped another industries been

294
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,030
popped and another attack has that

295
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,810
happened to us

296
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,880
well we didn't see it in the SEM these

297
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,950
platforms allow us to run that back to

298
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,379
go back nine months and say oh yeah

299
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:05,729
we were we were pop them and also it

300
00:11:05,729 --> 00:11:07,169
allows us to bring together a lot more

301
00:11:07,169 --> 00:11:08,220
of these data sources so

302
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,549
internal-external the the point around

303
00:11:11,549 --> 00:11:13,470
that were behavioral analytics is you're

304
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,269
looking for the modus operandi of the

305
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:17,689
guy you're not looking for the tool

306
00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:20,909
you're not looking for a particular

307
00:11:20,909 --> 00:11:25,129
packet type you're looking for the

308
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:27,479
characteristics and the sort of activity

309
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:31,079
someone will be taking so the really

310
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:34,199
simple one to do is people use computers

311
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:35,419
in a certain way

312
00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:38,939
malware tends to use CNC channels in a

313
00:11:38,939 --> 00:11:40,859
very regular way there's a number of

314
00:11:40,859 --> 00:11:43,109
back off algorithms they can try and

315
00:11:43,109 --> 00:11:45,749
hide that with but computers tend to be

316
00:11:45,749 --> 00:11:47,189
quite regular people tend to be

317
00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:49,439
different if you want to look like the

318
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:51,269
people in an organization that's

319
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:52,559
actually quite difficult to get your

320
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,669
malware to do that's quite a complicated

321
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:56,099
thing so actually without knowing what

322
00:11:56,099 --> 00:11:57,419
command and control channel is you can

323
00:11:57,419 --> 00:11:58,979
probably spot some of that behavior at

324
00:11:58,979 --> 00:12:01,229
least some of the simpler ones your your

325
00:12:01,229 --> 00:12:03,179
some of those back off algorithms start

326
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:04,799
getting quite complicated you do need to

327
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:07,829
spend some time thinking about that data

328
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:09,449
enabled investigation is the other one

329
00:12:09,449 --> 00:12:11,279
that's caught of a lot of tension and

330
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,559
there's leading to a lot of RI we're

331
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:14,879
basically putting all this data into one

332
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:16,639
pot we're keeping it for a lot longer

333
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,809
we've got a bunch of tools that allow

334
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:21,929
for fast entity resolution fast event

335
00:12:21,929 --> 00:12:24,059
resolution and ton timeline

336
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:26,699
visualization it means one when you've

337
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:28,289
got that indicate or you've got that

338
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,689
report from someone outside or maybe

339
00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:32,369
you've spotted you're being attacked who

340
00:12:32,369 --> 00:12:35,850
knows it's really quick these guys are

341
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,829
not spending three weeks trolling around

342
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:39,569
pulling off local logs or not they're

343
00:12:39,569 --> 00:12:41,369
not trying to format one set of logs

344
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:42,720
from Windows to another set of logs in

345
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,979
Oracle trying to work out the time

346
00:12:43,979 --> 00:12:45,839
difference this stuff's all sitting in a

347
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,629
database or a data store and you've got

348
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:49,859
a bunch of tools that allow you to

349
00:12:49,859 --> 00:12:51,959
manipulate that very quickly it

350
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,939
significantly reduces your time to

351
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:58,379
investigate and it also provides more

352
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:00,629
context so suddenly things that are a

353
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:02,609
bit risky that doesn't look right let me

354
00:13:02,609 --> 00:13:03,749
go and see if I can find that elsewhere

355
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:04,919
let me go and see if I can find

356
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:07,079
associated behaviors with that that's

357
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,629
bad you know it allows for that sort of

358
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:12,059
Hunter investigation I'm going to sit on

359
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:13,110
my network and I'm going to

360
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,899
bad guys I'm not gonna wait for my

361
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:17,130
systems to alert me I'm not going to be

362
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:21,300
an operator these are the two key use

363
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,300
cases that are driving a lot of the

364
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,200
investment a lot of the proof of

365
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,560
concepts right now and that's great but

366
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,730
there's some dangers to what that's

367
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:33,720
going to mean for us so one of the

368
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,550
things we're thinking about if you if if

369
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,140
you're building one of these it's not

370
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,360
just a case of go and get yourself a

371
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,440
download I had to go and get yourself

372
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,820
something funky like tableau or

373
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,040
something probably even nicer like a fee

374
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,870
to do your visualization whole bunch of

375
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,790
tooling you can download it's not just a

376
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,290
case of getting a slightly nerdy bloke I

377
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,610
understand statistics to go and build

378
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:57,149
you some animals analytics there's a

379
00:13:57,149 --> 00:14:00,480
whole set of capabilities you need here

380
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,850
it is the tooling there's some

381
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,380
interesting challenges for tooling in

382
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,519
some of the customers out there I've

383
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,120
been dealing with over time an awful lot

384
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,100
of corporate procurement has moved

385
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,390
towards sans share data and virtualized

386
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,310
servers so their whole procurement

387
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,560
process is about building large boxes

388
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,410
and shares if you aren't going down the

389
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,750
Hadoop route and at this point in time

390
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,220
if you're doing big data and you're not

391
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,690
going down the Hadoop group you probably

392
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:31,560
need a reason not to be who do require

393
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,709
well works in lots of small commodity

394
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:37,260
hardware with local storage so in theory

395
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,269
it's cheap to start small and to scale

396
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:42,060
out the problem is most large corporate

397
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,800
procurement processes don't know how to

398
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,089
buy those boxes anymore because they

399
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:46,620
don't they buy big boxes and they

400
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,170
virtualized I've had customers who've

401
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:52,290
had more trouble and spent more money on

402
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:56,000
this trying to just buy pizza boxes then

403
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,050
actually they were eight they spent on

404
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,910
the data science part it's fascinating

405
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,730
that these things become a problem for

406
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,110
so harder in software you need to

407
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,339
understand what you're doing that's the

408
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,110
bit a lot people talk about people

409
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:10,140
that's the problem the skills there are

410
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,459
as I said before there are unicorns

411
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:13,910
there's not these people out there

412
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:18,810
processes this is something you start

413
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,399
with a proof of concept to a bunch of

414
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,959
clever guys who turn up every now and

415
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,279
again and tell you look what I've done

416
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,450
this in this brilliant

417
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:26,490
where you want to get to is a place

418
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,959
where you've got change control on your

419
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:31,110
scripts where you've got testable

420
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,269
scripts where you've got the ability to

421
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:35,070
professionalize your workflow where

422
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,570
you've got to understand where changes

423
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,829
have happened and where data has come

424
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:43,290
from that stuff takes effort it doesn't

425
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,519
just happen because a bunch of clever

426
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:47,070
guys are playing our platform data

427
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,220
sources and as I said you start off here

428
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,300
with everything that's already firing

429
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,010
into your SEM you start up with all the

430
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,060
other people that are using the platform

431
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,920
and then you slowly but surely work

432
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,540
around everything in your organization

433
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,560
that you can instrument and then you

434
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,790
start thinking about new instruments you

435
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:04,050
can put out there the intelligence is

436
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,269
understanding the context now this

437
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:08,209
there's interesting here that

438
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:10,470
intelligence isn't just an external

439
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,389
function I was here two years ago

440
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:14,459
talking about security intelligence got

441
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:15,660
quite a lot of pushback from the

442
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:21,300
audience I seem to recall it is about

443
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,940
understanding from external sources

444
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,889
what's happening it's also about

445
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:27,600
understanding your own environment and

446
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,410
what's happening in your environment

447
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:32,010
it's not just about looking for bad guys

448
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,570
it's about understanding where are the

449
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,220
big change programs who's bringing in a

450
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,140
whole bunch of new IT how are we

451
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,000
changing the protocols in our control

452
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,130
system erste what's happening because

453
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,899
when that stuff starts feeding through

454
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:44,130
you need to be prepared for it in the

455
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,269
analytics but you also need to

456
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:46,890
understand what that means in terms of

457
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,449
suddenly I've got a whole load of false

458
00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:49,829
positives for a new protocol I wasn't

459
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:52,980
expecting so it's external and internal

460
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,640
intelligence and the knowledge is the

461
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,560
piece and this interesting that's that's

462
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,449
partly around the team that are doing

463
00:17:00,449 --> 00:17:01,920
your analytics understanding what the

464
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,439
business needs but a significant part of

465
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,449
that right now is telling the business

466
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:07,799
what they can get and what the benefit

467
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:10,020
would be and that's that's a real

468
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,270
activity that again bunch of clever guys

469
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,770
in a room claim it had to come up with

470
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,480
some stuff if they're not out there

471
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,130
talking to the management team and

472
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,020
saying what they want that's all it

473
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,379
never be

474
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,650
if anyone's ever seen the lambda

475
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,030
architecture they'll have seen something

476
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,709
like this before this is a fairly sort

477
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:32,000
of common common high-level architecture

478
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,070
for one of these platforms a whole

479
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,450
series of data sources which you

480
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,850
probably already have a log management

481
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,260
platform which I would hope you've

482
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,400
already got because that should be

483
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,720
feeding into your sin that you've

484
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,090
already got not to say that that's going

485
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,530
to be effective or that's going to be

486
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,880
right so that might be something that

487
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,980
needs to be improved a whole bunch of

488
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,780
enrichment sources which you've already

489
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,360
got may be surprised how many places

490
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,460
don't have CMD bees or have CMD bees and

491
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,990
actually it's more dangerous looking at

492
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:01,190
them or not and then you're talking

493
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,740
about the analytics the the sort of core

494
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,500
engines and initially batch analytics is

495
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,360
where people end up people track

496
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,700
MapReduce historically that was all

497
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,039
doodoo no longer the case Hadoop is now

498
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,380
a I think once described as the

499
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,039
equivalent of the Linux kernel for data

500
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:21,530
it will do a lot more it's about

501
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,570
bringing that data in it's about storing

502
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,610
it one of the big benefits here is you

503
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,409
don't need to transform the data on the

504
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:29,210
way into your store you just write it to

505
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,080
disk you're worried about the

506
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,049
transforming you do the analytics you

507
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:34,549
get your fast query store so you start

508
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:37,280
doing some of those pre-configured

509
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,260
analytics that you know that data is

510
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,690
structured the way you can get to it and

511
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:42,860
then you've got your analytics platform

512
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,380
itself it's fairly simple stuff in that

513
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,539
in that analytics area you've got your

514
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:49,250
engineer he's running the platform he's

515
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,480
bringing the data in and you've got your

516
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,340
scientist he's doing those analytics

517
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,650
he's producing that Cobras C++ whether

518
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:57,169
it's hive whatever it is you're you're

519
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,929
writing him you've got your structured

520
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:02,510
data so this is where you feed out a

521
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,400
bunch of data into another database for

522
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,480
a whole bunch of different tools to look

523
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,390
at there is no point replacing a whole

524
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,280
bunch of existing tooling that doesn't

525
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,580
doesn't provide any VAT any more value

526
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,840
replacing it if it's already there you

527
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,789
might as well just feed it but then

528
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,380
you've got the visualization air and and

529
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,940
this is interesting because everyone's

530
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,799
talking about sake analysts everyone's

531
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:23,830
talking about threat Intel analysts

532
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,179
nobody at the moment is talking an awful

533
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:28,520
lot about security managers and they are

534
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,290
going to be a key consumer of these

535
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:36,250
forms so shock workflow in theory you

536
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,570
should have something it should work if

537
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,240
you don't that's got to be fixed fret

538
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,640
intel browser the ability to take IOC s

539
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,320
that you're pulling in from your sharing

540
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,960
community from your subscription feed

541
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,400
apply it to the data see what pops up

542
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,830
start investigation your visualization

543
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,020
screened for the investigators to going

544
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,370
to start manipulating that data looking

545
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:57,550
for interesting patterns moving down the

546
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,790
dashboard classic security dashboard

547
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,900
suddenly you've got all that data in one

548
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,430
place it's not just a case of going and

549
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,720
asking someone once a month for a

550
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,740
certain number sticking them into a

551
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,000
spreadsheet and creating a bar graph out

552
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,930
at the back of it now you can actually

553
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:12,400
start producing that properly automated

554
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,650
reporting bi query not that different

555
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,110
what is interesting and we have seen

556
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:20,110
happening in internet communities which

557
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,720
is moving it to support this area this

558
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,700
more management area are what are called

559
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,120
question focus datasets so it is not

560
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,250
just a case of saying I'm going and go

561
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,870
into a massive data store and run some

562
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,610
analytics across it it's a case of

563
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,350
saying actually I've got a particular

564
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:40,570
area of concern I don't know farrakhan

565
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:43,180
fix I will go in and I will pull out

566
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,880
from that data store in a common format

567
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,430
in a searchable manner everything I know

568
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,170
about my firewall configs and I will

569
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,450
jump that into a sequel database but

570
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,160
then my management guys who are not data

571
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,530
scientists but can use Excel can use

572
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:58,180
other business intelligence tools can

573
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,160
use tableau can manipulate at their

574
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,160
level question 402 data sets are in

575
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,350
increasing the usual thing especially in

576
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:11,680
the management side and yeah frankly the

577
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,360
analytics team will end up talking to

578
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,360
everybody it's a communications role

579
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,010
traditionally your engineers and your

580
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,480
scientists are not great communicators

581
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,590
so you're going to need someone in that

582
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,660
team who can talk to people otherwise

583
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,740
it's just gonna fall in its face

584
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:33,790
so that's kind of where we are now

585
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,840
people are doing it they're doing it for

586
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,850
Network defense they're getting some ROI

587
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:40,850
on it there's an awful lot of vendors

588
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:44,240
producing platforms that are starting to

589
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,340
become closed so there's a lot of

590
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,750
vendors that will turn up and say yeah

591
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,730
we're a Hadoop based analytics vendor

592
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,680
but you gotta use our Hadoop

593
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,540
distribution you can't use anyone else's

594
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,430
and that breaks your data like you end

595
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,410
up them with a security platform and

596
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:58,850
then a business platform and a

597
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,790
proliferation of big data platforms out

598
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:05,420
there this is dangerous the reason this

599
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:09,020
is dangerous is we are you're on your my

600
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,850
finger in the air four or five years

601
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:13,730
away from really knowing how useful this

602
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,170
stuff is going to be and how we should

603
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:18,620
use it properly as a result anything you

604
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,940
invest in right now which is a closed

605
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,670
platform could well be dead in four

606
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,740
years you might have to kill it and

607
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,210
start again you might lose that data you

608
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:29,120
might lose those analytics one of the

609
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,770
key things I would say coming out of

610
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,600
this is we need to be building on open

611
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,880
platforms because we don't know where

612
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,400
we're going to end up yet

613
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,620
open doesn't mean open source or or free

614
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,410
software or the dirty canoe hippies can

615
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,150
back off at that point this is more

616
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,250
about open in terms of I want to be the

617
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,570
port there's analytics I wanted me to

618
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:51,380
move that data so why people doing this

619
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,470
a lot of the reason I've been pulled in

620
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,970
for the organization's to talk about

621
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,370
this is they all want to improve their

622
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,650
cyber situational awareness which is

623
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,270
great everyone's got it in their

624
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:05,060
strategy and then nobody really knows

625
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:05,450
what it is

626
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,610
so you've been a bit of time going

627
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:09,860
thinking about it there's a lot of

628
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,390
academic work out there on situational

629
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,350
awareness

630
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,590
strangely airline pilots is a big big

631
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:20,090
topic fighter pilots is a big topic the

632
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:22,220
is interesting there's a lot of work on

633
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,990
it there's a lot of models they seem to

634
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:26,120
be practical there's very little in the

635
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,250
way of reliable cognitive science behind

636
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,880
it so these are useful models and there

637
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,540
was wrong as every other model ever is

638
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,340
doctor enslie came up with the free

639
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,470
stage model in 95 and this is the one

640
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:40,730
that makes sense to me it seems to make

641
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,200
sense for a lot of people

642
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,030
fundamentally situational awareness is

643
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,430
perception you need to be able to see

644
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,410
the environment around you so this is

645
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:51,140
this is understanding not understanding

646
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,480
seeing this is just seeing everything

647
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,870
and this is the promise that these big

648
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,490
data platforms bring to us is that we

649
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:59,930
don't we no longer have to start

650
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,640
throwing away data it's too big for what

651
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,670
we're our analytics platform

652
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:06,140
understanding is then saying I can see

653
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,940
all the nodes around me I can see all

654
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,350
the planes around me I can see all the

655
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,910
nits all the computers on the network I

656
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:11,720
can see all the traffic

657
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,670
do we understand why it's doing what

658
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:16,160
it's doing do I understand how it

659
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,010
interrelates so understanding is second

660
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:21,500
level and then third level is what's

661
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,050
going to happen next so where's that

662
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:26,030
plane going it looks like it's pointing

663
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,020
in that direction and going at that

664
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,940
speed so probably in the next 10 seconds

665
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,380
it will be over there brilliant that's

666
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:33,710
prediction that's not to say I predict

667
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,480
I'm going to be attacked by this group

668
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,430
in the next six months you know that's

669
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:40,780
pretty much nonsense but this is about

670
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,040
even when you're doing an investigation

671
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,680
I found a problem I see that somebody in

672
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,780
a particular box that's a couple of hops

673
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,600
away from something I really care about

674
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,280
I've got reasonable intelligence that

675
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,690
suggests that they're after that

676
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:57,020
particular asset therefore I can roughly

677
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,250
say that if they're going to head in

678
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,600
that direction and I need to start doing

679
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,550
something about it

680
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:04,580
so it's seeing understanding predicting

681
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:08,390
and this correlates with identified ones

682
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,520
come across it the Yuda loop observe

683
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,790
Oriente decide act john boyd fighter

684
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:16,550
pilot u.s. fighter pilot I think and the

685
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,590
Korean War worked out why they were

686
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,840
getting their asses handed to them is

687
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,360
that they had planes that supported a

688
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,460
faster loop they could seize here they

689
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,960
could make decisions they easier and

690
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,660
they could move quicker it wasn't about

691
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,310
the fact that they had faster planes it

692
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,390
wasn't about the fact that they could go

693
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,890
higher it was that they can make

694
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:36,200
decisions faster than the guys than the

695
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,850
Americans and as a result they were

696
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,950
shooting them down all the time and he

697
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:43,610
in an adversarial relationship it's not

698
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:46,250
about being the best it's about probably

699
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,140
getting around that Hooda loop faster

700
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,430
can I see what you're doing can I

701
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,740
understand what it is can I decide what

702
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,790
I'm going to do about it and can I make

703
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,140
that action and then get back around

704
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,440
that loop again before

705
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,240
you do so in terms of situation

706
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,389
awareness operation of cybersecurity

707
00:26:02,389 --> 00:26:04,789
observe orientate to side act

708
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:06,899
situational awareness is quite clearly

709
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,940
observe and our intake that is telling

710
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,110
us what's going on do I understand it

711
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,480
and what's gonna happen next

712
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,049
decided act is interesting and I think

713
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:21,059
one of the other big topics that we're

714
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:22,139
going to be looking at over the next few

715
00:26:22,139 --> 00:26:24,990
years is automation we all hear that

716
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,330
there's a Daffy of cyber security skills

717
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,620
there are no people out there that can

718
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,570
do what we do it's great we all get paid

719
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:32,549
a lot of money for it there are no

720
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:33,750
people out they could do what we do I

721
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,980
can't hire anybody I don't know about

722
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,220
anyone else the problem here is only

723
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,070
gonna get worse we will train more

724
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:44,159
people but the demand will still go

725
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,350
ahead of that automation is going to be

726
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,809
the answer that's not to say we're all

727
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:51,059
going to become turning up in a box plug

728
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:53,519
it in and there's your answer what that

729
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:55,470
is to say is taking each one of us in

730
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,330
this room and giving us a 10times force

731
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,039
multiplier getting us to be able to do

732
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,730
more without so much hassle up from so

733
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,440
automation is about taking an awful lot

734
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,509
that low-hanging fruit it's about making

735
00:27:06,509 --> 00:27:09,080
decisions and having actions happen

736
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,549
without necessarily a human in the loop

737
00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:14,039
or maybe with a human in a small part of

738
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,570
the loop rather than having to end to

739
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:20,789
end in terms of operational security in

740
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:22,470
terms of those roles I've got their

741
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,509
operators hunters responders resolvers

742
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:26,549
again I'm sure people have heard about

743
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:28,409
this before operators tend to be the

744
00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:30,269
guys in your SEM these are the guys

745
00:27:30,269 --> 00:27:32,490
where a computer goes red and we've got

746
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:35,220
an alarm ring the bell I'm probably

747
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,509
doing them a disservice at that point

748
00:27:36,509 --> 00:27:38,879
they under their validating your

749
00:27:38,879 --> 00:27:41,309
incident your hunters are the guys who

750
00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:42,629
are sitting there and don't particularly

751
00:27:42,629 --> 00:27:44,549
have a day job their job is to sit there

752
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:46,379
and go I'm bored

753
00:27:46,379 --> 00:27:48,059
I wonder what somebody's doing in our

754
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:50,159
Oracle estate right now and goes off and

755
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,809
has a hunt around and sees what they can

756
00:27:51,809 --> 00:27:53,909
find there the creatives are the guys

757
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:55,559
who using analytics to look for stuff we

758
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:56,970
don't know we need to look for they're

759
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,049
also the guys that you give you

760
00:27:58,049 --> 00:27:59,549
indicators from your partner

761
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:00,539
organization that's saying where they've

762
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:02,879
been popped using this this bit this

763
00:28:02,879 --> 00:28:05,399
file this approach this scan and it goes

764
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:06,269
wrong I'm gonna go see if we've been

765
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:07,230
popped with that and he has a hunt

766
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,580
around the business

767
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,630
they're different people they're

768
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,970
different skill sets interestingly the

769
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,770
the data platforms we're talking about

770
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:16,520
are probably enabling both of them

771
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,720
responders are the guys who are making

772
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,700
decisions so your hunters your operators

773
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,110
put the flag up and say we found

774
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,180
something it's definitely bad we

775
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,230
definitely need to do something about

776
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,510
this anyway I'm gonna go find something

777
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:30,000
else you responders are those guys that

778
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,440
get called at 5 o'clock on a Friday to

779
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,380
have to go and fix it they're making

780
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,450
decisions they're acting but they need

781
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,250
to understand the context decisions once

782
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,590
they pick it up they've got to be able

783
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,240
to make multiple seizures they can't go

784
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,370
back to the operates and hunters and you

785
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:46,620
do find that you know the hunting team

786
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,480
and the responder team there will be

787
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,130
people that move between them according

788
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,550
to the day job but these are your

789
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,780
deciders but they are also specialists

790
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,390
in the field you resolvers tend not to

791
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,040
be a security specialist so this will be

792
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,570
your networks team this will be your

793
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,700
unix team your database team these are

794
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,050
the guys that you issue tickets to and

795
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,400
go for God's sake turn that off for

796
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,580
God's sake perhaps this and they are

797
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,140
they are not the guys that need to

798
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,790
understand what's going on it's worth

799
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,530
bearing in mind all three of those roles

800
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:15,690
I think have a direct security

801
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:18,390
responsibility have to have some role in

802
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:25,080
situational awareness now I'm spoken a

803
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,500
little bit about management security

804
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,790
management is on a slightly different

805
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:32,220
cycle yeah I'd like to say it's not

806
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,420
adversarial that's not always the case

807
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,800
but in theory you've not got someone

808
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,240
trying to beat you at security

809
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,800
management generally you just got

810
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,500
someone trying to beat you and this is

811
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,150
much more the Deming cycle so

812
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,100
plan-do-check-act this is much more

813
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,840
about driving out efficiency this is

814
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,870
much more about just making things work

815
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:57,510
right so if anyone's ever been be stood

816
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,910
by 27001 plan-do-check-act will have

817
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:01,200
been beaten into you and the back of

818
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,690
that it doesn't explain what it's

819
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:05,790
talking about very well plan do check

820
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:09,030
act is a scientific approach to

821
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:13,230
management and it's effectively find out

822
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:15,900
what your problem is understand how you

823
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,240
might fix it make a plan up with what

824
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,850
you're going to do do it did it work if

825
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,340
it did work and

826
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,900
automate that can we standardize it can

827
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,700
we make it better can we improve it and

828
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,740
then go back around and do it again it's

829
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,559
effectively an experiment it's not

830
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,750
presented as such it's presented as

831
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,880
plan-do-check-act and that plan stage

832
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,289
you know exactly what the outcomes going

833
00:30:36,289 --> 00:30:36,529
to be

834
00:30:36,529 --> 00:30:38,390
but effectively the original point of

835
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:39,590
the Deming cycle was you would go

836
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,970
through multiple iterations you'd be

837
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:45,140
very agile situational awareness is to

838
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,880
the same degree those capabilities are

839
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,980
needed in studying the situation

840
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,120
measuring success studying the results

841
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:55,250
and I think in automation in improving

842
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,600
standardized is gonna be an important

843
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:01,789
piece so I put a bit of context around

844
00:31:01,789 --> 00:31:04,490
why people are doing it and I'm leading

845
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,230
up to what I think people should be

846
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,620
doing next

847
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,610
so data-driven security management is

848
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:16,580
moving beyond can I see the bad guys can

849
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:20,149
I catch my apts can I stop my data leaks

850
00:31:20,149 --> 00:31:21,950
can I make some cool visualizations that

851
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,799
will allow me to talk at a conference

852
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:27,679
it's much more about actually making

853
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,440
decisions in your organization based on

854
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,779
what's working if your organization not

855
00:31:32,779 --> 00:31:35,480
cargo cult so the standards have helped

856
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,460
but invariably the standards that are

857
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,870
out there have either been written in a

858
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:41,929
bunker or in a bank and you might be

859
00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:43,909
working in the same sort of Bank or you

860
00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:45,380
might be working the same sort of bunker

861
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:49,070
but an awful lot of people don't and as

862
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,990
a result there's a lot of where this

863
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,429
works in a bank so it must work in my

864
00:31:52,429 --> 00:31:53,809
retail organization this works in a

865
00:31:53,809 --> 00:31:55,159
bunker so it must work in my

866
00:31:55,159 --> 00:31:57,890
manufacturing organization as cargo car

867
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,029
it's the same thing I see those guys

868
00:31:59,029 --> 00:32:00,260
they're doing it it looks good I'm going

869
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,309
to do something like what they're doing

870
00:32:01,309 --> 00:32:03,080
who knows if that's the right thing for

871
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,669
your organization who knows if actually

872
00:32:04,669 --> 00:32:05,779
you're performing a whole bunch of

873
00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:06,919
activities that are providing their

874
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:08,990
benefit back to you that's what we're

875
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,070
talking around in terms of data-driven

876
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:12,409
security management understanding if

877
00:32:12,409 --> 00:32:15,260
something actually works for you yeah

878
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,179
take best practice but then test it run

879
00:32:17,179 --> 00:32:21,020
it through the Deming cycle this is some

880
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,730
metrics and performance metrics is one

881
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:26,210
of the DARPA wicked problems which it

882
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,890
continually has no solution at this

883
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:30,610
point I think there's an opportunity

884
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,630
quantitative security management there

885
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:34,870
is an opportunity for us taking

886
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,540
data sets running these experiments to

887
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,390
actually start understanding what

888
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:42,280
metrics work and why they work I think

889
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,690
one of the key problems we've always had

890
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:44,920
is we've been trying to come up with

891
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,760
security metrics for an industry for a

892
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,500
for the world and actually what you

893
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,910
probably need to secure metrics that

894
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:55,300
work for your business so quantitative

895
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,950
data security it's a problem we've got

896
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:59,650
now chances are you're already using

897
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:02,800
Excel to do it Excel is the world's data

898
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,320
analysis platform it's great for

899
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,850
end-users who are not specialists

900
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:10,150
everything goes into it it's a very

901
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:12,880
quick and easy thing to build it's

902
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,920
impossible to do change control it's

903
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,910
terrible to test you know and it

904
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:21,160
obscures that the process by which gets

905
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,309
to the end result everyone uses Excel

906
00:33:24,309 --> 00:33:26,200
and we can do better

907
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,260
and this is where data science brings us

908
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,880
a workflow it brings a script above

909
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,110
workflow that breaks down these

910
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,679
capabilities and gives us a lot more

911
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:38,530
formalism and a lot more basically

912
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:40,000
ability to trust what the hell comes out

913
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,620
the other end if you're using Excel

914
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:45,580
really simply the our language

915
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,260
statistics language has a Finkle to data

916
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,630
frame the Python language has a library

917
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:53,290
called pandas the closure language has a

918
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:55,090
lot of recording cantor they will all

919
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:57,700
provide that matrix view that Excel

920
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,080
provides and allow you to apply

921
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,330
statistics and data analytics directly

922
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,850
to it you can lift most of them if

923
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:04,720
they've got something that will lift

924
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,490
directly from excel in and give you all

925
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:08,469
that functionality I thoroughly

926
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:11,168
recommend it if you're using Excel to

927
00:34:11,168 --> 00:34:13,899
generate all your graphs I bet they look

928
00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:17,168
lovely there's much better analytics

929
00:34:17,168 --> 00:34:19,060
tools out there click view I think is a

930
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,469
very popular one that I've tended to use

931
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:24,340
tableau again if you've got in CSV

932
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,449
format if you've got it in the Excel

933
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:26,679
format you're just throwing instance

934
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,780
into there and you do certain amount of

935
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,889
analytics but definitely the

936
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:33,250
visualization in those platforms so the

937
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,600
the nature of these quantitative

938
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,580
security management problems are mixed

939
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,500
data sources so I'm pulling in lots of

940
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,389
different tooling and pulling in lots of

941
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:44,168
different people's reports visualization

942
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:45,550
somehow I need to better go back and

943
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,210
tell people this is good bad

944
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,280
getting worse getting better should have

945
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,839
given me that money or maybe you

946
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:53,719
shouldn't it Germany has a set of

947
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,699
questions around the same topic so it's

948
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:58,160
not just I've got a question to answer

949
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,040
it's I've got a topic and I need to know

950
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,330
a number of different answers am i

951
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:06,200
performing is my karma controls working

952
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,300
are they performing well has my wrist

953
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,130
gone down have I spent too much money

954
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:11,780
that all these sorts things I need to

955
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,420
understand about the same area and

956
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,450
generally this is summary statistics so

957
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:19,670
anyone who is doing any form of security

958
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:24,670
consultancy who any point says you have

959
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:29,630
ten red risks versus 40 amber risks

960
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,880
you're doing very basic summary

961
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,740
statistics at any point you're saying

962
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:37,760
your median risk is this or your mean

963
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,230
risk is this your doing summary

964
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:41,000
statistics that's not big data analytics

965
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,250
it's kind of the bottom end of data

966
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,480
science but you know what you can

967
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,670
formalize that there's an awful lot you

968
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,170
can pick up and run with on that most

969
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:50,599
security consulting especially when

970
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:52,070
you're reporting out of the technical

971
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,540
layer into the management layer you're

972
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,520
doing some form of summary statistics if

973
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,630
you can understand what summary

974
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,400
statistics are and you understand what

975
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,260
the opportunities in there are you can

976
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,109
find a lot more value these sorts of

977
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:04,820
things trend analysis good posture /

978
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:07,070
interview operational KPIs control

979
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,410
performance all being done generally if

980
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:10,750
someone in your security teams got

981
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,950
honking great big Excel spreadsheet with

982
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:14,660
an enormous series of pivot tables in it

983
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,640
that's a really good opportunity to do

984
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,030
this so the first one that I've seen in

985
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,530
a number of customers that has been a

986
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:22,820
massive pain point of on ability

987
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,890
management you know you're pulling in

988
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,920
patch lists you're pulling in external

989
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,930
in notifications you're putting in your

990
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:32,119
vulnerability scanners you're pulling in

991
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:34,099
it internal tickets to see where they're

992
00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:36,470
at and you're producing probably on a

993
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:38,300
monthly basis if you're really good on a

994
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,400
fortnightly basis one of my biggest

995
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,500
problems and how am i performing against

996
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,520
it and I've seen senior senior security

997
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,230
management people spending two weeks of

998
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:50,599
the month churning data in Excel to

999
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:52,369
produce these reports of spreadsheets

1000
00:36:52,369 --> 00:36:54,290
that convince other bits of the business

1001
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:56,660
to do their jobs all that stuff becomes

1002
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,430
a lot faster and a lot easier when

1003
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,089
you've got a work

1004
00:36:59,089 --> 00:37:00,589
flown too fine and the series of scripts

1005
00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:03,289
you can maintain it's a clear candidate

1006
00:37:03,289 --> 00:37:04,940
for question for you today set put all

1007
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:07,219
this data in the spot pull it out in a

1008
00:37:07,219 --> 00:37:08,690
form that you can run sequel against

1009
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:09,859
then you've got a whole series of

1010
00:37:09,859 --> 00:37:11,059
business intelligence tools you can use

1011
00:37:11,059 --> 00:37:14,390
to query it executive dashboards same

1012
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:16,489
thing interestingly an awful lot of the

1013
00:37:16,489 --> 00:37:18,049
data going into that isn't going to come

1014
00:37:18,049 --> 00:37:19,460
out your technical estate a lot of that

1015
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,930
will come out of other reporting people

1016
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,759
do instant reports risk registers

1017
00:37:22,759 --> 00:37:24,079
project plans that sort of thing that

1018
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,059
data gets flows around all over the

1019
00:37:26,059 --> 00:37:29,420
place again you will generally have

1020
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,769
someone who spends a week a month in a

1021
00:37:30,769 --> 00:37:32,749
security management team reading all of

1022
00:37:32,749 --> 00:37:35,299
those maybe copying and pasting some

1023
00:37:35,299 --> 00:37:36,559
data in for another Excel spreadsheet or

1024
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:39,109
more likely tatry typing and starting

1025
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:41,390
again and then producing a one-page

1026
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:43,789
dashboard at the back of that that can

1027
00:37:43,789 --> 00:37:46,249
be better the other thing here is you

1028
00:37:46,249 --> 00:37:47,690
generally have multiple stakeholders so

1029
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:48,920
you might be saying I'm giving it to the

1030
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,559
board or to the exec team and you know

1031
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:54,619
the CTO the CIO the CFO all going to

1032
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:56,989
have different the senior risk officer

1033
00:37:56,989 --> 00:37:58,430
they're all going to have different

1034
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,380
questions they want to ask and won't

1035
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,239
have that dashboard tell them yes you're

1036
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:03,289
managing it I don't need to worry about

1037
00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:05,420
it that's a really good candidate for

1038
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,729
interactive visualization giving them

1039
00:38:07,729 --> 00:38:09,979
just enough tooling that they don't need

1040
00:38:09,979 --> 00:38:11,420
any training they can pull some sliders

1041
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,859
and pressing buttons and then get a

1042
00:38:12,859 --> 00:38:14,150
different view of the data depending on

1043
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:17,420
what they want from it and that's the

1044
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,069
application of visualization in the

1045
00:38:19,069 --> 00:38:20,839
application of analytics application

1046
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:22,640
today science it's not particularly big

1047
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,989
although there is a lot of variety in

1048
00:38:23,989 --> 00:38:28,910
there so then we've got some other

1049
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:32,359
opportunities that are are starting to

1050
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:34,789
appear they're not the early adoption

1051
00:38:34,789 --> 00:38:37,420
cases that people are doing right now

1052
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,400
one of these is risky staff behavior so

1053
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,219
right now our network behavior analytics

1054
00:38:43,219 --> 00:38:45,589
is saying what is the risk that this

1055
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:48,489
behavior I'm looking at is a bad guy and

1056
00:38:48,489 --> 00:38:51,229
it's scoring it and once you get above a

1057
00:38:51,229 --> 00:38:52,729
certain threshold somebody investigates

1058
00:38:52,729 --> 00:38:54,319
and tries to proven out and verifies

1059
00:38:54,319 --> 00:38:57,739
that's the case if I can see what that

1060
00:38:57,739 --> 00:38:59,150
bad guys doing in that work make sure

1061
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:01,609
what good guys doing on that one if I

1062
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:02,569
can see what good guys doing on the

1063
00:39:02,569 --> 00:39:05,690
network I can see how risky they're

1064
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:09,109
being so what I can do is rather than

1065
00:39:09,109 --> 00:39:11,220
necessarily fish them once a year

1066
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:14,520
I can watch their behavior with links

1067
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,319
and emails I can watch their surfing

1068
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:18,420
behavior I can watch their emailing

1069
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,310
content around to each other behavior

1070
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:22,410
and I can start putting risk scores to

1071
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:24,599
that they may be sending something which

1072
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:27,000
is not not marked not confidential in

1073
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,170
your organization to somebody else and

1074
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,190
they might do that on a fairly regular

1075
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:31,770
basis that that's might indicate that if

1076
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:32,790
they ended up with something that was

1077
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,140
confidential they might do that as well

1078
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,210
though there were a series of different

1079
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,650
behaviors that people will perform at

1080
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:39,210
different levels you run an awareness

1081
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,839
campaign you know did that work well you

1082
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:44,609
know our phishing campaign and next

1083
00:39:44,609 --> 00:39:45,660
years still caught someone with a

1084
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,950
corseted everyone gets caught by fishing

1085
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:50,010
at some point this this allows you to

1086
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:51,660
report back on trends it allows you see

1087
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,490
the effectiveness it also allows you to

1088
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:56,400
say actually the Hong Kong office are

1089
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,290
bloody terrible at this and we need to

1090
00:39:58,290 --> 00:39:59,609
go and do some targeted training on

1091
00:39:59,609 --> 00:40:01,140
those guys and put the wind up on the

1092
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:05,040
bit and get that sort of focus so it's

1093
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,170
this isn't looking for bad guys this

1094
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:08,609
isn't looking for malicious activity

1095
00:40:08,609 --> 00:40:10,650
this is looking for that accidental

1096
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,650
risky activity that people perform

1097
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:14,579
significant benefits to be had doing

1098
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,730
that automating into response we're

1099
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:19,380
starting to see products coming out for

1100
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:22,470
this which is interesting and this is

1101
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:24,240
saying when I've got that fresh hold

1102
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,180
that says above 80% I'm going to check

1103
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,910
and see if it's an instant and above 95

1104
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,859
percent I'll assume it's an instant or

1105
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:34,530
if it's in a particular network segment

1106
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:36,000
that holds high-value assets I'm going

1107
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,500
to assume it's instant and take action

1108
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,089
anyway and then worry about afterwards

1109
00:40:39,089 --> 00:40:42,329
you pre can your change controls I'm

1110
00:40:42,329 --> 00:40:43,859
going to change my firewall my routing

1111
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:45,569
I'm going to change my server configs I

1112
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:47,460
want to drop a whole bunch of things I

1113
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,810
think are vulnerable but aren't that

1114
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:52,200
critical and you pre can that and when

1115
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,609
you hit a certain threshold stuff

1116
00:40:53,609 --> 00:40:55,560
happens on your network significantly

1117
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,550
improves your response time

1118
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,470
significantly limits the extent of an

1119
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:01,170
attack I think this is undoubtedly the

1120
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:02,579
way to go to the same degree that

1121
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:04,890
everybody when IPS turned up said oh my

1122
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:05,849
god you're gonna get an array in the

1123
00:41:05,849 --> 00:41:07,430
business and we're all gonna get shot

1124
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:10,290
yeah this is gonna be risky it's

1125
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:12,210
probably at some point there's gonna be

1126
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,890
a tipping point between the riskiness of

1127
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:15,540
not doing it and the riskiness are doing

1128
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:19,470
it to the business the other thing here

1129
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:21,960
also though increased targeting

1130
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,670
monitoring so you've just sent the alert

1131
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,190
off to your

1132
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,990
your instant responder whose home

1133
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:28,400
embedded 2:00 in the morning he's gonna

1134
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,809
take an hour to get to the office

1135
00:41:29,809 --> 00:41:31,790
actually by the time he turns up why

1136
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:33,410
didn't you get an hour's worth of

1137
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,000
targeted monitoring at the endpoints

1138
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,040
that I've just triggered that alert so

1139
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,630
he turns up and he's got a lot more data

1140
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:41,690
than he would otherwise have had that's

1141
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:43,760
useful the other thing is you've

1142
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,260
identified something it looks like bad

1143
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,839
behavior push a button and immediately

1144
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,130
distributes that to all your other

1145
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:51,680
endpoints so you found that one egress

1146
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,109
point in Asia has been popped and

1147
00:41:54,109 --> 00:41:55,790
there's been a particular set of IP

1148
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:58,130
addresses or a particular set of attack

1149
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:01,190
types it automatically pushes that out

1150
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,450
to all your every Gress points and

1151
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:05,020
starts looking for the same data or

1152
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,520
actually looks for that data in your

1153
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,890
data like that's coming I think

1154
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:12,140
automated responses is in it's coming I

1155
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,819
think there are very interesting new

1156
00:42:13,819 --> 00:42:15,260
products turning up on the market for

1157
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,450
that that's big data security and it's

1158
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:21,859
opportunity on the horizon the future is

1159
00:42:21,859 --> 00:42:22,970
what I was talking about earlier

1160
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:26,869
this is experiments to identify if

1161
00:42:26,869 --> 00:42:29,900
something works for you so this isn't

1162
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,000
good practice or best practice this

1163
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,349
isn't do it because it's written down

1164
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:36,380
and the ISF for the iso or the

1165
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,970
government or anybody else tells you

1166
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:40,339
it's a good thing it's you do it and you

1167
00:42:40,339 --> 00:42:41,960
measure it and you do it in one place

1168
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,280
you don't do it in another place you

1169
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,440
come back and you say was that worth

1170
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,349
doing here's a great question does your

1171
00:42:48,349 --> 00:42:52,450
antivirus in a business unit in Asia

1172
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:55,970
provide you any benefit are you getting

1173
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:58,640
if you took that antivirus off would you

1174
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,890
have a higher increase of instance to

1175
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:02,000
worry about down there would you lose

1176
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,970
more data dangerous experiment to take

1177
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:07,339
but actually am i spending to deploy

1178
00:43:07,339 --> 00:43:09,410
multiple antivirus endpoints all across

1179
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:11,660
my business am I having a whole team who

1180
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:14,630
manages that for because everybody else

1181
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,099
does it's a good idea or actually do I

1182
00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:17,720
have other controls at all domesticating

1183
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,540
the risks I'd have these are the sorts

1184
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,859
of questions you want to start asking it

1185
00:43:21,859 --> 00:43:23,329
off it's about iterations it's about

1186
00:43:23,329 --> 00:43:25,430
doing the experiment did it work for us

1187
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:27,170
let's try that again do it again oh yeah

1188
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:28,430
it does work right let's automate it

1189
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:31,900
that's pushed out into the business now

1190
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,460
this I think is going to fundamentally

1191
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:36,410
change the nature of the chief security

1192
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:38,180
officer

1193
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,220
there are some skills you need to do for

1194
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,750
a hypothesis-driven security management

1195
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:43,940
you need to understand how to form a

1196
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:46,100
hypothesis that's actually quite a

1197
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,860
difficult thing in the first place you

1198
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,540
need to go and convince senior people to

1199
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,430
do something a bit risky to find out if

1200
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:55,700
you can be more effective and then you

1201
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,670
need to understand what it tells you and

1202
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:00,050
go and make a change happen to make it

1203
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:01,820
worthwhile doing in the first place now

1204
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:03,250
some of those data science skills

1205
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:06,290
understanding how to write the apophysis

1206
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:07,910
understanding what the outcome of it is

1207
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:10,010
actually doing the experiment probably

1208
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:12,110
are more data science e skills getting

1209
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:13,580
the air covered to do it making the

1210
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:17,210
change happen that's more seizing that's

1211
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:18,710
more security officer that's more

1212
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:20,390
talking to senior management and getting

1213
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:22,070
stakeholder by him

1214
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:24,140
however the cito can't do that and this

1215
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:25,580
he understands what the hell the data

1216
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,280
scientist is talking about and

1217
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,920
increasingly my view is Caesars will

1218
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,360
become data literate and if they won't

1219
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,370
that may be the end of a productive

1220
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:45,020
career in security management yeah so

1221
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,090
that's that's my future I I think this

1222
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:48,230
is where we're heading towards I think

1223
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:49,700
there's a serious benefit if we do it

1224
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,680
and I think this will fundamentally

1225
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:56,330
change a lot of security it won't any

1226
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:57,950
longer be a case of I measure my

1227
00:44:57,950 --> 00:44:59,750
security by the percentage of my IT

1228
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:02,270
budget it will actually be a case of I

1229
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:03,980
measure my security by the effectiveness

1230
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:06,620
of the activities I perform we've got a

1231
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,910
long way to go before we can do that yet

1232
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:12,560
so there are no silver bullets this

1233
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,570
stuff is not gonna solve any problems

1234
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:16,910
we're gonna have problems this stuff

1235
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:20,330
might should hopefully act as a force

1236
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:24,290
multiplier it should make us better we

1237
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:26,600
will still need people but we're also

1238
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,800
going to need alternation we're gonna

1239
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,150
need those people to be able to do more

1240
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:30,470
we're gonna need those people to

1241
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:34,280
understand how this analytics platform

1242
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,750
is working how these analytics what they

1243
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:38,300
do what they tell us and how useful they

1244
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:41,180
are right now we need to build open

1245
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:45,620
platforms the danger is we build we go

1246
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:47,540
and buy some vendor products in the next

1247
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:50,099
six months that is great a network

1248
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:53,299
analysis and harab or anything else and

1249
00:45:53,299 --> 00:45:56,009
suddenly do you have a stack for network

1250
00:45:56,009 --> 00:45:57,989
behavior analysis a stack for security

1251
00:45:57,989 --> 00:45:59,279
management and a separate stack

1252
00:45:59,279 --> 00:46:02,369
elsewhere for marketing you know go with

1253
00:46:02,369 --> 00:46:03,869
open platforms because I've always

1254
00:46:03,869 --> 00:46:05,609
you're going to get trapped and you need

1255
00:46:05,609 --> 00:46:06,660
to invest in these analytic skills

1256
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,579
they're not these people are not going

1257
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:10,739
to just appear in your business there is

1258
00:46:10,739 --> 00:46:13,049
not a pool around analytic and alysus

1259
00:46:13,049 --> 00:46:15,119
analysts sitting in the marketplace

1260
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,940
right now looking for work you know I've

1261
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,710
been to these conferences I've spoke to

1262
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,680
these guys they are even more highly

1263
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,960
sought after than we are and you know

1264
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,489
it's a great place to be in right now

1265
00:46:26,489 --> 00:46:28,319
security it's a better place to be in

1266
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:31,799
danger analytics if you don't invest in

1267
00:46:31,799 --> 00:46:35,009
those skills you won't get them so my

1268
00:46:35,009 --> 00:46:36,749
final statement here and I'm running

1269
00:46:36,749 --> 00:46:40,589
very short security is transforming from

1270
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,960
a subjective art to a data and

1271
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,599
automation discipline and that is

1272
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:48,619
probably my two to three year prediction

1273
00:46:48,619 --> 00:46:52,600
any questions thank you very much

1274
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:58,640
[Applause]
