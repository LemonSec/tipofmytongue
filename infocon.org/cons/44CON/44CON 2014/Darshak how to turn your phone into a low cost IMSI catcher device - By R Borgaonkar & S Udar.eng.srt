1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:03,030
so thanks for coming for the talk so we

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,460
have a topic here on how to turn your

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,160
phone into low-cost MC capture device so

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,599
basically the name is a little bit

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,519
confusion so we are not building an MC

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,190
catcher itself it's about how you could

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,590
detect MC catcher but today we will also

8
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,660
have something new exactly how you could

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,730
really turn this device into something

10
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,250
weird and we will try to show you how we

11
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,410
did with Samsung Galaxy s3 and what is

12
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,330
the possibility you could do more so

13
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,189
myself Ravishankar book how could I work

14
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,399
as a researcher in T Berlin since last

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,260
five years I am passionately curious

16
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,300
about mobile communication networks who

17
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,800
works on different security aspects and

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,530
he is a Sony ludar he works in all to a

19
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,559
university and he works as a master

20
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,210
student right now so we are college

21
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,739
friends from India actually and that's

22
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:50,190
what we hang out and work some new stuff

23
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,350
together so let's give you overview what

24
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,120
I'm going to talk about so how many guys

25
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,280
in black hat actually or how many guys

26
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,430
haven't seen this lights from black hat

27
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,949
okay not much so let's go so I will just

28
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:03,420
give you what exactly the unsolved

29
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,180
privacy issues with GSM and 3G

30
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,049
especially in cellular communication

31
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:08,700
network and what exactly we want to

32
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,560
focus here I mean that's what the

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,689
motivate me at least to build this tool

34
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:15,390
and what help this gives you and then we

35
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,820
build a - a privacy framework so why we

36
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,530
call this framework I will get you to

37
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,420
the point why it's needed to be like

38
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,369
build something like similar platform

39
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:25,920
and some of the use cases of this tool

40
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,170
like in daily use how could try to use

41
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,150
it and try to detect some weird

42
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,070
happenings in your cellular networks

43
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,920
maybe we don't know so like a weird

44
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,909
configuration or maybe something is bad

45
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:38,220
happening on the network side and then

46
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,380
future work that that's what we planning

47
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,240
with this tool where we want to take it

48
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,850
further so before going to the outline I

49
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,610
just wanted to see what is the problem

50
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,950
actually like we are seeing this fake

51
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,810
base station problem and how far we are

52
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,670
going in with this problem so there was

53
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,470
some from last year there are some

54
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,630
articles coming about that for the first

55
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,619
one Chinese cops have 1500 fake base

56
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:04,380
station spam raid there was also one

57
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,880
more actually the pseudo vegetation

58
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,669
hides the cars and run the street to

59
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,979
cover mobile phones send SMS floor so in

60
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,599
China there was some recent report

61
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,540
actually and

62
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,250
this was true because I also works in

63
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,349
academia so we review some papers and I

64
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:18,909
met some Chinese professor and he told

65
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:20,829
me yeah these reports were true so what

66
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:23,110
does happen in the night some car come

67
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,030
like outside of your building and

68
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,069
suddenly like middle of the night you

69
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:30,489
get some SMS hey your bank credit is low

70
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:32,500
or your bank seems to be hacked you

71
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,450
really want to check reply with this

72
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,129
with your credit card number or a pin

73
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:38,019
code or access code or something so this

74
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:39,940
is basically a spam SMS you getting no

75
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,260
no we're out of actually in the night

76
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,170
and some people just replied silent I

77
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,970
mean blindly and this could be your

78
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,500
credit card number or whatever it is so

79
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,450
there ways actually this is the new kind

80
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,370
of phishing attack with those fan base

81
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,659
stations because they are trying to

82
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:55,299
exploit the GSM weak links and these

83
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:56,769
boxes are getting pretty cheap nowadays

84
00:02:56,769 --> 00:02:59,560
so you can buy from China like a $1000

85
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,569
something or 1000 fine it atleast says I

86
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:03,159
mean yesterday we had to talk about

87
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,900
greedy base station so he talked us like

88
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,970
you can build yourself the same kind of

89
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,190
base station to send the SMS like he

90
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,079
yesterday has a demo like he can't prove

91
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:12,970
some SMS or something like that so this

92
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,530
was the one factor and this is we are

93
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,480
seeing in fact is happening so how do

94
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,190
you detect actually as a end user that

95
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,160
you are evicting of such kind of things

96
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,169
second is targeted attacks which we also

97
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,359
saw witness after I gave a talk in black

98
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:28,299
hat this time then immediately one

99
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:30,160
company said ok they also figure out

100
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,079
some fake base station United States and

101
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:35,139
they also gave a map like in which state

102
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:37,720
they figure out there are some fake base

103
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,199
stations

104
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,970
how many guys know this company called

105
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,190
GSM cage the German based company who

106
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,250
provides crypto phone yeah some guys

107
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,840
knows definitely so they claimed that

108
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,299
their clients discovered that these are

109
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:51,760
the fake base stations pretty good I

110
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,250
mean I mean and FCC also said that they

111
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,810
were 9 they're gonna investigate this

112
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,909
matter that how many fake base stations

113
00:03:57,909 --> 00:03:59,739
or maybe the illegal base stations

114
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,870
trying to intercept somebody's

115
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,419
communication so this is really ongoing

116
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:06,909
problem and that is not ongoing but we

117
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:08,590
might see in future something is problem

118
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,659
so how to tackle with this problem so

119
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:15,970
and what they claimed by all the media

120
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,430
some facts are true some facts are not

121
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,260
really true and that's what I want to

122
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,880
highlight or that's what has put into

123
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,800
this slide because with my son met

124
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,020
I try to show you that okay this might

125
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,730
be correct but this may be wrong

126
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,380
so they are not sure that this could be

127
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,850
a fake base stations because this is

128
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,620
pretty challenging task and we don't

129
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,480
know how skillful them see catchers are

130
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,970
actually nowadays exam in considering

131
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,380
the existing MC catchers I mean how

132
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,600
skillful they are how smart they are to

133
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,430
take some surroundings we don't know but

134
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,190
of course prediction helps and the

135
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,260
solution so far which we have that as I

136
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,330
already said so this is at least going

137
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,550
viral in the media so this is their tool

138
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,320
actually this is a firebase band

139
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,060
firewall which tried to tell you that

140
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,250
okay your mobile network standard

141
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,350
encryption has been turned off possibly

142
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,270
this could be a MC catcher or fake base

143
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,030
station right yeah that's their one

144
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,710
method of killing that okay you might be

145
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,780
under some interception maybe some FBI

146
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,810
or maybe any bad agency is trying to

147
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,640
intercept you and this is our tool

148
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,310
actually and if I follow their method if

149
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,650
you see these red dots and actually

150
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,570
those are the encryption so how many

151
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,139
calls I made it tells me that some of my

152
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:26,900
calls completely without having any

153
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,490
encryption there is completely plain

154
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,910
text over there and actually with this

155
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,550
concept I can say that most of ours also

156
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,080
on a fake base station but this is not

157
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,760
true

158
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,430
because this has a various technical

159
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,530
reasons why this is happening in the in

160
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,960
the real time and actually also I tested

161
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,000
last two days I was testing my tool so

162
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,940
here in this same place of course we did

163
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,320
not find any red dot but there were

164
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,870
plenty of weird behavior and of course

165
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,100
this is due to the load on the tower

166
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,200
will go so far so this is the solution

167
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,760
we have this one is free of course this

168
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,940
cost you to buy a special phone so let's

169
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,680
let's talk about what exactly the

170
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,690
problem I mean with this mobile space

171
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,820
why we are not able to detect this such

172
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,310
kind of attacks or or tools

173
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,039
everybody has smartphone I mean Android

174
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,620
you have a blackberry or maybe in any

175
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,419
other operating system right so

176
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,100
everybody's trying to say you are secure

177
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,720
your data is secure nobody gonna

178
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,979
intercept up to you of course you can

179
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:23,360
argue with me that you have end-to-end

180
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,000
encryption and you are safe you believe

181
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,440
that there are only two way

182
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,970
communication between your devices and

183
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,320
nobody can either safe okay you are

184
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,240
pretty much secure then we have efforts

185
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,770
from all the researchers startup

186
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,479
companies who are selling a new secure

187
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,970
phone into an encryption or whatever

188
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,160
is then devices are also good

189
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,110
everybody's trying to say networks if

190
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,580
you go to any operators say that we have

191
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,890
the best encryption standard I mean the

192
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,020
up-to-date encryption standard they are

193
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,910
using everybody's claim you can ask any

194
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,440
operator this is their the they are

195
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,120
trying their best to provide security

196
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,300
level to their customers but still when

197
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,680
you have a started attack so what

198
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,350
happens and some of the CEO is also

199
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,850
trying to say that okay when you have a

200
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,190
targeted attacks how do you detect and

201
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,320
this is the problem because attacks

202
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,270
happen your your conversation got

203
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,180
recorded and you don't have any trace so

204
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,370
how do you do that so one way they try

205
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,640
to do this such attacks is AMC catchers

206
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,340
first of all or who try to do I mean who

207
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,290
try to do these attacks these are the

208
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,450
legal entities or illegal entities I'm

209
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,310
not talking about lawful interception

210
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,010
here so I think I hope you guys know

211
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,740
lawful interception every country has a

212
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,230
law that for some time of period at

213
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,420
least one year or six month you're all

214
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,050
calls SMS are legally recorded this is

215
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,520
this goes by law I don't know exactly

216
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,400
what the law is law in UK but I live in

217
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,260
Germany so Germany has six to one one

218
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,300
year like a variant also I was living in

219
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,740
Nordic countries so they also have a law

220
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,200
it is they store for six month each and

221
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,970
every call is recorded so this is

222
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,700
different tasks they do for legal

223
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,280
purpose and illegal entities also do

224
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,290
that so how they do actually so that's

225
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,880
these the mechanism we're gonna see and

226
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,680
what are what are the methods are doing

227
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,660
whether they are they really compromised

228
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,419
your phone like pushing some Malchus

229
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:10,340
operating system update and just

230
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,080
compromised everything and sends back

231
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,210
data to their melchio server we don't

232
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,030
know I will just highlight what are the

233
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,040
ways trying to do that so let's see you

234
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,290
targeted attacks just to be wide what

235
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,660
exactly they do first is MC caches that

236
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,970
I hope everybody knows like you have

237
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,710
seen some Hollywood Hollywood movies the

238
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,960
color the black man comes and he has all

239
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,419
this fine equipment tools he say okay

240
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:35,000
this is the guy track him and let me

241
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,620
know what exactly is talking they just

242
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,539
press the button and you see what he is

243
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,280
talking right now sitting in the car so

244
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,650
these are the typical MC catchers there

245
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,080
are two methods at least in MC catches

246
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,720
one purpose is of course location to try

247
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,760
where this guy right now like if he

248
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,500
seems of

249
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,060
building right now or maybe whether he's

250
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,520
in this area that's one purpose second

251
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,740
purpose is real interception real time

252
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,630
they wanted to record your call it may

253
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,730
be a passive it may be active depending

254
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,770
on that and then there is also other

255
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,930
method some companies try to sell you

256
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,180
solutions so this is when you soil

257
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:11,320
company the Pegasus I'm bad at the I

258
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,270
mean pronunciation but this might one

259
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,580
Israeli company at least they claim so

260
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,080
of the documents which has been leaked

261
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,940
over the Internet they claim that they

262
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,670
they push some compromise update on your

263
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:25,930
phone which has been signed and properly

264
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,180
encrypted with the OTA keys and now who

265
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,400
give them OTA keys that is a real

266
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,430
question either they really do some

267
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:36,040
awesome research to find out what

268
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,870
exactly they can exploit to push the

269
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,880
firmware on you because legally only the

270
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,800
Android or maybe the Samsung is allowed

271
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,420
to push you the firmware right so I

272
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,950
don't know what exactly method they do

273
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,690
at least they claim that they're all the

274
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,940
tools to push these updates I mean what

275
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,680
I collect in document I have so this was

276
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,410
actually actually their catalog which

277
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,150
was released at least what this says

278
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,850
maybe sim toolkit they have and same

279
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,890
kind of mechanism we already saw an NSA

280
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,780
catalog which was released and the same

281
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,460
mechanism it was mentioned at least it

282
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,070
matches to be evidence this is possible

283
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,540
now how do you retake those kind of

284
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,520
attacks which are really happening

285
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,100
targeted attacks and one point nowadays

286
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,620
MC caches not only GSM they are also

287
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,470
supports 3G so this was from a gamma

288
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,820
company and they said okay they also

289
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,520
have a 3G GSM tactical interception they

290
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,410
even though they state 3G is try to

291
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,060
downgrade you but some are still

292
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,520
claiming that they have a 2g one also it

293
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,140
might be depending on femtocell and they

294
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:34,120
are true then normal question okay this

295
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,010
is about targeted attacks so you are you

296
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,660
are not the victim so you just travel

297
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,700
here and there but as a normal human

298
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,740
being at least I use mobile phone I want

299
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,420
to see whether my last call was really

300
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,210
in Cupid or not how do I see so there is

301
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,880
no method on your Android phone iOS I

302
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,190
mean Android phone or Apple phone or

303
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,660
even blackberry phone there is no tool

304
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,730
which you can see that whether the last

305
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,080
call was in Cupid of course if you are

306
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,060
using a sip provider or or you know that

307
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:01,060
you will call as always on Wi-Fi so they

308
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,800
might be secure but what about if if you

309
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,910
are using a cellular communicator

310
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,100
it's someone tracking you there are tons

311
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,400
of ways I mean some known ways someone

312
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,230
known ways to track you by sending some

313
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,240
silent SMS or maybe other mechanisms to

314
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,710
locate you whether you are in the city

315
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,570
or which country right now you're so I

316
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,550
mean anybody can do by sitting at a PC

317
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,290
right so how do you write to verified

318
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,390
somebody's really tracking me besides

319
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,980
legal entities or lawful interception

320
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,190
and how I try to know this is really hot

321
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,050
problem I mean how I know that I was a

322
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,850
victim of instigated attack that my

323
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:34,480
phone was compromised yeah and how do I

324
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,580
know that my mobile phone supports all

325
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,910
the up-to-date security standards

326
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,190
algorithms even my operator also so

327
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,360
there is no way to do that and that's

328
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,950
what actually I was trying to find out

329
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,990
as a researcher actually we were

330
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,970
building a tool okay how do I see there

331
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,740
are some fools actually old Blackberry

332
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,570
phones some old Nokia phone shows you

333
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,130
that whether your call was encrypted but

334
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,440
nowadays nobody shows you I do with this

335
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,390
smoke on phone or laptop but it's like

336
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,790
time consuming for me like I cannot take

337
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,800
my laptop and I'll wait see ok I go to

338
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,600
London now let's see how the network is

339
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,250
encrypted or not something so this is

340
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,840
like time consuming I cannot do so I

341
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,760
just wanted to have some phone which can

342
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,260
I do myself so that was the kind of

343
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,940
motivation to build this framework for

344
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,920
me then we also had one more problem

345
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,500
with the 3gpp or the whole mobile

346
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,660
ecosystem so what the standard says the

347
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,380
3gpp the standard which try to build

348
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,640
protocol like every manufacturer should

349
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,100
follow and build their device by this

350
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,010
guideline and they say is this is a

351
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,800
document for every manufacturer phone

352
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,690
manufacturers says there has to be a

353
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,300
ciphering indicator and this has to be a

354
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,400
mandatory or optional of course star it

355
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,050
means depending on some cases but this

356
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,630
is a mandatory feature every smartphone

357
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,640
which has been stalled by Samsung Apple

358
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,040
has to have this feature that's what the

359
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,530
standard says it used to follow all

360
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:53,260
times by Nokia by all Blackberry phones

361
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,170
old Sony Ericsson phone early days on

362
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,630
GSM you used to see like such kind of

363
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,460
message before you make a call nowadays

364
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,920
you don't see you see this kind of

365
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,230
message now on GSM K phone which has

366
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:09,520
been sold around $3500 pretty expensive

367
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,260
so you have this kind of issue but not

368
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,820
on every phone actually this has to be

369
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,950
supported by every phone then there is a

370
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,600
no API for

371
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,250
Google for this one so this was the

372
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,240
indicator and this was the issue

373
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,250
actually but after the black had talked

374
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,410
the Google gals contacted me here we are

375
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,210
a bit interested we you would you like

376
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,790
to share some result with us so I want

377
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,920
to work with us and now the one guy from

378
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,230
Niels from Google he commented on this

379
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,020
issue two weeks back ok we are ready to

380
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,330
build this API anybody wants to help us

381
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,040
so if you go on this link actually you

382
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,420
will see that they are interested now to

383
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,250
put something but they said that this

384
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,990
will not be enabled by default on

385
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,390
Android stream so user has to manually

386
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,520
do something to activate it there is a

387
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,140
reason for that because operator doesn't

388
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,670
like to see such kind of thing that

389
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,530
their interlock is not secure so there

390
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,030
is some politics kind of going on and

391
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,730
the best method actually whatever the

392
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,800
question I asked you I are there you are

393
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,720
a victim of mck sure or not how do you

394
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,910
really find out there is really Golden

395
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,670
Rule to find out this one and this is I

396
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,070
mean some smart people old generation

397
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,840
people still use it that is the prepaid

398
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,590
SIM card I give example if I'm a guy

399
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:17,380
actually who is under them see who is

400
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,950
under the MC catcher attack what happens

401
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,350
I mean they try to intercept me right it

402
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:26,410
means that my call is not going to the

403
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,240
DL network is going on a fake Network

404
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,220
and they are allowing me to talk free

405
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,680
because it's not a real Network so if

406
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,360
you have a prepaid SIM card have a

407
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,820
5-pound balance on your you made a call

408
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,190
and your last call was free you did not

409
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,630
get the message that your balance

410
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,790
remaining 3 it certainly means that

411
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,340
something is going wrong easy thing but

412
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,840
nowadays everybody has a flat rate

413
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,550
everybody has a data flat rate you

414
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,470
cannot really see what's happening with

415
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,200
your network bill that's the simple way

416
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,420
at least people say to find out whether

417
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,120
you are secure or not so that's what we

418
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,000
try to build then to figure out with

419
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,860
this - a framework so our goal was to

420
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,480
make research platform to collect the

421
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,060
GSM and 3G Secretariat data so anybody

422
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,960
has having this phone can use it you

423
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,430
don't need do anything just make normal

424
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,410
calls SMS it just collect some security

425
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,870
parameters you can upload data to our

426
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,490
server and we're gonna release all the

427
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,920
data to all the research community so we

428
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,840
also have one similar kind of tool which

429
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,560
is the GSM map from SR labs in Berlin

430
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,090
but actually they don't release any data

431
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,950
and data is really vital for is

432
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:32,800
at least in mobile space and now our

433
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,269
goal is to release this data by

434
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:36,730
collected all the user and second is

435
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,370
easy to use for everybody so you don't

436
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,779
see anything this is always run in the

437
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:42,519
background so now something will just

438
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:43,839
introduce you what exactly this

439
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,370
leadership framework and what features

440
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:50,050
we provide enough with the problems now

441
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,360
we'll see what solutions we can provide

442
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,430
to counter all these problems well to

443
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,720
counter all these problems would be a

444
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,810
very big statement we will try to just

445
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,970
find out the very basic things that at

446
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,320
least the user will avail of what's

447
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,540
going on in the background and provide a

448
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,029
more transparency to the user from the

449
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:10,660
network mobile networks so this does and

450
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,120
it means actually in Indian language is

451
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,459
an indicator so in this case it means an

452
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:18,610
indicator of security parameters of a

453
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,279
mobile network operator those should

454
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,810
we'll there are so many limitations and

455
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,060
Android EAP as they don't provide API

456
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,920
select whether your call is encrypted or

457
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,529
not whether your operator is refreshing

458
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:31,899
your team's irregularly or not whether

459
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:33,730
they are authenticating your car every

460
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,949
calls or not which they have to do they

461
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:38,350
should do but all these these were the

462
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,970
limitations an Android based framework

463
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:46,029
so we before we try to get the raw logs

464
00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:47,680
from the base band so that base band

465
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,269
logs also all the transactions between

466
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:51,519
your base band and your mobile device

467
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,070
and this base band logs is all the

468
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,860
details of the details whatever the

469
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,839
communications happens between network

470
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:01,269
operator and your device so given this

471
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:04,750
in mind we we try to develop a framework

472
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,240
which actually does basic for things

473
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,880
like it detects like whatever the

474
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,799
suspicious activity happens in the

475
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:13,119
background whether your call is

476
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,189
encrypted or not and all those things if

477
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:17,169
it detects something suspicious it

478
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,630
notifies the user it doesn't do anything

479
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,579
on behalf of the user but it just tells

480
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:23,349
the user hey this is something bad

481
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:25,030
happening or it seems to be suspicious

482
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,549
and this does it intelligence like the

483
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:29,890
msi catcher devices there's so many

484
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,720
IMSI catcher devices books many

485
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,730
parameters from the mobile device like

486
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,799
your cell identity your location in your

487
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:37,419
code but there are n number of

488
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:39,840
parameters which they may not be

489
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,100
changing or they may not be spoofing as

490
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,480
the mobile network operator

491
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,880
so we can track those parameters and see

492
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,340
if there is some change in the parameter

493
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,590
from your mobile net user

494
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,450
mobile network operator and then we can

495
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,220
notify the user hey there's something

496
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,590
changed again and also another thing is

497
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,180
a collection of data because there's no

498
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,700
single source of data where you can find

499
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,200
the data from all the mobile network

500
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,510
operator you know in your country or all

501
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,170
over the world

502
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,000
so this doser frameworks can help you to

503
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,880
collect the data and share it with share

504
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,950
with everyone who is or want to analyze

505
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:14,050
on the data further they can do it and

506
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:17,380
we're making this data free and open to

507
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:17,950
everyone

508
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,990
so with this framework in mind we've

509
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,450
divided with implemented few features

510
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,510
this is like a GSM and 3G networks so

511
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,160
whenever you make a call receive a call

512
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,590
send or receive an SMS it actually

513
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:32,620
tracks the security parameters which

514
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,330
were exchanged between mobile device and

515
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,430
your base stations for that transactions

516
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:39,400
and from that data it tries to get like

517
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,840
if their authentication is done

518
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,980
encryption is done

519
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,020
what was your team C number for that

520
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,660
transactions and all those details it

521
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,420
actually also captures the silent SMS

522
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,650
and notifies user silent SMS as many of

523
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,510
you know silent ISM has a special kind

524
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,300
of SMS which are when received it

525
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,330
doesn't notifies the user but and no

526
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,100
other recipients mobile just rich it's

527
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,920
the SMS however it sends a delivery

528
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,350
message to the sender so that the sender

529
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,200
can spy on you at least or see the your

530
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,570
mobile is on or off or it can also be

531
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,330
used for your location tracking also and

532
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,960
the recipients will never know about it

533
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,970
it's an alert whenever the user is not

534
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,220
you know call is not encrypted and

535
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,740
displays all suspicious activities that

536
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,310
we will discuss

537
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:32,539
okay these are the few technical details

538
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:35,779
of the OSHA framework right now though

539
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:37,549
so framework can only run on only

540
00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:40,309
Samsung S 3 and s 2 devices the reason

541
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:41,869
is that the baseband logs that were

542
00:19:41,869 --> 00:19:44,149
collecting it's only possible right now

543
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:46,610
only for the Intel baseband devices so

544
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:47,990
we are not tested on on any other

545
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:51,830
devices and we are no way to get them

546
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,889
right now and the the doser frame was

547
00:19:54,889 --> 00:19:56,600
based on the ex Coleman concept ex

548
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,059
Coleman is a tool which which it can be

549
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:01,309
used which is really very great tool

550
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:03,320
actually it helps you to capture your

551
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,159
mobile device communications in a run

552
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:09,350
time but the limitation with the ex

553
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,360
Goldman is that you need a Wireshark to

554
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,299
decipher all the packets and you cannot

555
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:16,580
and to run device or give need some

556
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,950
laptop or some mobile and X of computers

557
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,059
and you cannot carry your laptop

558
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:22,220
everywhere to see the communication

559
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,490
what's happening so just and the

560
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,379
improvement over the X Goldman is that

561
00:20:27,379 --> 00:20:29,659
the GSM map application jeezum map

562
00:20:29,659 --> 00:20:31,549
applications is an Android applications

563
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:33,970
which collects the data from the user

564
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:36,619
its provides a means to make a call to

565
00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:38,480
some dummy number for fixed number and

566
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,850
then that fixed number makes or sense a

567
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,740
call to you and it collects the data and

568
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,470
the user has to census data to over the

569
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,119
network to tell servers that they

570
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:49,009
haven't made this data available to

571
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:50,450
everyone else but they have a

572
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,190
application or that they have a website

573
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,950
called gsm app dot org where they have a

574
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,559
map of a whole whole world and then they

575
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:59,299
have indicated like what is the security

576
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,490
level of mobile network operator in that

577
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,830
region but it's that the data they have

578
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,450
collected is not open to everyone right

579
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:08,690
now so with these two acts Coleman and

580
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,190
Jason map in mind so we thought that

581
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:14,019
takes the run time of X Goldman and the

582
00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:17,269
accessibility of gsm lab so will we

583
00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:18,710
build this framework called the hawk

584
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,330
which tells you the security

585
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,159
capabilities of your mobile network

586
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,960
operator at runtime so you don't have to

587
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,129
carry a Wireshark everywhere so whenever

588
00:21:28,129 --> 00:21:29,869
there's another thing is that whenever

589
00:21:29,869 --> 00:21:31,759
you receive a silent SMS it tells you

590
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:33,769
like who is the sender of who is this

591
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:36,060
sender so that's pretty

592
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,970
need actually it also classifies what

593
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:41,100
kind of encryption algorithm is used in

594
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,770
while in your car like if I won a five

595
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,440
to a five three in case of GSM and UAE

596
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,940
won in case of UMTS or a 3G it also

597
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,980
tracks your TMS ID number in every

598
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,610
transaction so you can verify how TMS ID

599
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,530
number is changing because TMS ayah

600
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,570
number has to be changed regularly so

601
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,660
that no one can eavesdrop your call or

602
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,930
no one can track your location so so and

603
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,610
the network operator does not do it very

604
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:11,610
regularly so but as an end user you can

605
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:14,220
try it like how how frequently your TMS

606
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,380
is getting changed in case of an

607
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,210
authentication whenever a mobile network

608
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,310
operator does an authentication in case

609
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:23,760
of an G it sends you an R and the random

610
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,020
number and then you which you have to

611
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,420
encrypt with your secret key and then

612
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,670
sends over the network to down to the

613
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:30,750
mobile network operator and then the

614
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,940
verifies if the right user or not which

615
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,010
has to be done for every transaction but

616
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:37,860
mobile network operator never they do it

617
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,100
but they don't do it regularly you t

618
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,590
need at the same aut n is an

619
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,480
authentication token they use for in

620
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,530
case of an UMTS okay how to get an

621
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,030
application so we already release the

622
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,290
source code of another circuit

623
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:54,780
applications on github you know under a

624
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,240
GPL license so you can go modified fork

625
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:02,310
it and change it the rack application is

626
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,760
also released in Google App Store also

627
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,400
and which is of course free of cost so

628
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,510
you can download and give it a try okay

629
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:14,220
this is the how the application works in

630
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,860
the background well in applications

631
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,410
every 30 seconds the applications goes

632
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:21,570
in the background and guess the baseband

633
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:23,910
logs and once they get a baseband logs

634
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:26,940
it it scans for the silent SMS paging

635
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,130
request and system information request

636
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:32,490
in that baseband locks regularly every

637
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,740
30 seconds and whenever you make a call

638
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,710
or when you receive a call it acts as a

639
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:40,110
radio even and then it also looks for if

640
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,300
there is an authentication packet is

641
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,460
there if there is a TMC relocation

642
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,799
request is there and

643
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:49,850
and similar things related to your radio

644
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:54,890
transaction okay we will cover the Jason

645
00:23:54,890 --> 00:24:03,260
banks so this was about how exactly but

646
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,080
now to interpret or analyze this data so

647
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,240
we need to know more exactly how the GSM

648
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,130
behaves or 3G behaviors what is

649
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,809
suspicious what is not suspicious

650
00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:13,700
so this is really important like when

651
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,710
his previous slides he says it shows Tim

652
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:18,500
C so what exactly this Tim C means what

653
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,570
is needed to be updated every time and

654
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:24,140
why so in GSM we know some problems so I

655
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,789
mean I just don't want to explain in two

656
00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:27,620
detail I just try to make it in simple

657
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,210
word so we know everybody in those base

658
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,679
stations we see in every building and

659
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:32,120
every part right and then we have a

660
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,309
mobile phone this could be any phone so

661
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:36,409
this phone has a SIM card and SIM card

662
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:38,299
has one unique number when you buy from

663
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:40,880
a store it's called IMSI which is called

664
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,919
MC that's what exactly the first order

665
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:45,140
stands in MC caches this is about your

666
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,240
unique identity in a SIM card which bind

667
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,909
to your identity with your passport

668
00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:51,440
number social security number or

669
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,260
whatever it is and this elevates sent

670
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,450
first time when you connect your phone

671
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:59,419
to the network and since this is really

672
00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:02,450
important identity the network operator

673
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,520
I mean the design has been in this

674
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,620
fashion that once you authenticate they

675
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,929
will always use this Tim C number for

676
00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:10,970
subsequent calls or something so that

677
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,919
nobody can trace you that whether this

678
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:14,929
is the same guy who is making a call and

679
00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:17,630
that's why this Tim see Elvis has to

680
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,940
change after 2 or 3 calls or depending

681
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,279
on which location area you are going so

682
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:24,020
maybe from Western London to East London

683
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,909
you are going your team C has to change

684
00:25:25,909 --> 00:25:27,919
if you don't change anybody can trace

685
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,720
you if he knows your team C number at

686
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,669
least try to locate you so that's what's

687
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:33,409
important but that's what's the thing

688
00:25:33,409 --> 00:25:35,179
actually but now what are the problems

689
00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:36,830
we know in GSM so yesterday we had to

690
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,510
talk about DD base station so he tried

691
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,549
to he implemented everything he showed

692
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:42,559
everything but why this was possible he

693
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,390
was able to do that he why he was able

694
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:47,000
to intercept iPhones coli or data

695
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,950
connections first we know that there is

696
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,960
no mutual authentication between GSM and

697
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,750
between the tower and your mobile phone

698
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,490
so your mobile phone is always

699
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:58,039
authenticated but mobile phone doesn't

700
00:25:58,039 --> 00:25:58,870
have any

701
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,640
ability to authenticate whether this is

702
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,140
the right base stations or wrong base

703
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,059
station so this flow is classically we

704
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:06,610
know this is from last 20 years not has

705
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,110
been fixed it's difficult to fix because

706
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,300
we cannot update all these things this

707
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,120
that's why we see the tax fake business

708
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,070
tag attacks or man in the middle attack

709
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,870
like same attacks yesterday or Dempsey

710
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,490
catches work in the same month then we

711
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:20,559
have a week algorithms some there are

712
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,270
some conspiracy theory that they thought

713
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:25,450
they were designed to be weak actually

714
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,340
we don't know but there were plenty of

715
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,920
recent articles came actually saying

716
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,090
that they were designed to be

717
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,460
intercepted we don't know but if I to

718
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,380
was broken mathematically it was so it

719
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,420
was really weak actually if I one was

720
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,640
also weak the cryptographers really

721
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,440
showed that theoretical it's possible to

722
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,720
break but now in last five years we have

723
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,240
a really advantageous I mean we really

724
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,780
have a speed up the process to break fi

725
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,480
one passively so some guys I mean the SR

726
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,130
labs also ready is a rainbow table so we

727
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:56,020
can really do keep tape if I when calls

728
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,870
passively also NSA catalog shows you

729
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:00,580
that they have the capability to decrypt

730
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,740
if I want you can also go on a google

731
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,290
just catch MC catcher if I want

732
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,300
capability you will see many companies

733
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,040
who are sailing if I want how to

734
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,470
decipher deciphered a Phi one so you can

735
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,960
buy those devices nowadays wait to do is

736
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,070
if I when encryption so this is due to

737
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,410
this week algorithms then the main

738
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,000
problem with this whole mobile

739
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,520
communication this also happens with LTE

740
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,730
also 3g and also gsm the base station

741
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,860
has a fully capability to tell your

742
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,410
phone what to do or what not to do your

743
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:35,230
phone cannot decide anything if base

744
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,360
station says don't use encryption don't

745
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,610
do a sent occasion it just act as it is

746
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:40,960
you don't have any capital material

747
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,390
things so full power you have to blindly

748
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,950
trust the base station that is the main

749
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,690
problem in whole communication

750
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:48,700
architecture and in i mean any

751
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,740
communication technology 3g 2g on LTE

752
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,540
and that's what people are trying to

753
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,550
argue I can do the reason why this was

754
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:57,309
actually because when the guys in France

755
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:59,679
they decided to design this technology

756
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,110
gsm 3g i mean 20 years back

757
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:04,540
they thought the active attackers are

758
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:07,150
not gonna possible they never considered

759
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,950
threat model as active attacker while

760
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:11,320
designing the system because they

761
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,610
thought nobody gonna have this

762
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,440
ments to catch or intercept something

763
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,390
but now this is happening and now it's

764
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,920
difficult to fix all these things

765
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,840
because every technology has a backward

766
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,400
compatibility so you have a legacy

767
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,799
systems legacy system so it's difficult

768
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:25,780
to fix so this problem is going to occur

769
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,000
even for LT you know I mean might be of

770
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,290
course you cannot have a fake business

771
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,870
track attack but this this kind of issue

772
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:35,440
is it will be there then we have a plain

773
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,970
text over there of course if you don't

774
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:39,190
use proper encryption algorithm you can

775
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:41,200
have a MC and TMZ captured easily this

776
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,360
always happens you can anytime if you

777
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,960
have a any RF tool actually to intercept

778
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,730
communication try it decode with the

779
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,559
Wireshark you will see plenty of MC and

780
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,000
timsy numbers but you cannot recognize

781
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,010
which belongs to whom but this is always

782
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,929
in the over actually in the air then

783
00:28:55,929 --> 00:28:57,520
there is an authentication for IMEI

784
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,110
yesterday also the greedy base station

785
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,340
guy also told you like there is no

786
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,740
integration and you can easily see and

787
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,830
prove those numbers and lastly local

788
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:08,710
regulations nobody tried to force that

789
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:11,380
everybody knows GSM so why don't upgrade

790
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:14,380
like why don't they upgrade the

791
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,820
algorithms I mean they are still using

792
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,710
weak algorithms I will show you some of

793
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,330
the data I collected in last two days

794
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:20,950
while while staying here actually about

795
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,570
you key operators and you will see what

796
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,190
is really difference between what

797
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,960
exactly available in Germany what

798
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,640
exactly I believe it in US and what is

799
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,200
available here and why they did not

800
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,179
upgrade their systems so this is also

801
00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:32,799
problem about local regulations why the

802
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,780
government is not forcing to use the

803
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,240
standard algorithms right so GSM is

804
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,280
badly broken laws as yesterday said we

805
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,160
also saw real demo 'try only one point

806
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,890
is important actually for me to say

807
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,940
authentication and that's what our tool

808
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,160
is try to do actually because mobile

809
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,710
originated call and mobile terminated

810
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,480
call there are two technologies what

811
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,669
does it mean mobile oriented means when

812
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:57,370
you make a call and mobile terminated

813
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:59,350
when you receive a call and there is

814
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,090
really difference exactly how these two

815
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,710
calls are behave for authentication

816
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:06,040
encryption so and mobile originated

817
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,169
calls are always authenticated why

818
00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:10,000
because the telecommunication companies

819
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,790
wants to see really you are paying for

820
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:15,160
money or not because they charge you for

821
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,809
every call right so they have to see

822
00:30:16,809 --> 00:30:18,190
that whether you have a balance to make

823
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,350
a call but when you receive a call those

824
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:23,350
calls are free for you right so there is

825
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,660
no way I mean for them there is a way

826
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,980
there is a really good option not to

827
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,860
authenticate in all times 15 years back

828
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,990
when there was charged for income in

829
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,550
Carlisle so they were really

830
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,890
authenticating both calls so you see

831
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,540
business change now you have incoming

832
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,370
free now you don't have also encryption

833
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,810
I mean say security settings for your

834
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:41,680
incoming calls

835
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,240
so incoming calls are easy to monitor

836
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,790
and easy to spoof your incoming SMS and

837
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:48,760
those attacks also shoe is shown so

838
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,680
let's see use kisses actually so I

839
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,030
talked a lot about what exactly the

840
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,070
problem but let's see what exactly how

841
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,200
the shock shows or try to identify those

842
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:04,320
parameters can I have this fool continue

843
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:14,230
you can show which is taken today thank

844
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:16,060
you no there you can see the date and

845
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,680
then the network time which is given

846
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,020
then the event is like you make the call

847
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,580
if you see the call when the

848
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,280
authentication is done during this time

849
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,540
it shows green so means the

850
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,280
authentication was performed for doing

851
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:33,540
this encryption well encryption is

852
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,190
orange color it means the north

853
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,230
indication was perform identification

854
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:42,610
was a 5-1 so as Ravi X and you explained

855
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:45,460
that if I one can be broken so it is an

856
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,400
encrypted call but it can be broken with

857
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,790
sophisticated devices

858
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:57,310
so I try to make my miss call to this

859
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,440
device and let's see they win event will

860
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,990
pop up exactly what my last call say the

861
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:06,790
settings were actually transaction that

862
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,080
you've seen in earlier screen you can

863
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,120
see like other features like whether

864
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,620
they if I when is available if I to

865
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,840
available on their mobile device what is

866
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,490
a team see number but was a random

867
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:19,260
number that use doing

868
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,600
so don't try to take my number I mean

869
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,770
otherwise you will spam me again

870
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,330
with

871
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:51,519
so it sometimes it just takes time

872
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:56,409
because the Android whenever it's asleep

873
00:32:56,409 --> 00:32:58,389
more actually it just sometimes it just

874
00:32:58,389 --> 00:33:00,999
missed the event actually and this was

875
00:33:00,999 --> 00:33:03,970
flaw we fix it but it still sometimes

876
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:08,309
it's difficult with an Android because

877
00:33:08,309 --> 00:33:11,230
classically we cover collect all the raw

878
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,179
log with a baseband and sometime it just

879
00:33:13,179 --> 00:33:14,769
with the permission of course it device

880
00:33:14,769 --> 00:33:16,840
needs to be routed and sometimes some

881
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,940
apps try to tweak in Turkey in between

882
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:24,669
actually okay so looks like it's not

883
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,499
working but I will continue with the

884
00:33:26,499 --> 00:33:31,989
second one so we clear the locks as I

885
00:33:31,989 --> 00:33:35,129
say it sometime it's just

886
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,530
because Abby's always on in the

887
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,240
background we just created a flag so

888
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,600
that so I just now received the app now

889
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,010
and I make one miss Cole

890
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,750
yeah

891
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,600
now they should be

892
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,510
Dogen

893
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:38,739
anyway so as usual so they move happens

894
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:40,750
like this but I will continue so he will

895
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,399
continue with the demo and I will just

896
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:43,889
go with the slides can we have slides

897
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:48,069
please ok so he will just check the file

898
00:34:48,069 --> 00:34:51,480
so what exactly does actually tries to

899
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,989
intercept out all the calls and show you

900
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:57,190
what's happening so if you see this

901
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,960
symbol so this means this was the

902
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,230
outgoing call which was not using any

903
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,190
authentication or there was no

904
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,900
encryption actually so it shows you rate

905
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,760
dot 2 and of course it doesn't alert you

906
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,800
it alerts you if the operator is using a

907
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,140
Phi 2 which is the algorithm every

908
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,400
operator should get rid of from the

909
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,050
network so it gives you a pop-up alert

910
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,940
ok somebody's using a PI 2 and this

911
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,740
looks pretty suspicious now or maybe

912
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,960
when this popups at least right now we

913
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,579
did not put any notification for you

914
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:23,980
like wait last call was not encrypted so

915
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,390
something was something was wrong

916
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,609
because there's a reason for that when

917
00:35:27,609 --> 00:35:29,500
when you are in a congested area when

918
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,150
the base station doesn't have that much

919
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:33,430
I mean it's have a lot of traffic you

920
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:35,589
just don't do any signaling traffic so

921
00:35:35,589 --> 00:35:37,750
it might be just miss configuration in

922
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,910
the base base station or some technical

923
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,829
beach in the base station this this is

924
00:35:41,829 --> 00:35:43,630
causing so I cannot be really sure

925
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,130
that's what we are just using as an

926
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,809
indicator we are not popping up a

927
00:35:46,809 --> 00:35:48,490
massive message saying that oh this

928
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:49,630
would look like a suspicious or

929
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:56,440
something please yeah so now we have the

930
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,450
event for the GSM last call which we

931
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:01,569
made as it said so it shows you exactly

932
00:36:01,569 --> 00:36:03,849
so network operators it was requesting

933
00:36:03,849 --> 00:36:06,040
to start cycling so I was using so this

934
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,299
phone is right now on over the phone

935
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:08,859
network and the water phone networks

936
00:36:08,859 --> 00:36:12,490
says start encryption it was using a 5-1

937
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:14,230
but technically this was actually

938
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:16,780
somebody can break if they can intercept

939
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:19,329
you are call passing yell so even

940
00:36:19,329 --> 00:36:21,220
activity else passively and it'll just

941
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,750
shows you what exactly the random number

942
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,849
used and I collect this random number

943
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,190
because some operators are really weird

944
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,740
actually these random numbers are

945
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,480
created based on the hardware based

946
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,190
token on every base station so there is

947
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,140
really proper hardware we generate those

948
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,240
random numbers so when I collect this

949
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,430
data for different operators like last

950
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,170
two or three years I collect data and

951
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:43,569
you really see weird pattern those are

952
00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:45,970
not really random numbers so this might

953
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,410
be a problem from operator side so

954
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:48,069
that's what we can

955
00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:49,539
these numbers also if somebody's really

956
00:36:49,539 --> 00:36:51,729
willing to submit the data so we can

957
00:36:51,729 --> 00:36:53,949
have a more numbers actually to show

958
00:36:53,949 --> 00:36:55,299
that whether this is these are not

959
00:36:55,299 --> 00:36:56,829
really random numbers because everybody

960
00:36:56,829 --> 00:37:00,160
do research on random numbers with you

961
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,630
know a Linux system or something but in

962
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,279
mobile communication nobody try to focus

963
00:37:03,279 --> 00:37:06,729
what's going wrong on something so this

964
00:37:06,729 --> 00:37:09,099
was the first call so we go with the

965
00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:12,160
second one but okay now we have about

966
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,219
detecting silent SMS so instead of can

967
00:37:15,219 --> 00:37:15,999
we have a slide please

968
00:37:15,999 --> 00:37:19,479
yeah so detecting silent SMS so you

969
00:37:19,479 --> 00:37:25,420
continue I try really with the demo type

970
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,459
of silent SMS are there like this type

971
00:37:27,459 --> 00:37:32,559
zero SMS and standard specifications

972
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:34,359
that whenever you receive an SMS use

973
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:36,130
your mobile suits under deliver a

974
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:38,680
message to the mobile network operator

975
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,739
and but in the case of a silent SMS the

976
00:37:41,739 --> 00:37:43,809
whenever the recipients receive so

977
00:37:43,809 --> 00:37:47,079
silent SMS the masses gets discarded and

978
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:49,599
there's no trace of the mess a landmass

979
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,209
SMS over its sensor delivery masses back

980
00:37:52,209 --> 00:37:55,420
to the sender yeah and it does not show

981
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:58,690
any notifications for the user and this

982
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:01,660
this this flaw has been exploited by

983
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,359
many police of police agencies and

984
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:06,430
mythical entities to track users and

985
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:08,469
also when you receive a silent smsed

986
00:38:08,469 --> 00:38:10,839
your look your current locations gets

987
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:12,910
updated on your base stations and that

988
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:15,309
scan granularly attack track your

989
00:38:15,309 --> 00:38:17,650
current location without even notifying

990
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:20,229
the recipient and there's a tool called

991
00:38:20,229 --> 00:38:21,959
hash system s tool which we used for

992
00:38:21,959 --> 00:38:26,049
during our testing phase Harsha zamesca

993
00:38:26,049 --> 00:38:28,449
from Isis means you can send three type

994
00:38:28,449 --> 00:38:30,009
of silent s and lies like pin three

995
00:38:30,009 --> 00:38:31,839
paying for and there's a type zero

996
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:34,509
silent SMS yeah thanks to Isis

997
00:38:34,509 --> 00:38:37,089
so this pin Crean ping for so if you go

998
00:38:37,089 --> 00:38:38,859
on next line now we have a definitely so

999
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:40,089
what is this ping three fing for

1000
00:38:40,089 --> 00:38:41,979
actually these are basically a type of

1001
00:38:41,979 --> 00:38:44,589
message your phone should discard this

1002
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:46,390
will this will these are the binary in

1003
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,339
SMS which will never go to your inbox

1004
00:38:48,339 --> 00:38:50,289
like you will never see notification

1005
00:38:50,289 --> 00:38:51,999
okay I received but these are like a

1006
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:54,309
binary SMS which comes to a SIM card for

1007
00:38:54,309 --> 00:38:56,319
example or any special multimedia

1008
00:38:56,319 --> 00:38:58,509
message which just comes and you never

1009
00:38:58,509 --> 00:39:00,910
see actually this happens by a new SIM

1010
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:01,430
card

1011
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,349
you into a simcard sometime on Android

1012
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:06,200
or iOS you get a message sim data

1013
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,690
refresh actually these are those kind of

1014
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:11,240
messages but you don't get those message

1015
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,410
like immediately but those are the

1016
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:14,359
message which also try to implant sim

1017
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:16,670
toolkit on your SIM card to collect some

1018
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,980
information so these are the two types

1019
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,109
we try to detect and when this type 0

1020
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:23,569
which is typically used by agencies to

1021
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:26,089
track you which is it has a PID 64 bit

1022
00:39:26,089 --> 00:39:28,550
number and this nobody detect anything I

1023
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,470
mean basically I send 10 message to this

1024
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:32,750
device it never get alerts screen never

1025
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:36,109
gets beep or anything it just background

1026
00:39:36,109 --> 00:39:38,150
happens and they know these guys right

1027
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:38,839
now in this area

1028
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:41,809
it just happens right away so we also

1029
00:39:41,809 --> 00:39:44,089
did take this one even so you see here

1030
00:39:44,089 --> 00:39:46,250
and we also show you the exactly who was

1031
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,130
the last sender number if you know some

1032
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,450
of the numbers actually you can really

1033
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:52,730
google and try to see which belongs to

1034
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,020
whom I mean of course you will not get

1035
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,819
any information but this is just helpful

1036
00:39:55,819 --> 00:39:59,000
for you so we'll have a demo for now

1037
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,160
silent SMS so we try to send type 0

1038
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,900
there was a problem with sending a type

1039
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,349
0 actually because right now we are

1040
00:40:06,349 --> 00:40:08,089
using a t-mobile I have a t-mobile SIM

1041
00:40:08,089 --> 00:40:09,530
card also have a what a phone SIM card

1042
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,960
but it's from Germany so and I try to

1043
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,030
send on a Vodafone actually here by

1044
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,650
local SIM card so yesterday we got two

1045
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:17,299
local SIM cards from here and actually

1046
00:40:17,299 --> 00:40:19,579
it turns out that the UK operator are

1047
00:40:19,579 --> 00:40:22,280
blocks those SMS for sending only for

1048
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,900
sending but they do allow to receive

1049
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,569
those SMS this happens depends on every

1050
00:40:26,569 --> 00:40:28,309
country so in Germany would have one do

1051
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:31,369
allow yeah what are for and t-mobile

1052
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:33,710
they do allow actually but t-mobile

1053
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:35,930
completely blocks so if I send you SMS

1054
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:38,150
type 0 kind of you will just get a blank

1055
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,940
SMS only blank SMS no takes for example

1056
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,220
something like that so now I will show

1057
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:46,220
you with type 0 and also with type 3

1058
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:49,660
ping 3 and ping 4

1059
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:55,160
so now this is just a phone as it's

1060
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:59,630
probably by try to send now ping three

1061
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:02,270
first because ping three will be just to

1062
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:06,460
show numbers

1063
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,640
full of mine

1064
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:29,700
from seven four seven six

1065
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:38,859
so I send one SMS to this why for now

1066
00:41:38,859 --> 00:41:42,190
which is a type three now let's see what

1067
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:45,700
did pop ups on a screen so this was the

1068
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,680
pop-up from whose SMS which also try to

1069
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,450
detects there was one more tool but this

1070
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:51,240
detects only ping three and ping four

1071
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:57,250
which gives you the same alert and as I

1072
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:01,740
say that type zero doesn't pop you I

1073
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:04,030
mean not allowed to send from my

1074
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,740
t-mobile SIM card to this one so what I

1075
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:10,270
try to do now I try to send myself the

1076
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:13,450
type zero one which is so this is my

1077
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:23,460
number four nine one seven four four two

1078
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:26,050
so I try to send myself the same number

1079
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:28,210
I will show you exactly I mean I don't

1080
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:29,650
have any other SIM card otherwise I have

1081
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:33,210
showed you from other phone actually and

1082
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:36,700
sometimes they do filter those message

1083
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,490
or maybe it gets blocked by the network

1084
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:40,990
or depending on the traffic is just a

1085
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:42,490
pipe line because these are kind of

1086
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:49,240
binary binary type of SMS yeah so you

1087
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,849
get two notification either one but one

1088
00:42:51,849 --> 00:42:53,950
was from which is the who Seamus

1089
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:57,550
actually was exactly from the tire type

1090
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:00,820
three messages sorry ping three and this

1091
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:04,300
one shows you alert like this some

1092
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,770
suspicious activity going on what do you

1093
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:07,330
want to enable the flight mode now

1094
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:09,130
because looks like suspicious so you

1095
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:11,230
click on that message you get the phone

1096
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:13,720
number also who sent you this SMS and

1097
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,930
what was the timeframe and the who

1098
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:19,359
Seamus it also detects but it doesn't

1099
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:22,210
detect the protocol identifier 64 bit as

1100
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:24,460
I said so it detects you with protocol

1101
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:27,190
identifier bit which is zero for the

1102
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:29,500
ping three messages but type zero which

1103
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,630
is used by legal entities is like 64

1104
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:33,640
there has to be a 64 there and it

1105
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,190
doesn't show you the phone number

1106
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:37,839
actually which comes but this is only

1107
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:39,430
for this one but not for type zero

1108
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:41,320
because there's a reason these are the

1109
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,000
messages are always comes into your

1110
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,890
baseband processor never comes to

1111
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:47,349
Android UI or Android process I mean

1112
00:43:47,349 --> 00:43:47,890
Android

1113
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:49,870
operating system so that is the

1114
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:53,260
difference for that one so it does you

1115
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,930
take that one also message now so this

1116
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:57,640
was about did actually detecting these

1117
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,980
two ones so this is one feature now and

1118
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:02,590
now can we have slides please

1119
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:05,800
yeah so we continued further with this

1120
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,620
tool now how we can enhance to retake MC

1121
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,180
caches because now these are the only

1122
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,440
two features okay

1123
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,570
the whatever the calls you made it just

1124
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:15,760
pop up your shows you details and now

1125
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,310
also silent SMS now to detect AMC

1126
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:20,230
catchers this is really trivial problem

1127
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,700
as I said it's not that easy

1128
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,190
seems to be easy by reading the recent

1129
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:26,500
media articles but not not so why I'm

1130
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,860
saying this this was a manual from one

1131
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:32,410
company so they claimed what exactly

1132
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:34,300
their tool doing a tool does actually

1133
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,760
so they says automatically scanning and

1134
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,130
detecting parameters of all 3G networks

1135
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:41,410
so before you deploy any MC catcher it

1136
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:43,600
scans whatever the network surrounding

1137
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,670
it has it just filtered out all the

1138
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:48,160
settings the require says she'll setting

1139
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,720
to set up like yesterday the greedy base

1140
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,460
station guys set up his network as a

1141
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,590
word of one or any in it worth he has to

1142
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:55,360
scan those frequency channels and all

1143
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,090
the details to do that right jamming 3g

1144
00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:00,610
selected networks in the working area so

1145
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:02,650
this was the 3G MC catcher so what it

1146
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:04,660
does it also has a jammer it jumps

1147
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,730
surrounding all three networks

1148
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:08,170
automatically your phone camps back on a

1149
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:10,900
GSM even though you turn it to the 3G of

1150
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,910
course if you fixed the more to 3G it

1151
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,620
never goes down but there has to be

1152
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:16,570
connectivity always so these pop ups for

1153
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:18,970
a GSM and then forcing handsets to

1154
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:20,410
migrate to GSM more and it makes

1155
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:22,330
possible interception of such phones by

1156
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:24,250
GSM semi active or passive interception

1157
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:26,140
systems so this is the manual from one

1158
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:30,070
leaked version I mean for this one so

1159
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:31,330
this might be I don't know I mean this

1160
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:32,860
is one of the feature at least they say

1161
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:35,140
don't go down getting attack but with a

1162
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:36,790
femtocell system it's not really

1163
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:39,070
possible if somebody has a femtocell BMC

1164
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,170
catcher which I had on my earlier slide

1165
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:43,720
this is like a tiny iPhone and surprise

1166
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,400
this is the company in UK actually which

1167
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,130
sells this same signature like a tiny

1168
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:49,810
like your iPhone size this is the only

1169
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:52,060
time smallest mck sure you can have with

1170
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:54,220
the femtocell systems which is called

1171
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:56,020
auto sale actually like you have a

1172
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,940
femtocell then this is the smallest

1173
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:00,040
femtocell which they created and they

1174
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:00,970
also built a long

1175
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:02,560
this point so this is actually works on

1176
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,050
a 3G network and if you have that when

1177
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:07,000
there's no way you can detect those kind

1178
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,099
of base station I mean there is a way

1179
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,599
but it's really difficult because they

1180
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:12,730
never force you to go on GSM they also

1181
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:16,150
track you with the 3G so you need to

1182
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:18,040
have a more data you need to find more

1183
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,930
parameters to differentiate whether it

1184
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:21,609
was a real base station or was was it

1185
00:46:21,609 --> 00:46:24,069
really fake base station so from last

1186
00:46:24,069 --> 00:46:26,680
one and a half year we were trying to

1187
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,329
collect different network operators so

1188
00:46:28,329 --> 00:46:29,740
whenever I'd go to any country I just

1189
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:32,680
record the traffic I analyze okay so

1190
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,300
this belongs to this network and one

1191
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,339
parameter was so whatever the difference

1192
00:46:36,339 --> 00:46:40,540
we saw so far this was one one field was

1193
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:43,960
saying MSC is release 99 onwards what is

1194
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,760
MST means this means mobile switching

1195
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,550
center what so what is mobile switching

1196
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:50,530
Center so every base station is

1197
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:54,069
connected to one server which is called

1198
00:46:54,069 --> 00:46:56,200
mobile switching Center for example in

1199
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,810
London for Vodafone there might be two

1200
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:01,089
or three base stations sorry mobile

1201
00:47:01,089 --> 00:47:02,859
switching center which are totally

1202
00:47:02,859 --> 00:47:04,420
controlling all the base station in the

1203
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:07,030
city might be three or four because city

1204
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:08,530
is pretty big right now so might be

1205
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:10,690
three actually and these are three

1206
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:12,790
connected to the classical PSTN system

1207
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:14,050
so when you make a phone call to

1208
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:15,700
landline anywhere so these are the

1209
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,160
places which interconnects you are all

1210
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,980
calls and these are running a software

1211
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:23,109
which has released version 19 and

1212
00:47:23,109 --> 00:47:25,599
onwards every operator has a different

1213
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:27,520
configurations every operator has a

1214
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,980
different software's by I mean somebody

1215
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,630
buy from Ericsson somebody buy from

1216
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:33,130
Nokia Siemens Networks somebody brought

1217
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:35,050
to Hawaii and every software has some

1218
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:37,060
parameters and this is the parameter I

1219
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:39,490
get from that MSC actually and if I get

1220
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:42,220
any MC catcher definitely he's using

1221
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,690
some open source software or maybe they

1222
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:45,490
build their own so definitely they have

1223
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:46,960
different versions running or with

1224
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,760
different parameters this was we find

1225
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,650
out actually but now if if there is a

1226
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:52,150
guy who is sitting there who built sim

1227
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:53,740
ck sure definitely will go and he will

1228
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,480
just modify those parameters that's what

1229
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,040
I said it's like a cat-and-mouse game

1230
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,690
somebody can change parameter easily

1231
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:00,099
something's dress there has to be a way

1232
00:48:00,099 --> 00:48:02,079
to do that then second one second one

1233
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,450
was PW RC and then there was one radio

1234
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:08,380
link timeout so as I go this one so as I

1235
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:10,300
already said MSC so shows the current

1236
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,190
DSN network version and what kind of

1237
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:13,420
software it was running I already

1238
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:14,380
explained

1239
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,330
our data actually with the telecom in

1240
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:19,180
German it was 99 onwards basically most

1241
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:21,460
of the resent up I mean big operators

1242
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:23,170
had same settings this was a play

1243
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:25,330
network from what sorry it was from

1244
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:28,240
Poland actually it was 98 or older

1245
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,270
same goes with opened now yesterday the

1246
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:33,640
guy was running up BD BTS actually so I

1247
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,650
asked him whether you really change any

1248
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:38,110
parameters well patching a form we're so

1249
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:40,240
open BTS if you just compile and run as

1250
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,030
it is it has this setting so anybody

1251
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:45,040
with any MC catcher he's just using the

1252
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,050
same stock code actually which is

1253
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:49,060
available in open BTS or open BSC so

1254
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,290
actually his parameter will be same

1255
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:53,440
nobody will care to change this one who

1256
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,030
knows but these are kind of parameters

1257
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:57,220
we try to detect and try to see there is

1258
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:59,080
a difference with that the second one as

1259
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,790
I already stated radio link timeout so

1260
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:03,150
this depends if your city is too dense

1261
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:05,800
like you have a many users camping on a

1262
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,690
base station it's good to have a less

1263
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:09,610
value so that you can serve you can

1264
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:11,380
serve more mobile phone there will be

1265
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:13,060
less call dropout so these are the

1266
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:14,860
settings every operator does depending

1267
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,750
on the area depending on the time and

1268
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:19,630
when we analyze those packets the

1269
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:21,820
telecom in Germany lives in Berlin they

1270
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:24,520
had a 64-bit Oh - same in Berlin has a

1271
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,310
24 word our phone in UK also has a 64

1272
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:28,600
play network 64

1273
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,790
this was the BSNL from India also this

1274
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:32,830
was idea which is operated in India has

1275
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:35,440
a 40 we collected more data but you see

1276
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,610
a difference actually with those

1277
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:38,650
parameters and this really varies

1278
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:40,750
between the city I mean I really cannot

1279
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:42,370
say based on this parameter whether this

1280
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:44,740
is the fake base station or whatever it

1281
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,690
is but this is just give try to give

1282
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:48,400
more intelligence what's really

1283
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,730
happening there last isn't about power

1284
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:53,620
control indicator this is about base

1285
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:56,170
station asks you whether you should

1286
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:58,120
provide the power measurements from your

1287
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,650
mobile device to the network what

1288
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:01,870
exactly the power it has right now what

1289
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:03,850
is the power measurement and also there

1290
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:05,710
is only true field two fields true or

1291
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:07,390
false but there is also we solve some

1292
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:09,430
variations some operator does it some

1293
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:11,650
operator doesn't so telecom in Germany

1294
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:14,230
what was false but now we did actually

1295
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:16,870
inverter phone here they have a true we

1296
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:17,680
don't know I mean these are just

1297
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,720
parameters they change or we found

1298
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,240
difference parameters now and based on

1299
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,740
those parameters we try to build a

1300
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:26,200
profile so how does it look like so what

1301
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,880
these tool does if you install this app

1302
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,210
back

1303
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:30,700
on your phone like two days you use this

1304
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,650
app you travel to your office and

1305
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:34,809
building it just creates records all

1306
00:50:34,809 --> 00:50:37,720
those meshes same in a database in two

1307
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,280
days it will just give you public

1308
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,170
message hey your location area change

1309
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:42,849
there is a new profile there is new

1310
00:50:42,849 --> 00:50:44,319
something it collects all this

1311
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:45,670
information has stored in the database

1312
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:49,270
and now if you go next day to Paris as

1313
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:53,079
soon as you land you turn on your mobile

1314
00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:54,849
it will immediately pop up hey doesn't

1315
00:50:54,849 --> 00:50:56,349
look like you are in London right I mean

1316
00:50:56,349 --> 00:50:57,760
of course the roaming parameter but it

1317
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:58,510
checks

1318
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:00,520
all these parameters again saying that

1319
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,319
okay there is a new profile for you now

1320
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:04,900
and now this is good if you don't move

1321
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,339
anywhere but you come to house and

1322
00:51:06,339 --> 00:51:08,109
immediately profile change last two days

1323
00:51:08,109 --> 00:51:09,609
you didn't get a notification and third

1324
00:51:09,609 --> 00:51:10,599
day you are getting certainty

1325
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:12,970
notification now okay something it

1326
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:15,160
change but you did not move at all from

1327
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:15,970
your house right

1328
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:17,530
so this is like kind of a suspicious

1329
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:19,960
indicator to try to give you maybe and

1330
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,210
this is just indication okay something

1331
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:23,980
is wrong just turn off your phone or use

1332
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:26,400
some other mechanism to make a call just

1333
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,770
something is like about some interesting

1334
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:31,809
data what we collected like last two

1335
00:51:31,809 --> 00:51:35,500
days I said for a demo I was trying some

1336
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,819
SIM cards yesterday so we bought some

1337
00:51:36,819 --> 00:51:38,829
SIM card and let's test out some MC

1338
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:41,140
caches sending a type-0 cell and SMS or

1339
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,059
something so this was last one is

1340
00:51:43,059 --> 00:51:45,579
Vodafone UK calls so we made a 10 calls

1341
00:51:45,579 --> 00:51:49,329
like few calls SMS 3G GSM and this is

1342
00:51:49,329 --> 00:51:50,980
Ali bar I UK of course this was the

1343
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,119
cheapest I could bought from a store

1344
00:51:52,119 --> 00:51:54,309
actually because I go and ask the other

1345
00:51:54,309 --> 00:51:55,900
SIM card they said you need identity and

1346
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:58,020
some of course it's expensive so

1347
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,040
surprising thing is that the liberator

1348
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,990
SIM card which most of the foreigners

1349
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:04,210
use while coming in London at least for

1350
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:06,760
a cheap calls the network is also

1351
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,280
provided by word of own both base both

1352
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,250
SIM card were operated by Vodafone so

1353
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:14,650
when I make a call you see here that all

1354
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:16,630
my calls were authenticated even the

1355
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:18,220
incoming and outgoing but when I was

1356
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:23,290
using a libera card 80% call were not

1357
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:24,970
authenticated even the incoming and not

1358
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:27,460
outgoing I don't know why it's

1359
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:29,410
differentiation so the preference goes

1360
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:30,880
for the real world of phone customers

1361
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,660
for the so libera means libera means

1362
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:36,730
virtual mobile operator there might be

1363
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:38,980
more actually in UK now if you used

1364
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,630
those operator actually their settings

1365
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:41,349
are not really

1366
00:52:41,349 --> 00:52:42,970
secure and there is a really clear

1367
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:45,970
differentiation by the real operator to

1368
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:48,009
give those services so if you really buy

1369
00:52:48,009 --> 00:52:49,989
any such kind of cheap SIM card or

1370
00:52:49,989 --> 00:52:52,150
probably I mean like for less services

1371
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:54,069
might be a real different security

1372
00:52:54,069 --> 00:52:56,049
settings I mean you could ask this

1373
00:52:56,049 --> 00:52:57,430
question to the operator why this is

1374
00:52:57,430 --> 00:52:59,319
happening I mean why you are treating

1375
00:52:59,319 --> 00:53:01,180
like this for the security of different

1376
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:04,119
customers right and if your incoming

1377
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:06,190
calls like this one is not as indicated

1378
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:07,690
what does it mean there was a recent

1379
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:09,960
attacks from our group there was a guy

1380
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,160
two guys Nick one came in the dealer

1381
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,799
says on GSM if your incoming call is not

1382
00:53:14,799 --> 00:53:17,049
authenticated actually especially GSM

1383
00:53:17,049 --> 00:53:20,140
not authenticated it means that with a

1384
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:21,849
modified Oh smoke um tool or some

1385
00:53:21,849 --> 00:53:24,279
special tools they can take your call

1386
00:53:24,279 --> 00:53:26,739
before you take the call because there

1387
00:53:26,739 --> 00:53:28,569
is no 10th occasion that where this is

1388
00:53:28,569 --> 00:53:30,880
the yoga and they did a demo I mean

1389
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,470
still the paper is available for you to

1390
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:34,869
read if you want they grabbed your SMS

1391
00:53:34,869 --> 00:53:37,479
before you so if you get SMS like a

1392
00:53:37,479 --> 00:53:40,359
banking SMS your M can is this one they

1393
00:53:40,359 --> 00:53:42,519
grab this SMS before you your mobile

1394
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:45,099
phone get this one this happens if your

1395
00:53:45,099 --> 00:53:46,329
operate is not doing proper

1396
00:53:46,329 --> 00:53:48,160
authentication for the incoming calls of

1397
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,869
course you cannot do for authenticate

1398
00:53:49,869 --> 00:53:51,609
for outgoing because the call was

1399
00:53:51,609 --> 00:53:52,569
authenticated and if you are

1400
00:53:52,569 --> 00:53:54,819
authenticated this is not possible and

1401
00:53:54,819 --> 00:53:56,680
this has been shown actually one time

1402
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,719
also outgoing call is not authenticated

1403
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:01,359
somebody can spoof you I like I have a

1404
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:03,609
special tool and I can put your MC

1405
00:54:03,609 --> 00:54:05,769
number Kim C number on my settings and I

1406
00:54:05,769 --> 00:54:07,989
can make a call on behalf of you staying

1407
00:54:07,989 --> 00:54:10,989
this was my team C and if this goes in a

1408
00:54:10,989 --> 00:54:13,269
code like you did some bad activity

1409
00:54:13,269 --> 00:54:15,249
lawful interception system says that

1410
00:54:15,249 --> 00:54:16,809
these teams he belongs to you and

1411
00:54:16,809 --> 00:54:18,849
actually by record you are the victim

1412
00:54:18,849 --> 00:54:20,589
but not this guy wasn't making a call on

1413
00:54:20,589 --> 00:54:22,089
behalf of you because caller was not

1414
00:54:22,089 --> 00:54:23,289
indeed it or not authenticated

1415
00:54:23,289 --> 00:54:26,920
technically this is possible I mean

1416
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,390
currently this is possible this has been

1417
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:30,400
shown in practice and this was the

1418
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,079
behavior we found and there was also one

1419
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,210
more result while I was coming here I

1420
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:35,799
was I came from Switzerland actually

1421
00:54:35,799 --> 00:54:37,660
right so I was on a train so I was

1422
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:39,130
trying to make a call so I was bored on

1423
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:40,930
a train I made plenty of calls and see

1424
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:43,089
okay what's happening now notice one

1425
00:54:43,089 --> 00:54:45,969
thing the red dot means a5 an algorithm

1426
00:54:45,969 --> 00:54:48,460
and this green means a 5/3 most of the

1427
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:49,839
European operators have updated their

1428
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:52,450
algorithm they are using a PI 3 which is

1429
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:53,920
actually so far we don't know any proof

1430
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,000
that it can be broken

1431
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,260
but in UK Vodafone t-mobile UK also key

1432
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:01,620
mobile Germany use a PI 3 but t-mobile

1433
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:05,170
UK use fi 1 we don't know same goes with

1434
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:06,970
the product 1 what often you guys use fi

1435
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,920
one year and in Germany some network

1436
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:11,320
they have updated to use a 5 3 I don't

1437
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,970
know why they are not updated all their

1438
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:14,230
up algorithms like this

1439
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:16,060
but this might be a question to ask all

1440
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:18,160
the guys and there was one thing

1441
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,200
actually one parameter you see one call

1442
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,510
was not encrypted actually what it was

1443
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:24,280
authenticated but it was not encrypted

1444
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,620
what syndication can be fake first the

1445
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:28,840
the fake base station can force you not

1446
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:31,210
to authenticate but this can happen now

1447
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:33,490
if I use this media like if you read the

1448
00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:35,440
article about this fake base station and

1449
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,270
they say you get a pop-up notification

1450
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:39,730
your call was not encrypted so it they

1451
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:41,950
might be fake activity but this is not

1452
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:44,410
true because I was in a train train was

1453
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:48,790
going some maybe 70 km/h or 80 km/h so I

1454
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:50,590
was changing a location area or base

1455
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:53,440
station like with a speed right so what

1456
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,480
happens sometimes your call messages get

1457
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:58,720
drop okay your messages with drop right

1458
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:02,020
and then actually you cannot you cannot

1459
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:03,580
have a proper setting so sometimes the

1460
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:05,260
best station decide ok don't use the

1461
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,850
encryption for this guy because he's I

1462
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:09,220
mean because his IDs his location is

1463
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:11,080
changing pretty frequently so this was

1464
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,670
actually problem from the network sites

1465
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:13,810
there was no MC catcher

1466
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:15,700
so actually you really cannot say with

1467
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:18,130
that message that ok this was the fake

1468
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:19,750
base station this is just to highlight

1469
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,730
you that some media people says ok this

1470
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:23,920
was the thing of course the GSM key guys

1471
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,540
do more than that actually definitely I

1472
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,070
agree but this is not the only indicator

1473
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:29,080
to tell you that whether you are a fake

1474
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,390
basis or not I think this is over time

1475
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:33,580
is up but there was one thing I just

1476
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:35,650
wanted to mention or we want to release

1477
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:37,180
a tool I just take few minutes actually

1478
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:40,360
there was just one demo we want to make

1479
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,460
and last blackhat I showed about this

1480
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:43,780
point and I never released this

1481
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:45,670
information because this might be

1482
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:46,380
suspicious

1483
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:49,810
what is it actually every phone what

1484
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:51,730
happens I just keep this slide so what

1485
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:52,990
happened if you see this base station

1486
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:55,030
and there are two guys instead of allies

1487
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:57,100
above I just use Angela Merkel and and

1488
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:00,790
Obama actually so for example Obama is

1489
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:02,890
calling Merkel right now so hey I want

1490
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:04,420
to talk to you so what happens when he

1491
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,599
calls him his calls get divergent

1492
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:09,630
here at to his mobile phone and what

1493
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:12,779
basestation does it page your device it

1494
00:57:12,779 --> 00:57:15,839
means it has to say hi and in GSM the

1495
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:18,299
method of saying hi is either send your

1496
00:57:18,299 --> 00:57:21,059
Timson number or the IMS ID number for

1497
00:57:21,059 --> 00:57:22,650
your SIM card to recognize whether you

1498
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:23,460
are in this area

1499
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:27,420
but while happening this these hi

1500
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:30,569
messages are always in the air if you

1501
00:57:30,569 --> 00:57:32,640
have a proper device you can catch those

1502
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,339
messages so third shock has a capability

1503
00:57:35,339 --> 00:57:37,229
to do that I mean at least this phone

1504
00:57:37,229 --> 00:57:40,410
allows me to do that so what our new app

1505
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:41,789
which we're not gonna release because it

1506
00:57:41,789 --> 00:57:44,460
has a bad purpose it also detects these

1507
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:47,069
two numbers this belongs to Obama this

1508
00:57:47,069 --> 00:57:48,630
belongs to Merkel and I can see those

1509
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:51,720
message two messages what does it mean

1510
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,369
actually or what I can do bad purpose

1511
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:57,989
with this one now as I said there is a

1512
00:57:57,989 --> 00:57:59,700
silent SMS so I just quickly show you

1513
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:05,130
the demo and I finished my talk so I

1514
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:08,180
quickly turn off

1515
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:25,770
I stopped there yeah

1516
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:33,359
it is top I open a new app it's called

1517
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:34,980
Tim seed machine because basically we

1518
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:37,020
try to look at some guy actually so what

1519
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:40,230
I do is a is begin just to initiate the

1520
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:42,780
thing it's collecting the state of oh I

1521
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:45,960
just waiting for one message exactly

1522
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,850
it's starting now so what I will do now

1523
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:49,590
instead of sending a cell and SMS

1524
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:51,030
because I said I don't have a capability

1525
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:52,560
to the sensor at SM is because I am on a

1526
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,600
border phone network I just give a few

1527
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,970
missed call to this number like five

1528
00:58:56,970 --> 00:59:01,260
calls for example okay now so because we

1529
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:02,880
don't have a time I just run the demo

1530
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,800
but if you want I can just use the mode

1531
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:09,140
proof how exactly we are doing that so

1532
00:59:10,609 --> 00:59:13,470
so that was the first call I just give

1533
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:15,119
you three calls and I just show you what

1534
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,170
exactly the raziel comes out

1535
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:29,730
yeah this was the first one this was the

1536
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:33,210
second one and actually we can do also

1537
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:34,530
with other phone but right now we don't

1538
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:36,210
have a setup or other SIM cards to do

1539
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:37,859
that so basically I call with the two

1540
00:59:37,859 --> 00:59:39,660
phones and this is the special phone

1541
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:41,849
which is try to detect this this can be

1542
00:59:41,849 --> 00:59:43,230
anywhere in the room actually the third

1543
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:45,270
phone so this was the second call so

1544
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:46,920
let's do only with the two calls and I

1545
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,299
will show you the result and what does

1546
00:59:48,299 --> 00:59:50,520
it means actually so I say is calculate

1547
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,849
team C so it process whatever the

1548
00:59:53,849 --> 00:59:55,559
packets you got from a different phones

1549
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:58,410
and try to see how many times I page one

1550
00:59:58,410 --> 00:59:59,760
single number so there has to be a

1551
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,030
frequencies of collection okay as usual

1552
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:05,099
it didn't work out but okay we are

1553
01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:06,510
running at the time so I will show you

1554
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:08,400
again so what exactly does it it

1555
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,500
collects all the team sees so I call

1556
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,140
this guy now two times so method is all

1557
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:15,089
the all the agencies use this method

1558
01:00:15,089 --> 01:00:17,339
there is a special device called string

1559
01:00:17,339 --> 01:00:19,559
array or something it is the identifier

1560
01:00:19,559 --> 01:00:22,170
for you so they sent utensil and SMS for

1561
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:24,210
this guy this guy never get notified

1562
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:26,790
that his track what happens the device

1563
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:28,589
is running in this some proximity area

1564
01:00:28,589 --> 01:00:30,839
it detects that your mobile phone number

1565
01:00:30,839 --> 01:00:33,420
page for 10 times so they will get in a

1566
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:36,000
pop-up as a screen ten times one Kim C

1567
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,309
number is you get a pop okay so this was

1568
01:00:38,309 --> 01:00:40,230
the right guy we were talking to him and

1569
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:42,349
this is in this way area right now and

1570
01:00:42,349 --> 01:00:44,609
we don't have the ability to tell you

1571
01:00:44,609 --> 01:00:46,200
the location so there are some special

1572
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,670
tools which also tells you the direction

1573
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:49,650
he's in this area is in this area you

1574
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:50,819
might have seen this Hollywood movie

1575
01:00:50,819 --> 01:00:52,980
though on the map it just pop-up so this

1576
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:54,329
red dot belongs to this guy so this

1577
01:00:54,329 --> 01:00:56,130
guy's in this building right now so

1578
01:00:56,130 --> 01:00:58,140
actually we also have this capability

1579
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:00,089
not killing the building but at least we

1580
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:02,430
tell you that this belongs to this

1581
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:04,140
location area like particular visually

1582
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:05,430
on the distance could be one kilometer

1583
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:06,990
or two kilometers so I can tell you any

1584
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:08,430
guy which is exactly in one kilometer

1585
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:10,530
totally with this tool of course we're

1586
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:11,970
not going to release but this has that

1587
01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:13,770
kind of implications but we can do more

1588
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:15,150
than that with the chef that's what

1589
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:16,740
really the source code so if you are

1590
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:18,270
interested to do something more actually

1591
01:01:18,270 --> 01:01:19,829
detecting base stations or try to play

1592
01:01:19,829 --> 01:01:21,630
more around with the GSM or trying to

1593
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:23,609
detect suspicious behavior we are open

1594
01:01:23,609 --> 01:01:25,980
to have any surges or anything so thank

1595
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:27,059
you for your time and if you're

1596
01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:29,069
interested I can show you the demo again

1597
01:01:29,069 --> 01:01:32,808
right sorry for that thank you

1598
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:35,650
you
