1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,800
hi everyone

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,000
um so yeah thank you for coming to my

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,460
talk the tale of Phineas Fisher

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,919
um before I'd start I think um a lot of

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,000
people have probably heard if it is

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,380
performed but maybe don't know the full

7
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,440
story so I hope I can um

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,120
go through that today

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,039
first of all who am I will you know I'm

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,420
Jake

11
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,640
um but I also do some stuff with open

12
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,260
Rights group

13
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,779
um I also call run the Birmingham Defcon

14
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:25,680
group

15
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,380
and I never never thought if I got the

16
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,420
opportunity to speak before con that

17
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,460
would plug my drum and bass playlist but

18
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,100
uh that's there too

19
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,140
Okay so

20
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,820
those of you that maybe saw the

21
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,700
description of his talk I put a little

22
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,920
cryptic riddle

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,020
um so

24
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,600
what what do all these uh things have in

25
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,940
common if you if your answer was Finnish

26
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,879
Fischer you would be correct

27
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,579
so let's jump in into the first breach

28
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:57,719
this is the first bridge that was

29
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,940
accredited to Phoenix Fisher by Finnish

30
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,440
Fisher themselves

31
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,940
um and it was of course the attack on

32
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,000
gamma Industries

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,820
so here's a quote from phrase themselves

34
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,820
which they posted in their Manifesto

35
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,280
hacking is a tool the problem though

36
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,320
right is that companies like gamma Labs

37
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,799
sell to customers who seek to use

38
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,600
hacking to evil ends

39
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,340
so why government why gum industry is

40
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,540
right why would

41
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,460
Phineas Target them

42
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,619
so let's go through retirement of events

43
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,900
that might provide some context

44
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,860
so in July the 20th of July 2012

45
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,119
Citizen's lab posted a a report from

46
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,900
Bahrain with love

47
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,460
Pro

48
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,500
democracy activists in Bahrain were

49
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,979
targeted using finnspy which is the

50
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:53,540
mobile

51
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,740
spyware uh

52
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,380
produced by gamma Industries

53
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,899
then in on the 13th of March 2013

54
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,299
citizen lab bring another blog out

55
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,759
titled you only click once

56
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,520
shows they showed a thin fish a fin

57
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,480
fissure

58
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,819
uh which is the another product by car

59
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,580
Ministries uh being used in 25 countries

60
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,060
around the world

61
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,599
um as you can see kind of demonstrated

62
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,980
on that graphic they're on screen

63
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,440
uh countries such as Ethiopia

64
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,000
um and other other nations

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,580
uh

66
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,200
okay sorry

67
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,040
jumped ahead of myself

68
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,959
yeah so there was talking evidence that

69
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,900
there is a campaign in Vietnam

70
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,640
um of course car Industries at the time

71
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,920
said they only sell to law enforcement

72
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,260
and intelligence agencies they did not

73
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,879
comment on the human rights records of

74
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,819
the customers of these products

75
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:55,200
um I wouldn't expect them to but there

76
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,200
you go so how did Phineas get into game

77
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,920
Industries right

78
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,480
um according to Phineas we have a quote

79
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,000
in the case of Finn Fisher what led me

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,819
to the verbal fin support website was a

81
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,860
simple who is lookup of the Finn Fisher

82
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,120
domain so that's finfisher.com

83
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,920
so what does finish do they do some

84
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,379
Recon on this support website they found

85
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,840
and they noticed that the developer that

86
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,680
made

87
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,379
the fin support website had previous

88
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,959
projects which were open source and

89
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,400
within those projects they discovered

90
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,720
vulnerabilities

91
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,540
one of which was SQL injection some of

92
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,760
you can probably see where this is going

93
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,680
using single injection and on the fin

94
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,659
Finn support website they're able to

95
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,340
gain credentials

96
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,019
they're also through local file

97
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,299
inclusion able to get the source code of

98
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:46,920
that site just to confirm you know that

99
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,540
things were the same

100
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,040
in this source code they discover

101
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,920
there's an upload function so Phineas

102
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,420
naturally thinks web shell

103
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,180
so after using this functionality to

104
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,980
upload a web shell to the to the service

105
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,519
they discovered that the the uh the

106
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,879
machine is running Debian with no local

107
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,280
route exploits so Phineas is in a bit of

108
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,319
a pickle as to what to do next

109
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,700
they turn our attention then to other

110
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,399
machines so in that environment in that

111
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,180
state

112
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,220
this is where they discover a web server

113
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,979
offering a folder called QA team hmm

114
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:24,900
interesting

115
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,860
upon looking at the the uh the directory

116
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,520
they discover a bunch of files related

117
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,919
to the QA of the products would you

118
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:36,780
believe it

119
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,580
so I have my notes are playing up so I'm

120
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,940
having to do this by hand

121
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,000
okay cool

122
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,919
is this change

123
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,840
fantastic

124
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,120
okay great

125
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,340
okay

126
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,180
um so we have the file called QA team

127
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,280
which contained fin spy samples these

128
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,979
are samples of the of the of the spyware

129
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:03,720
that I mentioned earlier

130
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,820
Okay so

131
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,800
of the the material they're able to

132
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,780
access you've got the QA folder that I

133
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,419
just talked about you have the finfisher

134
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:14,460
folder which can which uh had a bunch of

135
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,900
products

136
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,699
um but they are encrypted so if anyone's

137
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,259
have a go at those they are still they

138
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:20,820
are still encrypted to this day no one

139
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,800
has managed to crack them

140
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,860
um it's pgp so our gbg so so and what do

141
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,360
you expect

142
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,199
um

143
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,340
and there was also the dump of the

144
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,440
database as well

145
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,580
um interestingly enough as well just a

146
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,720
caveat to this as well is that they

147
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,880
discovered uh support tickets for

148
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,580
customers so they were able to gleam uh

149
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,039
who some of the customers were

150
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,240
um who are using their products at the

151
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,100
time as well

152
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,300
um

153
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,520
they also taunted gamma Industries

154
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,360
through a gamma group PR Twitter handle

155
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,520
which I thought was quite funny

156
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,100
okay so I mentioned the customers here's

157
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,620
an example of some on the screen you can

158
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,560
see a call diving finish as well

159
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,240
um but that kind of wraps up the hack on

160
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,500
camera Industries

161
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,000
uh truth be told I don't think it was

162
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,680
what Phineas was hoping for

163
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,900
but uh as we'll see they will make up

164
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,060
for that going forward

165
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,960
okay so let's move on to kind of the I

166
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,639
think the turning point in Phoenix's

167
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,320
sort of career

168
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,940
um as a hacktivist

169
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,639
um that was the hacking of hacking team

170
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:26,160
um an italian-based company that sold

171
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,840
like gamma Industries

172
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,319
um that sold software products to uh law

173
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,900
enforcement intelligence agencies uh you

174
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,360
know kind of anyone who was paying

175
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,919
um you can see the other caught in

176
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,060
Phineas I can see him had very little

177
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,039
exposed to the internet for example my

178
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,479
gamma group their customer support site

179
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,100
needed a client certificate to connect

180
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:44,940
to

181
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,860
that was the main site was running

182
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,259
Joomla it was a mail server a couple of

183
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:52,259
routers a VPN Appliance and a Spam

184
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:54,180
filtering application our plants some

185
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,819
sort of Sonic walls

186
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:59,639
so um another graph here

187
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:02,880
you see the use of uh hacking teams uh

188
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,600
product RCS remote control system

189
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,539
um so February uh the 12th February 2014

190
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:13,139
uh citizen lab post hacking team and the

191
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,180
targeting of Ethiopian journalists

192
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,940
in December uh the following year they

193
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,340
also posted a

194
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,400
um a tax against ESET employees

195
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,039
um sorry Eastside employees uh using the

196
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:28,440
remote control system

197
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,360
so

198
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,099
just like how government industry

199
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:34,020
started Phineas had to do some Recon

200
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,120
right they were starting on the outside

201
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,979
so on the 22nd of May Phoenix began

202
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:40,800
scoping a hacking team

203
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,660
which started by finding their public IP

204
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,699
ranges you can see listed there

205
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,039
uh given what we know what we know then

206
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,380
smaller attack surface how did things

207
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,300
get into hacking team right how how did

208
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,580
they pivot from just IP addresses to

209
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,800
actually compromising the company

210
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,300
so let's start with some audience

211
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,419
participation right who thinks

212
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:03,180
they know how Phineas got in to hiking

213
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,979
team

214
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:07,080
um do we think it's a a zero day in

215
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,780
Joomla now I can't see your hands

216
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,799
okay I think again

217
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,819
B do you think it's a zero day in post

218
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:19,020
fix

219
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,539
any takers

220
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:25,560
c a zero day embedded device

221
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,199
truth I can't see anyone's hands see the

222
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,759
answer was C

223
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,039
so Phineas crafted an exploit for a

224
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:36,240
sonic wall VPN Appliance at the time of

225
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,799
this breach we didn't actually know that

226
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,299
but I thought it would be I just put it

227
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,279
in uh to name it so it made sense in the

228
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,020
story suppose it just kind of an

229
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,159
appliance

230
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,240
um yeah

231
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,580
Phineas crafted a remote exploit for for

232
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,260
our blinds

233
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,660
so now they're on the network

234
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,380
um

235
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,360
they need to plan their next move right

236
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,899
so philis relies on trusty nmap and

237
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:00,420
discover some mongodb servers

238
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,240
inside those mongodb servers are audio

239
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,700
files pictures

240
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,220
um for for the use of testing of The Da

241
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,040
Vinci and Galileo platforms so the

242
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,240
products are the part of the remote

243
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,959
control system Suite excuse me

244
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,959
so

245
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,279
now they're on the network they're

246
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,019
listening they're you know doing

247
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,839
attacker stuff on the estate

248
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,180
um Phineas is able to look at

249
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,940
documentation and that's a sample of the

250
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,160
actual documentation the hacking team uh

251
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,740
created and published stolen by Phineas

252
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,779
obviously naturally

253
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:37,980
um and so

254
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,779
they want to look at the backups right

255
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,160
of the organization they want to

256
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,260
understand what's going on and that that

257
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,300
the documentation allegedly

258
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,220
says that the backups are segmented

259
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,740
they're not on the same Lan as where

260
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,240
Phineas is

261
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,940
that's foreshadowing

262
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,860
um

263
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,140
so

264
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,140
finish does some CLI magic and is able

265
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,459
to mount the backups that they

266
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,519
discovered on one portion of the network

267
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:07,200
to their infrastructure

268
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,360
through this process they're able to

269
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,640
discover old backups of infrastructure

270
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,700
VMS how nice one of particular interest

271
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,839
was an exchange server from 2014.

272
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:21,720
using LS dump finish dumps credentials

273
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,399
and finds passwords

274
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,120
for an admin account for best admin

275
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,740
to then use the new phone credentials

276
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,720
which of course worked on the real

277
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,360
estate so just to add some context got

278
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,640
an old machines in 2014.

279
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,339
with cash credentials for an old admin

280
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:39,899
account finish uses those cash

281
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,720
credentials on the live Network to gain

282
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,579
an admin account fantastic

283
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,040
so you can see here A bunch of passwords

284
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,800
that was gathered from phineas's Attack

285
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,500
you notice this is not my annotations

286
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,240
it's often Phineas in their Manifesto

287
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,640
but you can see they point at one that

288
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,660
says admin's passwords

289
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,100
uh this is an example as well of some of

290
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,180
the files that were taken from the

291
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,100
organization there was a whole swath of

292
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,620
files a huge archive but I know you

293
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,760
probably can't see that I'm in the

294
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,500
audience but there's a directory listing

295
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,600
and a bunch of internal files

296
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,820
um and files relating to this individual

297
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,500
system means as well which we'll get to

298
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,600
in a second

299
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,540
so now for this has access to data has

300
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,120
access to particular particular

301
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,740
credentials in the estate but they still

302
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,600
don't have what they want which is the

303
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,700
source code of the remote control system

304
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,620
uh platforms

305
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,740
so um

306
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,880
remember going back to that

307
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,200
documentation the development at work

308
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,700
the backups are supposed to be segmented

309
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,620
so he needs to hop over right they need

310
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,000
to find a way to hop over to other

311
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,200
network

312
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,660
inside the credentials for one of the

313
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,079
system mins uh Christian Christian potty

314
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:52,620
um

315
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,880
he kept all of the maybe not all but a

316
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,860
vast quantity of infrastructure service

317
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,440
accounts uh platform logins in a plain

318
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,200
text in plain text in a text file on his

319
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,459
machine

320
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:06,660
um he also kept other things on his

321
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,579
machine as well like his favorite Pawn

322
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:11,820
uh URLs which he kept on his his desktop

323
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,980
and a text file so you know each to

324
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,920
their own this this before covert as

325
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,940
well so he was doing this in the office

326
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,160
for some context and finish also grabbed

327
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,140
screenshots as well periodically uh

328
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,120
using power supply so he was able to

329
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,279
piece together a bunch of

330
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:26,940
um

331
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,620
a bunch of different

332
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,540
um information on the company that he

333
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,320
probably wouldn't have been able to

334
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,740
gather and pivot to if uh Christian

335
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,420
didn't keep this in plain text

336
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,860
um so Christian Pottery is a bit of a is

337
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,779
a bit of a villain in the hacking team

338
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:45,060
story he became I guess what you could

339
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,620
call a fan favorite

340
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,920
because he at the time of the breach he

341
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,480
took to Twitter to defend the company

342
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,700
and claiming they didn't sell spyware

343
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,260
and that they were just a software

344
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,880
development company

345
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,920
unfortunately uh the onlookers on

346
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,260
Twitter didn't take to Cali to this and

347
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,180
uh yeah it lets a lot of people laughing

348
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,700
his bad password and uh his uh his work

349
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,240
habits

350
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:10,620
so um

351
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,839
there is no pivots to Christian's

352
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:14,000
machine

353
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,079
using power supply and a bunch of other

354
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,060
living off the land techniques on his

355
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,800
machine though he discovers a true Crypt

356
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,000
archive

357
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,100
so what does finish do finishes wait

358
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,680
right for Christian to decrypt the

359
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,500
encrypted archive and then once it's

360
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,720
decrypted and mounted philis can grab

361
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,459
the files inside

362
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:35,880
and inside those files was a log on to a

363
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,519
nadjos server

364
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:39,540
um

365
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,360
and this was the key this Nadia server

366
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,300
bridged the two Networks so remember

367
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,100
going back before it be segmented but

368
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,180
then there was this device in the middle

369
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,720
that allowed access to both

370
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,820
so this gave Phineas access to the

371
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,500
development Network which is what they

372
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,180
wanted

373
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,880
this obviously led to the taking of all

374
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,200
the source code right this is this is

375
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,360
this is the bridge

376
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,920
Okay so

377
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,200
that was hacking team and later in the

378
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,820
talk I will cover

379
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,500
um the aftermath of this and what was

380
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,139
kind of the the the the wash after this

381
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:14,279
but uh we'll move on now to another

382
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:15,300
breach

383
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,420
okay so after hacking team Phoenix

384
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,180
Fisher hacks a Spanish police Union

385
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:25,279
um denoted as mossos

386
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,459
um the interesting about this breach

387
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:27,899
though is that philis recorded the

388
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:30,360
entire thing from start to finish there

389
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,279
was obviously prior Recon done by finish

390
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,260
that wasn't recorded but the bulk of the

391
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,880
attack was actually recorded and you can

392
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,320
find the video online on YouTube for

393
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,880
example

394
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,139
um so

395
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:42,000
what does Venice do in this attack so

396
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,279
they break into the mossos website

397
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:46,500
and by SQL injection

398
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,600
uh they take they take obviously the the

399
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,360
database which contain names uh Bank

400
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,459
details of police staff in this police

401
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,560
Union uh another personal sort of

402
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,819
information relating to those offices

403
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,060
um so after having all this data they uh

404
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,399
they start to capture logins as well so

405
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,199
that in the video if you watch it you

406
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,920
can see Phineas edits the login PHP file

407
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,899
to actually act as a bit of a credit

408
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:14,820
logger so they he can gather more

409
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,980
credentials I think he thought that he'd

410
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,480
they would say they would get more

411
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,399
access if they got an admin account or

412
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,139
something

413
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:23,459
um

414
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:25,860
but then um whilst going through the

415
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,620
database for dumped credentials they

416
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,000
discover that

417
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,920
one of the passwords when the users is

418
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,320
using is the same password for their

419
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,320
official Twitter account

420
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,220
so Phineas uh takes a bunch of uh I'm

421
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,740
going to say alleged images of abuse by

422
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,019
this Police Department or Union

423
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:47,760
um I can't really confirm that but this

424
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,560
is what it looked like so they changed

425
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,260
the uh the banner for this official

426
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,540
account to the alleged

427
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,820
abuse

428
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,740
kind of showing sort of phineas's uh

429
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,240
political leanings there and just kind

430
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,860
of you know uh that real sort of

431
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,880
activist uh then and also as well before

432
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,459
the uh before they left to exfil the

433
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:09,779
data they changed the name of the file

434
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:13,019
to index.htm so they could do a little

435
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:15,180
bit of car forensics not too much but

436
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,459
just a little bit

437
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,139
okay great

438
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:21,420
so after the police Union there's a

439
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,040
period of time a period of time sorry

440
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,040
that for the longest time was not really

441
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,300
uh

442
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,860
talked about because there wasn't any

443
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,540
information Phineas kind of went dark on

444
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,399
this until very recently well a couple

445
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,500
years ago but recently uh it's my

446
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,959
favorite part it's the bank job

447
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,120
so at the time there was rumors about

448
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,860
this but it wasn't confirmed

449
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,259
and like I said this is where for me the

450
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,480
story kind of changes and becomes a bit

451
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,279
of a legend right

452
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,000
um

453
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,600
this was a post on Reddit at the time

454
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,899
Phoenix had a Reddit account and they uh

455
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:58,139
this roughly translates to the banks

456
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:00,300
steal money from the people why

457
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,980
shouldn't the people steal from Banks

458
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,140
and Phineas comment on this post saying

459
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,579
that it was an interesting idea so

460
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:06,900
perhaps this is where they got the

461
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,559
inspiration from

462
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:16,079
so great now I need to take a little bit

463
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,520
of a detail here to explain something

464
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,679
that will make sense later on it's

465
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,540
connected to this but I just thought for

466
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,579
the sake of the story uh it made sense

467
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:26,699
into it now and I talk about the rojava

468
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:28,319
so

469
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,620
um Phineas really resonated with uh

470
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,520
these these people this this region and

471
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,260
um you can see there I'm going to cover

472
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,820
it in a second but you can see they

473
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,140
talked about donating a lot of money to

474
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,000
them where did he get the money

475
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,700
interesting for those that don't know

476
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:49,740
the rojava is a a communion a a

477
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,740
breakaway state in Syria it's that green

478
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,580
area up there

479
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,500
um so these are I just want to say that

480
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,039
these are claims made by the group I I

481
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,539
obviously haven't voted them I have no

482
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:04,860
related to development but this is what

483
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,799
they say about their own Enclave

484
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:10,740
they said that the pyd officially

485
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,360
announcer region a regional autonomy

486
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,640
from the constitution of rojava and they

487
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,740
list a bunch of social policies that

488
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,520
they passed in the in that area again a

489
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,460
lot of uh political kind of leanings

490
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,919
here and the fact that Phineas

491
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,000
um aligned in line themselves to them

492
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,260
perhaps speaks to finish his political

493
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,720
aims as a hacktivist

494
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,940
okay so for some more context then with

495
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,179
the Roger have it turkey not a fan was

496
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:41,280
not a fan of the rojava they claimed

497
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,280
they were an extension of the Syria of

498
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,179
the Kurdish Workers Party the PPK

499
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:52,140
uh and on the 12th of April 2016 uh

500
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,640
Turkish foreign minister called the pyd

501
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,799
a terrorist organization

502
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,679
in his speech

503
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,380
Council of foreign ministers

504
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,360
2016 also marked the start of turkey's

505
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,000
strikes against pyd so turkey was

506
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,700
actively engaged in Warfare against the

507
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,900
pyd

508
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,340
uh instantly a few months after this

509
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:17,160
Phineas breaks in to the email server of

510
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,679
the AKP we'll cover that as well later

511
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,960
on but it just shows there's a there's a

512
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,640
timeline forming here around these

513
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,500
particular events

514
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,780
Okay so

515
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,000
let's talk about the bank job then this

516
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,440
was the bank that finished hacked not

517
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,179
this literal building obviously but the

518
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:34,440
establishment

519
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,080
um in November November November 17

520
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,120
sorry 2019

521
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,559
few years

522
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,620
uh had passed phrase publishes a very

523
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,720
highly political statement more so I

524
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,039
think than any of their other manifestos

525
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,020
if you go back and you look at designs

526
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,020
they posted for gamma Industries

527
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,419
um hacking team this one that they

528
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:57,539
posted about the Cayman Bank

529
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:00,120
National Bank was heavily politically

530
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,160
charged in my opinion

531
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,820
um uh so they said that they stole an

532
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:10,080
undisclosed few hundred thousand pounds

533
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,820
quite a lot of money

534
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,799
and they said they use the same exploit

535
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:15,419
that they used to break into hacking

536
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:18,120
teams so this kind of shows I think some

537
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,580
sophistication here from Phineas that

538
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,900
the reason why we didn't know for the

539
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,700
longest time that they had this exploits

540
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,780
because they were planning on using it

541
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,820
and they did against the Cayman National

542
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,380
Bank

543
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,080
so the same Smooth Wall uh VPN Appliance

544
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,080
was targeted just to clarify uh here's

545
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,000
the Bitcoin transaction of Phineas ping

546
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,460
or Java uh that hundred thousand ten

547
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,200
thousand Euros

548
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,660
um you can see that

549
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:47,160
and here's a a cup here's a cut from the

550
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,980
Finney's Manifesto on this breach I

551
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,179
quite like the ASCII so that's all

552
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:52,080
that's there

553
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,020
so very similar to kind of the ttps they

554
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,080
used in hacking team uh Finnish uses

555
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,940
Metasploit to find Swift transaction

556
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,980
screens so Phineas was able to get into

557
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,500
endpoints to these employees

558
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,780
um those fellow people in blue team are

559
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,940
probably shivering right now that this

560
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,700
Bank didn't detect this

561
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,480
um

562
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,860
and an interesting thing here I think

563
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,480
about Swift which I didn't know until

564
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,700
researching this and finish touching

565
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,320
upon it so in this particular

566
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,820
institution obviously you can't comment

567
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,980
for everyone else's industry

568
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,840
um it takes one user to create the Swift

569
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,740
message

570
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,320
another user to verify it and then

571
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,240
another user to authorize it so it kind

572
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,159
of three points out of verification

573
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,500
authentication whatever you like

574
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,960
however this Bank of Cayman

575
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,820
International didn't review the

576
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,860
assessment Swift messages

577
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,140
it wasn't done so before they could

578
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,940
revoke the transfers once they

579
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,320
discovered something had happened it was

580
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,799
too late the money had already gone

581
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:52,140
so let's move on then to the the breach

582
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,440
of the AKP the leading political party

583
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,360
in Turkey

584
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,340
and I love this quote from Phineas this

585
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,720
is kind of like a real sort of like this

586
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,640
how he felt about it right it was a

587
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,080
total [ __ ] show

588
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,720
didn't accomplish anything but the

589
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,580
public Narrative of what happened is not

590
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,559
correct

591
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,720
so what did happen

592
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,840
on the 19th of July 2016

593
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,860
Wikileaks released part one of a job lot

594
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:23,100
of emails from the AKP

595
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,159
the emails dated back to

596
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:28,500
2010 they then did a follow-up post on

597
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,440
the 5th of August 2016.

598
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,780
um with more so my emails kind of

599
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,919
crammed in there

600
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:37,500
and they came from the official our

601
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,320
Turkish party domain

602
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,940
turkey obviously didn't like this and

603
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,860
blocked Wikileaks in return from the

604
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,299
country

605
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:46,799
I sent it I guess would be a better for

606
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,240
us

607
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,919
um this is just an Excel from Wikileaks

608
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,480
about the contempted coup that happened

609
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,940
in Turkey around about that time but

610
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,919
WikiLeaks publishing all this

611
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,020
information happened just four days

612
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,740
after this coup

613
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,340
so

614
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,559
misunderstanding

615
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,000
that's odd you can't see there's a

616
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,100
there's a clown Emoji but uh you can't

617
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,659
see it on the slides

618
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:12,840
um so in response then to what happened

619
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,120
um Phineas was I think quite angry about

620
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,860
this because it looked like they were

621
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,659
being shoved in as sort of like a

622
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:20,280
wikileak sauce

623
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,260
um which it's apparent they didn't

624
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,700
really like

625
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,640
um so what was the misunderstanding so

626
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,320
it seems like someone within uh rojava

627
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,120
accidentally passed on the emails to

628
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,280
WikiLeaks

629
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,700
um again this is alleged right but they

630
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,039
allege that WikiLeaks took them

631
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,960
published them without asking or

632
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,159
confirming they should have been

633
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,659
published

634
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:47,460
um and this annoyed Phineas right

635
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,780
because at the time there was still

636
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,919
Within

637
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,320
uh akp's Network

638
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,000
so for this is in there doing doing

639
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,980
their thing right looking to maybe do

640
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,299
what they've done with similar breaches

641
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:59,640
but they're immediately burnt because

642
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,039
they took the parties response kicked in

643
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:04,380
right and they're booted off the network

644
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,419
so

645
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:08,520
um and he you know finish is obviously

646
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,440
incense because WikiLeaks

647
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,640
in their opinion shouldn't have

648
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,480
published it right they should have

649
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,159
respected the wishes of the rojava and

650
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,200
Phineas

651
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,179
um so any kind of response to this a bit

652
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:20,280
of a knee-jerk response Phineas decides

653
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,640
excuse me finish decides to publish a 30

654
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,700
gig Archive of what they had already

655
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,780
unfortunately uh in that archive was a

656
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,940
entire voter database for this for this

657
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,140
political party

658
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,440
and this when this kind of happened and

659
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,260
pressed uh came out about this the new

660
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,960
stories they framed it as if Phineas had

661
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,000
done this for and hacked the party for

662
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,460
the database and that you know uh

663
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,900
Phineas was like sort of a nation state

664
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,240
or something like that right but this

665
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,159
actual database has been leaked months

666
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,659
before by another group not affiliated

667
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,039
to Phineas

668
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:58,679
um so finish in their post was trying to

669
00:24:58,679 --> 00:24:59,820
point out that they weren't the first

670
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,679
there

671
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:02,880
okay

672
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,919
so now we've gone through the breaches

673
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:07,020
right quite a fair few of them now I

674
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,280
want to spend some time looking at the

675
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,980
aftermath what was the aftermath of uh

676
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,059
of these of these Bridges

677
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,840
so

678
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,659
let's let's first catch up with SME from

679
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:20,159
mosos

680
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,340
so the 31st of January 2017 Spanish law

681
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,840
enforcement investigating the attack

682
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,000
announced three arrests

683
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,860
one of those they said was the hacker

684
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,539
behind the attack they've caught the

685
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:31,500
Phineas

686
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,900
of course though this wasn't Phineas

687
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,840
uh what what came out uh from Freddy's

688
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,799
at the time because they were asked for

689
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:39,539
comment I think from motherboard uh you

690
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:40,799
saw on the screen but they said I think

691
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,960
Moses just arrested some people that

692
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,760
retweeted the link uh to their personal

693
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,799
information so just assuming you've gone

694
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,299
around the found three people that have

695
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:49,980
liked the post linked the post and

696
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,440
they've arrested them

697
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,220
uh I played awesome uh yeah so the the

698
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,100
next uh the next aftermath I'd like to

699
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,080
discuss is a hacking team this is maybe

700
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,799
the best uh best maybe to find by uh the

701
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,179
different parties involved but that's my

702
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:07,559
interpretation

703
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:08,700
um

704
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,299
so

705
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,820
after the uh after the hiking team

706
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,179
breach the FBI got involved and this I

707
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:20,400
believe was caused by uh the Italian

708
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,039
authorities wanting to

709
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,940
um you know investigate or an American

710
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,100
citizen so you think Phineas right

711
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,480
they've got Phineas

712
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,120
but no it was actually a an innocent

713
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,679
third party

714
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:37,860
a guy called John davichi

715
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,140
and the interview at the FBI sorry

716
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,919
interviewed him many times and he in the

717
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,900
interview said I've never even met I've

718
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,059
never heard of hacking team you know I

719
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:50,820
don't know who who Phineas is

720
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,140
um you know what so what happened right

721
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,820
how did this guy get thrown into this

722
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,640
mix well it was to do with this some of

723
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,720
you might actually remember this this

724
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,940
Bitcoin gift card or scratch card thing

725
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,799
from back in the day

726
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:03,900
so what happened was was that the

727
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,640
Bitcoins that were used to purchase the

728
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,919
server that finish uses a staging

729
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,659
environment to compromise hacking team

730
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:12,659
conduct their their assault from

731
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:14,940
um was paid for with Bitcoin from the

732
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,320
service

733
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,299
um it was at this point that finished uh

734
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:20,640
announces that they stole John's

735
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,779
Bitcoins

736
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:24,600
to use to buy to pay for infrastructure

737
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,640
which I thought was kind of cool and he

738
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,840
admitted that to motherboard in a

739
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,480
follow-up interview but yeah so John

740
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,980
John Bitcoins are still going to be used

741
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,779
and the FBI traced it back to what they

742
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:34,919
thought was a source which was the

743
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,539
strong guy

744
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:39,659
so still three is still not caught

745
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:41,159
so what happened to the employees of

746
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,860
hockey team though now this was a huge

747
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,260
there's a lot this huge spiraling of

748
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,179
events after this there's so much to

749
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:50,940
cover I can't cover all of it there's uh

750
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,100
there's the full you know hacking team's

751
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,860
full uh emails right there's there's a

752
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,919
bit there's been a metadata analysis uh

753
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:00,659
the another third party has done where

754
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:03,419
they say that hacking team used uh far

755
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:05,880
right or right-wing rhetoric to refer to

756
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,200
one another

757
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,059
um yeah I'm not going to cover that

758
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:10,260
obviously in too much detail but you

759
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,520
could do another talk just on that if

760
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,659
you want to

761
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:15,500
um so what does the foreign

762
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,559
they had learned anything from the gamma

763
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:21,120
Labs hacks they were aware of it in the

764
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,679
industry obviously but they hadn't done

765
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:24,120
anything right nothing had been done a

766
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,039
hacking team to to kind of show off

767
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:28,080
defenses to be proactive

768
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,580
I was a quote from one of the employees

769
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,779
that says the company was more worried

770
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:32,700
about selling spyware than keeping

771
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,100
hackers away I think a lot of vision the

772
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,279
industry can resonate with that

773
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:39,900
um now we have a direct court here from

774
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,240
kind of a marcini individual a hacking

775
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,919
team

776
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,419
um

777
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:46,799
he

778
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,020
he he was quite open with this and he

779
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,179
when he was asked he said that he was

780
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:53,580
told that too much security would hinder

781
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,380
development

782
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,620
and that uh the person that hacked

783
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,720
hacking team must have been a

784
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,580
sophisticated group of criminals which I

785
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,740
thought just funny

786
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:08,640
uh Vincent Yeti the CEO of hacking team

787
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,360
um

788
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,580
really kind of fell apart over this and

789
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,740
not exciting like you know boys me more

790
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,380
like a crusade to catch what he thought

791
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:21,059
was a an inside job he went ballistic he

792
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:25,320
started to cues former employees which

793
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,820
is some really sad stories about because

794
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,340
he you know he pursued them legally

795
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,320
there's people that were innocent but he

796
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,659
went after them anywhere he referred to

797
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:36,360
them as infidels and traitors

798
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,760
um presented this in Italian Court as I

799
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,880
mentioned to which though a judge

800
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,220
you know sort of uh

801
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,840
laughed him out of the courtroom by

802
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,000
saying it's clear that such theory is

803
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,220
completely groundless so it was funny

804
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,500
even the judges like no you're wrong so

805
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,120
what was the truth then what was the

806
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,919
what was the reason perhaps why other

807
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,419
than his company being breached why was

808
00:29:57,419 --> 00:29:59,340
David so hungry

809
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,640
all the facts he was salty right it had

810
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,440
been exposed to everyone that he was the

811
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,899
reason why key parts of infrastructure

812
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:08,279
like that something called Appliance we

813
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:10,799
spoke about earlier weren't dead he

814
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,840
refused to let it update this

815
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,820
infrastructure

816
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,559
um he wanted to use his legacy VPN and

817
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,120
that's what they did they you know he

818
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,279
used it he also installed a Witch Hunt

819
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:21,480
right as I mentioned earlier he went

820
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,919
after four employees he ruined for

821
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:25,380
employees lives uh legally to get you

822
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,120
know to try and get to this Narrative of

823
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,559
that people had been plotting against

824
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,720
him and that this breach was them

825
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,600
enacting that plot

826
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,740
so in December 11th of December 2017

827
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,320
um the milan-based prosecutor assigned

828
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,360
to the hacking team breach files with a

829
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,279
judge uh a motion to stop the

830
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:45,960
investigation

831
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,659
Phineas had gone away with it in July

832
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:50,279
2018 Italian judge rules the

833
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:51,899
investigation into what happened to

834
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:53,700
hacking team and he was responsible was

835
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,380
to be shut down

836
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,580
there were no leads

837
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,980
the investigator said that Phineas must

838
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,020
have been part of an organization that

839
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:07,320
was scientifically and maniacally used a

840
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,000
maniacally used techniques to evade

841
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,659
identification

842
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,399
sounds like a cool story to me in June

843
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,100
20th of 2019 Joseph men a kind of

844
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,700
renowned cyber security writer commenter

845
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,860
um bring brought a book the court of the

846
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,960
dead cow

847
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,539
um and in this book

848
00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:30,860
he uh has a quote from a U.S Source

849
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,720
sorry it's also the U.S government uh

850
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,700
that they alleged that phenise was a

851
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,820
likely a Russian operative

852
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,460
um some sort of like guccifer 2.0 you

853
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,740
know it's like giu op

854
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,480
however another source that was

855
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,760
commented uh by motherboard sorry was

856
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,080
sourced by motherboard and said that

857
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,520
actually the U.S government believe that

858
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,559
Phineas is a activist they don't believe

859
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,899
them to be a nation state at all

860
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,380
so

861
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,000
what else did you need to get up to

862
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,580
after these breaches well they launched

863
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,159
a hacker bug Bounty program

864
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:06,059
um I don't know how well that comes

865
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:07,860
across to the audience but as you can

866
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,720
see some Facebook in their last sort of

867
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,980
announcement in which they disclosed the

868
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,899
kit they came in international uh Bank

869
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:15,179
breach they also launched a book by a

870
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:17,700
program offering a hundred thousand

871
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,659
dollars

872
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:21,360
to people that can hack uh companies and

873
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,000
expose data in these industries gas oil

874
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,340
big Pharma can I get the picture

875
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,140
and someone actually did

876
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,120
somebody hacked me look off and then

877
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,820
received 10 000 from the uh from the

878
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,520
from the Bounty that's the asciar is not

879
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,679
me that was created by the attackers of

880
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:43,320
miliko in their Manifesto

881
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,740
so

882
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,299
that's the that's the Legacy that's the

883
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,440
aftermath

884
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,500
since then Phineas has been quiet deadly

885
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,520
silent

886
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,580
there's been no new posts no breaches

887
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,020
attributed to them by themselves there's

888
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,679
been nothing

889
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,620
um I think they even announced the

890
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,640
motherboard that they were they were

891
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,640
taking some time off for stress in 2019.

892
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,880
however fast forward to August 22 uh 20

893
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,100
2022 I'm sorry

894
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,080
um this happened

895
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,320
this is a screenshot from a video of a

896
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,659
activist group does it sound familiar

897
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:22,080
that went after Guatemala's Ministry of

898
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,159
Natural Resources a hydro a carbons

899
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:27,840
agency in Colombia and a bunch of other

900
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,240
oil and Mining

901
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,340
conglomerates in Brazil Venezuela Chile

902
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,799
and Colombia

903
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,559
um unlike Phineas this group recorded

904
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,360
their entire their entire breach of his

905
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,500
company

906
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,679
through exploitation uh all the way

907
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,840
across the attack chain the recorded the

908
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,299
entire thing and this is purely

909
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:50,580
speculation but to me the TTP is used by

910
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,860
this group are very very similar to

911
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,760
Phineas

912
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,380
obviously I can't say I'm confident just

913
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,600
this breach was Phineas

914
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,519
but I think it goes a show regardless

915
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,919
that phrase had a lasting effect and I

916
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,000
think always will have a lasting effect

917
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,500
on hacktivism

918
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,480
um and uh

919
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,239
yeah maybe maybe is that maybe it's not

920
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:11,760
we'll find out I guess in time

921
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,859
and that's it thank you very much thanks

922
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:15,300
for coming to my photography is Fisher

923
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,800
you can find me

924
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,339
thank you

925
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:25,139
we have time for uh maybe two questions

926
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:27,060
if there are any

927
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:30,719
or you can always find our uh fantastic

928
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,760
speakers

929
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,899
Meandering around

930
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:34,619
um

931
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:36,300
if there are no questions then it's

932
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,219
lunch oh we got a question

933
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:40,759
yep

934
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:44,099
yeah I was in Italy was following all

935
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:46,080
these hacking team stuff the the company

936
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,260
Milan that and I think maybe one of the

937
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,839
reasons the the prosecution was halted

938
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,060
against yeah is because I think the

939
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,980
Italian government may have been one of

940
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,220
the customers right of the thing the

941
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,560
data shot down the company because also

942
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,839
in that period in the news that's what's

943
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,140
in the menus Italy had a problem big

944
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:11,220
problems with Egypt because they kill an

945
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,280
Italian citizen in Africa so and also

946
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,320
Egypt used that software and there was a

947
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,119
big like and they wanted to shoot that

948
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:19,619
investigation and show that the company

949
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:21,960
and everything around that and I'm not

950
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,880
super confident on that but that's my

951
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,099
yeah yeah conclusion thank you for the

952
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:28,800
context yeah it's great yeah

953
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,599
all right here we go

954
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,339
uh so are there any hints to where they

955
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:37,440
so at the end they're offering a bug

956
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,599
Bounty program yeah so at some point

957
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:40,980
they must have acquired a bit of a war

958
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,380
chest any hints on what operations that

959
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,099
was uh yeah so the money

960
00:35:46,099 --> 00:35:48,420
in theory came from Cameron National

961
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,460
Bank right they don't disclose the full

962
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,740
amount but they they talk as they say a

963
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,720
few hundred thousand would you question

964
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,180
say where the money came from well

965
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,520
it's but you said that transfer didn't

966
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,980
actually work or how do you

967
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,320
so it's one thing where'd you put that

968
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,060
money afterwards Oh you mean where did

969
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:06,960
they put the money when they took it

970
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,339
from the bank yeah good question I don't

971
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:09,839
know I'm not Phineas right but uh yeah

972
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,940
they they um they took the money they

973
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,820
filled it actually I think uh it's a

974
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,839
whole different thing that being

975
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,060
transferred so yeah yeah going into a

976
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,400
Bitcoin War chest thing yeah yeah let me

977
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,560
clarify it wasn't a direct transfer from

978
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,720
the bank to like to bitcoin right they

979
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,220
took the money to an account

980
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,000
um

981
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,220
you've jumped my memory now yeah so they

982
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,020
took it they sent it to an account I

983
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,160
think the first time they did it they

984
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,660
sent to the Royal account

985
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,280
um it went through a bank in England as

986
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,660
opposed to a bank in South America I

987
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,920
think and then eventually went for the

988
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,119
right the right way route to their

989
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,040
account and then they they took it but

990
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,720
like I said there is a writer there's a

991
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,160
I can share with you after this there's

992
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,020
an enzyme that covers this maybe more

993
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,160
detail that I couldn't fit into the

994
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,320
slides but yeah yeah good question but

995
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,000
yeah they follow the money away and then

996
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,980
then exchange into Bitcoin or part of it

997
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,720
whatever they did

998
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,180
great all right much everyone
