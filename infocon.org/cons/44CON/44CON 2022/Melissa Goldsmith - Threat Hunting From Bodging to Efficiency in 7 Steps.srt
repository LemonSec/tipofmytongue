1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,700
hello hello can can everyone hear me

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,180
okay wow that is really right

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,059
um okay hi uh welcome to fresh hunting

4
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:11,519
and you from barging to efficiency in

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,740
seven ish steps I thought of another one

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,139
while I was at the previous talk but it

7
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:18,060
was too late to change it so

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,619
um I'm sure most people know what the

9
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:22,619
term bodging is but for my American

10
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:25,199
Brethren uh and other people who maybe

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,580
don't know the term I think it's a very

12
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,699
British term but bajing is you know

13
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,980
repairing something so it works albeit

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,840
mostly temporarily you know if it's a

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,380
short-term fix duct tape is usually

16
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,000
involved I think a great example is we

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,739
were heading back to the States for the

18
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,660
first time since covid and everything so

19
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,820
it's been like three years and of course

20
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,059
our kitchen sink decided to to leak and

21
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:49,739
right the night before we were gonna fly

22
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:50,879
and I was like we don't have time for

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,200
this I'm not calling up a plumber it's

24
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,559
too expensive so my husband's like

25
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,760
we'll do it live right we'll just budget

26
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,020
we'll just you know figure it out we

27
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,640
make a phone call to some people who

28
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,140
used to be plumbers say you know how can

29
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,359
we fix this so we can just have it hold

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,820
on until we come back and we we figured

31
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,140
out the solution it wasn't leaking

32
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,880
anymore so we're like all right and have

33
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,640
we fixed it yet no but

34
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,920
um you know it's a good badge then

35
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,900
that's that's always the sign but the

36
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,240
point is if you know threat hunting is

37
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,560
it's definitely not a new thing people

38
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,000
have been threat hunting for many many

39
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,560
years now

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,180
um I actually heard the term fronting

41
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,520
has anyone heard that it's terrible

42
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,380
um I hope it does not stick

43
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,900
but a lot of companies still haven't

44
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,780
really embraced threat hunting and I

45
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,700
think a lot of people they hear about it

46
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,780
and they're like this sounds interesting

47
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,340
hey can you do this in your spare time

48
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,780
when you're not doing incident response

49
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,040
when you're not doing your in you know

50
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,380
Intel Intel threat Intel or anything

51
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,840
like that and so I was like well how do

52
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,820
you start a threat hunting program like

53
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,380
if you're a smaller company right if

54
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,060
you're like a Booze Allen or a Raytheon

55
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,159
right you've got this all down

56
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,720
so you can go get another coffee if you

57
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,380
want

58
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,460
um

59
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,979
so yeah a little bit about me I've kind

60
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,659
of already talked about but I guess the

61
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,360
two things to take out of this

62
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,399
is I've been been doing this for a while

63
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:06,600
but I definitely don't consider myself

64
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,220
an expert by any stretch the imagination

65
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,520
the joy of this career is that you're

66
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,780
always learning there's always something

67
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,980
new

68
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,920
um there's always a fire like log4j

69
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,120
um but I actually only started doing

70
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,540
thread hunting officially in 2020 uh

71
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,220
came back from eternity leave and I was

72
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,300
like hey I don't really want to be on

73
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,980
call anymore I'd rather do this thing

74
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,780
called thread hunting and the bank said

75
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,340
yeah that's fine and then lockdown

76
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,379
happened and everything kind of went

77
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:34,140
you know Hurley Burley and then uh yeah

78
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,140
NBC Universal hired me in 2020 to do

79
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,660
threat hunting full time so work for

80
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,220
them now so shout out to the sky guys

81
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,519
and people

82
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,340
ah so here's my obligatory cya slide

83
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,780
obviously

84
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,459
um the views and opinions and data

85
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,680
points here are the sole discretion of

86
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,720
mine not NBC Universal and I've

87
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,640
accumulated this over my career as a

88
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,060
forensicator thread Hunter ER

89
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,940
so how do you there's lots of memes I'm

90
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,500
you know I guess it's old school I still

91
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,019
I still love a good meme so how to hunt

92
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:09,480
when you are a small team it just to

93
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,800
remember you're never alone you actually

94
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,540
probably came from one of these teams or

95
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,819
working part-time still in one of these

96
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,400
teams so it's always good to to have

97
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,080
these teams like in your back pocket or

98
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,220
always talking with them because

99
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,400
especially in the remote working world

100
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,599
not everyone is still going back into

101
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,940
the office so it's good to know these

102
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,379
these individuals so you have your

103
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,780
forensics your incident response and

104
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,480
your sock analysts you get some great

105
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,879
hunting ideas from previous incidents

106
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,280
many times we'll have the forensics lead

107
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,959
come to me and say hey we just had this

108
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,599
thing can you pull out the iocs and do

109
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,860
some third hunting to make sure we've

110
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,360
got everything you say okay and then you

111
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,920
come up with detections based on that

112
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,799
but then obviously in the reverse you

113
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:52,260
get you hand off escalations to them as

114
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,400
well right if you're doing thread

115
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,920
hunting and you see an active

116
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,900
active Badness in your network you're

117
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,280
not just going to sit on it and wait for

118
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,420
the report know you're escalating

119
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,980
immediately to them and you want to make

120
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,299
sure you're giving them all the data

121
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:04,560
they need to hit the ground running

122
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,200
there's nothing worse than going through

123
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,420
especially with time zone differences uh

124
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,739
it's very frustrating when you're doing

125
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,360
a bunch of work only to find out five

126
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,980
hours later when they come online oh

127
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,000
they've already done that but they

128
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,380
forgot to attach that you're like that

129
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,500
is infuriating so make sure that you

130
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,358
know what they need to to start doing

131
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,759
their work immediately

132
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,820
the sock is also the first to action on

133
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,460
a detection that you helped to create so

134
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,660
they're obviously really good for

135
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,820
feedback they also sometimes need a bit

136
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,699
more clarification as to what am I

137
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:37,259
actually looking for here this is also

138
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,000
where Internal Documentation is very

139
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,979
important I talk about that in a

140
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:42,780
different slide but they're basically

141
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,160
the boots to the ground you know they're

142
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,740
in the trenches so to speak and so they

143
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,900
know what is actually going on in in

144
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,419
your network so a great example of that

145
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:54,419
is we had a sock analyst come to the

146
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,800
hunting team and said hey we've been

147
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,840
having this it's like you know pop

148
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,419
adware kind of thing but they're getting

149
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:01,620
really annoyed with it because they had

150
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,479
about five or six tickets in the like

151
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:05,820
about a week and they're like can you do

152
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,500
some analysis and research and maybe see

153
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,720
if we can catch it further up The Kill

154
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,759
chain

155
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,919
um so I said okay sure so I took a look

156
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,440
at the tickets and I found out that they

157
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,400
are using the Run key

158
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,600
but they were changing the executable

159
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,860
name but there was something about it

160
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,720
that it was common amongst all of them

161
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,160
and that was the location of where it

162
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,500
was in like this weird and their roaming

163
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,000
profile so I said well let's do a query

164
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,740
for that and not only did we find the

165
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,120
ones that they knew about we also found

166
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,460
ones that our av didn't detect for

167
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,100
whatever reason so we found some more

168
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,080
Badness so we'll say thanks for that and

169
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,919
now I'm going to hand off another

170
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:43,320
escalation to you to to action so that

171
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,759
was a great

172
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,120
cyber security life cycle in action

173
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,400
and then you have your Intel team and

174
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,139
then again I guess it depends on the

175
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:53,460
size of your organization some

176
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,900
organizations do not have threat

177
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,460
intelligence but if you do you

178
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,479
definitely want to get to know them

179
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:59,880
because you know you can go to them and

180
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,580
say I who are the threat actors that we

181
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,139
are actually worried about you know

182
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:06,840
attacking us in our vertical or and what

183
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,060
are the tools and tactics and procedures

184
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,560
that they use and then you can go and

185
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,699
compare that to what did you have

186
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:13,139
detections for and say well I should

187
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,720
definitely start hunting in XYZ because

188
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,039
we don't have detections for that

189
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,680
because we don't we're blind

190
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,419
and then you have your detection

191
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:23,940
engineering team I'm just gonna see it

192
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,319
says oh

193
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,660
oh okay then you have your detection and

194
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,460
engineering team these are the people

195
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,139
the people that are creating the rules

196
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:32,759
based on the queries that you submit to

197
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,979
them so whatever your your sim is or

198
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:36,660
however you guys do that in your

199
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,400
environment so obviously you want to

200
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,660
make sure one you're giving them all the

201
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,580
information they need so you're getting

202
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,500
context about the query like what is it

203
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,660
from what hunt did you do so you can

204
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,220
give them all that information and they

205
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,960
can go and make your query probably

206
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,940
better because let's face it they are

207
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,380
usually much better at writing queries

208
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,660
than you are but that you get that

209
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,580
feedback from them and then it's just

210
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,199
that good dialogue because you just want

211
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,460
to be able to get this done as quickly

212
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,720
as possible

213
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,400
and then other teams that are great to

214
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,039
know uh are your security architecture

215
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,620
and engineering team uh like your red

216
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,120
team I guess and they can do like

217
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,220
onboarding for you onboarding of new uh

218
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,300
Technologies

219
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,680
and they're great to know because then

220
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,419
you know what's coming down the pipeline

221
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:16,620
of other things you might have to be

222
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,120
worrying about hunting because there's

223
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,319
this new application that's coming

224
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,599
online next week and it just opens up

225
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,340
this whole level of

226
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,720
stuff

227
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,319
um

228
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,840
then you have your logging team and

229
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,800
obviously they're important because

230
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,900
that's hopefully where your sim is and

231
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,060
I'm so glad I I'm coming after the

232
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,500
previous presentation because I talk

233
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,120
about logs as well but I have a bit of a

234
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,419
more negative thing about logging and

235
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:40,800
you can't have a presentation anymore

236
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,620
without not talking about the cloud it

237
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,199
is there and it is a mess and normally

238
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,599
you come in well before like the Cloud's

239
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:50,580
already up and running and you come in

240
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,319
and they're like wet logs and what do

241
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,220
you mean I don't know we've just been

242
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,599
spinning this up and we've been fine

243
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,580
this entire time you go okay so it's

244
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,720
always good to have a point of contact

245
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,780
in your multiple Cloud teams probably to

246
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,979
this way then when you start looking at

247
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:03,960
logs and analyzing you can say is this

248
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,120
normal is this not normal and then you

249
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,560
can put that in your environment notes

250
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,240
for further on down the line

251
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,220
so here is your generic threat hunting

252
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,580
life cycle and I added in kind of where

253
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,800
the other teams from the previous slides

254
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,500
would fit in in that perfect world

255
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,680
threat generic hunting life cycle and I

256
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,360
think it would probably be arrows going

257
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,919
both ways right like it is a two-way

258
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:30,720
street you're not they're not you're not

259
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,179
just feeding into the response response

260
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,740
is also feeding into you that's what you

261
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,080
want in a perfect world

262
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,760
but step three would be to have

263
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,820
processes and procedures documented

264
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,919
um you might not always be what I like

265
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,720
to call a threat sniper you might

266
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,459
actually have like a little buddy at

267
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:48,839
some point and then you actually might

268
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:51,300
get a full team so it's important to if

269
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,160
something happens to you for whatever

270
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,839
reason you can't come into the office or

271
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:56,760
something like that someone can pick up

272
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,160
where you left off and they kind of know

273
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,380
what the heck to do and follow along

274
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,440
with what you've been working on

275
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,320
um and it's also it's I find that very

276
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,700
tough sometimes when it's like well how

277
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,440
do you do threat hunting it's

278
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,760
it's something that you just kind of

279
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,959
pick up and I think this is where

280
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,420
experience comes into play where you

281
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,700
know you it I again to show my age it's

282
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,560
like the Matrix right you know when you

283
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,120
first start looking at it you every once

284
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,560
in a while you start to see you just see

285
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,420
numbers right or whatever the heck they

286
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,100
had and then you get a little bit more

287
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,660
experience you start seeing blondes and

288
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,760
brunettes and then suddenly you're Neo

289
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,500
and you just like I know this is bad or

290
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,000
I know what this is I know this is good

291
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,760
I can set my focus to something else

292
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,740
so I think this is where you know you

293
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,240
can't just have

294
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,860
five steps like if you do these five

295
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,060
things you are done threat hunting

296
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,800
that's not really how it works you have

297
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,899
to know when you need to Pivot and look

298
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:47,700
at us focus on something or you can say

299
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,380
I'm going to focus on that later that's

300
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,360
not important right now and you know

301
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,500
move on to the thing that you were

302
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,920
working on

303
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,000
um oh and then now that you've found

304
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,140
something

305
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,120
what the heck do you do with it right um

306
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,500
if you're a small team you could just

307
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,660
you know tap over to Charlie behind you

308
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,040
and say hey Charlie I got this thing can

309
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,660
you take a look at it but unfortunately

310
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,740
it's not really like that anymore

311
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,500
especially in a global uh organization

312
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,060
so you have to know who the heck you're

313
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,200
supposed to be escalating to obviously

314
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,120
when it's just an incident you're

315
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,980
escalating it to the sock that's pretty

316
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,320
straightforward and simple bless you but

317
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,920
when it's you know the cloud or it's you

318
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,240
know the Sim engineering team or

319
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,380
something like that you might not know

320
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,380
exactly who to talk to and the cloud is

321
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,519
a perfect example you probably have

322
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,740
multiple clouds with multiple accounts

323
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,200
with multiple tenants so talking to one

324
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,240
person might not be the right person for

325
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,560
this instance so you need to have that

326
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,779
written down somewhere so that if it is

327
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:41,220
a you know hey we need to find this

328
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,000
person now you're not just scrambling

329
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,459
uh oh and then having metrics right

330
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,560
management loves to see

331
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,820
change in the right direction so the

332
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,920
things that we've kind of seen that have

333
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,140
good things with management is

334
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,060
escalating how many escalations have you

335
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,640
actually submitted to to the sock or

336
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,440
even to another group like hey we found

337
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,540
this Gap in a security group in the

338
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,980
Amazon Cloud we need you to go and take

339
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,019
a look that's technically an escalation

340
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,519
it's not an escalation as that is an

341
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,560
incident but it is an escalation it's

342
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,600
improving your security posture of your

343
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,459
company so that is that is a good thing

344
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:18,420
right

345
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,519
and then how many detections have you

346
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,920
submitted to the detections team to be

347
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,720
turned into and actioned as an alert

348
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,640
because obviously that means okay yeah

349
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,899
we might not have found something today

350
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:30,540
but we might if someone tries to use

351
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,399
that same technique tomorrow we'll

352
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,839
detect it and we'll block it right

353
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,000
that's also well that brings up the true

354
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,339
positive alerts right that is obviously

355
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:40,019
the big win it's like we could have

356
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:42,420
gotten hit here and who knows what could

357
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,680
have happened they could have deployed

358
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,480
Kanti ransomware you know you don't know

359
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,220
you don't know what you don't know said

360
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,079
Donald Rumsfeld

361
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:52,860
um but you you stopped it there you know

362
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,360
so you can postulate whatever you want

363
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,680
could have happened but you stopped it

364
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,760
so you don't have to worry about it and

365
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,079
that is obviously a huge win

366
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,640
um but yeah so if there's your generic

367
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,920
life cycle with incident response you

368
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,899
know when you're executing your hunt uh

369
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,420
your detection team for your alerts and

370
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,740
then obviously various teams depending

371
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,660
on what your report actually has inside

372
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,839
it

373
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:19,560
so logs uh Florian Roth tweeted this and

374
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,959
I asked him if I could use it because

375
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:23,880
I'm like this just I feel like this sums

376
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,700
up the life of everybody

377
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,740
um you know back back in the day when I

378
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,480
first started out it was like there were

379
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,700
three Windows event logs and you didn't

380
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,440
have to worry about Powershell was this

381
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,240
nebulous thing that they said was coming

382
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,339
and we're like yeah sure just like fpv6

383
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:39,899
it's coming

384
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:44,160
um and and then suddenly it just the

385
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,560
logs just exploded and then you know you

386
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,600
have these huge corporations like when I

387
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,760
work for the Department of Defense

388
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,380
um how many computers the Department of

389
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,540
Defense has nobody knows

390
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,639
um so you just think about all of those

391
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,200
logs that are going and you're like I

392
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,060
can't you can't you cannot be logging

393
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,500
everything right so you have to be very

394
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,240
picky about what logs you actually are

395
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,800
ingesting into your sim it would be nice

396
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,720
if we could ingest all of them but I

397
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,839
feel like you do get this tsunami effect

398
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,760
happening where you have your OS logs

399
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,260
and your Sims like okay I can I can I

400
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,240
can kind of handle this it's okay and

401
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,620
then you get the service level log and

402
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,940
they're like okay this is this is a bit

403
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,380
too much now and then you get

404
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,000
application Level and you get your cloud

405
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,560
and then you get your network logs and

406
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,620
some of your Sims like whoa I I can't

407
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,660
I'm dead and then he's like I'm just

408
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,300
gonna do a search for the last year it's

409
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,040
like for everything you just go

410
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,320
absolutely not I'm just gonna poop on

411
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,300
you right now so

412
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,760
um just understand your log sources and

413
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,620
this is again where environment notes

414
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,899
are very very handy um working with your

415
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:44,579
sock team is a great example here of

416
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:46,320
documenting all of your log sources that

417
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,380
you have that you know about in your sim

418
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,779
because obviously they are using the

419
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:52,920
same sim when they're doing their

420
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,660
investigations you're going to use the

421
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,740
Sim when you're doing your threat

422
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,260
hunting so it benefits everybody to know

423
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,060
what kind of Vlogs you have in there for

424
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,740
what applications and what those fields

425
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,720
actually mean and if you see something

426
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,980
wrong with them will you go and talk to

427
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,300
your logging team and say hey these

428
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,160
aren't ingesting properly or you said

429
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,480
these are supposed to be here but

430
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,220
they're not

431
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,320
um so very important to be and be

432
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,360
reasonable but hopeful right you know

433
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,579
like I said you can't get every log you

434
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:19,620
can't hug every cat

435
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,600
um but you can always have a wish list

436
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,399
of logs that you just wish you had and

437
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,800
you start focusing on this is why we

438
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,360
need these logs right we would have we

439
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,040
would have had this detection for this

440
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,959
incident but we couldn't because we had

441
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,240
a gap here and then you can show value

442
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,040
with adding that log source and then

443
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,480
hopefully with enough times or enough

444
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,700
incidents management would be like hey

445
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,440
maybe we should ingest those log sources

446
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,880
and they're like I told you and then you

447
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,260
move to the next one down the list you

448
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,720
just keep adding and adding but yeah be

449
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,579
careful what you wish for because

450
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:51,380
you might get a tsunami

451
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,600
um the next one

452
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,000
I don't know if anybody's ever been to

453
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,820
the kirkhaldi bridge testing Works in

454
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,920
southeast London on Salt Lake Road right

455
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,779
across the street from the Bluefin

456
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:06,180
building but they they test Bridges they

457
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,860
test the materials that well I don't

458
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,019
think they do it there anymore but they

459
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:11,519
used to test the you know the materials

460
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,600
or bridges in their building to make

461
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,980
sure it could handle the stress of

462
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,839
things and the things they have above

463
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,540
their door is facts not opinions and I

464
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,180
just think that is so important in in

465
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,980
the cyber security world and also in

466
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,959
threat hunting and it goes also along

467
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,720
with trust fund verify

468
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,760
um just realizing that you will not be a

469
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,740
hundred percent there's nothing 100 in

470
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,500
cyber security that is a fallacy and so

471
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,899
you will not be 100 correct or accurate

472
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:38,279
you know you you can try and be as

473
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:40,260
correct as you can but you have to just

474
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,000
realize that you're gonna there's times

475
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,620
you're gonna be wrong

476
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,120
um and realize that other people might

477
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,740
know more than you and that's perfectly

478
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,600
fine

479
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,820
um but so facts not opinions but trust

480
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,420
but verify so I think again the previous

481
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,860
uh presenter did a great job talking

482
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,899
about the the dangers of what I like to

483
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:00,120
call Twitter sock uh where there's just

484
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,579
so much interesting things and people

485
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,680
who claim to know everything because

486
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,600
they have a PhD and they refuse to

487
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,860
listen to somebody who doesn't have a

488
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,019
PhD and it's just you just need to make

489
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:11,820
sure you do your own research and again

490
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,279
not just in this but in life to make

491
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:15,660
sure that what they're saying is true

492
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,760
and you know call them out on it if

493
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,600
you're like well wait a minute what

494
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,459
about this and what about that because

495
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,800
people might say so perfect example is

496
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,120
people think oh yeah we're we're

497
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,820
collecting all of our you know AWS cloud

498
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,459
trail logs I'm like all of them like oh

499
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:30,899
yeah yeah and then you go and you take a

500
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:33,120
look you're like well I have these 50

501
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,579
accounts here but then when I go and I

502
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,500
check the Sim I found 40 and they're

503
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,880
like

504
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,139
yeah so about those 10 right so it's

505
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:45,180
just it's just trying to make sure that

506
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,440
you're getting as much as accurate

507
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,820
information as you possibly can

508
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,420
um

509
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,420
but the biggest thing I would say is to

510
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,980
prioritize I don't even I think maybe

511
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,480
number one is actually more important is

512
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,560
because you have it you need that

513
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,600
Network to help make your life a lot

514
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,540
easier but

515
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,160
prioritization is also very important

516
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,020
and realizing that things will fall

517
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,299
behind hunts will be put on the back

518
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:12,299
burner and you will not 100 agree with

519
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,880
what management thinks is a fire but you

520
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,439
know their management you kind of got to

521
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:19,079
do what they say but you know what is

522
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,880
the most important thing today

523
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,380
might not be important tomorrow because

524
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,299
like for example log 4J will come around

525
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:26,400
and everyone's like guess what you are

526
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,620
working on log4j until you pass out

527
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,080
you're like okay great and so that's

528
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,179
just something you need to realize and

529
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:35,280
not get bent out of shape about and if

530
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,480
there's any question about what you

531
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,580
should be prioritizing on you always ask

532
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,620
leadership because one they're the ones

533
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,240
who are approving your program and so

534
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,559
they should also have a good idea of

535
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:46,980
what they you should be focusing on

536
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,179
right

537
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:50,700
so this kind of

538
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,400
goes into the previous slide of the

539
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,400
threat hunting life cycle you know what

540
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,080
are you trying to answer like what is

541
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,760
the actual point of the hunt that you

542
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,280
are doing like I am trying to find if do

543
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,440
we have malicious activity around

544
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,799
scheduled tasks right YN right

545
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:10,200
um it's like your scientific method uh

546
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,140
what is your focus or your scope right

547
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,460
if you're if you're looking at the

548
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,380
registry you're not really caring too

549
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,240
much about Max right now right if you're

550
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,039
learning about LD preload well then

551
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,179
you're not worrying about Windows too

552
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:23,160
much so that is very important when

553
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,480
you're trying to realize like what your

554
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,460
log sources are so what what do I need

555
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,679
to be querying again to make my querying

556
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:31,380
as effective as possible

557
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,059
um what do I need to be looking at here

558
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:35,220
and you hopefully know these top three

559
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,780
things before you actually start your

560
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,480
hunting but obviously the third one is a

561
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,919
bit of a nebulous because you might not

562
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,780
know exactly what your data points are

563
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,919
it might be something that you've never

564
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,299
encountered before so like well I need

565
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:47,520
to go out and do some more generic

566
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,799
searching to find out what these log

567
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:53,418
sources are and what they would be

568
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:56,760
um okay and then in the middle bit that

569
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,440
is kind of where the white bit in the

570
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,700
middle is where the hunting is actually

571
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,260
happening so you're writing your queries

572
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,179
you're taking the results you're

573
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:04,740
analyzing them like you're doing stack

574
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,059
counting or you're doing like a time

575
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:08,640
chart and you're trying to find the the

576
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,559
pieces of thread that you're trying to

577
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,480
pull right so that's kind of where the

578
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,160
magic happens I suppose is just doing

579
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,020
your analysis and then once you take

580
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,919
your results you're doing the

581
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:18,539
investigation to try and figure out is

582
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:20,580
this normal is this benign is this

583
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,320
malicious right and then obviously if

584
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,460
you have something malicious then you're

585
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,559
escalating immediately but you're just

586
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,120
you know taking that collating that

587
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,280
adding to your environment notes of this

588
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,840
new log source that you found or like

589
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,059
this one machine that does this one

590
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:34,620
really weird thing but it's it's

591
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,080
approved we have a exception request for

592
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,280
it so you might as well put it in the

593
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,440
notes so then for the next time a thread

594
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,179
Hunter comes around and finds it they

595
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:43,919
know that okay that's that machine it's

596
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,720
meant to be doing that

597
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,500
so what are your results results can be

598
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,140
your escalations your detections or your

599
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,900
process improvements so you know what

600
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,760
what did you find did you find any

601
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,919
analysis um proof of Badness in your

602
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:00,539
network and we kind of

603
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:03,840
the the scope is normally between like

604
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,900
30 to 90 days but it depends on your log

605
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,940
sources sometimes you have a year

606
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,440
sometimes you don't have a year

607
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,620
sometimes you have you know 20 days or

608
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,140
14 days so it just depends on how much

609
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,440
logging you're doing at on your sim

610
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,940
um and then there's any gaps identified

611
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,679
and gaps can be you know people

612
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,860
processes and technology so where where

613
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,360
can you improve the thing like we're

614
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,880
missing a log Source or you know we

615
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,520
don't have these kind of processing

616
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,039
capabilities right now for this specific

617
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,360
uh event that's occurring

618
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:40,559
so

619
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,240
your final product is going to be a

620
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,360
report and I think every hunt has a

621
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,860
final report and that can be a very

622
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,000
small report of what I like to call

623
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,039
Micro hunts where it's just like I'm

624
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,320
focusing on this one query that I've

625
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,940
that you know Intel sent to me I don't

626
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,679
have to do this full full-blown hunting

627
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,460
thing

628
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,020
but you have your executive summary

629
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,419
which has your overview of why should

630
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:02,760
management care about this like has this

631
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,260
been actively leveraged against your

632
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,299
network successfully or unsuccessfully

633
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:08,820
in the past have we seen it before is

634
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,200
there a threat actor that's now starting

635
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,820
to use that that is currently very

636
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,059
interested in in our company

637
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:16,320
um that you know why should management

638
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,140
actually take a look at this report then

639
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,660
your findings so this is any escalations

640
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,360
to incident response they go here and

641
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,480
any high impact gaps like I couldn't

642
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,460
actually finish this hunt because I

643
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,480
don't have

644
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,880
blah right that is a huge gap it's

645
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,200
basically I can't I can't I couldn't

646
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,580
finish this or I couldn't give you

647
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,980
anything with High Fidelity because I'm

648
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,960
missing this

649
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,780
and and then yeah so that's usually the

650
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,820
stuff that your management looks at and

651
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,000
then processes along up the chain

652
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,280
and then your technical report is the

653
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,620
good stuff so this is where you put your

654
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,659
background information so you know I

655
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:56,640
think everybody now knows what the

656
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,740
registry is and run keys right I feel

657
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,820
like you don't really need to have a lot

658
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,260
of background information in that but

659
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,500
for maybe other harder to understand

660
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,059
Concepts to again from maybe a

661
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:08,159
management perspective like you start

662
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,039
talking about sliver beacons and Cobalt

663
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,780
strike and you know those kind of things

664
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,960
and profiles or dll proxying things that

665
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,059
maybe are a little bit harder to grasp

666
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:19,799
you always like to I always like to have

667
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:22,799
a little like what is xll files and how

668
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,179
are they executed and what does it look

669
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:26,640
like and why are they used because this

670
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,559
way then management doesn't go well I

671
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,460
don't know what the hell this is and

672
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,440
they just throw it out

673
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,360
um and then any searches that I do and

674
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,460
again with the the point is again with

675
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,500
that trust but verify if someone comes

676
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,000
and looks at my report they can run the

677
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,860
exact same query with the exact same

678
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,480
time frame and get the exact same

679
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,980
results that I did and they can follow

680
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,480
along with my process and my

681
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,700
investigation to say yes Melissa was

682
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,820
right this is benign or yes she was she

683
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,919
was wrong yeah you can Autumn audit my

684
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:55,140
work that's fine too but I'd like to

685
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,720
keep that transparency because it's very

686
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,179
important for learning purposes as well

687
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,340
and then of course the analysis of those

688
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,440
results

689
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,240
oh then I have an appendix of all the

690
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,740
the queries that I've created to

691
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,919
detection

692
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:14,159
so uh hunt scenarios

693
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,260
so like how do you actually what how do

694
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,940
you come up with ideas for for threat

695
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:22,140
hunting so can we find use of a TTP that

696
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,760
may be downloading malicious files from

697
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,500
the internet right so that's you know

698
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,780
your classic LOL bins or your GTFO bins

699
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,159
if you want to live in the Linux world

700
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:33,360
because uh why would Bad Guy Bad actors

701
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,179
take the risk of a custom tool which

702
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:38,220
increased chances of getting caught when

703
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,320
you can just use Curl or Powershell or

704
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,140
net or run it reflective in memory you

705
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,700
know why why would you want to do that

706
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,280
right so why not use what is already in

707
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,840
the environment so that is a great way

708
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,220
of starting and that's already

709
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,020
documented out on the internet and

710
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,340
actually knowing what's in your own

711
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,799
system 32 is also very important because

712
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:57,600
it obviously varies from operating

713
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,100
system to operating system so it's nice

714
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,360
to know what you have in your

715
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,640
environment and not just trust what you

716
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,320
know maybe low bins missed something and

717
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,360
then you can actually add to the to the

718
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,919
uh to the program which is always good

719
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,780
too

720
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,880
um and then like can we find use of

721
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,039
malicious scheduled tests because even

722
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:15,659
though a lot of things like to run in

723
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:18,000
memory uh usually they need to maintain

724
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,620
persistence in some way shape or form

725
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,299
because they want to survive a reboot if

726
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:23,220
a reboot is going to happen

727
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,140
um obviously if you're on a server

728
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,580
you're probably not going to reboot but

729
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,640
never mind that so malicious scheduled

730
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,280
tasks like running in roaming or in temp

731
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,159
or their VBS files or their batch files

732
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:37,980
or their Powershell or encoded base64

733
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,960
right if you start like running around

734
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,299
looking for the beginning of an M

735
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:44,640
portable executable file that has the

736
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,000
base64 encoding then it's like the TVR

737
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,740
or whatever you start searching for that

738
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,700
around your environment you're like well

739
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,620
is that normal again maybe it is normal

740
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,820
in your environment but you don't know

741
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,400
unless you find out and then make an

742
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,080
environment note about it so then you

743
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,039
have your little Wiki and you're

744
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,480
building up your repository of

745
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,280
interesting things

746
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,500
uh can we find thread act so I think

747
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,580
this is always an interesting one

748
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,340
because it's very hard to do this

749
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,620
um can we find threat actors enumerating

750
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,320
our Network once they have a foothold

751
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,640
um because obviously like once you hit

752
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,100
that you get inside the nice GUI center

753
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,780
right the lateral movement it can be

754
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,000
really hard to to detect depending on

755
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,860
what tools you have but if you think

756
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,600
about it from a red team or perspective

757
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,940
and I think we actually did it even in

758
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,919
the in the sliver thing yesterday like

759
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:30,960
the first thing you run when you get a

760
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,240
shell on a box is normally like who am I

761
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,960
or ipconfig or if you know who am I with

762
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,880
forward slash privileges or net commands

763
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,559
right so you want to know who I am what

764
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,059
privileges do I have and where am I on

765
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:43,679
the network and what is my network even

766
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,600
called and who are my friends in the

767
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,760
network my neighbors like in maybe rdp2

768
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,120
or you know impersonate credentials

769
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,159
um so you can say okay well of these 10

770
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:55,980
commands that of malicious actor had

771
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,140
normally runs if I see five of them

772
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,000
running in the span of

773
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,980
I don't know 10 seconds five seconds a

774
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,200
minute whatever I want to know about it

775
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,760
and then you go and investigate and say

776
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,860
is this normal yes no is it tied to a

777
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,140
script that's normally what it is

778
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,880
um that okay can I is there a way I can

779
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,980
whitelist that and then I can move on

780
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,659
with my hunting

781
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:17,880
right so that's always a really fun and

782
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,260
interesting one because you also you

783
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,340
find out a lot of interesting things

784
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,500
just in your network like why is this

785
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,320
thing calling W get out to tour like I

786
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,179
don't know it's very interesting I might

787
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:28,440
as well do some investigation and find

788
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,360
out

789
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,659
um real world Sub-Zero incidents so uh

790
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:36,419
log 4J solarwinds right those were great

791
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:38,820
because there was a lot of research

792
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,320
already done for you all you had to do

793
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,940
was basically convert it to the query

794
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,100
language of whatever your sim is and

795
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,140
then off you go

796
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,419
um I think that was uh solarwinds

797
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:49,740
happened when I first started working at

798
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,360
NBC and so they're like guess what this

799
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,919
is what you're doing I said okay I think

800
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:55,320
I came up with like 15 detection queries

801
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,779
from just you know all the documentation

802
00:26:57,779 --> 00:26:59,460
that everyone was like Microsoft was

803
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,440
putting out it was it was very nice it

804
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,059
was like well this is my job for the

805
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:04,440
rest of December and January and

806
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,779
February all sorted

807
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:08,460
um hey I heard Microsoft is finally

808
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,799
doing something about macros

809
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,260
um so what's next on the horizon right

810
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,960
this is this is another great way of um

811
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,460
going if you have an Intel team to go

812
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,679
talk to them and say Hey you know

813
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,020
um is fancy bear doing anything exciting

814
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,120
nowadays or are they changing their ttps

815
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,340
do they ever use macros before should we

816
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,980
be concerned and that's that's a great

817
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,740
uh resource to go and tap into so like

818
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,299
we've noticed like I think I've said it

819
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:37,200
before xll files isos zip encrypted zip

820
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,039
files with like JavaScript inside

821
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:42,779
extensions Chrome extensions are aligned

822
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:45,120
to like to go into now so again it's

823
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,520
saying okay well can we hunt for that in

824
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,260
our Network can we hunt for malicious

825
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,659
Chrome extensions

826
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:54,120
depending I don't know the jury's still

827
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,380
out and then what about

828
00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:00,720
um like Crow uh yeah Firefox or Edge

829
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,100
so

830
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,480
um you know do you have to be concerned

831
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,279
about that I don't know

832
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,360
um you have to know what's in your

833
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,460
network to find out

834
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,980
um on the cloud um do we have Cloud

835
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,440
logging to identify suspicious logins

836
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,640
activity

837
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,919
um is it normal that suddenly this this

838
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:19,500
user logged in from

839
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,360
I don't know Russia and started

840
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,279
disabling two-factor Authentication

841
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,080
and they started disabling versioning

842
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,220
you're like

843
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,679
uh I don't know is it and so again you

844
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:30,179
have to go to your the person in the

845
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:31,679
cloud that you know and say hey person

846
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,779
from the cloud that I know is this

847
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:35,460
normal YN

848
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,080
um and hopefully the answer is

849
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:41,220
well if it's yes why but if it's no well

850
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,980
initiate incident response go

851
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,480
um but the whole point of this though is

852
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,580
to you need to have a high confidence of

853
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,260
what you're doing it's pointless to

854
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,260
create a detection that the sock your

855
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,580
sock analysts are just gonna you know

856
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,620
like the boy who cried wolf kind of

857
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,380
concept right you're like oh yep yep yep

858
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,640
and then they just let one get through

859
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,880
we had a perfect example of that um

860
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,240
kind of like ticket

861
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,260
tiredness I don't know what the term is

862
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,600
but uh

863
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,679
one of our analysts like LED it through

864
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:12,120
and they said oh because it's it's a

865
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,159
valid file because the the metadata was

866
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,140
was said it was a legitimate NBC

867
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,600
Universal tool I shouldn't be saying

868
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,399
this story but um

869
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,140
they and I looked at it I'm like that

870
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,720
just doesn't seem right because the our

871
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,179
tool was saying it had a very unique

872
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:28,740
prevalence in our Network and I said if

873
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,779
it's a if it's a tool that we've created

874
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:33,059
surely it should be everywhere in our

875
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:34,080
environment

876
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,659
what is so special about this one random

877
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:40,200
you know laptop turns out it was uh it

878
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,179
was a red team so

879
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:44,399
um that was great that was that was you

880
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:45,360
know it was just one of those things

881
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,159
where we were just very very lucky in

882
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:48,240
catching it

883
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,559
um

884
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:51,659
so yeah so don't mind me just waiting

885
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:54,000
for my sim query to finish

886
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,380
um just again that's why scoping is

887
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,360
really important so don't just go around

888
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,580
searching all of your indices you know

889
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,500
try and be a specifically vague as

890
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,700
possible is what I like to say

891
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,440
um other great hunts to start with are

892
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,960
ones with easy-ish answers so I think

893
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,419
process hierarchy is always a really

894
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:14,039
good one to start with

895
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:17,640
um the hunt evil PDF by Sans is I I

896
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,440
don't make any money off of sounds I

897
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,580
wish I did

898
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,080
um but they're that's great for system

899
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,659
processes so um you know if it's every

900
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:26,340
time you boot up a Windows 11 box it's

901
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,200
gonna you know run these 15 processes

902
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,460
and this is going to be the parent of

903
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,720
this and if you start seeing

904
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,980
discrepancies

905
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:35,100
why is that again maybe it's normal for

906
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,240
your environment but you don't know

907
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,580
unless you find out

908
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,440
um is your web is your web processes

909
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,960
your w3p

910
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,179
w3wp is that suddenly spawning you know

911
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:47,820
command.xc or VB script or you know

912
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,500
calling cert util you're like wait a

913
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,059
minute this isn't normal is this normal

914
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:53,220
YN again you have to go and do the

915
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,539
research to find out it's like a fun

916
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:58,440
little game of of cat and mouse

917
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,240
um well scripting processes with a

918
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,440
parent of Word and Excel this is

919
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,659
probably going to go away with with

920
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:05,820
macros going away

921
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,140
um but you never knew you know your

922
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,159
company can still say well we need

923
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,679
macros we need them so we have to allow

924
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:11,820
them to be downloaded from the internet

925
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,440
okay

926
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,000
um but again when I worked for a

927
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,700
financial institution they used macros

928
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,880
in Excel all the time so just saying oh

929
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,799
you can block this because it's bad well

930
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,500
have you are you sure it's bad like we

931
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,320
use it all the time so I can't say the

932
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,720
fact that I see a macro running you know

933
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,179
from Excel is bad if it's going out to

934
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:34,559
the internet now I might be a little bit

935
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,240
more interested right so you need to

936
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,919
know what your network is is what is

937
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,020
normal in your network

938
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,820
and then once where the heavy lifting is

939
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,500
done for you so your external

940
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,200
intelligence these are just a sampling

941
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,419
of ones that you can go and take a look

942
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:50,580
at and they usually have the work done

943
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,380
for you already in the the miter attack

944
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,840
which everyone loves now and has you

945
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,260
know accepted as their savior so

946
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,880
um it's great because then all you have

947
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,919
to do again is just convert it to to

948
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,260
your querying Sim language and then

949
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,940
you're good to go

950
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,380
um but then yeah just be careful with

951
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,000
Twitter sock because

952
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,399
it's just it's like the wild west out

953
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:14,899
there so it's a lot of weird people

954
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,899
um

955
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:18,539
are there great hunts just lots of great

956
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:20,820
ideas so ones where you know you have

957
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,799
gaps so I I mentioned the attack

958
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,960
framework right so one of the the nice

959
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,940
things that we like to talk about when I

960
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,320
was a consultant was if you have your

961
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,940
miter attack framework you have all the

962
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,120
thousands of techniques right and you

963
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,279
start them with all all of them read say

964
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,200
we have no detections for anything

965
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,880
and then you are you obviously you start

966
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,620
to populate it based on whatever your

967
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,960
you know anti-virus and your EDR and all

968
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,159
that stuff so it starts to hopefully

969
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,580
change from red to greenish right

970
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,500
there's never 100 percent

971
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,360
and then you say okay well where do we

972
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,179
have gaps in our in our miter attack

973
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:55,980
framework okay well let's start hunting

974
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,140
in there because we know that there's a

975
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,919
visibility gap an even better is if you

976
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,720
can actually talk to your Intel team and

977
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,559
say of these 40 red gaps that we have

978
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,779
which ones are the threat actors that we

979
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,059
care about which ones are they using

980
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:13,620
and then you're like I'm being so this

981
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,940
way you're being as effective as

982
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,679
possible in your threat hunting it has

983
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:20,340
the greatest return on investment

984
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,380
um and then yeah talking to your IO your

985
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,179
IR folks if they hit you once they can

986
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:25,740
hit you again

987
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,659
um is anyone like is like talking about

988
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:29,220
uh different things it's like everyone

989
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,860
seems to focus on Windows but do you

990
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,179
have Macs in your environment do you

991
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:35,159
have Linux in your environment what what

992
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:36,840
you know who who are running them what

993
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,279
kind of programs are they running you

994
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:40,919
know we obviously at our my company we

995
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:42,779
have lots of video editing so obviously

996
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:44,399
they're a very Mac heavy environment

997
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,220
what kind of malware is is currently

998
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,960
targeting a lot of Mac users for for

999
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,299
whatever reason do we have detections

1000
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:54,240
for that how good is your EDR tool with

1001
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,100
other operating systems if you if you

1002
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,299
have them because everyone seems to be

1003
00:33:57,299 --> 00:33:59,519
so focused on Windows they kind of

1004
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,760
usually forget about Linux and Mac

1005
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,480
um

1006
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,580
and then ones from management managers

1007
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,679
have a good view of your company in

1008
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,960
terms of Direction and they kind of see

1009
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,399
what's on the horizon they know about

1010
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:13,080
the new applications being on board and

1011
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,339
they know about all these extra things

1012
00:34:14,339 --> 00:34:16,560
going on that because in some you know

1013
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,399
security does tend to operate in a silo

1014
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,139
they think you know this security is

1015
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:23,460
important I don't understand why you

1016
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,619
guys have to do this roll out of this

1017
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:27,119
application next week we have so many

1018
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,379
problems with it but it's like well

1019
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:30,179
we're going to lose a couple billion

1020
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:32,159
pounds if we don't so

1021
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,780
you kind of gotta you know so management

1022
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,699
understands that and they try and liaise

1023
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:39,980
to make that a less painful as possible

1024
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,659
um but at the end of the day

1025
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:45,659
uh start small and have reasonable goals

1026
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:47,399
agreed with management so don't don't

1027
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:49,139
start your threat hunting program with

1028
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:52,619
the you know I'm gonna find a bear uh

1029
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:54,839
Russia a Russian actor by the end of the

1030
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:56,159
year you're like well that's

1031
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,020
that's a lofty goal it's it's admirable

1032
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,580
but why don't you just start with

1033
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:02,040
something smaller like just try and have

1034
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,359
a couple of detections that you've

1035
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,580
actually actioned into alerts

1036
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,440
um right a certain number of reports

1037
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,800
like I think a threat hunt normally for

1038
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,500
us is about two weeks from like start to

1039
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,460
finish

1040
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,260
um obviously but like 30 to 90 days of

1041
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:19,320
querying historically just to cover our

1042
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,660
bases but you know that it depends on

1043
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,240
your organization and how big it is

1044
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,920
um and if it isn't working change the

1045
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,900
process the joy of when you create your

1046
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,880
own if you're creating this program is

1047
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,560
that you can change it right it's small

1048
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,180
it's not like this big manageable thing

1049
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,440
you're like oh God now we got to go

1050
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,579
through this change management process

1051
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:38,220
like it's just starting out just if it's

1052
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,020
not working just just change it it's

1053
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:43,619
it's quite simple and again don't settle

1054
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:46,140
for we've always done it this way

1055
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,940
um I've worked in many companies where

1056
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,220
especially some of them where they've

1057
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,320
just been doing this one thing for

1058
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,579
hundreds of years and they're like well

1059
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:55,020
we never had to worry about this before

1060
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,060
you're like well the world has kind of

1061
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,380
moved on now

1062
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,880
um so we can't we can't always be doing

1063
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,619
things like this right you have to you

1064
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:05,220
have to adapt or die that kind of thing

1065
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,260
um I shouldn't say start humble it's

1066
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,240
always be humble because there are so

1067
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,280
many smart people in this room and

1068
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,599
everywhere and you can learn so much

1069
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:14,220
from so many people if you just kind of

1070
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,680
take the chance to just open your open

1071
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,619
your brain and just learn from everybody

1072
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:21,900
because it's a it's a big wide world out

1073
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,560
there

1074
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,599
and it's okay to stand on the shoulders

1075
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,820
of giants but make sure you give credit

1076
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,020
where credit is due because there's

1077
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,720
nothing worse than someone taking your

1078
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,220
work and not giving you any credit for

1079
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,200
you're like well that then you're less

1080
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,680
apt to be so helpful in the future

1081
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,140
and realize that not every hunt will end

1082
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,579
with a kill

1083
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:43,079
um but rest easier knowing that your

1084
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:45,420
trap has been set so you know you have a

1085
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,859
threat actor that has landed on your

1086
00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:48,180
network via

1087
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,820
whatever method but you've created all

1088
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,619
these detections so they have absolutely

1089
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:54,720
nowhere to go now so you'll get so

1090
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,980
you'll find them and then but the nice

1091
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,599
thing is if they do land on network now

1092
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:58,680
you're like now we can try and catch

1093
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,200
them even further right so it's always a

1094
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,240
it's always a game so

1095
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:07,619
that is that is it so that's this is me

1096
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:11,040
um if anybody has any questions comments

1097
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,900
concerns

1098
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,740
oh yes

1099
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:21,540
there's no such thing

1100
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:25,260
find the role slash profile of a thread

1101
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,140
Hunter as compared to the other roles in

1102
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:31,380
the infosec field so I consider a threat

1103
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,660
oh God these lights are super bright

1104
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,700
um I consider a threat Hunter as someone

1105
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,280
whose Act is searching for active

1106
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,200
someone who is searching for actors

1107
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,420
actively in your environment like right

1108
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,119
now so you're already assumed compromise

1109
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,520
already what are they doing in your

1110
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,920
network so it's like malware I threat

1111
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,180
actors you can just say you could also

1112
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,380
just say malware running in your

1113
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,760
environment like we're not always

1114
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,800
assuming you know there's a there's

1115
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,339
China or Russia or whatever nation state

1116
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:01,200
you want to insert here is is in your

1117
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,760
network but there's there's always bad

1118
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,260
in your network right so a threat Hunter

1119
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,420
is meant to be finding helping to find

1120
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,079
that Badness

1121
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,180
and another one for me uh how do you

1122
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,400
apply threat hunting or how would you

1123
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,500
apply threat hunting principles to

1124
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,960
integrated third-party suppliers like

1125
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,579
for example Cloud providers in your

1126
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:22,940
platform

1127
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,020
all right

1128
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,880
um it's like at least I'm not the first

1129
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,640
talk uh it's it's very hard because

1130
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,780
obviously like you mean like you're

1131
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,920
onboarding them like

1132
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:34,760
yeah

1133
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,780
let's say you're using a payment

1134
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,240
processor yeah so

1135
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,060
um that's usually where we have to get

1136
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,099
heavily involved with our security

1137
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:45,420
architecture and engineering team

1138
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:48,240
because they kind of do like they look

1139
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,920
at the the company's Network and they

1140
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,020
kind of do some poking around and then

1141
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,480
if we get a for a loud access

1142
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,460
we can kind of look around their network

1143
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,260
but normally we don't normally get that

1144
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,579
they're like well no no you have to sign

1145
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:01,380
on the dotted line before and have our

1146
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,760
networks merge before you can take a

1147
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,780
look and see what's in our Network

1148
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:06,420
you're like okay but it's one of those

1149
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,859
things where you have to ask them like

1150
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:09,960
what do you have do you have a forensic

1151
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,820
do you have an IR program do you have a

1152
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,800
threat hunting program can you walk us

1153
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,720
through you know one of your examples

1154
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,160
that you've had or can we talk to them

1155
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,020
can you show us like what you've done

1156
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,180
because you know where are you in the

1157
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,740
maturity level and it's kind of

1158
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,320
unfortunately it is kind of trusting but

1159
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,180
trust but verify right so you're kind of

1160
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,740
like asking them to show their work I

1161
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,420
don't know if that answers your question

1162
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:34,140
okay okay

1163
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,500
just to follow up from the last question

1164
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,320
thank you would it be appropriate

1165
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,780
because you spoke of C yes and the thing

1166
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,880
everyone's talking about now is saw

1167
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,000
so in that scenario where we've got our

1168
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,160
corporate thing yeah we've got our

1169
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,859
corporate login steam Strokes or yes

1170
00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:54,960
would it be appropriate to share with

1171
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,540
your third parties perhaps an input into

1172
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,400
the saw even if it's just a manual or

1173
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,640
hopefully a feed is that something you

1174
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,280
would consider a good thing

1175
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,320
I mean you mean like ingesting their

1176
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,119
logs into your sim

1177
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,920
yes

1178
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,060
that's fine I can hear you

1179
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,460
specifically thinking of if they had an

1180
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,859
incident yeah and we were aware of it

1181
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:22,200
yes that was making them manually put a

1182
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,240
ticket into the saw and if you haven't

1183
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,880
got a feed for whatever reason yet right

1184
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,099
there might be an appropriate time where

1185
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:31,020
they're on the Fret huh so we have had

1186
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,960
instances in the past in multiple jobs

1187
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,520
not just this this one that I'm

1188
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,440
currently in where you've had a third

1189
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,940
party compromise and you said look we

1190
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,920
need to we need your logs we need we

1191
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,240
need to see there's action happening

1192
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,099
here and we have like what we like to

1193
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:46,380
call Hot wash meetings you know during

1194
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,260
the incident so they can you know tell

1195
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,520
us what's going on and they're like okay

1196
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,960
can you actually give us those logs

1197
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,880
because we want to verify what you've

1198
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,040
done and then you know okay now how are

1199
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,740
you actively proactively fixing this in

1200
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,820
your environment you know how are you

1201
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,079
how are you going to fix this so it's

1202
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:02,160
not going to happen again in the future

1203
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,720
and then of course we're taking that

1204
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,099
we're making sure that our environment

1205
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:08,460
is also clear but yeah like

1206
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,260
sometimes we get the logs and sometimes

1207
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,940
we don't that's one of the problems like

1208
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,220
you have to get all these like n ndas

1209
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,660
and stuff depending on the third party

1210
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,799
that you're talking with

1211
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,839
yeah I would say so

1212
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,078
okay

1213
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:27,300
thank you hello I can't say oh hello oh

1214
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,760
you're right there okay so it seems to

1215
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,339
me that everybody wants to be a red team

1216
00:41:31,339 --> 00:41:34,200
I don't and that seems to be the thing

1217
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,200
but um I think threat hunting is a

1218
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,060
really really interesting angle of cyber

1219
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:41,220
security yeah how many people are coming

1220
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,839
to you and saying look this is the

1221
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:44,579
direction of travel I want to go in this

1222
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:46,680
is kind of straddling that Blue Team

1223
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,839
Angle but have an understanding of

1224
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,720
exactly the types of yeah techniques and

1225
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,980
things that you're using red teaming

1226
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,020
yeah no quite a few because it is it's a

1227
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,240
it's it's a Perfect Blend it's like a

1228
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,460
it's like a lovely red wine it's it's a

1229
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,720
great blend of red teaming and blue

1230
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,040
teaming and I actually should have put a

1231
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,780
thing on here is just researching like

1232
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,280
having your own lab so like the the

1233
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,200
thing with the sliver yesterday the

1234
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,760
every the whole time all I could think

1235
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,099
about was I wish I was home it was my

1236
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:13,079
lab and I had all my stuff set up and

1237
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:14,460
then I could actually be just trying to

1238
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,079
monitor because like you were talking

1239
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,180
doing a token impersonation and stuff

1240
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,800
like that and depending on your EDR you

1241
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,900
can detect that like Integrity levels

1242
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,880
changing from users suddenly from

1243
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,220
regular like from medium to high and

1244
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,420
suddenly they're using impersonation

1245
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,300
tokens instead of primary tokens like is

1246
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,820
that normal it might not be right but

1247
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,579
you don't know unless you you check

1248
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:37,020
um but that's all I wanted to do like

1249
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,280
when I was listening to all these talks

1250
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,480
yesterday I was like oh God I just want

1251
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,099
to test this out I want to test this out

1252
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:42,900
my life so always trying to be curious I

1253
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,820
guess is a great thing to have as well

1254
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,200
but there's a lot of people that are

1255
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,579
really interested in threat hunting they

1256
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:50,160
just don't know where to start so yeah

1257
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,320
it seems to have become the the sort of

1258
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,640
the area that you have to focus on

1259
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,079
because even as a red team you need to

1260
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:55,740
understand

1261
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,079
a lot of the Bluetooth inside and you

1262
00:42:58,079 --> 00:42:59,400
know what to it then you know what to

1263
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,020
attack yeah so it seems to be like the

1264
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,640
perfect mix of basically we're saying

1265
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,960
everybody should have a strong

1266
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,760
understanding of what it is to threat

1267
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,560
hunt yeah and especially like you said

1268
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,660
with the the Frameworks being so

1269
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:13,260
amazing nowadays and free uh some of

1270
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,880
them it's it's you know it's really hard

1271
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,220
as a blue teamer to do your job so you

1272
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,420
can't you know let's let's give the blue

1273
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,980
team a break and you know if we have

1274
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,839
threat Hunters that are also

1275
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,640
snooping around in our environment they

1276
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,440
get you know get a little safer on the

1277
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,180
inside but better sleep for your CSO

1278
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,020
which is only

1279
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:31,160
awesome thank you

1280
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:34,260
just another follow-up and a similar

1281
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,760
question to the one I asked I want to

1282
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,800
put my sunglasses on what are you going

1283
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,980
I mean without specifics do you feel

1284
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,839
there's some extra measures you want to

1285
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:45,540
be looking at perhaps registry keys on

1286
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,640
certificates and promotions you just

1287
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,400
said so do you feel there's a need for

1288
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,740
an extra layer around your active

1289
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:55,800
directory uh

1290
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,180
I'm not sure I understand the question

1291
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,700
I'm sorry so you just mentioned the

1292
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:02,339
thing that users might go from one level

1293
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:04,740
to a higher level and presumably that's

1294
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,300
all backed up with some sort of

1295
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,480
certificate that gets implemented by an

1296
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,940
active directory silver or gold ticket

1297
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,400
yeah so do you feel there's an extra

1298
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,339
layer that we might call today fret

1299
00:44:17,339 --> 00:44:19,859
hunting that might become a new

1300
00:44:19,859 --> 00:44:22,380
type of protection around the active

1301
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:26,119
directory itself yeah I think

1302
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,460
it's always considered I would think a

1303
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,020
crown jewel of

1304
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,339
his rate so you should always have

1305
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:34,079
additional layers of protection around

1306
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,140
that and most companies that I did

1307
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,160
Consulting with that was definitely

1308
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,839
something we would say you always want

1309
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,640
to have a little bit more uh stringent

1310
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,040
alerting and protocols around active

1311
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,480
directory and you also don't want anyone

1312
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,760
to be rdping into your domain

1313
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,619
controllers right that is a big No-No

1314
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:51,000
like you should have jump servers and

1315
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
all these extra layers of security

1316
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,839
I don't know if that answers your

1317
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:56,060
question okay

1318
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,960
[Music]

1319
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,220
oh

1320
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:01,879
okay

1321
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:04,319
I feel like I'm gonna get a sunburn here

1322
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,140
this is this is crazy

1323
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:10,800
is okay so what will you expect to see

1324
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,839
from architectural engineering that will

1325
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:14,940
help you with hunting

1326
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:18,319
um so architect there is

1327
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,040
to use it for like onboarding new

1328
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,020
technologies so they're the ones who

1329
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,880
take a look at the security posture and

1330
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,040
they also make recommendations in terms

1331
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,020
of the log sources that we're going to

1332
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,140
need for for to be ingested for for us

1333
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,819
from a security perspective so we engage

1334
00:45:35,819 --> 00:45:37,560
with them a lot because they say hey

1335
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,000
this is this new thing that we're coming

1336
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,540
out with this new platform or whatever

1337
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,980
microtransactional thing you know these

1338
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,000
are the things that we're talking about

1339
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,800
do you think this is enough to be doing

1340
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,119
threat hunting in your you know doing

1341
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:49,920
your job effectively which is always

1342
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,119
really hard because I don't know the

1343
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:52,619
answer sometimes because I'm just like

1344
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:53,880
I've never heard of this before so I

1345
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,280
have to do research but that's usually

1346
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,020
how we engage with them and they kind of

1347
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,880
you know let us know of new things that

1348
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,260
might be of interest to us from a

1349
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,700
security like hey this could be very

1350
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,200
important if some if someone was to

1351
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,940
compromise this we would be in big

1352
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:08,040
trouble does that answer your question

1353
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,540
okay

1354
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,880
oh please

1355
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,619
are we done oh

1356
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:16,500
um uh last question okay

1357
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,980
yep

1358
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,500
have you ever been involved in a threat

1359
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,640
at home where you've accidentally

1360
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,220
alerted through actors have I ever been

1361
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,500
like where I've like triggered malware

1362
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,400
that's phoned home

1363
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,540
oh

1364
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:40,800
uh not in my professional capacity no

1365
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,839
but when I

1366
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:44,940
you know when I was when I researched

1367
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,140
stuff there have been times where I've

1368
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,640
accidentally done something where I

1369
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,099
haven't been in my VMS correctly or I

1370
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:52,140
forgot to turn off networking

1371
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,579
um but that's why you have a VM right

1372
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:55,800
you're trying to just like oh shoot and

1373
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,319
you go backwards um but yeah so I think

1374
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,599
that yes I have but not not in a

1375
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:03,319
professional capacity

1376
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:05,940
and with it thank you everybody for your

1377
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:07,800
questions and let's thank Melissa again

1378
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,319
for a wonderful presentation

1379
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:12,740
uh
