00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:05,040
my name is Klaus schmee I'm a German I.T

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,980
security consultant crypto expert crypto

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,760
blogger and book all the if you're

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,920
interested in my blog about code

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,800
breaking and cryptography check the URL

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,460
shmay.org and there's also a book I can

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,699
recommend the book is titled code

8
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,980
breaking a practical guide

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,340
I co-wrote it with my friend ilanka

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,059
dunian from the USA and the book is

11
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,120
about paper and pencil encryption and

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,360
how to break systems on of this kind

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,620
with modern means

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,600
and this is what I'm going to talk today

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,320
it's about cyphus and crime about crimes

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,460
that involve encrypted messages and let

17
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,000
me start with a case that took place in

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,640
the 19th century

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,820
um I wish I could show you a few

20
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,260
original pictures of this case but as

21
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,840
far as I know there aren't any or at

22
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,720
least not very many so what I did I

23
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,360
created pictures myself

24
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,880
uh using Lego bricks yes and

25
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,460
this is the start of this story it's

26
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,540
about a man named Henry the bosnis Henry

27
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,180
de bosnis came to Essex County in the

28
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,079
U.S state of New York in the year

29
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,640
1882

30
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,220
he was a stranger nobody no nobody knew

31
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,920
him and almost immediately he started

32
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,259
courting a widow named Elizabeth Wells

33
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:51,899
and after only a few weeks

34
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,119
the two married

35
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,759
and in fact this was not the first

36
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,579
marriage of Henry de bosnis his first

37
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,119
wife Judith died after seven years of

38
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,939
marriage the second one named Celestine

39
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,680
after 10 years

40
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,300
and in fact uh Elizabeth didn't survive

41
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,540
the wedding very long either because she

42
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,819
was found dead only a few weeks later

43
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:24,360
she was both stabbed and shot at the

44
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,680
same time and all this happened within a

45
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,200
very short time frame uh the Boston's

46
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,060
arrival was on May the 1st and five

47
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,879
weeks later the two married and two

48
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:39,599
months later Elizabeth was killed and of

49
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,420
course Henry the bosnis soon became the

50
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,800
prime suspect he was arrested and put

51
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,980
into Trio and he while he was waiting

52
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,599
for his trial in jail he created

53
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,879
documents he wrote poems he painted

54
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,620
pictures and he created a number of

55
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,120
encrypted texts

56
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,680
I will come back to these later

57
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,620
on January the 20th

58
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:14,099
1883 the trial began Henry de poison

59
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:17,519
said I'm innocent the blood on my knife

60
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,159
was the blood of a chipmunk

61
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,700
well in fact the jury didn't believe him

62
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,920
so

63
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,159
on April the 16th he was found guilty

64
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:34,019
and a few days later he was hanged

65
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:35,519
and

66
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,239
what you see here is a ticket you had to

67
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,400
purchase if you want to witness this

68
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,739
hanging so it was not that easy you

69
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:45,840
could not just go there and watch it you

70
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,060
had to I think you didn't have to buy it

71
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,120
but you did have to have a ticket well

72
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,400
if you want to know more about this case

73
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,159
there's a book about it written by Jerry

74
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,459
Farnsworth the book is titled the

75
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,980
Adirondack enigma

76
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,040
and there's another interesting source

77
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,400
of information that's the local Museum

78
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,180
the Adirondack History Museum to my

79
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,099
regret I've never been there but my

80
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:16,738
friend and co-author ilon cartoon went

81
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:18,600
there just a few weeks ago

82
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,460
and she looked at the bosnis exhibits

83
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,680
here you can see the encrypted or one of

84
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,380
the encrypted messages and on this

85
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,080
picture you can see the skull of Henry D

86
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,600
bosnis and The Hangman's rope so if

87
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
you're interested things like these you

88
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,699
should go there one day

89
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:41,160
but what is more interesting for us is

90
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,540
that there are still a few open

91
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,900
questions about this case uh one

92
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,560
question is was the botanist guilty

93
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,900
the second question is did he murder his

94
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,120
two wife his first two wives too just

95
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,060
remember that his two first marriages

96
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,000
didn't last very long either

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,880
so perhaps these questions could be

98
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,560
answered

99
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,199
if it was possible to solve the

100
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,360
encrypted messages he wrote while in

101
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,720
jail well all together he created four

102
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,780
encrypted messages and these are

103
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,780
excerpts and as you can imagine if you

104
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,699
look at these messages they are very

105
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:24,000
difficult to analyze because the

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,280
alphabet is pretty large there are many

107
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,740
different symbols and if you know code

108
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,259
breaking tools such as frequency

109
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,139
analysis or word pattern search or

110
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,539
things like that they are very hard to

111
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:38,160
apply here because there are so many

112
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,840
different symbols that for example a

113
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,039
frequency analysis doesn't tell very

114
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:45,479
much

115
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,280
but perhaps if we look at this

116
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,100
particular encrypted message maybe this

117
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,199
is a little easier because this looks

118
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,419
like a poem and in fact while the

119
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,120
business was in prison he also wrote a

120
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,460
poem that looked pretty similar and this

121
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,100
one is readable it's written in Greek

122
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,560
letters I think it's nothing he created

123
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,620
himself it's uh some known poem but he

124
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,600
wrote it down in Greek letters and of

125
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,100
course when code Breakers looked at it

126
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,740
they thought well maybe this is a grip

127
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,780
that will help us to break this

128
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,880
encryption but

129
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,699
this was not the case

130
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:22,319
so

131
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,880
if you're looking for an interesting

132
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,340
Challenge and if you want to solve a

133
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,800
crime or if you want to find out more

134
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,380
about a crime that happened 130 years

135
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:35,699
ago here's something you can do a very

136
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,620
interesting case very interesting

137
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,979
encryption and this encryption is still

138
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:43,979
unsolved

139
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:47,280
but it's uh well I put this at the

140
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,500
beginning of my talk because this is a

141
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,780
typical example of a crime related

142
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,020
cryptogram and this is not nothing

143
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,660
unusual there are many crimes that

144
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,440
involve encrypted messages and I will

145
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,259
introduce a few of these in my talk

146
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:06,720
today

147
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,280
let's look back at the agenda

148
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,319
the second case or it's more than one

149
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:16,740
case but the second Story collection I

150
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,380
want to introduce today is about prison

151
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,060
ciphers

152
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,680
and this chapter will start in Sarasota

153
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,900
Florida

154
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:31,979
in the south east of the USA

155
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:36,300
in Sarasota in the year 2004 a 12 year

156
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,639
old girl was murdered her name was Carly

157
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,319
brucha and when police investigated this

158
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,099
crime they found that at the local car

159
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:53,780
wash there was a surveillance video

160
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,539
where could be seen that Carly butcher

161
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:01,280
met a man and this man took her with him

162
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,620
and in fact when this video was shown on

163
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,460
TV it didn't take very long until until

164
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,740
this man was identified he was

165
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,740
identified as Joseph P Smith

166
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,500
and of course he was arrested and it

167
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,180
turned out that he was really the

168
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,240
murderer of Carla brucha

169
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,539
so why Joseph P Smith was in jail

170
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,539
waiting for his trial he tried to send

171
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:31,139
an encrypted message to his brother

172
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:33,419
he wasn't successful because the prison

173
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,839
staff intercepted this message and now

174
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:40,200
of course police code Breakers wanted to

175
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,719
decipher this message because they hope

176
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,700
that it would contain evidence that

177
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,120
would be helpful for example

178
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,839
on Court and

179
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:55,680
apparently they were successful but um

180
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,600
in the Press you could only read about

181
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,180
the encrypted message this solution was

182
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,700
not published which was of course a

183
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,140
little annoying to me because I'm

184
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,120
interested in things like these so what

185
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,420
I did is in 2040 I introduced this

186
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,240
message on my blog and I asked my blog

187
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,300
readers to decipher it I could even say

188
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,060
tell them what the message is about but

189
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,800
I didn't know the encryption system and

190
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,720
didn't take very long until my block

191
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,240
reader news scopal with a very good code

192
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,540
breaker found out what was going on here

193
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,100
well first of all he found out that

194
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,440
uh sign or each sign belongs to a number

195
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,200
so for example the first letter in this

196
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,200
encrypted message would be plus five and

197
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,000
then we have a five and then we have a

198
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,060
plus one so if there's a sign before the

199
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,100
message it belongs together that's what

200
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,860
he found out and he found out that the

201
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,380
text needs to be read backwards to make

202
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,140
sense and then he used a couple of

203
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,140
standard code breaking techniques and he

204
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,899
found the solution and this is what you

205
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:03,839
see here the encryption table so if you

206
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,420
want to encrypt an a take the minus one

207
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,260
B is a minus two and for example if you

208
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,839
want to encrypt the J it's this divided

209
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,980
symbol for load by a one so not an

210
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,399
especially good encryption so this is

211
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,959
why it was

212
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:24,899
broken by the police code Breakers this

213
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:26,779
is the plain text

214
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:30,360
it says I wish I had something juicy to

215
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,640
say and so on it's basically a message

216
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,519
from the murderer to his brother and the

217
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,500
murderer tells his brother to get rid of

218
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,320
of some evidence so it was quite an

219
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,959
important message for the police and it

220
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,660
was used on Court and this shows once

221
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,640
again that police code breaking or

222
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,279
forensic code breaking is something

223
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,800
quite important

224
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,019
so if you want to read the message here

225
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:56,220
we have an eye

226
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,279
then it is followed by a w then it

227
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,040
followed by an L which should actually

228
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,740
be an I but this happens quite often if

229
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,620
one examines messages of this kind that

230
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,980
there are spelling errors which makes

231
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,360
things a little more complicated

232
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,319
okay

233
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,820
so the message or the clear text was

234
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,779
used in court and in 2006 Joseph Smith

235
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:30,480
was sentenced to death but the death

236
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,420
sentence is not yet enforced so the

237
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,940
moment is in the Union Correctional

238
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,640
Institution in Rayford Florida waiting

239
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,160
for his execution

240
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,100
and in this case the case is solved and

241
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,260
the message cases the message is solved

242
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,100
too

243
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,680
let's now go to another place in the USA

244
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,380
to all the Albany the capital of the

245
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,440
state of New York Albany is the home of

246
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,980
Gary Clemens Gary Clements is a forensic

247
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,680
code breaker and he's one of the very

248
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,100
few forensic code Breakers I know or one

249
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,800
of the few who is known to the public at

250
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,300
least his name is known to the public

251
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,720
I've met him once he didn't want his

252
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,760
picture to be taken because he wants to

253
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,160
stay Anonymous and he has written a

254
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,959
quite interesting book gain codes

255
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,440
deciphered so this is a book about gank

256
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,140
hosts and how to break them although

257
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,420
these are very interesting examples of

258
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,760
forensic code breaking very interesting

259
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,959
book

260
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,180
and this is one message that is

261
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,320
described uh in this book this is

262
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,200
um message not sent from a prison inmate

263
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,139
but it's sent to a prison inmate this

264
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:47,700
took place in Pennsylvania in 2013 and

265
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,100
um Gary Clements examined this encrypted

266
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,260
message she also solved it but later he

267
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,000
found out that it would have been a lot

268
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,820
easier than going through all this

269
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,220
analysis stuff does anybody recognize

270
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,279
what's going on here

271
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:07,500
yes exactly it's a Star Wars Cipher well

272
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,490
let me first explain what it is about

273
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:10,860
[Music]

274
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,579
um

275
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:14,220
here's some somebody writes I could not

276
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,620
find a generator online but there is an

277
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,139
aurabish font that you can download and

278
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:22,560
so on it's about taking pictures of

279
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,540
snowflakes I don't know if this is a

280
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,880
code expression for something or if it's

281
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,779
just a hobby but at least

282
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:32,700
um Gary Clements was successful in

283
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,279
breaking it and it turned out that it

284
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,800
was a Star Wars font also known as

285
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,200
aurobish so of course if he had known

286
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,120
this the whole code breaking process

287
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,120
would have been a lot shorter but anyway

288
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,760
it was also possible to do it in a more

289
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,440
complicated way

290
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,959
here's another message

291
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:52,800
um

292
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,500
that is described in Gary Clement's book

293
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,620
this is from a present inmate to his

294
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,860
spouse and if you look at this you see

295
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,639
that every word ends with a y p

296
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,160
the reason for this is simply that the

297
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,700
YP shall confuse the code breaker so one

298
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,459
can simply omit this white piece this is

299
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:16,800
what Gary Clemens did

300
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,500
and it turned out to be a Caesar Cipher

301
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,019
which is the most simple Cipher of all

302
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:24,600
which simply means that the alphabet is

303
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,600
shifted by a few units what you see here

304
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,660
is the key and if we read this message

305
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,579
this one is very interesting because

306
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:35,519
this is about smart links drugs into

307
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,320
prison so the sender tells his spouse to

308
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,480
take a certain amount of trucks put it

309
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,399
in rubber which is probably a condom

310
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,519
swallow it and then he writes make sure

311
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,160
that you use hand sanitizer before you

312
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,980
swallow this object which certainly

313
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,600
makes sense

314
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,260
and so this is a protein procedure to

315
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,839
smuggle

316
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,519
drugs into the prison and of course this

317
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:05,339
was very helpful for the prison staff to

318
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:08,100
know about this encrypted message and to

319
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,079
have it solved by professional code

320
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,660
Breakers so

321
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,000
fold them together as small as possible

322
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,639
for me to swallow

323
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:20,300
okay

324
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:23,220
so if we look at this orepish message

325
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,040
and this smuggling message we see that

326
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,279
we have to solve messages

327
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:31,680
the next one I'm going to show you has

328
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,019
been solved by the police too but the

329
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:37,500
solution is not known to the public this

330
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,040
story took place in urban Italy Northern

331
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,920
Italy and in 2006 the so-called Urban

332
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,480
would be the Italian pronunciation the

333
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,740
erbar massacre took place in 2006 a

334
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,220
couple named Rosa bati and olindo Romano

335
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,880
they killed four neighbors why did they

336
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,459
kill four neighbors well because they

337
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:05,820
might made too much noise that was the

338
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,920
only reason why they killed for

339
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,300
neighbors and of course they were

340
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,480
convicted to Long prison sentences a

341
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,440
very strange crime but while in prison

342
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,019
olindo Romano tried to send an encrypted

343
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:22,380
message to his wife who was arrested in

344
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,920
a different prison and the message was

345
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,019
hidden in a Bible

346
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:32,160
but this quite interesting way to

347
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,320
smuggle information didn't work because

348
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,440
it was intercepted by the prison staff

349
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,660
and apparently police was able to break

350
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,399
this message

351
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:44,820
but when I saw this it was published in

352
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,740
in the Press I wondered how this

353
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,480
encryption worked and this is not

354
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,820
documented as far as I know the Italian

355
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,639
police has never published the plain

356
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:56,579
text or the encryption system used here

357
00:16:56,579 --> 00:17:00,180
so I introduced this on my blog

358
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:04,020
and so far my readers were not able to

359
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,540
break this message to my regret but at

360
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,740
least at least there was an Italian

361
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,980
reader who made an educated guess he

362
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,199
said well probably a substitution Cipher

363
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,500
was used replacing single letters with

364
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,559
syllables such that the cipher text is

365
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:22,380
mostly pronounceable and the XS probably

366
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,179
stands for space

367
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:26,819
and probably this is not the the

368
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,160
complete message probably it's only one

369
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,840
page out of several so it might be

370
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,820
easier to break the message if if the

371
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,100
whole message was available but this is

372
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,740
not the kind and it's very typical it

373
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,380
happens quite often that only parts of

374
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,380
messages are published or only the

375
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,500
cipher text not the plain text so

376
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,960
I'm very interested in stuff like this

377
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,679
but it's often hard to get the whole

378
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:54,539
truth

379
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:57,059
okay so I have introduced now a couple

380
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,820
of messages that were sent from

381
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,299
prisoners or to prisoners and some of

382
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:08,480
these were solved others are not

383
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:13,080
let's now come to the next chapter

384
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,039
this one takes us to Saint Charles

385
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:19,880
Missouri to the year

386
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,100
1999 well again I didn't find good

387
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,700
pictures so I created a few myself you

388
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,440
can you can see what actually happened

389
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,220
or how the story more or less began in

390
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,320
1998

391
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,200
uh a corpse was found lying on the floor

392
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,100
in a corn field a sweet corn field in

393
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,880
Missouri pretty close to the interstate

394
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,160
Road

395
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,059
367 and uh yes the corpse was identified

396
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:55,100
as Ricky McCormick a 41 year old

397
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,960
Ricky McCormick was a person with a

398
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,020
criminal record he was unemployed at

399
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,559
that time so not necessarily a man who

400
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,260
was very lucky in his life

401
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,039
and so police researched his background

402
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,400
and it became clear that before his

403
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,640
death he took two bus trips to Orlando

404
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,020
which is quite a trip from Missouri

405
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,900
and both from Missouri to Orlando and

406
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,720
Peck and Orlando is a place where a lot

407
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,960
of trucks are dealt so the suspicion was

408
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,900
that he was a drug Smuggler but details

409
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,480
are not known at least not known to the

410
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,640
public

411
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,100
um so Witnesses say that Ricky McCormick

412
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,820
was he felt scared after his trips he

413
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,000
tried to be taken in by hospitals which

414
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,280
didn't really work because he was not

415
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,100
ill and after he left the hospital in

416
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,360
June 25 on June 25 in 1999 he was never

417
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,280
seen again

418
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,120
before he was finally found dead on the

419
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,539
cornfield next to a road in Saint

420
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,100
Charles

421
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,500
what makes this case interesting for us

422
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,679
is that Ricky McCormick had to encrypted

423
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,740
sheets in his pocket and these encrypted

424
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:20,820
sheets were examined by the crru well

425
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,780
the crru is the

426
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,220
cryptanalysis and racketeering records

427
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,039
unit so the code breaking unit of the

428
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:33,660
FBI in the USA it's probably the world's

429
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,820
leading organization in this field a

430
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,100
very secretive organization not much is

431
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,780
known about them but it's known that

432
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,000
they exist and it's known that they

433
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,780
examine this case but to know avail

434
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,940
they couldn't break the McCormick

435
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,000
cryptograms so what the FBI did is they

436
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,860
made these cryptograms available on

437
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,160
their website and they asked the publish

438
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,700
this happened in 2011 they asked the

439
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,840
public to try to decipher these messages

440
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,600
and here are transcripts of these

441
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,720
messages so

442
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,660
these are two sheets and well the

443
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,440
background is again it is pretty unclear

444
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,679
so according to official information

445
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:21,780
Ricky McCormick never was really

446
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,600
involved in cryptography and he he

447
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,880
wasn't very good at mathematics or

448
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,240
science or things like that so it's

449
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,299
pretty unclear if this is really

450
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:35,100
incredible it's probably real encryption

451
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,100
but why he did it or if he left behind

452
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,620
other encrypted nodes we don't know all

453
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,659
this was never published but it's clear

454
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:45,780
that he had these notes in his pocket

455
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,700
and that the police call Breakers have

456
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,360
never been successful in breaking them

457
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,760
it is clear that the letters ens are

458
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,179
quite frequent in these two cryptograms

459
00:21:56,179 --> 00:22:01,380
why while k q X and C are rare this is

460
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,880
very similar to the English language

461
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,440
which means that we might have might uh

462
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,620
be dealing with a transposition cipher

463
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:14,340
but this is as far as it gets this is

464
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,880
all that has been found out so far in

465
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,340
addition the the latter combination SE

466
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:24,360
is very frequent wld and ncbe are

467
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,240
frequent too this is not consistent with

468
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,159
any common Cipher whatsoever so this is

469
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,480
quite a mystery an unsolved murder case

470
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,220
two encrypted nodes that have never been

471
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,919
solved so code Breakers are still

472
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:44,340
analyzing these messages but so far none

473
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,700
of these has been successful so very

474
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,179
interesting and exciting criminal case

475
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:55,500
or criminal and crypto case so perhaps

476
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,940
if you want to take a look at it maybe

477
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,340
you're successful but

478
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,820
so far this has not happened

479
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:05,460
so in this case the case and the cipher

480
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,559
texts are unsolved

481
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,480
let's now look at probably the most

482
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,440
famous story on my agenda you might have

483
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,900
heard of the Zodiac Killer

484
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,780
the Zodiac killer was a serial killer

485
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,120
who operated in the San Francisco area

486
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,179
in the late 1960s

487
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:31,919
so the first crime or probably the first

488
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,360
crime it's not really clear how many

489
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,020
crimes he committed some crimes can be

490
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,900
attributed to him with certainty but the

491
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,000
first one that is really secure took

492
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,280
place in 1968

493
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,860
shortly before Christmas in Benicia

494
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,280
North of San Francisco in California it

495
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,860
was when the Zodiac Killer murdered a

496
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:56,100
man and a woman a very young couple and

497
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,140
you can see a lot of blood it was a very

498
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,120
brutal crime

499
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,200
and it was not the only one because a

500
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,440
few months later or half a year later in

501
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,500
Vallejo California the Zodiac Killer

502
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,740
murdered again again he murdered a young

503
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,679
couple young man young woman again it

504
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:19,020
was they were in their car and again it

505
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:22,559
was a very brutal crime and then the

506
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,440
third murder was again an attempt at

507
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,780
double murder this one took place in

508
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:31,559
Lake Berryessa California in 1969. again

509
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:34,380
he tried to murder a man and a woman

510
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,740
very young people about 20 years old but

511
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,080
this time the

512
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,740
man survived and he could describe the

513
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,559
murderer and he said that the murderer

514
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,320
wore a strange costume with a zodiac

515
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,340
symbol and a strange mask

516
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,679
so but this is all he he could say so

517
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,840
there's no detailed description of the

518
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,960
perpetrator and finally the last crime

519
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,480
happened in Presidio Heights which is

520
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,500
the borough of San Francisco in 1969 and

521
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,840
this time a taxi driver was murdered

522
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,760
which was untypical it was not a couple

523
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,880
but it was a taxi driver again a young

524
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,280
man about 20 years old and again it was

525
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,080
very brutal

526
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,280
so we have all together four murders or

527
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,860
double murders all of these happened in

528
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,740
the San Francisco area and all these

529
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:32,400
were committed by the Zodiac Killer

530
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,039
and what makes this case interesting for

531
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,620
us is that the Zodiac Killer sent

532
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,200
messages to the police I think he sent

533
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,659
over 10 messages to the local not not

534
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:45,059
really to the police but to newspapers

535
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:48,720
and four of these messages are contained

536
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,600
ciphertexts so

537
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,960
you can see them here the ciphertext the

538
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,080
Zodiac Killer scent are named uh said

539
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,340
408 set the E40 set 32 and said 13

540
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,919
because of the number of letters these

541
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:07,980
messages contain and let's start with

542
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,380
the first one the first one he sent to

543
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:15,900
local newspapers had 408 letters and

544
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,480
this one was broken but it was not

545
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,460
broken by police code Breakers but it

546
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,340
was spoken by a teacher couple when they

547
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,760
read about this message in the Press so

548
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,220
quite an interesting story Donald and

549
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,520
Betty Harden two teachers looked at

550
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,159
these messages and they invested quite a

551
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:36,960
lot of time I think they worked on these

552
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,059
messages for a couple of days in a row

553
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:41,340
they didn't do anything else not even

554
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,100
did they go to sleep and finally Betty

555
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,440
Harden found out how the encryption

556
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,940
worked

557
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,340
and this is basically what it is about

558
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,640
it's a so-called homophonic Cipher that

559
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,620
means that for every letter of the

560
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,260
alphabet several deep not for every but

561
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,640
for some letters of the alphabet

562
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,760
different symbols are available so for

563
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,100
example if you want to encrypt the a you

564
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,880
have four different symbols you can use

565
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,400
and uh of course this makes things like

566
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,539
frequency analysis a lot more difficult

567
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:18,840
than usual and this is how the

568
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,419
encryption worked this is the plain text

569
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:23,760
I like killing people because it is so

570
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,820
much fun and so on it didn't help police

571
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,740
very much of course but this was hoping

572
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,159
that the perpetrator told his name in

573
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,260
this message but this did not happen but

574
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,419
any anyway from a cryptographic point of

575
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:38,340
view this is extremely interesting and

576
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,020
if you want to know how Betty Harden

577
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,600
broke this message well the first step

578
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,020
was that she guessed that the Zodiac

579
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,000
Killer is an ego Maniac started to

580
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,620
message with I and she was right and in

581
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,740
addition the the expression uh I like

582
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,320
killing people fits very good with a

583
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,360
person like the Zodiac Killer so of

584
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,299
course this she was lucky in in this

585
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:05,520
sense uh could have been something

586
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,340
completely else and so they would

587
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,840
probably still try to solve the message

588
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,020
but she did a good guess I like killing

589
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,360
people and when she gets these first few

590
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,799
words

591
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,159
uh she could solve the whole message

592
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:22,860
that happened back in 1969

593
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,960
this here is the second Zodiac Killer

594
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,900
message this one remained unsolved for

595
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,960
decades and it became one of the most

596
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,960
famous encrypted messages or unsolved

597
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,059
encrypted messages at all in the world

598
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:40,740
and I blocked about it many times and my

599
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,720
um I I never thought that this would

600
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,000
ever be solved because for decades a

601
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,740
great code Breakers looked at it and

602
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,840
they were not successful so I thought

603
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,940
this will never happen but I was wrong

604
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,400
because in

605
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,700
2000 2020

606
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:01,500
um I received a notice that uh said 340

607
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,779
was broken I couldn't believe it but

608
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:05,940
then I read who had published this

609
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,700
message it was Dave oranchek a friend of

610
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,880
mine and an extremely good code breaker

611
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,720
yalvan aike also a code breaker I know

612
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,059
he's a real genius and when I read these

613
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:20,279
two names I thought well these are

614
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,500
really good code Breakers they don't

615
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,260
publish any nonsense they must be right

616
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,720
and it turned out that their solution

617
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,299
was correct I didn't know Sand Lake but

618
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:32,340
he turned out to be a reader of my blog

619
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,919
so I'm quite proud I always say that

620
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:37,260
this message was solved by readers of my

621
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:41,279
blog which is totally true but I was not

622
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,460
really involved to my regret

623
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,580
but anyway uh in my view this is the

624
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,039
greatest success in the history of

625
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:52,260
non-military crypto analysis I had never

626
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:55,620
expected this message ever to be solved

627
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,360
so how did it work

628
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,720
well first of all apparently the Zodiac

629
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,700
Killer well I'm only going to cover the

630
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,340
first 20 letters and the first 20

631
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,880
letters well for for this message uh the

632
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,679
same system or the same kind of system

633
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:13,080
was used as for the first one of course

634
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,539
it was a different table uh the symbols

635
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:18,720
are not exactly the same but again we

636
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,659
have a homophobic Cipher that means that

637
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:24,960
from some letters several signs are

638
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,220
available

639
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,620
as we cover only the first 20 letters we

640
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,320
have two signs available for the K two

641
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,539
for the E and we have even three signs

642
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:35,820
for the O of course if we cover the

643
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,980
whole message or the list gets a little

644
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,059
longer

645
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:41,700
but this is the first building block of

646
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,380
the encryption and the second building

647
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,559
block of the encryption is that uh the

648
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,899
message isn't to be read from left to

649
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:51,899
right and top to bottom but it's to be

650
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:55,260
read in night moves if you look at the

651
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:58,320
one that's in the upper left corner

652
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,600
number two the second letter would be

653
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,299
one below and two right that's a typical

654
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:06,179
night move then number three again one

655
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:08,520
below to right and then you have to go

656
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,940
uh through the whole message

657
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,159
until you end up here and then you have

658
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,899
to start at the top again and uh yes

659
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:20,940
well these are only the first 20 letters

660
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,460
but this is the basic scheme that was

661
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,760
used here and in my view it's absolutely

662
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,880
uh uh absolutely a sensation that

663
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,640
somebody has found out how this works

664
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,260
because it required a lot of computer

665
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,559
analysis to determine the order of the

666
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:41,159
letters and this is the real uh success

667
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:44,279
of the code Breakers in in this case the

668
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:47,399
plain text the first 20 letters are I

669
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:49,380
hope you are having a lot

670
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,980
lots of fun again it didn't contain any

671
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,960
evidence that helped the police to

672
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,659
identify the Zodiac Killer but anyway

673
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:00,419
from a cryptographic point of view this

674
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:05,580
is really something very outstanding

675
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,399
two of the 38 killer messages are still

676
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,980
unsolved they are pretty short they are

677
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,840
actually too short to be really solved

678
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,740
with ordinary code breaking means so

679
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,360
frequency analysis of work pattern

680
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,720
guessing doesn't help here in my view

681
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,360
these messages can only be solved if

682
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,220
additional information becomes available

683
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,980
so perhaps somebody will find out that a

684
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,080
similar system was used elsewhere maybe

685
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,260
in the first two messages

686
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:37,200
that might help but apart from that

687
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,020
um it won't work

688
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,059
uh what is interesting there has been

689
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:43,679
one

690
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:44,460
um

691
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:48,360
potential decipherment of said 13 Craig

692
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,640
Bower who is an American codebreaker

693
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,820
found out that the name Alfred E Newman

694
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:58,440
was almost a fit for these 13 letters

695
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,299
but only almost because one letter

696
00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:03,000
doesn't fit you certainly all know

697
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,399
Alfred E Newman the mad guy and it's of

698
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,580
course possible that this signature and

699
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,980
it even says my name is so the Zodiac

700
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,019
Killer says here my name is and then

701
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:18,360
encrypted string of course this might be

702
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,760
a joke by the Zodiac Killer and perhaps

703
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,340
it simply took Alfred E Newman encrypted

704
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,200
it and maybe made a mistake

705
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,720
could be but there are certainly other

706
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,240
options

707
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,940
so basically we can say the Zodiac

708
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,919
Killer is probably the the best known

709
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:37,620
crime that involves encryption the crime

710
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,380
is unsolved the killer has never been

711
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,559
found and but at least the cipherteks

712
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:46,860
are partially solved

713
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,600
okay

714
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,500
I have to look at the time okay so let's

715
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,220
look at the summer 10 man now

716
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:01,080
uh this story takes us to Adelaide in

717
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,419
Southern Australia in Adelaide in

718
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:07,019
Southern Australia in the year 1948 a

719
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:09,839
man was seen lying on the beach there

720
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:13,440
were several witnesses who saw him

721
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,599
and

722
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,699
finally it became clear that this person

723
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:21,359
was dead so of course police examined

724
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,199
the corpse and he

725
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:27,179
this is how the man looked like the

726
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:30,780
Silverton man he was not identified it

727
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,960
became a mystery or probably Australia's

728
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,540
best-known crime mystery nobody ever

729
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,639
nobody found out who this man actually

730
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,540
was when a police examined the corpse

731
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,239
they found a piece of paper in the

732
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:48,540
pocket these people of paper contained

733
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,000
two words

734
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,060
which is I think a person or a person or

735
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,339
farsi's name of the language and simply

736
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:57,720
means end

737
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,900
and it soon became clear that this uh

738
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,119
piece of paper was thrown out from a

739
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,800
book and this book was

740
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,520
the rubayat of Omar kayama which is a

741
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,619
book that was quite popular in the 19th

742
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:13,020
century and the police even found a copy

743
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:16,200
of this book that had an empty place on

744
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,820
the last page and this was apparently

745
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,640
where this piece of paper was taken from

746
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,640
now it was found nearby

747
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,480
and on the last page of this book copy

748
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,420
police found this encrypted message or

749
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,400
this message no nobody really knows if

750
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,040
it's encrypted could be anything but

751
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,020
um of course police assumed that it was

752
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,140
an encrypted message and it was

753
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:42,240
examined let's look at the locations

754
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,760
again the train station of Adelaide is

755
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,579
important because the Silverton man had

756
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:50,400
a ticket in his pocket for a bus trip

757
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,680
from the train station to Somerton Beach

758
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,900
and his baggage was found at the train

759
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,940
station so that's probably pretty much

760
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,760
all we know of the of this story before

761
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,160
the cops was found so the main must have

762
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,960
come from the train station he took a

763
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,900
bus to Silverton Beach and close to

764
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,820
Somerton Beach the book was found and

765
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,640
today the man is buried close to the

766
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,240
train station and this is the encrypted

767
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,060
message that was found in the book he

768
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:21,420
must have owned it's also referred to as

769
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,900
the tamam should cryptocrime

770
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,200
and of course many people tried or many

771
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,320
people analyzed this message but nobody

772
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,140
could decipher it and the most

773
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,540
um most likely uh explanation is that

774
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:39,540
these letters are word initials uh they

775
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,060
might be from a poem from a prayer from

776
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,280
a shopping list it could be a theater

777
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,500
dialogue this man needed to learn by

778
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,079
heart or maybe a customer so whatsoever

779
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:52,920
at least the ladder frequencies are

780
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,740
consistent with uh word initials of the

781
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,220
English language but this is all we know

782
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:01,079
so I hope that someone someday somebody

783
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:04,020
will come up with certain word list and

784
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,000
say well this is an exact fit and then

785
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,520
the problem is solved but so far this

786
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,140
has never been the case

787
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,880
last year

788
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,640
there was an article in the Press saying

789
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,020
that the body of the Summerton man was

790
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,760
exhumed to finally find out who he was

791
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:25,320
or to at least examine his DNA so far no

792
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,240
results have been published but a few

793
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,980
weeks ago which was a completely

794
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,040
complete surprise a few weeks ago there

795
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,500
were three scientists who said we have

796
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,800
identified this man and these results

797
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,800
are not related to the exclamation they

798
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,020
used other evidence and they they could

799
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,079
raise the DNA or that they could isolate

800
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,500
the DNA of this person and connect it

801
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,900
with the DNA of other persons and so

802
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,240
these scientists say well this man must

803
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,240
be Charles Webb a man from Melbourne

804
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,599
Australia and so at least the identity

805
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:02,760
should be clear now I I was quite

806
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,920
surprised when I read about this and I'm

807
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,320
still not 100 convinced that it's

808
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,660
correct but the scientists who published

809
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:13,160
this information are very well

810
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,740
renowned people so

811
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,440
they are probably right the only

812
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,380
question I I still ask myself is why

813
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,480
didn't anybody recognize this man this

814
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,460
picture was published in just about

815
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,800
every Australian newspaper for 50 years

816
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,619
nobody came up and said I know this man

817
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:33,720
were very strange and now it turns out

818
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,720
that it's just an ornery person who

819
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,420
lived in Australia for decades and there

820
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,180
must be hundreds of people who knew him

821
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,460
well we still don't know what's going on

822
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,859
here so this case is partially solved

823
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:49,440
but the cipher text is still unsolved

824
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,920
okay uh sorry now I need to skip the

825
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,020
next chapter otherwise

826
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,400
I will run out of time

827
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,839
let me come now

828
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,060
to the last chapter

829
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,820
this chapter is about

830
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:11,280
computer-based encryption so everything

831
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,680
I've covered so far is about paper and

832
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,740
pencil encryption but now let's first go

833
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:20,640
to my home country to Germany again

834
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:26,720
um in Germany there in the 1919s 1990s

835
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:32,280
serial killer was active he started his

836
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,060
crime Series in 1992 he killed three

837
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:39,540
children and abused about 40 of these he

838
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:42,480
was called the masked man of course

839
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,780
because he always wear wore a black mask

840
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:50,339
when he committed his crime and in 2011

841
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:51,660
finally

842
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:55,760
this man was identified as Martin Knight

843
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,119
Martini was a man who worked for a

844
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:02,579
children's holiday home so by profession

845
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:04,920
he worked a lot with children and

846
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,619
apparently he also committed these

847
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:11,700
crimes to children after he was arrested

848
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,020
a police ceased a couple of encrypted

849
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:19,520
encrypted hard drives he owned and

850
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,619
to my regret I don't know which software

851
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:25,500
Martin I use because this again was

852
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,680
never published but

853
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,900
of course we all know that encryption

854
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,560
computer programs are available I think

855
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,079
at the moment the most popular one is

856
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:38,780
veracrypt

857
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:41,460
verakrypt is a very nice software I use

858
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:45,420
it myself it's available for free

859
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:49,560
and you can easily use it to encrypt

860
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,560
files or you can also encrypt complete

861
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:58,740
drives it uses the AES Cipher and it's

862
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:01,980
based on password so you have to use a

863
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,960
password as the key and if you don't

864
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,480
know the password you can't decrypt the

865
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,560
software anymore and it's very secure

866
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,079
so

867
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:15,599
I don't know if Martin Knight used

868
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,420
veracrip but it would be the most likely

869
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,099
option

870
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:22,560
uh now sorry he certainly didn't use

871
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,240
veracrypt because veracrypt wasn't

872
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,760
around at that time but he probably used

873
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,740
the Forerunner Drew Crypt he probably

874
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,500
used true and of course when police

875
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,660
found these encrypted fires in his

876
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:36,180
possession they would have liked to

877
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,520
decipher them it was especially

878
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,500
important because there were only three

879
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,900
murders that could could be attributed

880
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,960
to Martin Knight and police suspected

881
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,480
that that there was more so it would

882
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,400
have been really important for police to

883
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,640
read these files but they couldn't break

884
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,320
the encryption which is no wonder

885
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,680
because truecrypt is very secure and

886
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:02,400
Martin Naye didn't reveal passwords so

887
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,800
this is a very interesting question it

888
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,359
would be no problem at all to give a

889
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:08,940
whole presentation only about passwords

890
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,740
used by criminals because in some

891
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,839
countries it's legal to force a criminal

892
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:15,480
to review the password in Germany this

893
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,859
is not legal so the police had no real

894
00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:22,740
um means of forcing Martin Knight to

895
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,920
reveal his password so all they could do

896
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,980
is try to guess the password but they

897
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:32,280
were not successful well this wasn't

898
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,380
that important for the trial because

899
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,660
there was enough other evidence so he

900
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:37,880
was finally

901
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,280
convicted to life in prison but again

902
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,040
it's still not really clear if he

903
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:47,280
committed more than these three murders

904
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,640
and so at that time police was very much

905
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,280
interested in in reading these files but

906
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,660
it didn't happen

907
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,640
I will come back to the massman later

908
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,280
let's now look at a few other similar

909
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,619
cases because it's quite quite

910
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:03,900
widespread that compute that criminals

911
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,359
use computer software for encryption for

912
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:09,359
example in Utah there was a young woman

913
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,500
named Susan Powell she went missing in

914
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:16,740
2009 and until today she has never

915
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,020
appeared again probably she doesn't live

916
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,180
anymore but her corpse has never been

917
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,260
found

918
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:25,579
and the prime suspect became her husband

919
00:43:25,579 --> 00:43:30,119
Joshua Powell he died in 2012.

920
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:31,859
so

921
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,740
um he's he's not a neither witness nor a

922
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,720
suspect anymore that that is of any

923
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,140
value but um Joshua Powell had encrypted

924
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:43,800
hard drives too police seized them but

925
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,460
they couldn't decipher them and again

926
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,540
Joshua Powell didn't reveal any

927
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:52,440
passwords and when he died in 2012 he

928
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,780
took these passwords into his grave so

929
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,060
until today

930
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:59,760
the crime is unsolved if it was a crime

931
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,060
could also be an accident and uh the

932
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:06,000
hard drive still can't be read because

933
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
they are encrypted probably with a

934
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,339
veracrypt or with something else again

935
00:44:11,339 --> 00:44:14,280
this information has not been published

936
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,560
there are more criminals who use the

937
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,960
encryption software for example Albert

938
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,119
Gonzalez one of the most successful

939
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,560
hackers in history he saw millions of

940
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,960
dollars online he was convicted to a 20

941
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,760
years prison sentence he's still in

942
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,339
prison used encryption software Joseph

943
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:34,619
Duncan the serial killer used encryption

944
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:37,859
software and our Chapman a spy for the

945
00:44:37,859 --> 00:44:40,680
Russians in the USA used encryption

946
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,079
software of course many child porn

947
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:45,660
offenders use encrypted software

948
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:48,660
encryption software and so on

949
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,180
so there are many more cases of this

950
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,400
kind I have a list which is available on

951
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,619
my website I think meanwhile I have

952
00:44:55,619 --> 00:44:58,099
found about 80 cases

953
00:44:58,099 --> 00:45:00,200
involving

954
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,700
computer-based encryption and this list

955
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,859
is far from complete and of course most

956
00:45:04,859 --> 00:45:09,000
most cases are not even published

957
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,140
and

958
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,480
the question is of course can a software

959
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,020
such as veracrypt be broken

960
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,760
um while the encryption as such cannot

961
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,040
be broken at the moment it's as good as

962
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,440
impossible to break the AES or other

963
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,839
modern encryption system but it's always

964
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:27,540
possible to guess the password It's

965
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:30,060
usually the only chance one has and of

966
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,980
course there's software available for

967
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,859
breaking passwords such as hashcraig

968
00:45:34,859 --> 00:45:38,579
hashgrack was written by a German but

969
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:41,220
there are other tools of this kind of

970
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:45,480
course and while these tools all work

971
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,359
the same way they need a dictionary file

972
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:51,060
with as many potential passwords as

973
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,960
possible and these

974
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:58,079
candidates are used to decrypt the file

975
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:01,260
and if something useful comes out the

976
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,119
the decryption is correct or the

977
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:05,040
password is correct otherwise it isn't

978
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,780
and of course such a software always

979
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:09,480
tries different variations of the same

980
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,300
word so it's no problem to test 10

981
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,760
million different passwords

982
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,700
and hoping that one of these is correct

983
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:20,099
and sometimes it works but sometimes it

984
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:21,720
doesn't

985
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,599
so the last case I'm going to cover is

986
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:27,240
uh in to place in San Bernardino

987
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,220
California

988
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:33,560
the San Bernardino shooting in 2015 when

989
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:37,079
a Muslim couple killed 14 people and

990
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:42,180
injured 21. and after the crime the the

991
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:45,300
iPhone 5c of the male perpetrator was

992
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,000
seized but it was password protected

993
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,660
which means it was encrypted and

994
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:55,759
password guessing was the only chance

995
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,579
but so uh James Comey the FBI director

996
00:46:59,579 --> 00:47:01,680
said well Apple needs to help us finding

997
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,500
the password but Tim Cook of Apple said

998
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,859
no way we all helped you we won't create

999
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:10,800
a back door for our own products

1000
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,680
and this is this was a part of the

1001
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,680
so-called crypto War because there are

1002
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,839
people who say encryption should be made

1003
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:22,740
illegal others say no uh this should not

1004
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,540
be done and well I work for a company

1005
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:27,480
producing encryption programs and of

1006
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,700
course my employer wouldn't like to

1007
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,940
include backdoors into our product so I

1008
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:34,859
can easily understand that there are

1009
00:47:34,859 --> 00:47:38,220
many people protesting about making

1010
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:42,359
crypto illegal or about or against back

1011
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,720
doors

1012
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:48,660
okay so uh the FBI was successful in

1013
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:51,599
Breaking uh this iPhone anyway

1014
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,060
they had the help of an Australian

1015
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:57,240
company and at the end of the

1016
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,819
presentation let's come back to martinai

1017
00:47:59,819 --> 00:48:03,240
again the mass man well as I said police

1018
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,099
was not successful in breaking his

1019
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:10,020
messages but in 2016 16 he revealed his

1020
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,839
passwords it's not publicly known why he

1021
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:17,160
did this perhaps he received something

1022
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,720
or in in exchange

1023
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,119
easier conditions or better conditions

1024
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:26,040
in his

1025
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,359
oh

1026
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:31,560
in prison and when police examined these

1027
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,540
encrypted hard drives which now could be

1028
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:37,079
read they found allegedly no additional

1029
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:39,900
evidence and no evidence for additional

1030
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:44,280
murders this man might have committed

1031
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,760
so some of these cases I told you about

1032
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,119
are solved but the discussion about back

1033
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,660
doors is still going on

1034
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:57,599
okay this was my overview on cyphus and

1035
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,300
crime there are many more crimes

1036
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:03,240
involving ciphers

1037
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,079
um

1038
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:07,079
it's a lot more than I can cover in a

1039
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:09,300
presentation of this kind so all I can

1040
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:13,200
say at the moment is thank you and well

1041
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,640
are there any questions

1042
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:25,249
[Applause]

1043
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,180
how did he die well that's an

1044
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:37,740
interesting question uh it's basically

1045
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:39,240
not known there are several

1046
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,819
possibilities he might have been killed

1047
00:49:41,819 --> 00:49:44,339
he might have died of natural causes or

1048
00:49:44,339 --> 00:49:47,579
he might have committed suicide he might

1049
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:49,800
at least he might have died of a poison

1050
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:54,119
that could not be detected at that time

1051
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:57,240
um so that there was no injury and no

1052
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,940
poison was found so either it must have

1053
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:01,980
been some disease something like an

1054
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,599
allergic shock

1055
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,599
or he took some uh poison that could not

1056
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:10,380
be identified and if he took this uh uh

1057
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,780
to to kill himself or if somebody else

1058
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:15,960
gave it to him uh is not known

1059
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,480
