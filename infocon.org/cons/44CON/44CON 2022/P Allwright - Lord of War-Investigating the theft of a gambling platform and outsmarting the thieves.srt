1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:03,360
I'm hopefully going to show you how we

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,560
use technology in a good way

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,080
and in in this case study it's how we

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,719
use technology to in essence outsmart

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,240
the groups you'll see a few techniques

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,619
that

7
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:18,660
some of you will most probably question

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,279
my ethics

9
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,140
but it's around

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,939
turning the tables

11
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,180
on those those criminals and really

12
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,060
getting back our clients data this case

13
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,520
study is going to be on a gaming a

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,200
gaming platform it's probably one of the

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,840
biggest in the world

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,040
um you wouldn't have heard about the

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,079
story because it was all wrapped up very

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,160
quickly

19
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,600
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,120
explain to you quickly who I am

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,460
I'm going to talk to you about the case

22
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,520
study how we investigated these guys in

23
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,860
in different countries I'll also explain

24
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,379
to you why people commit crime and

25
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,539
there's psychology behind the crime and

26
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:58,980
we eventually use that psychology

27
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,180
against the people that we're

28
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,160
investigating and in essence when we're

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,600
doing interrogations or we're doing

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,600
social engineering we're just playing

31
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,640
psychological games with them based on a

32
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,280
whole variety of of sock puppets so I

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,860
mean I've got like 15 sock puppets

34
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,360
running at the moment and every time I

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,220
come home my wife asks me who I am this

36
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,540
week

37
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,159
I'm also going to explain to you why

38
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,080
some of the the big Industries are being

39
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,759
targeted and this in this instance I'll

40
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,380
speak to you about the gaming industry

41
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,659
because it's one of the reasons why so

42
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,700
many people are attracted to trying to

43
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,080
take out some of the gaming companies

44
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,659
there's big money to be made but there's

45
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,759
also not enough resources being placed

46
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,380
at those gaming companies to protect the

47
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,759
IP as well

48
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,460
and the case study is really around

49
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,159
taking what a lot of us do and using it

50
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,420
in in some ways a a different way and in

51
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,000
some ways it's using a whole variety of

52
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,920
techniques that some of you will know

53
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,840
using a lot of Open Source intelligence

54
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,540
package tools self-developed tools and

55
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,840
I'll show you how how we in fact

56
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,460
investigate the theft of that platform

57
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,259
and then quickly at the end I'll explain

58
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,840
to you the situation that most of you

59
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,060
must probably placed in where people are

60
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,160
not giving enough money until the poop

61
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,480
hits the fan and then they want to give

62
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,920
you as much money as you want to go and

63
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,980
fix up what has happened

64
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,980
very quickly I started out as a as a

65
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,520
developer I was a DBA

66
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,500
I didn't think that my personality is

67
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,420
suited to being sitting in a room and

68
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,940
programming all day so I landed up at

69
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,080
deloitte's I became a Management

70
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,360
Consultant putting in systems

71
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,580
and then I left and joined one of the

72
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,040
biggest law firms in Africa set up their

73
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,440
forensic Consulting practice and then

74
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,239
started traveling the world doing what

75
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,739
I'm going to show you now

76
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:45,540
I've recently moved to the Isle of Man

77
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,540
which is the mecca of gaming crypto and

78
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,099
a few other Industries

79
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:52,860
so as you'll see

80
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,860
um we are able to do a lot of these

81
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,379
activities out of the Isle of Man but

82
00:02:58,379 --> 00:02:59,580
you'll also see that some of these

83
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,920
activities we cannot do in certain

84
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,860
jurisdictions so at every point in time

85
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,900
we're doing this work we have a team of

86
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,180
lawyers with us because at the bottom

87
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,980
they have been detained in horrible

88
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,900
countries like Ethiopia and Israel

89
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,319
Thailand we've been detained I've been

90
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,180
poisoned

91
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,580
have been bitten by perinean Mountain

92
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,700
dogs that were sent after me

93
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,000
and you'll see why I think

94
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,920
I'm not very popular in certain

95
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,180
industries

96
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,500
you'll see as well I'm going to be

97
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,780
showing you live audio and video

98
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,420
of certain activities where possible

99
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,060
I've tried to to block those out because

100
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,980
some of those people are still busy

101
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,200
going through a legal process some are

102
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,159
in jail

103
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,400
and some hopefully I'll never see again

104
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,860
so it all started in Kiev and we're

105
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,680
talking just before covert hit early

106
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,720
2020

107
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,379
there's a there's um the infrastructure

108
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,120
of this gaming company was stolen and

109
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,180
practically by insiders in Kiev

110
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,040
I then was called to a meeting in London

111
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,900
where I was given a piece of paper and

112
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,000
given an instruction

113
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,599
we then flew into Kiev as as the world

114
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,239
was changing and covert started

115
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,220
with ended a whole lot of Investigation

116
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,779
around Europe because the different

117
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,699
components of the criminal Syndicate

118
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:22,860
operated around Europe and a lot of

119
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,660
those developers that we come across in

120
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,979
this industry

121
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:28,139
are based in one particular place in

122
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:30,060
Russia and almost every single time I do

123
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,860
this I might as well visit there because

124
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,900
that's where they're based

125
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,340
we then

126
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,040
managed to entice The Syndicate into

127
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,180
London

128
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,460
and we got 12 of them to fly in and why

129
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,840
do we do that because when you're

130
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,940
sitting in a jurisdiction like Russia

131
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,680
it's almost impossible to litigate

132
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,900
doesn't matter what you do so we entice

133
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,120
them into a conference in London and we

134
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,479
got them with a wire to admit or confess

135
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,940
to what they were doing

136
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,460
we then spent several months socially

137
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,199
engineering them creating a whole lot of

138
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,220
profiles

139
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,560
I became somebody else and I'll show you

140
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,900
how I did it and in essence we just

141
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,540
played games we

142
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,360
kind of socially profile everybody their

143
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,280
wives the kids

144
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,979
we we knew which soccer teams they

145
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:18,720
enjoyed we knew where they shopped we

146
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,479
completely analyzed them so that by the

147
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:22,919
time we started playing around with him

148
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,080
we knew which triggers to push and I'll

149
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,240
show you how we did that

150
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,060
then eventually our job was done

151
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,699
and the cyber crime police in Kiev did a

152
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,380
search and seizure you'll see parts of

153
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,539
that footage I'll explain to you why the

154
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:38,940
footage doesn't carry on because there

155
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,740
was a particular lady that was getting

156
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,280
very upset when the police were about to

157
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,460
chain Soho her door open

158
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,500
so why do people commit crime so we

159
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,780
really talk about the fro diamond

160
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,780
so often in a normal environment

161
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,820
there's an incentive that drives that

162
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,520
crime so some people have an affair

163
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,680
they've got three girlfriends

164
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,720
they need more money that's the

165
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,120
incentive some people believe they

166
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,800
should have been promoted they weren't

167
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,020
promoted they're short of money so they

168
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,380
steal money here we find that the gaming

169
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,479
industry has been targeted heavily from

170
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:18,419
about 2019 it's just become much worse

171
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,100
because there are a whole bunch of

172
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,840
people who've not seen how much money is

173
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,759
being made in the gaming industry

174
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,580
some companies are making close to 500

175
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,360
million us a year in pounds

176
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,000
and it's just it's just a crazy amount

177
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,639
of money then what we have as well

178
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,979
people sit and they watch so it's either

179
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:39,419
looking for vulnerabilities doing

180
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,100
reconnaissance

181
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,720
and some people just sit in their watch

182
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,340
and the data see how many

183
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,020
vulnerabilities they are and then one

184
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,919
day they penetrate that environment

185
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,020
then we have the capability where people

186
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,400
think that they're cleverer than the

187
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,199
people sitting inside the company and a

188
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,460
lot of these gaming companies it was

189
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,900
probably right they got better resources

190
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,699
got better technology

191
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,560
and they then strike

192
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,300
and the most interesting thing at the

193
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,620
end of the day is what we call

194
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,940
rationalization

195
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,580
so if you take an example and you think

196
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,840
that you should have been paid money and

197
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,360
you weren't so well you steal the money

198
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,860
and because you think you should have

199
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,720
been promoted we've got the money and

200
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,280
how do you rationalize it well I should

201
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,160
have got it anyway same instance here

202
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,560
people think that gaming or gambling is

203
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,539
is immoral so what they're doing is

204
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:25,740
they're taking money from their model

205
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,259
and they're spending it on themselves or

206
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,919
in a better way

207
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,800
we also believe that from the research

208
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,180
that takes place every year by the

209
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,979
Association of certified fraud examiners

210
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:40,020
that companies lose at least five

211
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,520
percent of their revenue whether they

212
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,680
know about it or not and that revenue is

213
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,360
often built into their financials so

214
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,099
it's it's something that's been there

215
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,720
for years and they actually don't know

216
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,639
about it and actually they need to spend

217
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,979
the time to unravel what has been stolen

218
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:54,660
from their business

219
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,759
if you also look at the online gambling

220
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,280
industry it's massive and it's growing

221
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,120
way in excess of of most Industries and

222
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,240
because people are making so much money

223
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,919
um that's one of the biggest issues that

224
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,440
we have in terms of people trying to

225
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,240
hack into Data Centers because they they

226
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,979
can see how many people are how much

227
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:16,139
money these companies are making how

228
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:18,180
many the vrp players are spending and

229
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,060
I've seen up to 50 000 Euros a month so

230
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,620
there's huge amounts of money to be made

231
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,599
here

232
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:27,539
and in terms of Insider threat which is

233
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:29,759
this in this case study

234
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,399
the problem we have with inside a fraud

235
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,620
is that a lot of companies implicitly

236
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,719
trust their employees and in this

237
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,979
instance

238
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:40,740
everybody who was a developer had access

239
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,799
to the to the software to the databases

240
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,779
they could in essence do anything they

241
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:47,580
they they could

242
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,500
so in essence they lifted up the whole

243
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,779
infrastructure of that gaming industry

244
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:55,019
so that's in the infrastructure the

245
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:57,959
software and the player kind of Ip and

246
00:08:57,959 --> 00:08:59,640
they just walked out the door

247
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,920
and only on the Monday did I realize

248
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,200
what the problem was

249
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,839
so in terms of the case study

250
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,060
the staff have all enjoyed a long

251
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,800
weekend

252
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,620
Monday morning is absolutely nobody

253
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,200
around

254
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,899
these are photos of the actual office

255
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:20,580
so people start phoning their colleagues

256
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,080
trying to work out is it a public

257
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,399
holiday or they're supposed to be

258
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,200
somewhere else

259
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,339
but the colleagues that they happen to

260
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:28,560
be phoning their phones are off

261
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,839
they're then trying to start emailing

262
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:32,160
their colleagues

263
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,420
they get no response

264
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,200
and this is the part we started laughing

265
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,519
at most people thought that they were

266
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,040
supposed to be at a off-site team

267
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,839
building event

268
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:45,360
but they couldn't find any

269
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,220
off-site team bullying event in their

270
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,480
diary

271
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,420
also the biggest issue we found is

272
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,640
all of the I.T operational staff were

273
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,019
missing so I'm talking about the guys

274
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:57,360
look after networks the servers

275
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,399
they were all gone

276
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,440
only the CIO

277
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,140
was behind I've been a CIO and I

278
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,180
wouldn't like to be left behind

279
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,279
because I want my CTO and staff to be

280
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:09,240
there

281
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,860
because they know these issues far

282
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,580
better than I do

283
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,399
so the managers got together and tried

284
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:20,160
to determine what was going on

285
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,260
because there was just such a big

286
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,080
proportion of their staff missing

287
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,760
so they happened to call one of the

288
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,040
owners and fortunately they called the

289
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,820
correct owner and they were two owners

290
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,620
so

291
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,320
they explained a situation to Vlad

292
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,240
and say Vlad is there's a big problem

293
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,300
here 40 of our developers are gone

294
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,339
and a huge portion of the rest of our

295
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,980
team are just not here

296
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,560
but his business partner has disappeared

297
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,720
and the phone number that he used had

298
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,540
been gone had been disconnected

299
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,600
so from an from an incident response

300
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,339
perspective

301
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,079
I think a lot

302
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:03,480
could have been done far better and I

303
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,820
think because the I.T operational staff

304
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,260
had left

305
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,480
with this incident

306
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,160
let's call it their procedures and

307
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,540
policies and everything that had been

308
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,579
worked that they worked on kind of like

309
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:16,320
fell apart because the people that were

310
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,700
supposed to implement those policies and

311
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,339
procedures had walked out the door with

312
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:21,720
infrastructure

313
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,060
so flight hires a private investigator

314
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,399
and says there are so many people that

315
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,899
are missing I need you to go and find

316
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:28,920
them

317
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,740
so the private investigator is briefed

318
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,420
in an underground

319
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,459
in Kiev

320
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,260
and he gets away and he goes up and does

321
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,459
his work

322
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,980
to this day we still don't know what

323
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,680
exactly happened but we do know that the

324
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,480
private investigators started following

325
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,720
or trying to follow people and we assume

326
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,579
that he had been

327
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:51,660
spotted

328
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,660
because he was pummeled

329
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,300
and then he refused to do any work and

330
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,720
that's when

331
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,459
I got a call I was asked please come

332
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:05,040
sort this mess out

333
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,380
whilst we were doing that some of the

334
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,339
techies

335
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:10,680
were trying to work out what actually

336
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,880
had happened

337
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,899
and while I was busy flying to London

338
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:17,700
they discovered that there were whole

339
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,860
variety of back doors that have been

340
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,720
programmed to the system so any

341
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,760
modifications that have been made any

342
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,180
new players that joined anything that

343
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,519
was changed changing on their platform

344
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,920
or an infrastructure was being sent out

345
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,320
via scripts and this was a continual

346
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,200
process and it took them quite a while

347
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,200
to determine where all these back doors

348
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,899
were and how this data was was being

349
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:46,220
leaked out of the infrastructure

350
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:50,639
so

351
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,399
from a client perspective

352
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:56,279
we have an individual

353
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:59,040
who has who's a ultimate beneficial

354
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,260
owner of a casino platform

355
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,660
big Dev house that is developing

356
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,639
software for that platform

357
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:08,100
there's also white label operator so for

358
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,480
those of you don't work in the space

359
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,720
they create a kind of infrastructure

360
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,000
with a platform and then you can label

361
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,339
it in terms of your brand and they can

362
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,320
kind of sell that and you can brand it

363
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,060
as many times as you want to with a

364
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,579
whole variety of skins as well

365
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:27,660
and he was very

366
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,480
influential and he traveled a lot and he

367
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,820
managed to put together very good

368
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,720
business

369
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,519
at the time of this

370
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,040
case study he had about 80 software

371
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,100
developers in Kiev and about another 350

372
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,639
in a variety of countries had about half

373
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,320
a million active players

374
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,260
and at that point just to give you a a

375
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,240
feeling uh

376
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,800
some of the shoot to kill games we've

377
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,320
been asked to look at are at any point

378
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,779
in time running 450

379
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:59,399
000 online users

380
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:00,839
got about

381
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,200
10 billion they've generated 10 billion

382
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,139
US Dollars uh over about a 10-year

383
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:10,680
period and they have many many millions

384
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,440
of players so the infrastructure that

385
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,940
these kind of

386
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,940
business need to sustain is is fairly

387
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,279
sophisticated yet a whole variety of

388
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:23,579
casinos and had a a

389
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:27,360
very healthy financial situation

390
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,420
so what is what did we discover right up

391
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,339
front

392
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:35,040
Vlad and he and his business partner was

393
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,899
a long-term friend they had invested

394
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:37,860
money

395
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,720
and almost most of their money into this

396
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,579
Venture they had created this in

397
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:43,019
infrastructure and platform that they

398
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:44,880
wanted a white label and they really

399
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,040
wanted to kind of make sure that they

400
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,180
could get

401
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,100
good penetration into the gaming

402
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,079
industry and it's not only the gaming

403
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,699
industry it's gambling it's Esports and

404
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:56,399
all the different other variants of that

405
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,019
and on the morning that we're talking

406
00:14:58,019 --> 00:14:59,820
about 40 of the I.T staff had

407
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,139
disappeared

408
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,300
all the I.T operational staff were gone

409
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,279
as I said the CIO was the last man

410
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,399
standing CTO was gone

411
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,260
and what they had discovered is some of

412
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,459
their clients were contacting them

413
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:13,199
saying some of the staff that had left

414
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,180
were now phoning them and trying to

415
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,060
entice their clients away from them to

416
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,980
wherever this new business was being run

417
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,019
so it was clear to him that this had

418
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:24,180
been a well-orchestrated plan and had

419
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,040
taken many many months

420
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,720
to to plan

421
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,760
the only thing they didn't know is to

422
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,100
where where these individuals had gone

423
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,360
off to

424
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,339
we also then discovered that the legal

425
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:38,040
advisors started behaving very strangely

426
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,800
she started taking whole lot of calls

427
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,079
they then discovered that none of the IP

428
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:45,600
on that platform had been protected

429
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,540
enormous protected via legal agreements

430
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,000
and how that happens is some

431
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,820
jurisdictions if you are are the dev on

432
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,920
a piece of software

433
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,620
you become the co-owner of that piece of

434
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,360
software so if you work for company X

435
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,519
and you are the dev and you work on

436
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:05,459
something you share 50 of that IP and in

437
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:07,800
some of these jurisdictions this is what

438
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,880
happened here then one day the folder of

439
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,279
the legal advice that disappeared was

440
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:19,019
deleted and she disappeared with it

441
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,360
and this was our instruction

442
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,740
two people

443
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,779
very angry men

444
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:27,300
he said find them

445
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,519
find out who funded them and the last

446
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,260
word you can imagine

447
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,180
what he said

448
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,240
he just wanted to completely annihilate

449
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,079
them

450
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,560
so how we admit is we run a what we call

451
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,259
a offensive forensic unit so most

452
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,060
forensic units do the investigation

453
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,240
issued a report and hand it over

454
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,100
so he liked what we did is we

455
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,860
investigated we play around and we get

456
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,279
up and we fly so we would often fly with

457
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:00,120
4 6 10 12 bodyguards

458
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,279
and then we hunt these people down

459
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,140
we get our stuff back

460
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,260
so he said the last one whatever you do

461
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,199
I want everything back

462
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:11,760
so what did we do and I'm going to

463
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,199
explain this to you because this is

464
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,540
often the place we get stuck with some

465
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,859
of our clients

466
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:18,660
in essence we Define what we're going to

467
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,380
do

468
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,419
we have a combination of resources our

469
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:23,459
team and local team and often we need

470
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,900
the local team because they fit into the

471
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,760
environment and what they'll do is

472
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,559
they'll just blend in so like in

473
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,360
Ethiopia I was following a whole bunch

474
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,799
of bootleggers

475
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,660
I would stand out like a sore thumb

476
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,820
because I'd be on a tuck tuck trying to

477
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,460
follow a truck whether locals would just

478
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,320
blend into the environment

479
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,580
we would Define roles and

480
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,380
responsibilities

481
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,940
and then we spend most of our time

482
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,160
talking about that because we have a lot

483
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,039
of clients who have ethical issues about

484
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,380
us profiling people and to the extent in

485
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,299
which we profile them

486
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:57,179
social engineering I.E we become other

487
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:59,100
people and we come with false personas

488
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,520
to in in essence get information

489
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,100
and some of us some of them don't like

490
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,620
the way we are quite offensive in terms

491
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,460
of

492
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,559
doing search and seizures every now and

493
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,120
then things don't go well

494
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,559
and that's probably reason why we've

495
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,240
been detained

496
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,179
so in terms of the overall we would do a

497
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:20,100
whole bunch of preparation

498
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,260
find out who the key players are so I'm

499
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,780
trying to get our team together in this

500
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,640
instance we were going to assess the

501
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,440
client's Casino so we basically would

502
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,240
clone that whole environment

503
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,860
we would then

504
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,160
find the client the people who've stolen

505
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,919
it and the cler the environment they've

506
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,679
stolen we've clone it we would then

507
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:42,240
secure intelligence and the targets

508
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,440
which is the individuals and entities

509
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,720
they've created with social engineer

510
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,020
them get our data raid them do whatever

511
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,240
we need to do and then there's a whole

512
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,419
reporting and legal component

513
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:56,220
but often what we need to do is we need

514
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,419
to secure Intelligence on those

515
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:59,580
individuals right up front because we

516
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,080
really need to know where they are we

517
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,059
need to know about them which that will

518
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,919
often guide us through the processes

519
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:06,960
around potentially how they've done it

520
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,020
how intelligent are they how how well

521
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,780
funded are they at the same time in this

522
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,640
instance as well we started social

523
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,320
engineering them very early

524
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,179
so here from the preparation stage we

525
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:22,980
really configured all our machines our

526
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,799
devices we started doing

527
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,480
um some planning and we started creating

528
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,220
all the sock puppets or the individuals

529
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,919
we created the platforms the websites

530
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,679
the social media kind of profiles and we

531
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:36,720
kind of like created that

532
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,220
falsivity

533
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,840
on which we were going to interact with

534
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,220
him

535
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,100
and then we kind of just agreed what we

536
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,960
were going to do

537
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,900
in the second phase we really use

538
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,000
products like four which is a forensic

539
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,400
acquisition tool which basically will go

540
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,200
into an environment and it'll

541
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,700
forensically acquire everything that's

542
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,640
there we also then registers players put

543
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,440
money in and we really just see how that

544
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,299
system works and we're running different

545
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:04,919
software to see what servers is talking

546
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:08,520
to and what kind of calls it's making

547
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,820
then we do the same in terms of the the

548
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,880
stolen platform that we find

549
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,760
and then we start securing intelligence

550
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,620
um

551
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,539
this is one area that we were squabbling

552
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:22,740
with a client about because we

553
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,179
forensically profiled the wives

554
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:26,880
girlfriends kids grandparents and we

555
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,100
just created these maps and we then went

556
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,660
through all their social media profiles

557
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,000
and we knew them explicitly so when I

558
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,160
spoke to some of the people I knew how

559
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,380
old the kids were what soccer team and

560
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,179
that's what the hook and the many hooks

561
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:41,640
we used to get them to trust us and once

562
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,220
they trusted us

563
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,799
it was very easy because once people

564
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,799
explicitly trust you you are able in

565
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,600
some ways to get anything out of them

566
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,559
which is what we did

567
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,679
from the social engineering perspective

568
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:01,440
it's probably the some ways to meet the

569
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,200
easiest but also the most fun because

570
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,140
once you forensically profile somebody

571
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,000
you've kind of a kind of like got to

572
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,380
swoop in

573
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,380
troduce yourself in such a way that the

574
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,980
person you are investigating is almost

575
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:20,220
instantaneously saying I want to I want

576
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,840
to talk to that person I want to set up

577
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,080
a business relationship so we gather a

578
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,000
lot of information

579
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,659
we spend a lot of time creating kind of

580
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:33,120
playbooks that we're going to use to

581
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,520
interact with all of these individuals

582
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,679
we exploit them we get information we

583
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:38,460
want

584
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,140
and then we disappear

585
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,299
at the place of a button

586
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:44,760
means we have to delete all our digital

587
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,159
Footprints and make sure that as we

588
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:49,740
swooped in we swoop out

589
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,620
sometimes

590
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,780
things don't quite according to plan

591
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,720
and you'll see here as well

592
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,580
but that's probably the most important

593
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,400
part and part members of my team who are

594
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,679
deep techies are not good at this

595
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:06,780
because you kind of like have to come in

596
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,419
and be a chameleon and you can actually

597
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:11,700
just as things happen you can just go

598
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,080
with the flow

599
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,880
and other people who we've brought in

600
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,960
who are

601
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,320
kind of social more of qualifications in

602
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,020
Social and English they love this part

603
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,600
so it all depends on your personality

604
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,280
and here it's really just Gathering the

605
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,659
evidence so in this instance we gathered

606
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:30,240
about 120 gigs of data and we're just

607
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,860
running software the whole time every

608
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,780
time we just run software we're just

609
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,400
covering up we're just gathering

610
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,740
information the whole time

611
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,100
so much to my wife's utter annoyance as

612
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,500
covert was hitting I get on a plane

613
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,840
and I Fly East

614
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,000
Landing Kiev

615
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,740
to discover that a hit has been put out

616
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,539
on our team

617
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:54,840
and we get given two

618
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,080
Range Rovers of bodyguards

619
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,679
so this delightful character here

620
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,320
he blocked he they all worked for the

621
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,940
Russian Special Forces

622
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,100
he always carried a sort of shotgun on

623
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,419
his chest

624
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:11,580
and what made us particularly nervous is

625
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,260
we were worried with his finger was

626
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,080
always on the shot the shotgun if he

627
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,940
sneezed or did anything wrong he was

628
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,679
going to shoot his foot off

629
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,539
but the one thing

630
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:24,179
that was concerning to us is they knew

631
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:25,919
that we were arriving before we arrived

632
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,260
so we were as we were met

633
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,539
these bodyguards took us everywhere we

634
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:31,799
soon realized

635
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:33,480
that our client was much more

636
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,120
influential than we realized because he

637
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,740
would we would go into a restaurant they

638
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,020
would clear the whole restaurant out and

639
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,520
all our bodyguards would come in with us

640
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,860
and we would sit down so clearly

641
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,919
there was a lot more play behind us

642
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:49,380
we also use forensic tags you can call

643
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,360
them tokens

644
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,299
they are on us in my phone

645
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,100
on my body

646
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,260
and because we were particularly

647
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,840
concerned we're busy driving Kiev and

648
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,140
there's a pulse going off the whole time

649
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,880
and because that's the building we spent

650
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,799
a few days in the pulse was just telling

651
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:09,120
everybody

652
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,059
I'm still alive I'm not buried

653
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:14,159
because this is we've used this very

654
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,780
effectively when we have been arrested

655
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,940
by certain people so we get stopped in

656
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,299
this building

657
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,140
in essence a very innocuous building

658
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,020
with a friend of the son of shotgun

659
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,299
Data Center

660
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,280
very strangely that took

661
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,340
their data center incredibly seriously

662
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,799
from the outside but not from the inside

663
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,900
why do I say that because they had

664
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,299
multiple audit reports in that

665
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:40,860
environment

666
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,539
so for those of you who understand all

667
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:43,380
this

668
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,780
you can see that they had a multitude of

669
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,539
issues they were being reported every

670
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:50,100
single year

671
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,380
and for a variety of reasons of budget

672
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,360
that's not interested never happen to us

673
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,039
the normal reasons

674
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:58,140
they were left

675
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,539
people could run scripts they could copy

676
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:02,220
data across the network there's a two

677
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,260
gig pipe they can miles or pick up their

678
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,000
play databases and just move it to

679
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,580
complete different jurisdiction

680
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,480
oops sorry

681
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,740
it was

682
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,780
it was a happy Hunting Ground so we

683
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,360
arrived with a fairly small team

684
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,039
and what did we find there was an open

685
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:22,320
VPN software

686
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,080
where the crooks had decided in their

687
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,299
brazenness to create

688
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:30,059
a license of that

689
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:32,159
piece of software that they had used to

690
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,659
create a new business

691
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:35,760
so once we found this

692
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,000
we could find the license key and the

693
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,539
host name almost instantaneously of the

694
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:44,400
domain that they had created and where

695
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,840
they had stolen and moved the whole

696
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,059
infrastructure to

697
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:49,559
so that

698
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:53,700
second third block along was invaluable

699
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,120
we then also were able to forensically

700
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,640
access a note that was supposed to be

701
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,820
created sent open deleted for whatever

702
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,100
reason it didn't finish

703
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,100
and we found an email with a key

704
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,620
and that email and the key told us the

705
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:14,178
domain and how to access that domain

706
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,100
then from a forensic profiling we

707
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,140
realized that these were the main ring

708
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,640
leaders

709
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,559
and we started running a whole variety

710
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,799
of software so here we would run

711
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:29,360
everything from multigo to shadow dragon

712
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,240
to telescope to a whole variety of

713
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,000
Python scripts an open source kind of

714
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,679
software

715
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,360
we would then do a whole variety of

716
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,980
stuff because we got about a thousand

717
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,360
different things that we can play around

718
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,159
with we can exploit vulnerabilities and

719
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,039
apis in URLs in systems

720
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,460
so we do intensive forensic profiling

721
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,679
sometimes we use private investigators

722
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:56,220
we look at Family any connections with

723
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,900
their work where they went to school who

724
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,700
their friends were and we started

725
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,919
building that into software

726
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,140
we prepare our social engineering models

727
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,380
and our case studies and playbooks

728
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,860
and here as well we used a very old

729
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,000
trick

730
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,039
so from intelligent intelligence

731
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:16,559
gathering we realized that

732
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,900
we wanted to find out where somebody was

733
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,720
located we phoned play music in the

734
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,400
background say hey with DHL we've got a

735
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,720
delivery for you

736
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,820
we give an incorrect address

737
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,799
we say who we want to deliver it to and

738
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,720
they correct us so that would be the

739
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,820
wife the grandmother some poor

740
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,100
unsuspecting family member

741
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,500
we discovered a wife also had an Etsy

742
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,200
shop that we then exploited

743
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,880
and we

744
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,340
contacted her about an order and that we

745
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,620
wanted to physically come look at an

746
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,659
item so members of our team went and

747
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:50,940
looked at the place where she stored it

748
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,760
and my favorite Strava

749
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,220
one of them was a big cyclist

750
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,340
and he posted his Cycles on Facebook

751
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,140
and sometimes

752
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:05,039
he also copied his ride onto Facebook so

753
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,140
we went into Strava and we eventually

754
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,179
worked out where he started and we ended

755
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:10,740
and then we just put a surveillance team

756
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,900
on there and then we followed him

757
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,960
I mean he went back to his friends

758
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,960
we also actively use Canary tokens so

759
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,120
anything we can a document

760
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,659
any redirection we will insert a canary

761
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:25,980
token in

762
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,559
so all that does is

763
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,960
we are trying to determine and

764
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,760
triangulate where they are

765
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,059
and we've so injected into a document

766
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:38,460
into something we're sending them in a

767
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,919
client agreement and we'd put create

768
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:44,100
email addresses with URLs as a kind of

769
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,980
the signature all got Canary tokens and

770
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,159
in this instance as well we also used

771
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:51,900
pixel tracking for some of the software

772
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,460
we use in case any of the other

773
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,200
mechanisms failed

774
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,000
we then physically conducted

775
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
surveillance around Kiev where we had

776
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,460
discovered or triangulated where they

777
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,559
were we did ethical hacking and I'll

778
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,120
just keep it at that

779
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,980
we fiddle around

780
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,600
and then

781
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,240
we are offensively

782
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,700
penetrated their Network

783
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,559
so here's one of the profiles this is

784
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,179
produced by telescope

785
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:20,340
and all you basically do is it just

786
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,100
gathers evidence finds images goes and

787
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,559
hunts brings back stuff for us

788
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:29,279
our pixel tracking and Canary tokens

789
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,020
give you a lot more information depends

790
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,340
which ones you have

791
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,080
but if you're not using these for honey

792
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,720
pots turn it around you can use it very

793
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,179
actively for other things

794
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:41,279
we also discovered that the one domain

795
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,679
that we have been gifted there was a

796
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,419
whole Myriad of other activity that we

797
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:47,220
started looking at

798
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,899
we also then found a whole lot of

799
00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:51,179
cryptocurrency transactions so this is

800
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:54,059
using some software in um

801
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,039
uh multigo and there's also chain

802
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:58,080
analysis so we started finding more

803
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,820
connectivity in terms of terms of some

804
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,260
of the money flows

805
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:04,080
but ultimately you'll see it as a

806
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,179
pinpoint we found what looked like a

807
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,760
block of flats we then were walking our

808
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,200
surveillance team was walking around the

809
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,419
block of flats

810
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:13,740
um

811
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,020
we found a nice shop which is no longer

812
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,059
there it's called Monster coffee

813
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:20,039
only to discover that through that clock

814
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:21,960
wall was where the office was that we

815
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,220
were looking for

816
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,220
so we took out our little friend

817
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,679
and we started playing

818
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:30,899
let's just say we found very interesting

819
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:32,520
stuff here that

820
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,220
we need it

821
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:39,539
and then we got the hell out of cave

822
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:41,159
so these poor guys were just trying to

823
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:42,720
get rid of us because I think they were

824
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,260
concerned

825
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:47,940
my colleague I took a

826
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,860
one of my junior colleagues with me as a

827
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,299
learning experience I think eyes are

828
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:52,740
like this the whole time

829
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,320
she's never been so scared in her life

830
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,779
those were the two permanent Russian

831
00:30:57,779 --> 00:30:59,279
Special Forces guys would have given to

832
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,419
us

833
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:03,299
so yeah we couldn't understand each

834
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:04,940
other so they were always talking into

835
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,380
their Android phone it was just a

836
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,000
translation so you can imagine

837
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,860
we didn't always quite understand each

838
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,580
other

839
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,559
so because these guys were based in a

840
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:15,480
jurisdiction that wasn't litigation

841
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,500
friendly

842
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,360
we convinced them

843
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,860
to come to London

844
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,840
so there's the big ice conference every

845
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,799
year

846
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,140
where everybody every frog in his dog

847
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,600
comes in the 75 000 people there it's a

848
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,240
complete and utter dog show

849
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,919
um you cannot move

850
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,020
you cannot do anything and it's on the

851
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,000
one side of X takes up the whole Excel

852
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,700
on the one side it's land-based on the

853
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,220
other side it's all online and they've

854
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:44,520
recently deduced Esports

855
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,039
so we wearing a wire and we've got a

856
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,720
camera and a buttonhole and the whole

857
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,039
team's weighing it

858
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:53,340
and as with technology starts failing

859
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,220
so I have to convince a whole lot of

860
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,799
unpleasant guys so we had an Israeli

861
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,140
close Protection Team so they use a

862
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,940
circular technique where they aren't

863
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,919
armed but if we climb if you walk

864
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:07,260
through this circle let us take it out

865
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,899
so I had to leave Excel and walk down to

866
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:11,640
what is called the corona bar which is

867
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,919
at the sea level

868
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,039
um

869
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:20,729
[Music]

870
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:28,740
about is the fact that whilst we were

871
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,779
going to use our back office initially

872
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:33,799
our own potentially back office

873
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:36,419
we wanted to come when we meet military

874
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:38,399
we want to understand a few things and

875
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:39,779
that's I think why put it down in my

876
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:41,460
email is

877
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,679
um you guys have created the gaming

878
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,880
platform you can integrate to different

879
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,860
we can go different ways okay

880
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:56,220
as as I understand uh one of the way is

881
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,500
the is it's not going but all they're

882
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,960
telling me in very much detail is how

883
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,539
they've stolen it how it works how much

884
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:04,559
you pay

885
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,179
how they make sure that whatever they've

886
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:09,260
cloned Carries On

887
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,000
so the sock puppets we created we

888
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,220
created four main sock puppets

889
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,860
we have different roles I'm the first

890
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,820
one

891
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:21,240
I Julian is a retired COBOL programmer

892
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,940
for those of you who as old as me

893
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,620
Lizzy

894
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,539
was actually my colleague my blonde

895
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:29,159
colleague and Andrew was a poor friend

896
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:30,539
of mine that I dragged out who knows

897
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:33,059
marketing and sales and acted as the old

898
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:35,279
stupid guy they kept on asking questions

899
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,740
we created a whole platform and a whole

900
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:41,279
gaming environment that was our front

901
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,320
when we created that I went to the

902
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,200
website that they had created from the

903
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,539
domain we found put in a question saying

904
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:49,620
hello

905
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,899
I'm in the business covert's coming

906
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:54,240
along I want to go online

907
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,220
send an email

908
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,860
with all the entices about covert about

909
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,600
we needing to change and we're needing

910
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,960
to set up the business quickly

911
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,600
uh put a few hooks in there

912
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,119
very quickly I get a response how their

913
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,060
business Works what they need to know

914
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:15,119
sorry what they need to know

915
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,580
and part of the response I just put the

916
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:21,560
size of many images many many millions

917
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,599
we then started a process of Now setting

918
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:25,918
up a relationship with them we start

919
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,719
talking

920
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,699
so that's our marketing and sales guy

921
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:32,339
here it's one of these sales people and

922
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:33,899
what we're doing is

923
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:36,239
we have this kind of mechanism where we

924
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,520
can communicate with each other and we

925
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,739
basically start

926
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:43,260
setting up a friendship

927
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,639
personally

928
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,379
I think as soon as you start showing

929
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:48,839
your face people the guard starts going

930
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:49,859
down

931
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:52,139
so problem is my job as soon as I do

932
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:54,359
that I become a big Target

933
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:55,440
so

934
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,080
we use a variety of people I wasn't on

935
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,160
these ones

936
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,480
but we started setting up the

937
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,980
relationship where we were talking to

938
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,080
people

939
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,780
then we in the background we're busy

940
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,880
cloning our clients environment sucking

941
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,680
of everything we can

942
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,040
we then used products that basically go

943
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,720
into sites they suck off all information

944
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,119
and they then use that to go and search

945
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:20,940
for anything they can find so here's

946
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:24,180
part of telescope web IQ kind of

947
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,740
environment where it does that we've got

948
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,240
other kind of software that does it as

949
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,320
well

950
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,540
we then use a whole variety of products

951
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,339
to map out the infrastructure where all

952
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:34,380
the domains are and servers because at

953
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,400
some point we're gonna have to rate

954
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,339
those data centers and take back our

955
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:40,980
client so we've taken an approach pretty

956
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,619
much like Facebook did many years ago if

957
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:45,720
you host any of our clients data we will

958
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,060
ask you very nicely once if you don't

959
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,760
take it we rate you so we've gone off

960
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,280
with 23 servers from some data centers

961
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,500
where we've asked you nicely we don't

962
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,720
want to play and some data centers we've

963
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,060
we've rated repeatedly so all we're

964
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,560
doing is just unraveling the

965
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,940
infrastructure

966
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,980
we start putting together the companies

967
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,540
the individuals and how they're linked

968
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,280
to the company so this is also using

969
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,560
telescope or we use multiga and a whole

970
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,839
lot of other software

971
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:16,260
we then have many many workshops and

972
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,460
that's about establishing the

973
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,400
relationship getting the trust and

974
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,780
getting the rapport

975
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,180
so I was some of these lasted four to

976
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,619
six hours and all we're doing is just

977
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:27,540
playing games asking questions

978
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,660
but it's all it is is to get their trust

979
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:34,020
so you'll see covert wasn't good to me

980
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,760
start putting on weight

981
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,520
beard lost the beard and all we're doing

982
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,260
is just talking to people

983
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,800
and we're setting up Trust

984
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,380
and then we eventually got to the trust

985
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,720
element so nicely they started showing

986
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,119
us the raw code of what they'd stolen

987
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,180
and what they were trying to change

988
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,540
so we can change this now uh for each

989
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,220
project we can click configure different

990
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,520
days

991
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:04,680
okay all right so that's that's the

992
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,780
number of days after some event has

993
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,640
happened yes yes

994
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,520
like a deposit or a withdrawal or

995
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,560
whatever

996
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,200
so what we've done is we've taken them

997
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,579
from nowhere

998
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:19,680
showing us your your system

999
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,380
asking questions you want to buy but we

1000
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,640
need to see the code we want to see how

1001
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,380
the code handles this and next thing

1002
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,180
we've seen all the raw data

1003
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,040
so

1004
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,859
we then started talking about soccer and

1005
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:33,420
how you know

1006
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,880
we liked each other's teams

1007
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,859
we managed to convince them to show us

1008
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:39,960
the back end

1009
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,420
56 servers

1010
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:47,359
with all the IPS This openvpn Cloud Fair

1011
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:51,078
everything was revealed

1012
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,940
we had software that was running that

1013
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,980
was busy sucking off other things in the

1014
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,720
background

1015
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,119
but then eventually got access

1016
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:02,520
to our own little playground

1017
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,280
you can imagine what we did

1018
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,339
and then what we did is we took our

1019
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:10,500
clients environment and we compared it

1020
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,960
to environment that we had just found

1021
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,700
discovered and cloned

1022
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,680
and we found that databases have been

1023
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,619
stolen domains have been stolen

1024
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:23,700
API tables were exactly the same

1025
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,700
constant names were the same

1026
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,740
and here in the payment system we found

1027
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,900
that they had hard-coded usernames

1028
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,240
passwords everything into that system

1029
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,339
that we were then able to use in fact we

1030
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:37,079
should have because we would

1031
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:40,400
pretty Wealthy by now

1032
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,800
then part of our intelligence gathering

1033
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,740
we are able to unravel that whole kind

1034
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,540
of infrastructure in terms of companies

1035
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:51,359
domains so we can reverse engineer a

1036
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,339
whole lot of stuff with what we've got

1037
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:56,220
we then discovered who the funder was

1038
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,740
the Quasi director of that entity was

1039
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,140
and through our corporate intelligence

1040
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,119
practice we were able to get

1041
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,220
utility accounts work out where they

1042
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,500
live because now we're going to go raid

1043
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,400
them we're going to sue them

1044
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:14,880
then

1045
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,280
we hand over

1046
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,320
and then it's up to law enforcement so

1047
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,000
often in these instances

1048
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,619
depending on the jurisdiction and the

1049
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:24,960
client often we would open up the

1050
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,940
criminal complaints would Lodge the

1051
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,160
affidavits we would generate

1052
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,900
a whole lot of evidence in terms of

1053
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,660
lectures forensic reports evidence

1054
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,579
and we leave it as that

1055
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:37,619
and some jurisdictions

1056
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:38,339
um

1057
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:40,260
stake it like Ethiopia

1058
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,700
we would

1059
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,619
the client would do the reporting and

1060
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:44,940
then we'd engage with Interpol

1061
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,260
especially if it's a

1062
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,599
multi-jurisdictional kind of issue

1063
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:50,040
and we've learned through through

1064
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,260
experience that for those of you know

1065
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,880
fugitives on the Run

1066
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,640
if you're looking to Red Flag somebody

1067
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,339
if you know where they are and you tell

1068
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:01,200
for example Bangkok we were looking for

1069
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,540
some hackers you know where they are you

1070
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,700
start a multi-year process with a one

1071
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,339
just one government Department talks to

1072
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,900
the other and it just takes

1073
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,540
two three five years but we've learned

1074
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,880
with them knowing that if you say to

1075
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,680
them that you don't know where they are

1076
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,900
they'll issue a red notice fairly

1077
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,359
quickly a couple of months

1078
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,760
so we at first when we did this we made

1079
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,619
them very angry because we would say to

1080
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:27,599
them we don't know where they are but in

1081
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,880
fact we'd flown into Thailand

1082
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,520
we'd gone to Phuket we'd gone on to an

1083
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,160
island and the hecka had started a whole

1084
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,780
Spa

1085
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,640
and we discovered that through Facebook

1086
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,800
so we knew where they were

1087
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,440
and then we had a whole kind of let's

1088
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,420
call it the Gathering in Bangkok where

1089
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,280
we got them together and we knew we'd do

1090
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,619
around that but we let him run

1091
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:51,420
and then we said so we've got the red

1092
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,820
notice issued and then we went okay we

1093
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,680
just discovered where they are and off

1094
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,960
they go and the reason why we do that is

1095
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,359
in some jurisdictions I take Bangkok

1096
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:02,880
Thailand as example they're getting 2

1097
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,980
000 red notice requests a month because

1098
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,460
they got Israelis Russians bulgarians a

1099
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,720
whole lot of people that have gone there

1100
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,700
because of their cyber crime

1101
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,680
legislation or the lack it off and

1102
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,880
that's why they run their businesses

1103
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,900
from there

1104
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,780
so the Ukrainian cybercrime police

1105
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:22,079
raided multiple premises

1106
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,320
this lady got particularly angry she was

1107
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,540
in a curlers she was in a

1108
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,800
sleepwear

1109
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,660
and somebody was going to take a

1110
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:33,480
chainsaw I mean a grinder and go

1111
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,400
straight through her door I've been on

1112
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,440
so many years and they are incredibly

1113
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,700
dangerous

1114
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,359
and

1115
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,079
let's just stop it there because she

1116
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:44,880
goes off her head

1117
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,079
okay

1118
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:47,760
and the problem is with these is

1119
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,380
although we've got law enforcement so

1120
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,480
sometimes you'll have 10 12 15 police

1121
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,180
officers to you there's always people

1122
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,619
who want to fight

1123
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:59,040
and she was wanting to fight and in some

1124
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,839
instances as I said

1125
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,180
we've asked very nicely for our data

1126
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,220
clients data to be returned they don't

1127
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,560
so we've just learned the only way to

1128
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,200
listen is go in and take every single

1129
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,880
server that's on that rack or all the

1130
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,740
racks we just take it all out and we

1131
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,180
just put it in a warehouse

1132
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,640
we take our time

1133
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,099
then there was a whole lot of Siege and

1134
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:23,700
different kind of offices and houses

1135
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,400
a whole lot of people fled

1136
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,200
and the reason why I've blocked some of

1137
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,700
those people off some of the legal

1138
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,980
action is still happening and will still

1139
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,480
happen for a while

1140
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,040
as you can imagine there's a whole lot

1141
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,619
of complexities with this case because

1142
00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:38,460
multi-jurisdictional a lot of these

1143
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,540
people have left gone to other

1144
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:42,180
jurisdictions around the IP legislation

1145
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,619
the country and what's criminal in one

1146
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:44,820
country it's not criminal in the other

1147
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,140
country

1148
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:49,320
it's the feeding ground for for lawyers

1149
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:53,780
so so a lot of you sorry a lot of you

1150
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,480
oof

1151
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,420
that's the issue we come across in most

1152
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,280
of these investigations

1153
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,599
and

1154
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,960
being a CIO many many many years ago I

1155
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,700
used to have the same fights

1156
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,680
most of the time you are underfunded

1157
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,000
you're not represented at the right

1158
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,780
level

1159
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:15,119
people are going to listen to you

1160
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,920
and

1161
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,119
some people say if we don't know if

1162
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:19,859
we've done some penetration testing or

1163
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:21,780
the tested something they think it's

1164
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,160
fine

1165
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,839
nobody's attacked us why would they want

1166
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:26,520
to attack us we're small we're in a

1167
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,500
strange jurisdiction

1168
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,319
or they think that they're running

1169
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:33,480
really good software but now we've seen

1170
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,180
with supplier side attacks that doesn't

1171
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,500
actually matter because all they do is

1172
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,240
they

1173
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,579
they go for your weakest Point into the

1174
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:42,420
system

1175
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,119
and take out

1176
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,220
uh the biggest issue was to have is

1177
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,140
people who run third party kind of

1178
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:51,839
systems or providers think

1179
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,180
that's fine they also get compromised or

1180
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,760
they also don't run things

1181
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,040
as they should

1182
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,960
and this is the thing that we come

1183
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,420
across almost consistently

1184
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,520
the issue as well is for us the big

1185
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,560
domino effect is for a lot of the big

1186
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,839
clients so we had one big client that

1187
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:11,819
was listing in the US two weeks before

1188
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:13,619
they're listing the whole platform got

1189
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:15,720
compromised and that could have

1190
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,220
potentially have taken out that whole

1191
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,359
listing

1192
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:19,560
and people don't quite understand

1193
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,960
particularly at the board level

1194
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,460
The Knockout effect

1195
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,280
so biggest issue we have is when the

1196
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,500
poop is eat the fan and now they want to

1197
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,579
spend

1198
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:32,099
all the money and I'm talking no money

1199
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:33,960
is too much to go and find this and sort

1200
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,099
it out

1201
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:37,380
spend the money up front then you then

1202
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:40,280
you don't have this issue

1203
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,319
so for us

1204
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:44,819
most of you will know this it's about

1205
00:44:44,819 --> 00:44:47,339
improving our cyber security getting the

1206
00:44:47,339 --> 00:44:49,260
right kind of representation the right

1207
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,599
levels putting all the right stuff in

1208
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:52,740
place

1209
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:55,200
making sure that

1210
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,660
you know you're not you're not one of

1211
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,140
the targets

1212
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,480
and having what we would call a

1213
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,700
continuous improvement process and

1214
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,319
always testing and seeing what is going

1215
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:09,560
on

1216
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,270
it's me

1217
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:22,959
[Applause]

1218
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:27,319
I can see you

1219
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:39,980
fact that you

1220
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,740
yeah so if if we're able to bring people

1221
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:47,880
into

1222
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,180
the UK we can get a court order on our

1223
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,280
set of facts here and then that court

1224
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,980
order can then be applied kind of to a

1225
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,359
different jurisdiction and I mean

1226
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:00,000
applied quite quite Loosely it's if you

1227
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,099
get an order here you then go to Malta

1228
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:04,500
Cyprus right wherever it is and you'll

1229
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,880
have to go through a process but it's a

1230
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,800
far easier process than us having

1231
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,020
somebody sitting in Russia or Ukraine

1232
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,300
where I can almost tell you don't don't

1233
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,640
waste your time

1234
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,720
sorry yep

1235
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:19,800
hi

1236
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,020
um how do you limit the risk that you

1237
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:25,500
become a pawn and the the clients game

1238
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,140
so I

1239
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,760
was probably it's a very good question

1240
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,859
because it's one of the the things that

1241
00:46:31,859 --> 00:46:34,800
we always need to be careful of because

1242
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,440
for example we did work for local

1243
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,060
government and you have one political

1244
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,339
party who's coming to power wants to

1245
00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:43,800
take out the other political party and

1246
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,359
particularly in this space where there's

1247
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,940
a lot of data Brokers and stuff you need

1248
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:50,099
to be so aware of what is going on

1249
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:52,140
around you you've got to so with this

1250
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,200
one we did a whole lot of kind of due

1251
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,359
diligence before we even started this

1252
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,099
process to try and work out who the

1253
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:01,140
Figures were we did a whole lot of

1254
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:02,760
validation with other people we know and

1255
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,859
saying tell us about this company

1256
00:47:04,859 --> 00:47:06,960
so that we kind of made sure that we

1257
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,700
were doing a legitimate kind of

1258
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,619
investigation and we're not trying to

1259
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,300
score settle scores

1260
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,440
but I think it's something we have to be

1261
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,720
very Mindful and careful of

1262
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:19,220
in any forensic work we do

1263
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,440
with the rise of say facial recognition

1264
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,420
Technologies do you worry about your

1265
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:28,980
social engineering techniques becoming

1266
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,380
less effective where did I learn them

1267
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,060
sorry do you worry about your social

1268
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:34,740
engineering techniques becoming less

1269
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:37,380
effective as so there are more data is

1270
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:39,480
known about people

1271
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,640
so we so one of the issues we we have to

1272
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:42,960
be very careful of is when we're

1273
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,060
investigating people we gener we collect

1274
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:47,220
a lot of information about a whole

1275
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:48,900
variety of people so I've got to make

1276
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,540
sure that I'm finding that information

1277
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:53,400
for the right purpose

1278
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,560
then in terms of social engineering it's

1279
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:58,759
are you asking me whether

1280
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:03,619
so you just

1281
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:05,579
you bought them over to London and

1282
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:07,319
you're coming up with these profiles and

1283
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:09,359
they worry that it's going to

1284
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:10,800
need to find out

1285
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,260
something or to find out where you

1286
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:14,280
really so there's a flip side I'll

1287
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,660
answer it this way

1288
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,220
I eventually become a witness in a court

1289
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,660
case

1290
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:23,160
so I I am Freddie fudpucker Donald Duck

1291
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,040
for better word and

1292
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,920
I would say that

1293
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,780
in ninety percent of the investigations

1294
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,640
we've done we've managed to delete every

1295
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,079
single digital

1296
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:35,940
kind of breadcrumb

1297
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:38,040
I would say they've been reasons why we

1298
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,060
haven't

1299
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,619
to this date

1300
00:48:40,619 --> 00:48:43,260
that's never been exploited

1301
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,900
but I have like in these instances

1302
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,359
eventually I have to appear

1303
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:51,240
as a person so the problem we have day

1304
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,460
to day is a client traveling with 12

1305
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,020
bodyguards

1306
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:58,140
but go a year later I'm back at home

1307
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,760
and that's the biggest issue facing our

1308
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,400
com our company and our clients is to

1309
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,260
how do they give me

1310
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,380
permanent protection

1311
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,339
particularly because we've been targeted

1312
00:49:08,339 --> 00:49:09,720
very heavily at time and then people try

1313
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,599
to kill me with poisoning me it's

1314
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:13,980
it's something we're still addressing

1315
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,359
it's probably the reason why we can't

1316
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:16,800
get professional Indemnity insurance

1317
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,680
because of the way of the kind of work

1318
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,140
we do but I think

1319
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:22,859
um

1320
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:25,319
I try as hard as possible I I fully

1321
00:49:25,319 --> 00:49:27,839
understand the risk of what I'm doing

1322
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,900
um

1323
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,220
yeah it's something that I live with I

1324
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,399
think

1325
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,420
how do you handle issues with data

1326
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:44,220
protection legislation

1327
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:46,200
is it possible for the bad guys to do a

1328
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,759
subject access request halfway through

1329
00:49:50,099 --> 00:49:51,359
so

1330
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,180
we spend four months setting going

1331
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,400
through data protection issues before we

1332
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,720
can set up this business in the Isle of

1333
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:58,619
Man

1334
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:00,839
and every I can't tell you how many

1335
00:50:00,839 --> 00:50:03,060
processes we had to go through so we had

1336
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:04,980
risk management compliance data

1337
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:07,440
protection every kind of lawyer and his

1338
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,540
friend going through it so they have

1339
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,839
created a

1340
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:14,940
a method it's called a framework that we

1341
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:17,220
use and every process we follow we have

1342
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:19,260
to get legal advice but everything

1343
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,760
you're seeing

1344
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,579
is open source data

1345
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:26,280
that we just happen to find a way

1346
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,200
to legally exploit

1347
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,480
that data

1348
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,599
it's a very tight box

1349
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,319
um

1350
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,480
so the scary thing about open source

1351
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,520
intelligence is I can put

1352
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,619
my email address in and within three

1353
00:50:40,619 --> 00:50:42,480
seconds I can tell you over 500 sites

1354
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,400
where that's used same thing I can take

1355
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,280
your photo your phone number and within

1356
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,339
seconds I can find it it's scary what is

1357
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:51,300
out there

1358
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,640
and some of the software we use they

1359
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,140
only give it to forensic people after

1360
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:57,180
you've been vetted as you can imagine

1361
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:00,180
like facial recognition software

1362
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:03,480
it's the use cases and the abuse cases

1363
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,740
it's just so big

1364
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,940
just quickly on that

1365
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:14,040
I know that AI is coming it was

1366
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,980
mentioned too and proof that your AI got

1367
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:20,160
to the conclusion it did might need to

1368
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,720
be shown in court

1369
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,720
in your experience with the processes

1370
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,180
you've used at the moment yeah you might

1371
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:30,839
get to an open source picture eventually

1372
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:33,720
but that whole chain itself that led you

1373
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:34,859
there

1374
00:51:34,859 --> 00:51:37,460
is perhaps inadmissible under certain

1375
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:39,780
circumstances for that endpoint evidence

1376
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:42,720
if attained a certain way do you have

1377
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,720
any advice generally on that space or

1378
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,280
thoughts

1379
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,240
so I'm I'm very strict when it comes to

1380
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,579
our methodology and our chain of custody

1381
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:54,960
because

1382
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,960
if I cannot lawfully get data

1383
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,640
I cannot use it

1384
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,859
so I'll give an example in another

1385
00:52:01,859 --> 00:52:03,599
instance where Herbert Smith Three Hills

1386
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:06,780
we're our lawyers I got interrogated

1387
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:09,900
twice for five days

1388
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,180
and you can understand why because they

1389
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:14,220
wanted to know how did you get from here

1390
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:16,980
to here how did you find his face how

1391
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:18,180
did you find this phone number was

1392
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:20,099
connected to here so we had to step

1393
00:52:20,099 --> 00:52:25,200
through for 10 solid days so to me it we

1394
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,359
are ex we have access to a whole lot of

1395
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:30,059
databases whole lot of techniques I must

1396
00:52:30,059 --> 00:52:31,140
make sure

1397
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:34,140
that whatever I do is lawful because

1398
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:36,059
otherwise I can't use it and I'll tell

1399
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:37,079
you there are a whole lot of people out

1400
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:39,240
there that are completely different and

1401
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,619
they will find something reverse

1402
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:42,240
engineer would go back and say oh this

1403
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,859
is how I got it I don't want to go there

1404
00:52:46,859 --> 00:52:49,500
just in summary then there's no case for

1405
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,500
plausible deniability in your view

1406
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,359
I will tell you when you and the witness

1407
00:52:54,359 --> 00:52:56,400
stand being interrogated

1408
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,020
you will make sure that you've done it

1409
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:59,339
correctly and your whole team has done

1410
00:52:59,339 --> 00:53:01,880
it correctly

1411
00:53:06,359 --> 00:53:08,839
sorry

1412
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,400
uh

1413
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,640
that you cannot recall how you got it

1414
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:17,379
[Laughter]

1415
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,980
I basically have to connect all of those

1416
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:22,319
dots together and I kind of like have to

1417
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:23,880
show all the breadcrumbs

1418
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,160
in one flow I can't just have bits of

1419
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,260
pieces because we eventually put it in a

1420
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,359
report a hand over 100 gigs a date and I

1421
00:53:30,359 --> 00:53:31,440
say

1422
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,099
here it is

1423
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:41,160
[Applause]

1424
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,859
we're done could I ask a question even

1425
00:53:43,859 --> 00:53:45,440
though I'm cool

1426
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,880
I do have to ask this question of what

1427
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,200
keeps you motivated because you're

1428
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,819
putting yourself at risk every single

1429
00:53:50,819 --> 00:53:53,579
day uh even being here uh you know

1430
00:53:53,579 --> 00:53:55,140
sharing this information is putting you

1431
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:58,260
at risk what keeps you motivated

1432
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:01,339
solving crime

1433
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,000
getting clients back something was

1434
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,940
stolen I mean I've I learned in this I

1435
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:07,140
land this environment completely by

1436
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:09,300
accident and every day I get up is a

1437
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,160
completely new day and it's

1438
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:14,160
and a lot of the time it's a real

1439
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,920
challenge trying to find stuff connected

1440
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,859
find people and it's being patient

1441
00:54:19,859 --> 00:54:22,500
methodical and finding that one thing

1442
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,839
that they make which is a mistake so one

1443
00:54:24,839 --> 00:54:26,520
day we find a person who disappeared for

1444
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,319
seven years because he played pool

1445
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:30,780
and a photo was put up on Facebook and

1446
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:32,220
our facial recognition software found

1447
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,459
him

1448
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:41,510
thank you very much

1449
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:47,379
[Applause]
