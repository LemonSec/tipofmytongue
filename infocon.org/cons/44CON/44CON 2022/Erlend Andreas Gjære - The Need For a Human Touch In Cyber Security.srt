attractive sport

93
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,839

00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,600

101
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,380
an investor yeah we have lots of good

102
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,080
investors and if you actually bought 18

103
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,979
000 Bitcoins in 2017 and sold them in

104
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:50,460
2021 you would have like three or four

105
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,840
hundred thousand dollars in profit

106
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,820

110
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,580
to fund her own gym

111
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,840
and she even got the advice from her

112
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,139
aunt who is a bank executive she is

113
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,680
conservative she thought it was risky

114
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,660
but hey have you made any investments

115
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,900
before

116
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,800
I'm like well no

117
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:29,880

118
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,680
so what are we waiting for I say

119
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,580
oh okay that's the next day

120
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,880
and my Jesse is gone

121
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,740
can you imagine the Heartbreak

122
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,440
I'm still feeling it right

123
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,600
this is too real

124
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,080
I mean I was getting so very well along

125
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,600
with this girl and

126
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,160
turns out

127
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,500
she wasn't only talking to me

128
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,240
Twitter disables accounts

129
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,560
because there are scammers

130
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,000
so you know what the worst thing is

131
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,620
yeah

132
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,960
I don't think Jesse looked like the

133
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,600
profile picture it may even look like

134
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,560
this

135
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,259
and this is the person I was getting so

136
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:31,080
acquainted with investing my time and

137
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,180
energy and

138
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,919
yeah

139
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:37,800
no the worst thing did I mention I'm

140
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,960
married so when I told my wife about

141
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,479
this

142
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:45,600
you can't imagine the reaction right

143
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,060
yeah it was an experiment and she knew

144
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,240
so we're still married no problem uh

145
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,880
Jesse was an experiment from my side I

146
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,880
don't think Jesse knew that I knew

147
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,440
about her

148
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,940
but I was

149
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,840
collecting data I was building a story

150
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,400
because I tried to tell these stories

151
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,319
make it real to people how these things

152
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,639
work

153
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,280
and stories they have a unique ability

154
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,780
to let people in on

155
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,759
understanding through actually getting

156
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,300
emotionally invested in the story you

157
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,319
get curious what's happening next and I

158
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,780
could really relate to this myself I

159
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,340
don't know if anyone could relate to

160
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,599
actually being in this situation

161
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:39,060
yourself or have been

162
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,000
but this is real and people are tricked

163
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,620
by scammers

164
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,039
looking like this but obviously using

165
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,039
some I don't know photos they pull from

166
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:52,680
a random Instagram account to portray as

167
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,479
someone else

168
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,900
without blinking

169
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,020
and they use

170
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,259
science of psychology

171
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:06,120
science of influence

172
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,759
and there are a number of tricks in the

173
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,319
book actually and I'm going to go

174
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,580
through these seven tricks that

175
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:19,440
well scammers use to build uh influence

176
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,160
or build a relationship with you but

177
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,960
the interesting thing is they were

178
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,940
originally developed for actually

179
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,240
improving sales performance

180
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,899
they were used for good I mean sales is

181
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,000
about helping people buying something in

182
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,539
their need right so it helping people

183
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:43,039
right it's something good

184
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,700
could be

185
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,399
um I'm kind of giving people something

186
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,380
makes them want to give back to you

187
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,040
right so if this person shares something

188
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,959
with me I want to share something with

189
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,060
her she sends me a photo I want to send

190
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:01,019
a photo back right simple as that uh you

191
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:03,779
invite someone into a party and yeah

192
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:06,660
we would like to invite them back

193
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,779
but often the key is how you give it it

194
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:11,580
has to be kind of unexpected then you

195
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,100
will have the most impact and when I

196
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,279
talk about this influencing techniques

197
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,980
please note that they can be used for

198
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,740
good and for bad so now we heard a story

199
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,240
about the bad

200
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,760
but you can also keep in mind since we

201
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,399
are Security Professionals here

202
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,440
we can also use

203
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,080
I don't know call them tricks but I

204
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,820
don't know methods for influence because

205
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,360
I know technical people like us we have

206
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,140
a tendency to speak in technical terms

207
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,860
we could sometimes use with a few skills

208
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,380
to improve our impacts when

209
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,040
communicating in the organization right

210
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,600
okay so giving stuff away sure uh

211
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,000
anybody wants a t-shirt yeah I'll give

212
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,899
that to a personal question okay uh

213
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:06,839
let's build our relationship and then

214
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,540
obviously people like others who like

215
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,160
them right

216
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,540
so yeah we get receptive to ideas from

217
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,399
people we like

218
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,500
Tupperware parties have been so

219
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,200
successful because it's about people who

220
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,519
get together because they're friends

221
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,899
anyway and then they share these little

222
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:29,580
things that they sell to each other and

223
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,260
it's boom

224
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,700
they sold so much more

225
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,240
we do what other people do but not

226
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,839
anyone but people who are similar to us

227
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:45,480
so if we say yeah everybody let's use

228
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,740
MFA then all of you will of course do

229
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,300
that because we are all Security

230
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,160
Professionals here

231
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,860
but people who don't identify themselves

232
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,040
with us will not necessarily think that

233
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,300
this will apply to them

234
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,480
finding like Common Ground making us

235
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,000
more similar to other people we meet

236
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,700
will give us a better chance to

237
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,839
influence their choices and decisions

238
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,399
people listen to Authority

239
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,700
I'm not Tim berners-lee

240
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,680
I guess none of you have even heard my

241
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,839
name until today

242
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,700
so I'm standing on the stage so

243
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,860
hopefully I think I have some influence

244
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,459
on you since I was in fact invited by a

245
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:38,100
committee to come here although probably

246
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,720
they didn't know anything about me

247
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,220
before either

248
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,660
uh

249
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,120
but using Authority if you don't have it

250
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,279
it's also possible because you can use

251
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,820
someone with authority to speak your

252
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,260
message

253
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,899
so if you don't have that Authority in

254
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:56,339
the organization yourself you can

255
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:58,500
actually yeah piggyback someone who has

256
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,720
to carry your message

257
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,600
this one is really important in the love

258
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,200
scams

259
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,740
start engaging with someone

260
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,500
start committing

261
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,860
when you respond to an email saying

262
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,440
pretending to be from your boss saying

263
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,779
hey I need help with some urgent stuff

264
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,779
and you're like hey yeah I'm ready what

265
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:30,000
do you need then you're already kind of

266
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,620
committed

267
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,680
and then the response is again it's very

268
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,500
kind of innocent yeah I just need to buy

269
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,660
some gift cards I was like yeah okay

270
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,480
sure I can help you with that and then

271
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,600
for each commitment each statement you

272
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,839
commit more same in love scams

273
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,180
when you develop a relationship you

274
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,500
commit to them

275
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,959
and that's why even victims of love

276
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,139
scams who have been tricked for hundreds

277
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:01,320
of thousands of pounds even

278
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,959
still can't realize they have been

279
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:07,260
tricked they don't want to realize they

280
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,000
were wrong because it went so far

281
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,399
and finally people loves an advantage

282
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,040
and they hate to lose out on a

283
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,480
opportunity

284
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,519
so this is also something people put up

285
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:22,920
so yeah just see if she

286
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,440
shared her success story as an investor

287
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,839
and of course I would love to be in her

288
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,160
shoes

289
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,440
right so I'm going to tell you another

290
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,579
story

291
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:35,820
this time about two people who are

292
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,459

real people Thomas and anina they are in

294
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,760

um that was me coming back into the

341
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:53,420
office

342
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,779
I fired them so don't worry

343
00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:00,660
no we actually laughed for many days it

344
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,980
was so funny

345
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,079
uh I must admit I've been probably

346
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,779
responsible for sending some hundreds of

347
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:09,300
thousands of assimilated phishing emails

348
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,779
through the years to other people so it

349
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:13,500
was

350
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,220
about time I got some payback in return

351
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,360
so yeah happy to do that

352
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,420
fishing simulations and won't do that

353
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,600
fishing tests what do you call it

354
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,380
fishing awareness training yes

355
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,000
so I don't know if anyone works for

356
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,779
GoDaddy but they did this thing uh a

357
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:38,699
couple of years ago in the middle of

358
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:41,160
panamic we have a Christmas bonus for

359
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,380
everyone yay

360
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,720
click here to redeem of course

361
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,120
wow

362
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,820
this backfired heavily

363
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,220
you think this was nice to do

364
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:58,339
no do you think this was necessary to do

365
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,259
yeah I think that's where the discussion

366
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:04,079
goes I mean would any cyber criminal

367
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,020
have the ethics to not

368
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,900
posed as a Christmas bonus

369
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,980
no

370
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,599
so why should we avoid doing this

371
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,579
that's a good question

372
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,380
but I'm going to talk a little bit now

373
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,360
about building trust in our organization

374
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,460
building trust is one of many ways

375
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,840
to do security

376
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,700
in an organization

377
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,140
another way

378
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,880
though

379
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,160
is fair

380
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,980
yes we can use Fair

381
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,960
ing people saying everything is

382
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,520
dangerous do not click on any email

383
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,879
right

384
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,580
[Music]

385
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,539
um

386
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:54,539
fear is unpredictable

387
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:57,179
some people just oh well

388
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:59,179
yeah doesn't apply to me

389
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:02,880
people respond they're nervous

390
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,299
they stop clicking on emails altogether

391
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:08,400
maybe fear has a short-term effect but

392
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,039
uh negative long-term effects can you

393
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,860
always use fear no you can you can it

394
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,600
has its limitations and this has also

395
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,200
been a topic of of scientific research

396
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,380
uh the landsky in 2014 did a survey

397
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,840
found that fear for fishing had no

398
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,679
impact on fishing avoidance behavior

399
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:32,179
and that's eight years ago

400
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:38,220
fear uh can compromise an organization

401
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,760
fear of telling the truth

402
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,440
uh

403
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,460
intelligence has it that yeah

404
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,679
some people fear

405
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,320
speaking the truth to their boss in

406
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,320
Russia

407
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,660
maybe with good reason

408
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,780
um

409
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,679
but is it really an effective way to run

410
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:07,380
an organization no I think we all know

411
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,720
the answer to that

412
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,720
um I don't know how culture is like in

413
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,059
the UK about this I never worked in a UK

414
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:16,860
organization I was only here as a

415
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,840
student in Norway

416
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,160
um I think we were voted as like the

417
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,120
most naive uh second most naive

418
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:31,140
population in Europe so we we usually

419
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,720
don't use these techniques but I know

420
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,720
some who do still

421
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,200
can't build resilience on something that

422
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,740
unpredictable as fear which is a emotion

423
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,700
leads us to running away right

424
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,559
and this has also been subject to a lot

425
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,200
of research and here is a model you may

426
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,120
have heard about it you may have seen it

427
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,520
uh the Swiss Cheese model by James

428
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,500
reason he was a professor at Manchester

429
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,419
University

430
00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:03,480
and I added like annotations here

431
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,140
because yeah swiss cheese model

432
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,679
is about barriers barriers for

433
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:14,160
compromise breach whatever something bad

434
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,559
is going to happen and this model has

435
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,840
been used a lot in aviation in

436
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,419
healthcare and process manufacturing

437
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:22,500
Industries

438
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:28,640
Etc where he human lives are at stake

439
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,419
and to build barriers you use a number

440
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:36,120
of techniques which all together produce

441
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,400
these layers by layer by layer it's like

442
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,299
yeah

443
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:43,380
security layered security right

444
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,940
and if Hazard should arrive

445
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,640
there should be a number of faults

446
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,520
that all align together

447
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,740
really well if you're going to have a

448
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,059
loss in the end

449
00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:00,120
but if your holes in the layers are big

450
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,240
then of course the probability that this

451
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,880
Hazard will actually cause a loss will

452
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,120
increase

453
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,280
and I added like the technology people

454
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,559
in process Triad which we often talk

455
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:17,160
about in security and yeah I mean when

456
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,900
you talk about security technology or

457
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,020
technology or yeah

458
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,299
things going bad in security

459
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:27,600
we often hear this it's human error

460
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,860
right

461
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,679
so a company got breached oh what

462
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,299
happened human error

463
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,340
it was our student our intern was it

464
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,320
solarwinds or something

465
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,700
yeah

466
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,640
human error even pinpointing a symptom

467
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,280
here because that's what they do when

468
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,860
you say it's human error

469
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,980
you're not actually finding

470
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,120
the cause you're finding a symptom

471
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,340
and the symptom is

472
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,679
just like in healthcare

473
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,740
nothing we really need to be treating we

474
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,659
want to be treating the cause of the

475
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,020
disease

476
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:14,120
so how can we find the course

477
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:18,900
how can we find the course because when

478
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,960
we work with people we cannot settle

479
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,740
with human error as the cause

480
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,720
it's not good enough

481
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,299
we have to find out

482
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:32,960
why

483
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,299
it was a human error

484
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:39,720
why okay can everyone say that it was a

485
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,799
human error

486
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,480
why

487
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,659
okay somebody clicked the link

488
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:47,340
why

489
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,340
we have two y's okay can you guess what

490
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,960
the next one is

491
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,840
why

492
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,580
maybe it's someone else's perspective

493
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:04,980
four wise five wise ask five wise

494
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,140
why did it happen okay why did that

495
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:11,400
happen why did that happen then

496
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,740
five times

497
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,419
then

498
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:17,520
you're doing a root cause analysis then

499
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,100
you're approaching the real cause

500
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,460
of why something went wrong

501
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,640
and the fifth why could be because our

502
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,380
management don't care about security

503
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,700
because a student

504
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,140
had clicked the wrong link

505
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,520
you actually need to find the root cause

506
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,500
and this is

507
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,679
the most cost benefit effective advice I

508
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:48,000
can ever give you as a security

509
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,380
professional

510
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:53,600
ask why five times

511
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,980
if something has gone wrong

512
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,559
we also want to maybe ask why if

513
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,900
something almost went wrong

514
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,059
then you need to actually know that

515
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:05,940
something almost went wrong and how do

516
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,159
you do that

517
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,080
well you've got to have trust in your

518
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,880
organization you've got to have people

519
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,820
letting you know something almost went

520
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,659
wrong

521
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:18,539
only then can you

522
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:19,799
find

523
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:21,360
the risk

524
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,400
before it actually goes wrong then you

525
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,740
can treat the risk

526
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:29,960
before you actually have a loss

527
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,240
okay

528
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,840
I'm going to dive even deeper into human

529
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,120
error and how we can actually

530
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,880
answer to this wise okay because

531
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,059
research in mentioned fields of

532
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:49,520
um

533
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,820
Healthcare and

534
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,740
yeah Pro skills control

535
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,760
Etc

536
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,340
they have been

537
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,559
researching different kinds of human

538
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:03,120
errors

539
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,740
it's not just one

540
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,200
there are many kinds this one

541
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,600
we can call that a slip obviously the

542
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,200
journalist who wrote a piece and

543
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,020
happened to forget or slip it's just

544
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,100
like yeah

545
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,080
Tom mcadron who asked to remain

546
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,480
anonymous nice

547
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,120
so it was just it wasn't uh

548
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,559
intentionally doing this and this is

549
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,480
like the first class of Errors like the

550
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,279
unintentional errors people aren't

551
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,080
trying to do bad but they just do

552
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,080
because they're people

553
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,700
make mistakes

554
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,220
okay

555
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,760
slips and this can happen also

556
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,220
yeah in I.T security like

557
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:50,100
uh yeah I can I can come up with some

558
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,740
examples uh afterwards I think I'd spend

559
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,600
too much time if I come up with examples

560
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,799
for everything

561
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:58,440
this one is called the lapse it's when

562
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,200
you actually forget that something uh

563
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,000
was actually the case

564
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,820
um it's very similar to slip but uh yeah

565
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,159
it's not a class kind of of Errors from

566
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,600
from research

567
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,900
um yeah forgot that the bus was too tall

568
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,700
for the bridge

569
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,400
uh here we have another one

570
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,740
it's called a rule-based mistake it's

571
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,320
one we have like a recipe for something

572
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,900
but the recipe is insufficient in

573
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,000
instructing how so we kind of we follow

574
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,460
the rules but the rules they're

575
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,059
incomplete or yeah unsufficient to to

576
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:34,799
actually get it right

577
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,779
so yeah

578
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:39,320
um these things happen

579
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,840
on one of these kind of things yeah I

580
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,940
could do the example of encrypting an

581
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,179
email uh it's it's very kind of abstract

582
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:49,860
and difficult to do so we can't expect

583
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,220
people to just understand it's like

584
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,539
um

585
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:58,080
concept of Email encryption so there are

586
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,419
so many ways to do it wrong you could

587
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:02,220
give a recipe but people don't still

588
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,200
don't have the understanding of

589
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,299
validating an email signature right

590
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:13,700
then you have like lack of knowledge or

591
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,260
knowledge-based mistakes

592
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:20,880
so yeah simply looking a translator

593
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,419
to to translate English to Arabic

594
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,500
um yeah

595
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,000
and when you say a lack of knowledge

596
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,580
yeah how do we treat that

597
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,919
uh yeah I don't know if any of you work

598
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,900
with security awareness and training but

599
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,760
I know many people who kind of feel a

600
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,220
bit like this

601
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:43,020
but anyway people need some knowledge

602
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,840
and I'll get back to that in the end how

603
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,220
we can actually increase people's

604
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,100
knowledge but yeah it's not always

605
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,940
trivial to do but many of the accidents

606
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,700
that happened from the unintentional

607
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,620
errors

608
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:02,100
um can be treated with very concrete uh

609
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,799
fixes so to say yeah training is one

610
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,539
checklists

611
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:08,279
like Innovation they use so many

612
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:12,980
checklists just to avoid the memory uh

613
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:16,440
weakness like the lapses and just okay

614
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,360
check check check check and you go

615
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:22,200
through a list every single time

616
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,000
and you have this because you cannot

617
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,700
afford to like no airplane just drop

618
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,400
down oops let's rethink it

619
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,220
as it was a laptop like we do that in it

620
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,620
it's very simple and usually yeah

621
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,840
ransomware yeah didn't take down our

622
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,620
network storage so yeah just re-tank and

623
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:44,340
rinse and repeat yes

624
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,919
then you have like these routine

625
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:48,679
violations and now we're talking about

626
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:50,940
intentional errors

627
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,000
so routine violations they get so common

628
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,700
that people yeah I know we have this

629
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,100
rule but we kind of just don't follow it

630
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,679
and then our new colleagues come in and

631
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,659
see we're not following the rules so

632
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,779
we'll get even more rules kind of broken

633
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:10,380
and and omitted yeah maybe so much we

634
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,559
actually have to build a new road to

635
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:15,539
kind of uh

636
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:19,740
to catch up with the the amount of

637
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,820
rule of policy violations

638
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,080
but in general this is a really bad

639
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,240
thing so if you detect that maybe it's

640
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,279
not just the people you shouldn't be

641
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,779
worrying about maybe it's the rule

642
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:32,460
itself

643
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,740
maybe you're asking people about the

644
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,600
wrong thing

645
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,220
or maybe you're not supporting them

646
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:41,640
enough maybe they need a better tool

647
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,220
if you say people yeah you should always

648
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,100
encrypt your sensitive Communications in

649
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,440
email if you're sending it and you have

650
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,659
to like well use a number of tools and

651
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:53,220
understand them it's like

652
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,039
okay maybe it's just better to get the

653
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:57,899
service that is actually working for

654
00:29:57,899 --> 00:30:00,659
people to get the job done

655
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:03,740
so they don't build this

656
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:07,919
Shadow I.T lots of

657
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,080
services that you don't have any control

658
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,240
over

659
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,120
then you have like situational errors

660
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,000
you can also call them shortcuts which

661
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,860
happen when yeah

662
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,620
you know you shouldn't be doing this but

663
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,840
you really need to build this I don't

664
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,700
know wall before the plumber comes

665
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,919
tomorrow so you just have to do it

666
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:30,419
it's like yeah you have this deadline

667
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:32,640
you just have to send this document

668
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,700
unencrypted via email so you yeah you

669
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,340
just do this this one time and that

670
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,100
could very well be

671
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,899
a good way

672
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:45,899
to manage risk

673
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:48,059
because the business isn't there to

674
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:49,919
support security security is there to

675
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:51,240
support business

676
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,340
and maybe

677
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,140
sometimes

678
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,600
people are in this situation where they

679
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,799
actually make

680
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:03,779
kind of x exceptional mistakes

681
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,000
because

682
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,880
the risk of loss

683
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,360
from kind of following the rules would

684
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,700
actually be much greater

685
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,760
than taking a calculated risk and

686
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,460
calculated is the key word if you have a

687
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,080
calculated risk

688
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,299
you can actually say yeah but I

689
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,520
evaluated this and this and that and I

690
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,500
found that this was actually the right

691
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,380
thing to do in the end

692
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,200
although it failed

693
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,039
which could also be an outcome

694
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,620
but this is where I want to to to bring

695
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,659
the focus back into like the positive

696
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:44,700
side of people

697
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,059
because

698
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,559
machines can't do the thinking for us

699
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,779
yeah we say yeah we gotta have this

700
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:54,480
technical controls to fix everything

701
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,059
right we can't rely on humans just fire

702
00:31:57,059 --> 00:31:58,799
all the people and our business we'll be

703
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,059
fine

704
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:03,480
can't do that we need the people and we

705
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,620
can really benefit from people who have

706
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,899
an understanding of risk

707
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:13,320
who can make informed risk-based

708
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,419
decisions

709
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:18,260
in the business

710
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,520
that will help the business

711
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:26,880
so making better decisions is really

712
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,340
valuable to an organization

713
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,980
people who are able to think and

714
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,440
sometimes out of the box

715
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,299
will help the organization

716
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:44,399
sometimes people just need clear

717
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,320
instructions have you ever flown an

718
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,980
airplane like this

719
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,440
whatever you have right is it fun I

720
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,799
never did Scary yeah because it has only

721
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:59,340
one engine sorry

722
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,460
around the thunderstorms right you can't

723
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,720
go through

724
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,760
it's a small aircraft

725
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,799
it has only one engine

726
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:10,260
you know did you did you ever read the

727
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,080
manual before getting into the plane

728
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,360
you were in the back the uh I guess the

729
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,580
pilots had read the manual you know what

730
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:21,299
manual says on the Cessna uh one engine

731
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:22,679
airplane

732
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:28,019
if you have an engine outage

733
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,140
okay what should you do

734
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,539
anyone

735
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:36,019
start crying

736
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:38,820
take the plane down yeah it says

737
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:42,320
remember to fly

738
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,679
what else can you do but it's still it's

739
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:51,440
the most sane advice remember to fly

740
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,539
and we need to understand both the

741
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:56,640
technical Dimension here and the human

742
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,299
dimension

743
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,679
and we need to give people the tools

744
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,200
they need to stay safe and then people

745
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,300
can make the exceptional outcome out of

746
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,899
lots of situations we would really kind

747
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:16,260
of fear but but still if we if we manage

748
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:19,260
to build this understanding of risk then

749
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:22,679
then people are much better equipped to

750
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:25,399
do the right thing

751
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,500
and so when I speak about Hope

752
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,560
um and this is my second to final slide

753
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,418
I'm going to spend a little bit of time

754
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:38,219
here

755
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:40,440
because we've been doing some research

756
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,179
and building on some previous research

757
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:44,280
actually from some exceptional research

758
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,960
done here in London University College

759
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,540
in London Angela SAS and her team used

760
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:53,820
to uh like for two decades build so much

761
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:57,420
knowledge in human-centered security and

762
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,480
I've been

763
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,480
scientific researcher myself reading all

764
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,940
this research and now as an entrepreneur

765
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,119
building

766
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:11,460
ways to to to communicate better with

767
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,140
people

768
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,900
in terms of risk

769
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,460
and if you have a look at this model

770
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,700
it's actually boiling down a lot of

771
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:23,240
several studies and also some like

772
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,400
interdisciplinary ideas I don't know if

773
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,260
any of you have heard about personas

774
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,040
in software engineering and product

775
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,440
development you you have these personas

776
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,900
which are kind of stereotypical users

777
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,119
that you build based on like you do

778
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,040
interviews and collect data about your

779
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,099
users and their I don't know needs and

780
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:46,740
and who they are and how they do things

781
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,140
and and want to do things sir in order

782
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,579
to understand better how you can help

783
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:52,440
them and I think one of the things we

784
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,260
can really do better in securities

785
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:59,160
yeah not relying on fear and this

786
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,079
yeah

787
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:04,020
bad things but rather build on like the

788
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,000
positive risk there is positive risk

789
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,420
also in security we also always almost

790
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,060
focus on the negative risk but if humans

791
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,880
are the cause of 90 of all

792
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,060
bad stuff that happens I would say 100

793
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,560
because yeah in the end it's all a human

794
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,020
who've programmed the computer right so

795
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:25,200
if we say 50 or 60 or 90 or 100 it

796
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,420
doesn't matter but if we're going to

797
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,000
actually

798
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,040
provide people with the understanding

799
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,540
they need

800
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,700
then we need to understand the people

801
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,339
better

802
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:40,079
and so we've been doing this research

803
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,260
and we did a research study now also

804
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,960
with the university in in Norway on like

805
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,500
from from The Institute of Design and

806
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,079
kind of uh studying like the user

807
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,619
Journey the of an employee in a company

808
00:36:54,619 --> 00:36:57,420
with respect to security and these are

809
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,000
people employees they don't work in

810
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,160
security and we've been studying how

811
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,079
people what kind of touch points they

812
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,619
have what kind of emotions they face

813
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:10,440
their kind of experiencing like is the

814
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,560
fair or uncertainty or is it Joy yeah

815
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,800
new security awareness video or phishing

816
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,160
tests like

817
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,839
I got caught again or maybe you're

818
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,599
laughing because we're having fun we

819
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:26,579
learned something new right

820
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:29,760
um the the self-efficacy I mean how

821
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,280
people actually believe in themselves

822
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,440
and their own ability to

823
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,300
do something

824
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,060
The Cure like do you believe you're able

825
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:43,740
to enable MFA on Facebook

826
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,480
do you believe you're able to do this

827
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,020
yeah I can't expect security people to

828
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,640
be

829
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,880
expecting themselves to be enabling that

830
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,320
right

831
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,119
if you ask

832
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,240
your friends who are not working in it

833
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,900
are do you think you're able to do this

834
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,380
then you're touching a point there

835
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:10,020
yeah both their risk understanding but

836
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:13,619
also kind of their interests or effects

837
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:16,740
an effect is the like the academic word

838
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,599
they use but it's like

839
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:20,339
yeah what what do you actually feel

840
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,920
inside when somebody talks to you about

841
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,859
multi-factor authentication or MFA and

842
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:29,040
you're like uh MFA what's that I have no

843
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,660
idea

844
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,119
um so I think it's possible and based on

845
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,040
these studies and our own research also

846
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,160
to actually try to see if okay we have

847
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,660
these people who have a high degree of

848
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,820
risk understanding and also positive

849
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,079
interests

850
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:45,599
and a positive effect towards security

851
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,440
and compliance right I guess most of you

852
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,920
guys are in the top right corner here in

853
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,280
the green smiley face it's a group and

854
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,079
it's large because we're in a security

855
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,240
event

856
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,460
maybe in our company we also have these

857
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,859
large groups of people who yeah they

858
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:06,540
know what they need to do and yeah

859
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,280
they're happy to do it

860
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,040
Champions they called Maybe

861
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,920
then you have like the positive ones

862
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,140
but they lack the risk understanding

863
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,000
these are people who are kind of happy

864
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,680
to receive whatever knowledge we can

865
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,720
give to them I mean

866
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,060
micro learning or phishing assessment is

867
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,619
like oh yeah I'll learn something today

868
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:27,000
and it's good

869
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,800
right

870
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,660
and then you have the people

871
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,900
to the right slower corner like the I

872
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,940
don't know they want to

873
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,460
be their own kind of Boss they don't

874
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,320
like compliance they want Linux on their

875
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,619
laptop I don't know they have a high

876
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:45,960
degree of risk understanding maybe some

877
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,700
of you are here but they're not

878
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,740
interested in compliance

879
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,380
kind of have this friction between like

880
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,359
the security team or compliance team and

881
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:56,880
and how they actually need to work maybe

882
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,280
they're developers they just need to get

883
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,619
the job done you can't compile your

884
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:03,720
software without admin rights on your PC

885
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,060
so you need admin rights

886
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,160
right

887
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,339
you have the ones low on facts and low

888
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:14,520
on risk understanding research proposes

889
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,320
you can fire them in Norway that would

890
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,040
be illegal but I don't know uh it's uh

891
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,260
yeah you kind of just have to help them

892
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:25,140
however you can if you fire them you're

893
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,480
kind of treating a symptom but maybe all

894
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,820
hope is out but hopefully not and then

895
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,079
in the middle you have like the big

896
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:33,599
fuzzy blob and yeah most people are

897
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,700
there but maybe if you like poke a hole

898
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,839
in them

899
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:38,880
maybe you can find out if they're moving

900
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,280
somewhere in this model so this is what

901
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,500
we're researching and I think if you're

902
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,359
better able to understand the people

903
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,000
we're communicating with we're better

904
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,540
able to actually design a message to

905
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:54,599
create a message that people will

906
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:57,300
respond to in a positive way that will

907
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,160
actually increase their effect increase

908
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,160
their own belief in their own ability to

909
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,720
make good security decisions

910
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,720
and if we can do that we can achieve

911
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,599
a risk of wear

912
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:15,960
Workforce people who are able to make

913
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,820
the exceptional decisions whenever

914
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,920
needed

915
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,980
not just the I don't know

916
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,599
um

917
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:31,040
random look or unlock of human error

918
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,099

919

buttons

933
00:42:05,339 --> 00:42:07,740
and then finally just to recap the

934
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:10,380
entire presentation all of these points

935
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,880
maybe you remember them

936
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,160
about influence

937
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,240
okay

938
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,040
because it's not all about social

939
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,680
engineering

940
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,859
that we need to teach people how to

941
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:24,839
avoid social engineering and

942
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:26,700
manipulation

943
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,880
we also need to learn something about

944
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,960
people

945
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,700
we also need to learn something about

946
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:36,240
being human maybe even expose ourselves

947
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,859
to

948
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:41,280
a love scam just to get the feeling of

949
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,500
how things work and how maybe other

950
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,680
people experience this

951
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,119
we had the discussion in the pub

952
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:50,820
yesterday I was like yeah can you

953
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:53,720
actually do this for fun

954
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,220
actually it is a little bit of fun

955
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,819
to expose yourself to this

956
00:42:58,819 --> 00:43:01,800
can be

957
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,660
if you're just wasting another scammer's

958
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:06,060
time man it could be worse

959
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,619
all right

960
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:09,540
so with that I say thank you for your

961
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:12,000
attention I love to come here and please

962
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,610
if you have questions

963
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:14,940
[Music]

964
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,480

965
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:27,720
[Applause]

966
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:31,520
a t-shirt for a question come on

967
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,980
I do have a question regarding the five

968
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:44,880
wise because if you deal with companies

969
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,740
um in Singapore I'm just saying this

970
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,420
because I Come From There usually when

971
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,579
you go to the five wise people are very

972
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:53,099
used to having every answer other than

973
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:56,040
management being the issue by the time

974
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,900
we hit five it's usually somewhere else

975
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,900
like a vendor issue or that issue how do

976
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,300
you make sure that they focus on what is

977
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,700
actually happening yeah yeah this is a

978
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,800
really great question and it's

979
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,800
I I guess it could be a very culturally

980
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,200
dependent like if you have a culture

981
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,119
where you never blame management it's

982
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,400
really difficult to blame management

983
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,460
but again it that is a weakness in kind

984
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,260
of the organization if you cannot have

985
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,200
that trust so in any way you can you

986
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,420
should really use the opportunity to

987
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,579
build trust in the organization this is

988
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:33,000
universal any company

989
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,020
needs to build trusts needs to be like

990
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:42,780
capable uh competent employees

991
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,359
um so that is never a waste of investing

992
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:49,040
your time I think yeah

993
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,140
does he get the T-shirt

994
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:58,260
we'll get a t-shirts yeah you want to

995
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,720
see the T-shirt yeah

996
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,540
it's uh

997
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,040
it says

998
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,880
it's a trap

999
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:11,839
ask if in doubt okay so

1000
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:15,060
I guess people can ask you now

1001
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:20,000
okay thank you guys thank you thank you
