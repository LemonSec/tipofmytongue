1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,130
all right well good morning everyone

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:08,309
thanks for making it

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,170
my name is is shawl work for a company

4
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:13,259
called sense post we're a South African

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:16,079
paint testing operation we're owned by a

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:21,090
business called secure data here in the

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:23,970
UK I work for secure data now and I run

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,300
a security intelligence and threat

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,519
detection unit within secure data my

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,340
talk this morning is called bad

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,769
analogies make bad realities and the

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:38,270
subtitle is are we sitting on a security

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,350
debt crisis that's my twitter handle

14
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:43,290
being a South African I'm trying very

15
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,579
hard to catch up with Elon Musk and Mark

16
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,149
Shuttleworth in terms of Twitter

17
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:52,820
followers my mom and my wife aren't on

18
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:55,920
Twitter so I need all the help I can get

19
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:58,620
you if you participate in Twitter then

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,800
take take a moment to follow Mia and

21
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:04,860
I've uploaded the slides onto on 2g

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,179
Drive so if you're taking photos you can

23
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,830
make a note of the URL you can download

24
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,290
it and follow along the slides are quite

25
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:13,650
content heavy and I won't be going into

26
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,820
all of the details so it's the topic

27
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,950
captures your interest in was probably

28
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:23,539
worth downloading then having a look

29
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:27,600
alright so why this talk

30
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:30,150
well back in 2016 while we were talking

31
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:34,649
about hacking internet-connected sex

32
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:37,200
toys russian hackers targeting the u.s.

33
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:40,259
changed the world I think in quite a

34
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,460
substantial way not only did they have

35
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:47,790
the gumption to try to affect and

36
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:50,479
possibly actually affect the outcome of

37
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:55,170
a democratic election in a free country

38
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:57,590
but they suspend an entire new phase an

39
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,360
entire new era I believe in our industry

40
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:02,880
and we'll all know the sort of major

41
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:07,950
events eternal blue wanna cry not

42
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,720
picture those were all events in our

43
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,340
industry that emerged directly as a

44
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:16,599
consequence of Russian government hack

45
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:19,030
and us offensive cyber operations and I

46
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:21,910
think significantly up the game for us

47
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:23,560
significantly changed what it is that

48
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,630
we're dealing with and it happened on

49
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:29,410
our watch something that happened in our

50
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:32,859
industry during our time and so I think

51
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:34,900
today we're looking at a world that's

52
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,720
completely different to the world that

53
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:41,230
we knew before there's a there's a

54
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:45,100
threat emerging that has the potential

55
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:47,380
to fundamentally change the world as we

56
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:50,650
know it I'm not just talking about our

57
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,790
own security you know take the security

58
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:55,870
of our own technology and our own

59
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:57,459
personal privacy or even the security of

60
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:01,450
the businesses and the organizations

61
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:03,549
that we work for I'm talking about the

62
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,780
the our families the people we know and

63
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:10,870
love the society that we operate in

64
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,670
those things have the potential to be to

65
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:15,790
be to be changed in very substantial

66
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:18,160
ways over the next few years

67
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:22,480
directly as a result of what's happening

68
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:24,010
in the security space and you know that

69
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,320
can work out in good ways good things

70
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:28,540
can emerge from that or bad things can

71
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,489
emerge from that but very certainly

72
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,400
things are going to change and they're

73
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:36,340
going to change in real and significant

74
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,900
in significant ways and if you're

75
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,190
sitting in this room or you're sitting

76
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,819
next door you're sleeping off a hangover

77
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:45,609
from last night then like it or not

78
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:48,608
you're a part of that battle that's that

79
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:49,989
started your you're at the front of a

80
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:51,670
war that I think is going to shape our

81
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:54,670
world over the next few years in a very

82
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:56,980
substantial way and so we're all

83
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:59,108
participants we're we're all shaping it

84
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,230
through the things that we do the things

85
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:04,870
that we say the decisions that we make

86
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:06,790
and so it's very much up to us to

87
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:11,260
determine how the world is going to

88
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:13,298
shape up over the next few years and I

89
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,659
think there's a there's a call to action

90
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:19,329
here in that we as security

91
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:22,720
practitioners need to step up to this

92
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:25,110
challenge recognize that we're not in

93
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,110
Kansas anymore this is not kindergarten

94
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,879
it's not just fun and games but what we

95
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,800
do really matters and it matters in a

96
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:34,949
very fundamental and as I said in a

97
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:39,030
societal way and I think that stepping

98
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:42,270
up requires for us as practitioners to

99
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:44,878
to commence to start out on a journey of

100
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:48,060
maturity a kind of a process of growing

101
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:52,020
up in which we rethink about what we do

102
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:53,789
and how we do it and moving from where

103
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,280
many of us are today as kind of solitary

104
00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:58,590
operators that do what we have to do in

105
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,929
our own space to a place where we can be

106
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:04,049
generally genuinely significant

107
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:06,270
genuinely impact a society and the world

108
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:09,659
and I think there's a number of phases

109
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:11,789
on that journey now we start off being

110
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:13,590
solitary operators and in that space we

111
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:15,449
need to improve and work on our own

112
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:18,869
performance we need to become excellent

113
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:21,090
at what we do genuine experts people who

114
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:24,840
really know what we talk about think

115
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:27,779
research study learn practice we need to

116
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,549
progress from there to developing

117
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:32,819
process that allows us to be sustainable

118
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:35,490
allows what we do to be repeated and not

119
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:37,500
only by ourselves but also by others we

120
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,719
need to make it simple for others to

121
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:43,529
reproduce what we do and we do that by

122
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:45,710
producing tools white papers blog posts

123
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:49,139
participating at conferences like this

124
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:51,029
then we need to make it scalable which

125
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:53,969
means that can be done by others beyond

126
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:56,520
ourselves at a larger scale and that

127
00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:59,129
involves investing in people empowering

128
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:02,190
other people to be as good as we are at

129
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:04,589
what we do and then we need to move from

130
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:07,469
there I believe to be being taken

131
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:11,009
seriously in the places that we work and

132
00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:12,930
in the industries that we operate in and

133
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:16,800
I think we do that by being able to

134
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:19,589
accurately express purpose why is

135
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,930
security important why does one decision

136
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:23,699
better than another decision why can

137
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,680
this trade-off not be accepted what is

138
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:29,120
the return on investments of being able

139
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:32,310
to handle those things being able to

140
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,959
express those things will allow us to be

141
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,789
taken seriously in those in the spaces

142
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:37,560
that we work and then beyond that I

143
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:38,289
think we need to start impacting society

144
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,840
by

145
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:43,900
by developing the ability to express a

146
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:46,450
purpose and principle sorry and by that

147
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,760
I mean the why of security why is

148
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:50,469
privacy importance in today's world why

149
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,570
is security important in today's world

150
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:54,730
why does it matter that these things are

151
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:56,770
done right and then finally I think once

152
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:58,450
we've mastered that we can emerge at a

153
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:00,609
point where we can really affect policy

154
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:02,229
at the highest levels the decisions that

155
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:04,750
government makes the priorities that

156
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:06,280
they have at all levels can be affected

157
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:09,490
and then at that point I believe we can

158
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,989
be significant and as I said I think

159
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,540
this is a call to arms for us I think

160
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:15,820
this is something that we should all put

161
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:17,500
on our roadmaps for ourselves to move

162
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,880
out of the space we were sort of playing

163
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,040
around with things that are interesting

164
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,330
and fun for us to get a place we were

165
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,290
really affecting the way the world

166
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:28,570
thinks about the decisions we make now

167
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:30,850
on this journey there's a large part of

168
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:32,710
it that you can still do on your own you

169
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,720
can operate in isolation you can talk to

170
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:37,979
yourself you can work from your office

171
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,240
so from your or from your from your home

172
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:42,610
but if we really want to move up that

173
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,740
trajectory we have to get to the point

174
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:47,050
where we can express our thoughts and

175
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,760
our ideas and our principles in clear

176
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,730
language that other people can

177
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:55,570
understand starting at the board we need

178
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:58,750
to be able to we need to be explain why

179
00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:02,740
security is important using terms and

180
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:04,840
analogies and and and vernacular that

181
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:08,020
the people we're communicating with can

182
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:10,119
understand and so a big part of my

183
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,820
thesis in my presentation this morning

184
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,130
is to express the idea that metaphors

185
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:19,090
matter so the vernacular that we use

186
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:20,980
when we talk about what we do changes

187
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,989
the way we think about what we do and

188
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,340
the way that other people think about

189
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:26,380
what we do and I want to give you a

190
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:30,820
simple example that I really like what

191
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:32,439
I'm talking to people there's a there's

192
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,120
an there's an analogy a metaphor that

193
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,550
emerges from from Africa where we're

194
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,010
from about the gazelle who lives in the

195
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:40,510
African bush and the gazelle when when

196
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:42,340
she wakes up in the morning knows that

197
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,900
she has to start running just to get up

198
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,640
and she has to start running because

199
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,260
she's running away from a predator from

200
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,630
a lion that wants to catch her an eater

201
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,130
and if the gazelle doesn't run quick

202
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,540
enough and fast enough

203
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,580
then the Lions gonna catch her and

204
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:56,829
she'll be destroyed similarly the lion

205
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,570
wakes up and he has to start running yes

206
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:59,980
not running to catch prey so he can eat

207
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,870
and survive and if the lion doesn't run

208
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:04,480
quick enough and fast enough then the

209
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,530
Lions gonna starve and die and listen

210
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,510
energy I don't have you've encountered

211
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:09,459
it by I hear it a lot this idea that

212
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,930
we're running away from lions and it's a

213
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,300
comfortable and energy for people they

214
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:15,579
like it because it expresses a sense of

215
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,589
linearity of cause and effect if I do

216
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,240
wake up I'm the prey obviously I'm the

217
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:21,490
gazelle if I do wake up and I start

218
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,530
running and I'm fast enough and I run

219
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,880
for long enough then I can outrun the

220
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:28,120
line and I'll be safe and I'll survive

221
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,560
to run another day and and people like

222
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,640
that it gives you a sense of comfort to

223
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,520
think there's something I can do

224
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,880
something definite and concrete that I

225
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:39,819
can apply myself to that will improve my

226
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,340
chances for survival an analogy gets

227
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:44,770
extended from there by arguing that I

228
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:46,960
don't even have to outrun the lion all I

229
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:48,579
have to do is outrun the other gazelle

230
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,870
because I'm running faster than the

231
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,220
other gazelle then the lion are going to

232
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:54,370
catch the slower gazelles and they'll

233
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:56,680
get eaten and not us right so this kind

234
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,960
of analogy shapes the way we think about

235
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:02,109
security and sets people in a particular

236
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:04,360
course if we shift that analogy we

237
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,560
express what we do as security

238
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,870
practitioners in a slightly different

239
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:10,599
way we can evoke other kinds of thinking

240
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:12,220
so for example if I say to you security

241
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,560
is not like a gazelle running a right

242
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,900
from a lion but security is more like

243
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,000
running with the Bulls in Pamplona then

244
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,860
I can invoke other ideas right other

245
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,470
ways of thinking running with the Bulls

246
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:25,600
is very much not linear there's very

247
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,790
little cause and effect if you are stuck

248
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,130
on that narrow road with 17 angry Bulls

249
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,930
and thousands of other runners there's

250
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:34,030
very little linearity in what we do

251
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:37,000
rather what you get is a sense of chaos

252
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:38,980
right a sense of unpredictability the

253
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,530
sense that ultimately no matter what I

254
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:43,900
do I'm gonna get gorged by the bull

255
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:45,310
eventually anyway I can't really predict

256
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,860
which bullets going to be and I can't

257
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:49,540
really change the probabilities by

258
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:52,330
running faster or running differently

259
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:54,880
right there's this randomness and

260
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:56,380
unpredictability and that brings like

261
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,120
other ways of thinking now I stop

262
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,950
thinking about what I do to protect

263
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,270
myself and I start thinking more about

264
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:04,220
what I do when I get gorged right

265
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:06,439
when I get compromised so start thinking

266
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:09,290
about detection and response and so

267
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:12,130
changing the analogy changes the way we

268
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:15,740
think and shifts the conversation and

269
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:18,140
there's one particular area where I

270
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:19,820
think we use analogy to try and express

271
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:22,040
what we do and why it's important and

272
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:24,050
that's in the language of risk so when

273
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:27,410
we talk to businesses for the most part

274
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:31,280
we're talking about risk and so I think

275
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:33,140
risk is one of those one of the

276
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:36,470
analogies that we use in our space that

277
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:39,160
really deserves to be to be examined to

278
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:43,730
be criticized and maybe to be revisited

279
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:46,640
and we try all kinds of tools to express

280
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:48,410
risk to business and one very nice one

281
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,819
that I found on the net is this idea of

282
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:51,740
the Doomsday Clock which I'm sure you

283
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,380
all are familiar with the Doomsday Clock

284
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:57,620
is a simple mechanism that you use to

285
00:11:54,380 --> 00:12:00,590
try and express to outside stakeholders

286
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:03,470
there's the size of the the threat that

287
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:05,240
they're facing and the and the

288
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:07,160
likelihood that that threat is going to

289
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,190
be realized it's a very simple very

290
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:12,740
graphical way of communicating a complex

291
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,850
idea to people to whom it matters but

292
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:17,030
that don't necessarily have the

293
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:19,100
technical expertise to work it out for

294
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:20,839
themselves and in in the same way risk

295
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:23,780
is the language that we try and use to

296
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,730
express the urgency around security to

297
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:27,589
our stakeholders and particularly to

298
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:29,360
business and as I said to society on a

299
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:32,260
whole and to the regulators and

300
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,600
policymakers that that shape the world

301
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:38,090
our risk generally has these two axes

302
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,250
two ways we use to try and quantify risk

303
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:43,010
we talk about the severity so how bad is

304
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:45,110
it gonna be you know how much will

305
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:47,150
we be in when things go wrong and then

306
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:49,220
this is the likelihood so how probable

307
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:51,860
is it that that thing is going to to

308
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,930
happen and so we talked about severity

309
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,690
and likelihood and we try and express to

310
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:58,520
our stakeholders just you know we're the

311
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:01,370
Doomsday Clock is if you like in terms

312
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,540
of the in terms of the security concept

313
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:05,870
that you're trying to communicate

314
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:07,939
the problem with risk is that we're

315
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,960
basically thumb-sucking you'll see I've

316
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,200
got a new tablet that's got a

317
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,700
touchscreen and so I can

318
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,530
I'm writing on everything now just

319
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:17,620
because I can

320
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:18,459
so we're estimating these things with

321
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,000
thumb-sucking

322
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:24,160
these concepts we don't have a way to

323
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,920
concretely qualify them and people much

324
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,870
smarter than me in our space have been

325
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,900
talking about this problem for some time

326
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:33,160
now you may know Alex Hutton is famous

327
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:36,790
for his contributions to the horizon

328
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:38,890
Dvir right in the various framework an

329
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:41,079
Alex points are that really risk is this

330
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:43,569
absolutely quintessential concept in

331
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,250
what we do and yet we don't really

332
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:49,240
understand it right we haven't dropped

333
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:51,460
it we don't get it as an industry dan

334
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,570
gear who everyone has to quote in a

335
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,370
presentation because it makes you look

336
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:56,620
smarter than you are

337
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:59,890
captured it captures it a different way

338
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:02,830
he says look as an industry we were able

339
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:05,230
to roughly say that option X is better

340
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:06,910
than option Y but we're really in no

341
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:10,780
position to try and quantify how much

342
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:13,120
better X's than Y and then I really like

343
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:15,370
this quote from Richard Bayly we will

344
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,820
know from tile security is the CTO at

345
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,130
fireEye

346
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:20,260
he brings up this idea of what he calls

347
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:22,810
physics Envy it's another concept that

348
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:26,470
he that he stumbled upon physics Envy is

349
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:28,540
this tendency by other industries to try

350
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:30,100
and assert that we have the same kind of

351
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,380
precision the same kind of scientific

352
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:35,230
precision that you see in real Sciences

353
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:37,300
like physics and chemistry and when we

354
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:39,490
try and pretend that we've got the

355
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:42,219
ability to quantify and express things

356
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:44,380
in the way that the real scientists do

357
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:46,060
that's called physics Envy so which was

358
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:50,620
beta leases were suffering from physics

359
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:52,030
Envy coming back to Alex Hutton he he

360
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,940
asks a question on his blog and

361
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:57,339
incidentally I highly recommend it look

362
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,300
at new school security but a blog

363
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,100
there's some very smart people

364
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:02,410
contributed he asked the questions now

365
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,910
how do we rank how do we rank in the

366
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:06,990
family of Sciences in terms of being

367
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:09,719
able to quantify and express what we do

368
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:13,090
and these findings are pretty damning

369
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:16,060
now and I will admit to sometimes

370
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:17,710
forgetting to wear trousers in the UK

371
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,390
you can't call them pants you have to

372
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:21,430
call them trousers I'll confess that

373
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:23,290
that sometimes me but on the whole

374
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:26,079
having been in this industry

375
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:27,610
for for almost 20 years now I find this

376
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,439
assessment of our performance pretty

377
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:32,139
damning it's a little bit miserable and

378
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:36,130
so I think there's an argument to be

379
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:38,259
made that we can do better and Paris of

380
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:40,509
tablets from from Google from the chrome

381
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:43,209
team expressed it very nicely in a new

382
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:45,009
in a black hat keynote earlier this year

383
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:46,810
where she said you know let's the

384
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:50,649
status quo it doesn't have to be like

385
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:53,258
this we can do better and so I want to

386
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:55,959
make an attempt to make this part of

387
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:59,319
what we do a little bit better by

388
00:15:55,959 --> 00:16:01,388
talking about an alternative analogy in

389
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:03,519
turn ative metaphor that we can

390
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:06,220
potentially use to express what we do to

391
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:10,959
business and that's why talking about

392
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:12,850
debt rather than talking about risk now

393
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,219
before I launch into this in too much

394
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:17,019
detail I need to make a confession

395
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,550
when when this idea sort of started to

396
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:20,410
occurring to me started occurring to me

397
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:23,319
I thought I was very clever and I

398
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:24,910
immediately wanted to TM you know get a

399
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:29,110
brand name form idea I was thinking

400
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:31,120
about debt Kapil UPS the security dit

401
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,829
copper lips and I thought it would make

402
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,480
me famous but of course as is often the

403
00:16:32,829 --> 00:16:36,069
case when I started actually reading and

404
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,360
researching it turns out a lot of people

405
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:39,639
again much smarter than me

406
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,500
have been thinking about this much

407
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:43,120
longer than me and I need to highlight

408
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,449
some of those people the first is only

409
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,850
white house now with NTT was with rex at

410
00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:54,279
the time who wrote a paper about in 2012

411
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:57,370
i forget this guy's name alfonso herrera

412
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:59,800
wrote a article about it also in 2012

413
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:02,889
and then chris why so for whom i know as

414
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:05,230
well pond he jumped in later with a

415
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:08,770
number of blog posts on the very cold

416
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:12,459
blog and in dan gear and guna peterson

417
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:15,819
in 2014 wrote a very short but I think

418
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:19,270
very sort of powerful paper on the

419
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:21,760
concept which was published in the on

420
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:24,099
the using X forums now I'm going to be

421
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,079
referring to these people and and really

422
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:28,329
shamelessly plagiarizing their work

423
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,470
throughout my presentation I would

424
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:30,850
recommend that you go and find these

425
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,530
papers of this topic interests you at

426
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:35,530
all there's some very interesting work

427
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:36,559
but really the idea begins with another

428
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:39,889
guy a guy

429
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:42,168
Ward Cunningham back in 1992 expressed

430
00:17:39,889 --> 00:17:44,379
this idea of what he calls technical

431
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:44,379
debt

432
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:49,490
what Cunningham is famous for having

433
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:52,009
developed the wiki server used Wikipedia

434
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:53,809
that concept the technical framework

435
00:17:52,009 --> 00:17:56,149
that that's built on was developed by

436
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:59,360
Ward Cunningham and and he talks about

437
00:17:56,149 --> 00:18:01,518
technical talks about this idea of early

438
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,428
in the lifecycle of a new development

439
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:07,340
project going into debt and you're going

440
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:09,619
to debt effectively too by making

441
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:12,428
shortcuts to achieve deadlines or add

442
00:18:09,619 --> 00:18:15,769
features at the expense of doing things

443
00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:18,320
right the first time so the expense of

444
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:19,999
fixing the fundamentals you rush ahead

445
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,460
to some kind of outcome and in doing so

446
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:24,499
you accrue debt and he points out that

447
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:27,049
that becomes dangerous when that debt is

448
00:18:24,499 --> 00:18:30,169
ultimately not paid and that's because

449
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:32,389
debt in technology like debt in finance

450
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:34,220
accrues interest over time and so over

451
00:18:32,389 --> 00:18:36,139
time it becomes more and more difficult

452
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,940
to pay that debt back and I think we all

453
00:18:36,139 --> 00:18:40,039
know that to be true right we know that

454
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,779
it's true that the later in the software

455
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:43,610
development lifecycle we discover an

456
00:18:41,779 --> 00:18:44,659
address a bug the more expensive it

457
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:47,689
becomes was something that's very

458
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:49,730
clearly understood now another guy that

459
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:51,529
I came across in my research I'd never

460
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:54,820
heard about before it goes by the name

461
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:57,799
of Melvin he blogs and talks a lot about

462
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:59,480
software development and DevOps he talks

463
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:01,249
about technical decks on his page and he

464
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,639
highlights sort of four high-level

465
00:19:01,249 --> 00:19:06,649
categories causes of a Korean debt

466
00:19:04,639 --> 00:19:10,879
things like making shortcuts as I said

467
00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:15,080
to hit deadlines using old or unpatched

468
00:19:10,879 --> 00:19:18,678
libraries or frameworks prioritizing

469
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:21,379
features of as I said fundamentals or

470
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:24,080
making use of third parties like api's

471
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:26,240
for example that themselves have got

472
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,999
debt that themselves have made shortcuts

473
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:32,389
now if any of you are in a sort of seaso

474
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:34,909
security manager type role the CTO

475
00:19:32,389 --> 00:19:36,529
superhero then I think some of these

476
00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:39,049
concepts are going to be familiar to you

477
00:19:36,529 --> 00:19:40,909
from the security space also right we

478
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:42,950
see businesses making these trade-offs

479
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:45,559
and not only when they develop

480
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:48,200
technology but also when they assess and

481
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:49,010
prioritize the need for the security

482
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:53,240
recommendations

483
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:55,790
that we we make and so the the concept

484
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,410
emerged again back in 2012 with Ollie

485
00:19:55,790 --> 00:20:00,020
Whitehouse and with Chris were so cool

486
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:02,230
that we can think not only of technical

487
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:06,230
debt but we can think specifically about

488
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:07,700
security debt which is really the debt

489
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:09,140
that accrued when we make security

490
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:11,060
trade-offs not only in developing

491
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:13,250
software but also in the way we develop

492
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:15,679
our infrastructure the processes and the

493
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:17,990
and the projects that we prioritize the

494
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,150
people that we hire or don't hire all of

495
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:22,850
those things can be thought of as a

496
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:24,320
crewing security debt and so I want to

497
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:26,629
spend a fair amount of time in my

498
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:31,010
presentation today by talking about this

499
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:33,620
idea of debt and examining the the value

500
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:37,580
and the impact of using data and the

501
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:40,879
energy of using risk as an analogy and

502
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:42,409
to do that it's worth just spending a

503
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,210
little bit of time on outlining what

504
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:46,040
some of these what some of the concepts

505
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:48,620
are what are the elements of debt that

506
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,570
we have to be aware of what is the the

507
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:52,129
range I suppose that our analogy has to

508
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:53,689
cover so we need to start off by

509
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:56,600
understanding this debt vs. credit

510
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:58,160
that's borrowing vers lending you've got

511
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,959
the debt or the borrower who receives

512
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,060
the money you've got the creditor who's

513
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,470
giving the money you've got the loan

514
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:06,260
which is really the contract that

515
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:07,880
expresses that transaction and the loan

516
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:10,160
we'll talk about how much money is being

517
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,380
lent on what basis that needs to be

518
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:15,140
repaid so how frequently and within what

519
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:18,110
timeframe and also what happens if the

520
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:20,000
debt isn't repaid alright so if I don't

521
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,709
get my money what do I get in what I get

522
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,700
in return

523
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:24,350
there's the principle which is the

524
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:27,350
fundamental amount of money that's being

525
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:30,230
that's being loaned that decreases over

526
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:32,060
time as you pay it off generally to

527
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,860
favor the creditor there's interest that

528
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:36,860
gets paid as a premium on top of that

529
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:38,360
loan that interest is calculated as an

530
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,699
interest rate which is a percentage on

531
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:43,370
the premium and then that debt can be

532
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:45,020
secured or unsecured mostly you're going

533
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:47,300
to see secured debt which basically

534
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:50,810
means that the lender holds something of

535
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:53,690
value as hostage for the case that the

536
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:55,220
debt doesn't get repaid right and that

537
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:56,840
thing that's held us hostage is

538
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,730
something of value that's generally

539
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,159
refer to as collateral right these are

540
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:03,340
all terms that are that

541
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:06,040
familiar for you too you know the reason

542
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:09,010
I outlined them is because I want to try

543
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:12,100
and sort of clarify this analogy the

544
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:13,900
analogy between regular acid based acid

545
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,219
back debt so that's the debt you'll be

546
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:19,630
familiar with in your and your home

547
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:20,860
mortgage and security did so we think

548
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:23,620
about it from the top what's actually

549
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:26,800
happening is that a business is a

550
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:30,699
borrower the business needs resources in

551
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:32,350
order to pursue its own objectives so it

552
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,450
goes to somewhere where they are

553
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:36,429
potentially resources and in the Pope

554
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:38,020
for the purposes of mind energy that

555
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:39,580
some way is going to be the risk

556
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,800
mitigation function so the risk

557
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:44,560
mitigation function has people has money

558
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,899
has budget as time has energy that it

559
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,909
can invest in reducing risk right

560
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,500
dealing with security problems and the

561
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:53,050
business goes and takes that away from

562
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,540
the risk mitigation function in order to

563
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:56,409
invest it into something else

564
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:59,230
now that's something else maybe

565
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:00,820
technology that maybe people may be

566
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:03,340
marketing you know whatever else the

567
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:06,850
business thinks is necessary and the

568
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:09,399
business is doing that in order to in

569
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:12,520
the future generate some utility value

570
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,290
right and that can be by spending on

571
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:21,190
operational things or can be by making

572
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:23,470
capital investments and so as collateral

573
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:26,500
the business is going to be using that

574
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:28,830
future utility value that future utility

575
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:31,270
value that's created by borrowing from

576
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:34,230
the security function is what's held

577
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:37,060
hostage in case the debt is not repaid

578
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:38,740
now in a normal loan debts have to be

579
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:41,649
repaid on a regular basis we all know

580
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:43,390
that from my own my own mortgages but in

581
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:45,730
this case and the security debt because

582
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:47,770
it's internal within a business it's

583
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:49,480
conceivable that the debt isn't repaid

584
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:50,950
on a regular basis right the business

585
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,140
decides when it's going to repay the

586
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:55,480
debt but I'm going to make the argument

587
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:57,370
a little bit later in these slides that

588
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,590
there are instances there are specific

589
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:02,199
identifiable circumstances under which

590
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:04,300
that debt must be repaid so it can't

591
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,180
simply be ignored it does have to be

592
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:09,490
repaid just like other debt and it gets

593
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:12,550
repaid from the revenue or capital

594
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:13,570
that's generated by the utility value

595
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:16,760
that was pre

596
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:18,559
from the learn right and ultimately that

597
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,390
deaf needs to be repaid back into the

598
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,250
security function as we know that

599
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:24,820
doesn't always happen but as I'm arguing

600
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:28,460
sometimes it should eventually it should

601
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:31,490
in this concept of borrowing to create

602
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:34,190
future value is what the finance guys

603
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:36,049
call leverage and this crowd quote

604
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:37,610
better explained it's a stock for like

605
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:40,158
kids and teenagers to understand

606
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:41,719
difficult concepts is what I use to

607
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,679
understand the concept of leverage so

608
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,640
I'll give you an idea of where I'm

609
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:48,620
operating and they make them they they

610
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,029
make the argument that that leverage is

611
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:52,129
a little bit like borrowing a cow and

612
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:54,200
selling the milk I really like this so I

613
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:56,210
go to Samuel who comes from India and he

614
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,630
has a lot of cows and I say soumil give

615
00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:01,669
me one of your cars I'm not gonna pay

616
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:05,450
you for it now but I'll pay you back

617
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:07,970
later in monthly installments then I

618
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:10,909
move the Kaua'i sell the milk and from

619
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:12,740
the proceeds of the milk I repay Samuel

620
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:15,409
fries car and hopefully I take a little

621
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:18,049
bit of a little bit of profit and that

622
00:25:15,409 --> 00:25:21,970
profit is what I gain by leveraging the

623
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:24,918
count and this concept works very well

624
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:28,520
but the leverage has the effect of

625
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:31,220
multiplying both the risk and the reward

626
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:33,500
of that business operation and you see

627
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:36,110
it very nicely in this little calculator

628
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:39,890
that I found so if I used my own money

629
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:41,330
and I bought a car and I'm hoping that

630
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:44,240
I'm gonna make twice my money back by

631
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:46,428
selling the milk then ultimately I've

632
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,840
got on the upside the opportunity is

633
00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:50,750
that I could make twice my money back

634
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,340
and on the downside the risk is that I

635
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:55,220
lose all my money right so I end up with

636
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:57,709
nothing if however I'm borrowing to buy

637
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:59,899
the car then both the risk and the

638
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:02,450
opportunity get multiplied I can still

639
00:25:59,899 --> 00:26:05,510
make much more money than I had much

640
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:08,450
more money than I had but I also stand

641
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:11,510
to lose much more if it goes wrong right

642
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:13,730
I can end up not having the car and not

643
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:15,379
having any money and still having to pay

644
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:17,870
some your back for the car that I

645
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:21,649
borrowed right so that's the trade-off

646
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:23,600
that you make when you leverage so I

647
00:26:21,649 --> 00:26:25,459
think there's some advantages to using

648
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,668
this debt analogy if you accept that it

649
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,869
can hold insecurity

650
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:29,009
and I think there's some advantages and

651
00:26:27,869 --> 00:26:32,149
I just want to trot through those very

652
00:26:29,009 --> 00:26:34,529
quickly the first is that it's concrete

653
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:36,779
dates is something that shows up on a

654
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:39,989
balance sheet of a business it's there

655
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:42,929
and it doesn't go away and it impacts in

656
00:26:39,989 --> 00:26:45,029
a very real way on business viability so

657
00:26:42,929 --> 00:26:46,769
if you have more debt than you have

658
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:48,419
assets then I can make the argument that

659
00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:50,489
your business is effectively bankrupt

660
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:52,350
right and I can do that based on the

661
00:26:50,489 --> 00:26:55,289
numbers that are present in your and

662
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:56,730
your financial statements and the

663
00:26:55,289 --> 00:26:59,039
business conscious to accept that away

664
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:01,710
they can't say oh that risk is accepted

665
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:03,658
we'll ignore it it's there it's on the

666
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:06,210
balance sheet and it stays there until

667
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:07,739
it gets repaid and that in turn links

668
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:08,970
directly into the fiduciary

669
00:27:07,739 --> 00:27:11,070
responsibilities of the people who

670
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:12,989
manage that business right the directors

671
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:14,580
and the board of that business are held

672
00:27:12,989 --> 00:27:17,730
to account for what's on the balance

673
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:19,649
sheet and in real finance you know that

674
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:21,659
can have you know criminal consequences

675
00:27:19,649 --> 00:27:23,639
for them if they're irresponsible with

676
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:26,190
how they manage that debt is also

677
00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:28,139
transferable that means it moves from

678
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:30,779
one place to another doing certain kinds

679
00:27:28,139 --> 00:27:33,330
of transactions and specifically what it

680
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:35,220
means for us is that if we buy or

681
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:37,289
implement the technology that's

682
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:39,840
developed by somebody else then we

683
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:41,309
inherit the debt that was accrued in

684
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,840
developing that technology and that has

685
00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:46,408
very powerful implications which I'll

686
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:48,119
touch on a little bit debt as we've

687
00:27:46,409 --> 00:27:51,950
noted accrues interest so it becomes

688
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:51,949
harder and harder to repay over time

689
00:27:52,489 --> 00:27:57,179
debt can be paid off and that's also

690
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:59,009
very concrete so as we invest in

691
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:01,259
security as we pay back these loans the

692
00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:05,119
debt on our books become smaller and

693
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:07,889
debt can be extrapolated so I can take I

694
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:10,139
can I can take an estimate of debt in

695
00:28:07,889 --> 00:28:11,850
one place and extrapolate what that

696
00:28:10,139 --> 00:28:14,008
means across for example in industry

697
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:16,080
across the sector across a group of

698
00:28:14,009 --> 00:28:19,320
companies even in a country I could say

699
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,029
this country has security debt to this

700
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:26,369
volume right it can be extrapolated in

701
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:27,929
that way but like all analogies debt as

702
00:28:26,369 --> 00:28:30,570
a way of expressing security isn't

703
00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:32,900
perfect so it holds in most counts but

704
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:34,700
it has some differences from

705
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,200
from get the way you would understand in

706
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,000
your mortgage and I'm gonna try and

707
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,130
express it with this with this diagram

708
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,560
so what you're seeing on the right there

709
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:45,170
is what I'm calling the the risk stack

710
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,610
or the debt step and it just expresses

711
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:48,830
the idea that I that I captured in that

712
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:51,169
table earlier very simply that we have a

713
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:52,909
risk mitigation function we borrow from

714
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:55,520
that function and accrue security debt

715
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:57,680
we leverage that debt to create utility

716
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,180
within a business that utility is used

717
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,010
to create revenue and that revenues

718
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:02,540
officer ultimately used to repay the

719
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:04,879
debt right that's that that's the risk

720
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:06,500
that's the debt stack and it exists in

721
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,570
every single business and it's not

722
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:12,470
necessarily a bad thing as we saw with

723
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:13,939
the cow analogy leveraging can be very

724
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:15,560
powerful it's how we get ahead so

725
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:18,350
businesses are doing it all all the time

726
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:20,060
it's acceptable and even good what we

727
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:23,240
have to realize though is it's not just

728
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:25,159
us that doing it everyone we buy from is

729
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,620
doing it also so when you buy a product

730
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:30,290
it has a debt stack like this in that

731
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:32,179
product right and unless the debt in

732
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:33,920
that product is repaid it's going to

733
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:36,410
continue cumulating interest just like

734
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:39,260
our own would and every single piece of

735
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:42,440
technology that we use within our

736
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:44,870
environments has that debt stack right

737
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:47,150
and so what happens is all of that stuff

738
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:49,159
accumulates right all the way from

739
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:50,750
hardware right through to the to the

740
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,490
products that we you know that we that

741
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:55,730
we run our systems on have the

742
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:57,860
accumulation of all the dead stacks from

743
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:59,570
all the vendors and all the participants

744
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:01,969
and all the contributors right bundled

745
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:04,879
up into them and that ultimately finds

746
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:06,980
its way into our own debt stack so when

747
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,540
you're trying to assess what the debt

748
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,730
level the security debt level of is a

749
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:12,170
business you can't just look at what

750
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:13,430
that business is the decisions that

751
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:16,160
business is made itself you have to

752
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:18,500
recognize that you're also inheriting in

753
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,720
a linear way all the other dates tax

754
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:25,160
made by the companies you work with the

755
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:27,560
systems that you that that you consume

756
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:31,880
and services you consume all right and

757
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:33,260
that idea allows us to think in some

758
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,900
different ways about security and

759
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:37,490
immediately brings to light some some I

760
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:40,520
think quite interesting new ideas to

761
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:43,250
play with and the first is this idea of

762
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:45,290
of accruing interest not only on your

763
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:46,040
own debt but also on the date that

764
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:48,470
you've inherited

765
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:50,300
others I slept us together Excel this is

766
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:52,760
not science this is definitely guys

767
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:54,590
riding on horses with tinfoil hats stuff

768
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,540
but I think it expresses the idea what

769
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:58,730
you see here is a balance sheet two Mach

770
00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:01,399
balance sheet of a business over time

771
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:03,950
and on the upside of that balance sheet

772
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:06,680
in terms of assets you've got the the

773
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:08,600
technology or the utility value that I

774
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,850
spoke about that the business has

775
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,649
developed and you've got the capital

776
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:14,179
that that business then accrues as a

777
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:16,580
result of having that utility value

778
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:18,620
below the line you've got the security

779
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:20,570
debt right a liability that needs to be

780
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:22,550
offset you've got the interest that

781
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:24,560
accumulates on that debt you've got the

782
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:26,120
the security debt from the vendors from

783
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,679
the technologies that you take in and

784
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,889
you've got the interest on those over

785
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:34,040
time what happens unless that debt is

786
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:35,870
repaid is that over time the utility

787
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:38,210
value decreases we call it amortization

788
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:40,219
right it gets less over time but the

789
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:42,740
interest accrues it gets more over time

790
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:44,510
and not just your own but also those of

791
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:46,550
the vendors if that debt is not repaid

792
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:48,050
and so what you see over time is that

793
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:50,360
the balance sheet of that business

794
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:53,389
shifts quite dramatically and in an

795
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:55,850
exponential way away from being net

796
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:58,730
positive to being negative which

797
00:31:55,850 --> 00:32:01,159
presents the argument that unless debt

798
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:04,310
is being repaid in a business that

799
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:06,950
business is arguably bankrupt they own

800
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:08,750
more than they have right and I don't

801
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:10,760
know if any of you of experiences but

802
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:13,040
I've seen businesses that we work with

803
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:15,350
we were presented with security problems

804
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:17,030
that were asked to help solve where it

805
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:19,879
becomes immediately apparent that that

806
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:22,580
business could never in afford to invest

807
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,920
what it would take to achieve a tenable

808
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:27,230
level of security based on how much they

809
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:29,270
make right their business model isn't

810
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:30,560
bankrupt and the only reason that

811
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:33,290
they're still functioning in the world

812
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:35,179
and not being run under is because

813
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:38,240
they're not being forced to repay that

814
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:39,860
debt the cost is being externalized to

815
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,960
others were ultimately the victims of

816
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:43,760
security compromises and that's what we

817
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,520
see happening with with data breaches

818
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,590
for example right so that's the first

819
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:51,560
interesting concept that emerges if we

820
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:53,120
accept this analogy of debt the the

821
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,679
other interesting concept that emerges

822
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,189
is this idea that the debt is fully

823
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:59,210
inherited so not only you take a part of

824
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:02,029
the debt from you

825
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:04,729
but you inherit the entire stack of that

826
00:33:02,029 --> 00:33:06,859
vendor and those vendors are all

827
00:33:04,729 --> 00:33:09,619
connected together in a kind of a

828
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:12,739
network that pivots around the shared

829
00:33:09,619 --> 00:33:14,418
technologies that they use right so if

830
00:33:12,739 --> 00:33:17,029
we take something like Spectre or melt

831
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:21,289
down what we recognize is that all of us

832
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:23,899
are using a technology in the form of a

833
00:33:21,289 --> 00:33:25,460
CPU that has a degree of technical debt

834
00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:28,008
in it it's a trade-off that the CPU

835
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:30,379
manufacturers made performance over

836
00:33:28,009 --> 00:33:33,139
security all right and that debt is now

837
00:33:30,379 --> 00:33:36,129
in all of our stacks and it connects us

838
00:33:33,139 --> 00:33:38,570
together in a way that exposes us

839
00:33:36,129 --> 00:33:40,879
universally to the same risk so if

840
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:43,309
something goes wrong with that CPU all

841
00:33:40,879 --> 00:33:45,139
of that debt now sits on our books and

842
00:33:43,309 --> 00:33:48,440
we have to suddenly deal with it and

843
00:33:45,139 --> 00:33:50,869
what that means is that arguably not

844
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:53,599
just individual businesses but entire

845
00:33:50,869 --> 00:33:55,939
collections of businesses sectors that

846
00:33:53,599 --> 00:34:00,659
share technologies either vertically or

847
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:02,049
horizontally or all or all laden all

848
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:05,839
[Music]

849
00:34:02,049 --> 00:34:07,668
tied down by the shade debt and that's a

850
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:10,219
very interesting concept which is going

851
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:13,339
to lead me to sort of the next part of

852
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:15,439
my thesis but before we go there

853
00:34:13,339 --> 00:34:17,659
I've argued already that debt can be

854
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,659
good leverage is used to probe

855
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:22,490
businesses it's a powerful concept but

856
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:26,029
when it goes wrong the implications can

857
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:27,859
be very scary and to understand that we

858
00:34:26,029 --> 00:34:29,839
must recognize that although it doesn't

859
00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:32,239
seem like within businesses we have to

860
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:35,359
repay security debt ultimately debt must

861
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:37,308
always be repaid and only white are some

862
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:39,918
in their paper outline said of about

863
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:41,720
seven circumstances under which what

864
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:44,359
they call forced repayment will have to

865
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:46,129
happen and it's things like client

866
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:48,199
expectations when you've been accruing

867
00:34:46,129 --> 00:34:49,940
security data over time as a vendor and

868
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:51,589
for whatever reason your clients go

869
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:52,909
actually we're not so comfortable with

870
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:54,949
the level of security in your product

871
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:57,559
anymore or the level of security in your

872
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:59,569
systems we expect it to be seen to be

873
00:34:57,559 --> 00:35:01,220
done better then suddenly you find that

874
00:34:59,569 --> 00:35:03,319
you have to go and repay that debt you

875
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:05,390
hadn't planned to but now you have to

876
00:35:03,319 --> 00:35:08,808
take away from something else to go and

877
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:10,250
repay that debt with its interest when

878
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:11,060
businesses recognized that it's getting

879
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:13,280
two weeks

880
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:15,799
to repay that debt they may be forced to

881
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,810
repay that debt at some point and when

882
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:21,860
he sternal capabilities evolved in other

883
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:23,900
words or for example when when when an

884
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:25,460
exploit a vulnerability that you didn't

885
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:27,020
think was exploitable suddenly becomes

886
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:29,510
exploitable the death that you've

887
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:32,150
accrued has to be paid or simply when

888
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:33,710
there's increased in external focus so

889
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:35,390
you've written your killer app you took

890
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:38,000
a whole lot of shortcuts to get it to

891
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:39,680
market you've accrued a lot of debt

892
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,820
you didn't think security mattered but

893
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,080
now suddenly you hit the jackpot a

894
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,670
million people are using your app near

895
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:46,700
like oh I better get this right

896
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:48,830
you're forced to repay that debt but I

897
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:51,460
want to add to those three I think

898
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:54,020
simpler conditions that I think capture

899
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:56,090
circumstances under which debt will have

900
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:58,070
to be repaid the first is when your

901
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:59,360
business gets evaluated I've sort of

902
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:01,070
been in the startup space for a while

903
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,840
and one of the things out of experience

904
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:05,090
is what they called diligence which is

905
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:07,010
when a buyer evaluates a business or

906
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:08,600
purchase part of diligence is technical

907
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:09,770
diligence which is when they come and

908
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,540
look at what you've got under the hood

909
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:13,340
and they say how good is it so you're

910
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:16,310
making the argument that your startup

911
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:19,340
you know that has an online internet

912
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:21,890
connected waffle iron is worth a million

913
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:23,150
dollars and the evaluators the due

914
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:24,560
diligence guys come and have a look and

915
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:25,970
they say yes this is what flying is

916
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,130
worth a million dollars but guess what

917
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:30,080
you still owe a million dollars on it

918
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:31,580
because you've accrued security did so

919
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,230
actually your waffle iron isn't worth a

920
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:35,029
million dollars it's worth nothing

921
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:36,020
that's the first circumstance the second

922
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:37,940
circumstance is what we're seeing

923
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:39,950
happening with things like GDP are right

924
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:42,380
now where the government as regulator

925
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:43,939
step in and say we are not comfortable

926
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,500
with the level of security debt that you

927
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,930
recurring it's not okay

928
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:50,720
you're taking on too much risk and it's

929
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:53,149
not a right for you to externalize that

930
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,069
risk to your customers anymore we want

931
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:57,380
you to square you have to settle your

932
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:58,970
security debt now by making it right

933
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:01,340
and finally suddenly you find yourself

934
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:03,290
under external pressure being forced to

935
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:05,600
repaid it that you are happy ignoring

936
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:08,210
previously and the third circumstance is

937
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:10,640
when the assets so the utility value

938
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:13,400
that you created by leveraging your

939
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:15,410
security debt goes toxic toxic is a

940
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,960
concept it's borrowed from finance and

941
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:21,060
basically what it means is that the

942
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:23,460
underlying asset suddenly loses value

943
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:25,950
it doesn't have utility for you anymore

944
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:28,080
right it's worthless and not only is it

945
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:29,879
worthless to you but it's worthless to

946
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,710
others so you can't even sell it off

947
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,810
anymore nobody will take it off your

948
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:35,550
books everybody wants to get rid of what

949
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:37,259
they've got and so what you see is a

950
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:38,460
fire sale people just selling it for

951
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,500
whatever they can get and the value of

952
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:42,150
that thing continues to drop and an

953
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:44,880
example of where that would happen in

954
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:48,300
security is for example in in in a big

955
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,670
breach you may find that Intel

956
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:52,290
experienced the form of this because of

957
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:54,090
the specter and meltdown vulnerabilities

958
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:55,980
we suddenly everybody said we don't want

959
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:57,750
to be in Intel anymore we want to get

960
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:59,640
rid of our Intel we don't trust it it

961
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:01,770
has no more of utility value it's not

962
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:04,620
worth what we paid for it anymore we

963
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:07,200
want to get into you know AMD or

964
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:09,089
whatever the case is and so you find

965
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,490
that that that asset that they created

966
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:13,260
suddenly becomes toxic I'll come back to

967
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:16,740
that in a moment let me capture it like

968
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:19,110
this leverage is great until the cow

969
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:21,149
runs off right so I've borrowed from

970
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:22,590
Samuel I'm using the car to create milk

971
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:24,390
I'm using the milk to get money so I can

972
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:27,090
pay Samuel suddenly the car drops dead

973
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:29,520
boom right now I still owe some you look

974
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:31,860
house money and I don't have a way of

975
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:34,140
generating revenue an arm up Street

976
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:36,840
and we see that very concretely in our

977
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:39,540
own lives with the idea of foreclosures

978
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:41,940
right so if I have a house I suddenly

979
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:43,770
can't pay my mortgage on the house what

980
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:46,170
happens is the bank comes and takes that

981
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:48,480
house away from me and depending on how

982
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:50,160
the loan contract was structured there

983
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,290
are circumstances where the bank may

984
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,020
even say you know what if the House

985
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:57,240
today is toxic it's not worth what you

986
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,800
thought it was and we can't sell it to

987
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,750
recover what you owe us on the loan

988
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,800
we're going to keep coming for you we

989
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:03,390
can take your house then we're going to

990
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:06,240
take your car then we're going to take

991
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:09,089
your internet-connected waffle iron or

992
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,109
the ps4 please God not my ps4 but

993
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:12,080
they're going to come and fetch at all

994
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:14,640
until they feel that that loan is repaid

995
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:17,850
now that's what happens in a single

996
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:19,980
instance when when one entity goes

997
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:22,650
bankrupt but what happens in that

998
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:24,600
network scenario that I spoke about when

999
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:27,950
a whole lot of interconnected entities

1000
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:31,200
go bankrupt well we've seen that before

1001
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:33,299
in the financial market with the

1002
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:36,330
financial crisis of 2008

1003
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:38,340
in 2007 this idea of CEOs of

1004
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:40,080
collateralized debt objects so what was

1005
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:43,080
happening there where someone would go

1006
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:45,810
to a bank borrow money to obtain a

1007
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:48,360
utility house a car credit card whatever

1008
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:51,240
it is what they needed the banks or that

1009
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:52,590
loan as an asset and they would resell

1010
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,149
it that said there's something that we

1011
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,930
owe I don't have it right now but it

1012
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:56,400
something that's owed to me and I'm

1013
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:58,589
gonna resell it they resell it to an

1014
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,110
investment bank and the investment bank

1015
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:02,730
would then bundle the loans from a whole

1016
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:04,770
lot of different parties together into

1017
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:06,900
products which then contained those

1018
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:08,460
loans and resell them to investors

1019
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:11,510
including you and me and the people who

1020
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:14,130
have managed our retirement funds etc

1021
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:16,440
and that was all honky-dory

1022
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:20,190
everybody loved that until the

1023
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:22,500
fundamental asset went toxic and we all

1024
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:23,310
remember what happened when that

1025
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,630
happened and there was when they

1026
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:26,820
determined that the actual house that

1027
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:28,590
was borrowed wasn't worth what they

1028
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:30,060
thought it was and they couldn't recover

1029
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:31,590
their debts everybody wanted to get out

1030
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:33,810
of those products there was a fire sale

1031
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:35,570
and the whole thing goes down and what

1032
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:37,740
we saw there was a was a collapse

1033
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:40,320
effectively the entire financial system

1034
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:42,270
that started with the individual home

1035
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:46,620
owners the people they had borrowed from

1036
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:48,360
the people were building homes the

1037
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:51,180
financial markets and eventually the

1038
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:53,130
entire global economy collapsed because

1039
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:56,549
of the network effect that was created

1040
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:59,280
by these shared and distributed loans

1041
00:40:56,550 --> 00:41:02,730
and the impact was extremely severe

1042
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:06,060
global GDP growth dropped to negative

1043
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:08,190
four percent during 2009 some estimates

1044
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:09,930
reckon that the that the irrecoverable

1045
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:13,920
impact on the global economy was twenty

1046
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:16,589
trillion dollars over that period so I

1047
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,420
got interested in this idea of whether

1048
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:21,570
if we accept that the analogy of

1049
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:23,730
security debt holds whether the concept

1050
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:26,730
of a financial crisis or crisis like we

1051
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:29,340
saw in finance could also occur in debt

1052
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:30,660
so I started reading and one of the guys

1053
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:33,600
that I read is a guy called Timothy

1054
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:36,000
Geithner who was the Treasury secretary

1055
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:38,819
under Obama but previously in his role

1056
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,160
as head of the Federal Reserve the New

1057
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:42,990
York Fed also laid the response to the

1058
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:45,509
financial crisis and

1059
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:47,250
and he highlights that in every case

1060
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:49,440
when there's a financial crisis there's

1061
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:52,500
really three attributes this is what he

1062
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,360
calls mania or a bubble this is what he

1063
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:56,010
calls excessive leverage so too much

1064
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:58,560
borrowing and not enough repayment of

1065
00:41:56,010 --> 00:42:01,110
their debt and then what he calls a

1066
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:03,090
runnable financing runnable financing is

1067
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:06,900
short-term financing that can easily

1068
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:09,240
abandoned if when things go toxic so

1069
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:11,550
people drop it right and the form of a

1070
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:15,089
fire sell and I started wondering

1071
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:16,290
whether security debt would have the

1072
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:18,420
same characteristics and I started

1073
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:19,680
asking around and I spotted this tweet

1074
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,720
by Rob lamely

1075
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,549
who spoke about the potential of an

1076
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:25,560
attack on US infrastructure and he

1077
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:27,300
mentions that what worries him is not so

1078
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:29,369
much the impact of the attack on the

1079
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:31,590
infrastructure itself but the secondary

1080
00:42:29,369 --> 00:42:33,240
effects of people becoming afraid and

1081
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:35,700
acting irrationally and I ask the

1082
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:37,589
question could that happen in technology

1083
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:39,270
could a run happen on technology like a

1084
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:42,750
run happens on financial instruments

1085
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:44,310
during a crisis and a debates ensued

1086
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:46,290
around that with a lot of people

1087
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:49,140
weighing in generally arguing that it

1088
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:52,529
probably didn't seem likely but then

1089
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:53,850
then them reams piped in and he drew my

1090
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:58,410
attention to something called the simple

1091
00:42:53,850 --> 00:43:01,350
logic bomb project which is a research

1092
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:03,359
project by Cambridge University by the

1093
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:06,089
Center for risk studies in which they

1094
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:08,130
examine exactly this question and they

1095
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:10,619
sketch a scenario where a single

1096
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:13,560
technology that's very widely used by

1097
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:15,180
major corporations they use a database

1098
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:17,820
of fictional database called Sybil which

1099
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:19,859
i think is modeled on Oracle and in

1100
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:21,630
their scenario they talk about a logic

1101
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:26,670
bomb within this technology that

1102
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:28,680
effectively subvert solve affects the

1103
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:33,560
integrity of the data that that's in

1104
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:36,750
that database very slowly over time and

1105
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:39,000
and then they then they they they play

1106
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:40,980
out in their study what the impacts the

1107
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,020
sort of primary secondary tertiary

1108
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:44,520
impacts of that will be as people lose

1109
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,990
faith in the technology they lose faith

1110
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,490
in the data that their technology

1111
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:49,080
generates they lose faith in the

1112
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:51,330
products and the processes that use that

1113
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:53,580
data and eventually they start to

1114
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:55,049
abandon it wholesale and not just that

1115
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,580
technology but also the other

1116
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:58,140
technologies by that vendor

1117
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:00,630
and similar technologies by other

1118
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:04,379
vendors the market uses faith in all of

1119
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:08,760
those and so it turns out that they

1120
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:11,430
sketch almost an exact precise replica

1121
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:13,680
of what Gartner describes in his book

1122
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:16,980
and where Gartner talks about runnable

1123
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:19,109
assets the Cambridge guys talk about

1124
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:23,010
information malaise which is basically

1125
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:25,680
this large scale loss in faith in a

1126
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:27,840
technology or a technology stack because

1127
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,040
of the uncertainty caused by the initial

1128
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,300
breach right people some do you say we

1129
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,250
can't trust it anymore

1130
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,720
we could not we don't feel confident

1131
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:35,370
that it's good and so we're going to

1132
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,200
abandon it and they abandon at large

1133
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:38,850
scale and then they track out the

1134
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,160
implications for that on the global

1135
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:43,170
economy by using sort of standard

1136
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,609
economic forecasting models they look at

1137
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:46,470
what the economy could have done and

1138
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:48,930
then they look at the impact on the

1139
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:50,730
economy if the scenario plays out and

1140
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:53,899
they sketch four or five different

1141
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:57,260
models of you know based on severity etc

1142
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:59,280
and in each case the impact is

1143
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:01,620
significant on the global economy over

1144
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,480
time so given the right kind of scenario

1145
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:07,470
the right kind of technology and the

1146
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:09,600
right severe enough impact then the

1147
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:11,700
impact on the global economy over time

1148
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:13,290
ranges between something like four

1149
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:15,540
trillion dollars and something like

1150
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:18,810
fifteen trillion dollars over a five

1151
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:20,759
year period now according to them that's

1152
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:22,560
comparable with an impact on the economy

1153
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:26,490
of 20 trillion dollars during the global

1154
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:29,580
financial crisis so the conclusion is

1155
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:32,009
that was this kind of signal scenario is

1156
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:34,860
highly improbable it's not very likely

1157
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:36,470
to happen it is absolutely possible it

1158
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:38,430
may be a one in a hundred year event

1159
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:39,839
right but you don't know which of those

1160
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:42,240
hundred years it's going to happen in

1161
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,950
and when it does happen we could be

1162
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,720
dealing with real the kind of

1163
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:47,490
that we dealt with in 2007 because of

1164
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:52,709
the global financial crisis maybe not

1165
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:56,549
quite as bad but pretty close so so it

1166
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:59,400
feels to me like this analogy using debt

1167
00:45:56,550 --> 00:46:00,930
instead of risk is powerful and allows

1168
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,760
us to see our world in a very different

1169
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:04,529
way think about what we're doing in a

1170
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,030
very different way and consider the

1171
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:07,160
implications of not getting it right in

1172
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:09,320
a very different way

1173
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,940
but at the bottom of that we still sit

1174
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:14,780
with a problem that we had with risk

1175
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:16,610
which is that quantifying debt like

1176
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:18,920
quantifying risk is actually still very

1177
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:21,050
difficult and when I started talking to

1178
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:23,870
people about this it was very quickly

1179
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:26,510
drawn to my attention that it's a nice

1180
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:29,660
idea but until you can start quantifying

1181
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:32,570
it you really can't move the dial as as

1182
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:35,779
Irina said move the needle on on

1183
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:37,880
shifting the conversation forward so I

1184
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:41,360
want to go back to those original papers

1185
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:43,880
and just explore very briefly how each

1186
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:46,370
of those players looked at quantifying

1187
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:48,710
risk and I'm going to bring in here the

1188
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:50,750
guys from melv and also talk about

1189
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:52,100
technical debt not security debt because

1190
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:56,210
they have some powerful ideas that I

1191
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:59,390
think we can learn from so starting with

1192
00:46:56,210 --> 00:47:01,640
Rick's they talk a lot about the the

1193
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:03,620
characteristics of the state and but

1194
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:05,690
they don't really go to much effort to

1195
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:08,420
present a model through which debt can

1196
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:10,700
be calculated they ask some concepts

1197
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:12,740
though that they introduced that I think

1198
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:14,990
we can leverage leverage excuse the pun

1199
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:17,750
the first is that the interest rate that

1200
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:19,729
we use when we consider how debt accrues

1201
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:22,220
over time isn't necessarily fixed it

1202
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:24,230
varies and it varies on the depending on

1203
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:25,700
the kind of trade-offs that you're that

1204
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:28,940
you're making this is a concept that

1205
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:30,140
Melvin will bring in later also they

1206
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:32,270
also introduce the idea that debt can

1207
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:35,210
expire so for example you can write a

1208
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:37,280
product off like Microsoft does when

1209
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:39,110
technologies reach in reach end of life

1210
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,250
and they point out that you know

1211
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:41,840
microscope even makes a distinction

1212
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:43,400
between end of life and end of security

1213
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,720
life an end of security life what

1214
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,550
they're saying is we're written that off

1215
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,959
and by writing the technology or also

1216
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:49,490
writing the debt off our books it's gone

1217
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:52,280
we're not worried about it anymore we

1218
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:54,459
can strike it from the balance sheet but

1219
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:57,440
that's about as far as they go and

1220
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:59,810
crystallize so Paul tries harder in his

1221
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:03,920
blog post and he actually presents a

1222
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:05,509
model which he has examples for and uses

1223
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,450
it to calculate numbers his numbers end

1224
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:10,960
up being very big as you can see but his

1225
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:13,669
model requires us to have information

1226
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:16,670
that's very hard to get and that is

1227
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:18,860
probably not within our reach at this

1228
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:20,400
point and specifically he's looking for

1229
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:22,290
a way to relate

1230
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,760
abilities in your systems to the

1231
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:24,900
vulnerabilities that were involved in

1232
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,450
actual breaches where there were

1233
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:29,100
quantifiable losses and he goes on to

1234
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:31,710
say well look that's that's gonna be

1235
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:34,830
future work and I haven't actually seen

1236
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:36,720
any future work by him on that so he

1237
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:37,950
sort of shifts the dial a little bit but

1238
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:41,750
really there's not something anything

1239
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:41,750
that we can that we can implement it

1240
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:48,780
dan gear and gonna Peterson go much

1241
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:50,940
further and they produce an actual model

1242
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:53,580
which is a both simple and I think

1243
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:55,710
practical for certain applications and

1244
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:57,900
they use them they use a concept which

1245
00:48:55,710 --> 00:49:00,150
is again well understood in finance

1246
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:03,060
called margin of safety and effectively

1247
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:06,900
what they say is if you take what you

1248
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:08,940
invest in producing a utility and you

1249
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:10,830
subtract what you invested in securing

1250
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:13,770
that utility then the difference is

1251
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:15,540
called the margin of safety and the

1252
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:17,670
bigger the difference is the less your

1253
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:19,259
margin of safety is the more risk you

1254
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:22,290
have and they describe that difference

1255
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:23,940
effectively as the leverage and in their

1256
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:26,970
model because the concepts are quite

1257
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:29,850
simple they can actually come up with a

1258
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:31,259
you know with an example and they

1259
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:33,480
express the margin of safety as a

1260
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:35,310
percentage the ratio between what you

1261
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:37,500
spent on securing something and what you

1262
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:39,090
spent on developing something right now

1263
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,560
that doesn't give you a quantifiable

1264
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:42,960
number that you can express in the

1265
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:45,660
balance sheet but it does allow you to

1266
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,910
solve that problem that dandy Express

1267
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:49,950
early on which is that you can compare

1268
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:52,259
two things together so thinking this

1269
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:53,580
analogy no not in this one but in

1270
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:56,790
another one they present they talk about

1271
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:58,259
the margin of safety in a web

1272
00:49:56,790 --> 00:50:00,540
application that's developed by a

1273
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:02,070
company versus the margin of safety in a

1274
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:04,350
mobile app that's developed by the same

1275
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:05,880
company and they can calculate that the

1276
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:07,440
margin of safety is much higher on the

1277
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,930
mobile app than it is on the web app and

1278
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,280
so they can say we've done more here and

1279
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:13,200
what we're doing on the web app is blow

1280
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,420
right so they can compare which meets

1281
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:19,560
one of the criteria that Dan gars set

1282
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:22,080
for metrics within a science but still

1283
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:23,640
doesn't really address our need to have

1284
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:25,620
something that's we can put on the

1285
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,930
balance sheet and then the guys from

1286
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:29,310
Melvin look at it in a very different

1287
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:32,029
way and this I think opens up a whole

1288
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:36,470
lot of doors for us what they say

1289
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:39,380
is let's express the the need to address

1290
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:41,419
and pay off technical debt as specific

1291
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:43,580
projects on our on our roadmaps and

1292
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:46,460
specifically as epics within a within a

1293
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:49,430
scrum and they start off by saying the

1294
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:51,650
first the first step in that in that

1295
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:54,919
epoch what they call a or do they call

1296
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:56,630
it again a spike is simply to calculate

1297
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:59,180
the amount of work that would be

1298
00:50:56,630 --> 00:51:01,610
required to pay off the debt all right

1299
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:04,190
then you take that and you express it as

1300
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:05,930
stories within that epoch and then you

1301
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:08,300
add those to the roadmap so what it

1302
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:11,210
means in this limited scenario for a

1303
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:13,340
development for a development manager is

1304
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:16,040
that they can say this is exactly how

1305
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:17,150
long it's going to take us based on our

1306
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,620
you know development planning

1307
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:21,290
methodology this is exactly how long

1308
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:23,509
it's going to take us to to pay off this

1309
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:24,950
debt and because a business that can

1310
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:26,450
then calculate what its development

1311
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:27,649
costs are you would be able to attach a

1312
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:29,450
number to that right you'd be able to

1313
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:31,400
say paying off this debt is going to

1314
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:33,069
cost us this much at this point based on

1315
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:35,240
you know specific planning that we did

1316
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:37,420
they also talked about the idea of

1317
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:40,129
grading the debt so we're saying let's

1318
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:42,110
this use different characteristics the

1319
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:45,560
severity the currents into dependency

1320
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:47,030
etc to prioritize the debt that we have

1321
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:49,190
to pay off so it's some is more

1322
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:52,550
important than others and both of those

1323
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:56,480
ideas from from Melvin's paper I think

1324
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:57,980
can be used in developing a new model so

1325
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,110
I put my thinking head on there you see

1326
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:03,830
my pen again but am I thinking head-on

1327
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:06,920
and I and I I've made an attempt in the

1328
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:08,270
spirit of moving the needle to try and

1329
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:09,920
come up with another model that I think

1330
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:12,650
can be used to quantified it and my

1331
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,390
model works like this let's start by

1332
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:16,790
simply creating and maintaining a debt

1333
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:18,230
register so if you're a development guy

1334
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:20,600
you're a security manager if you're a

1335
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:22,070
CEO don't ask for permission just do it

1336
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:24,290
create a debt register and Excel

1337
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:27,410
spreadsheets and keep it on your on your

1338
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:29,390
computer then establish what I call a

1339
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:31,279
locus of control for security so who is

1340
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:33,140
the person in your environment who's

1341
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,030
best determine who's best position to

1342
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:36,650
determine what's the right thing to do

1343
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:38,720
doesn't have to be perfect you just need

1344
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:40,610
someone who consistently say I believe

1345
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,810
that to achieve a level of security

1346
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:44,000
that's appropriate for what we're doing

1347
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:45,420
this is what we ought to do that could

1348
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,549
be auditors it could be the radio

1349
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:49,290
laterz could be or pentesters could be

1350
00:52:47,549 --> 00:52:50,579
yourself doesn't matter just needs to be

1351
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:53,369
someone who says I think this is what's

1352
00:52:50,579 --> 00:52:55,440
right then every time a security

1353
00:52:53,369 --> 00:52:58,829
trade-off is made within your within

1354
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:01,079
your organization what you do is you

1355
00:52:58,829 --> 00:53:03,329
calculate what the recommended path

1356
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:06,630
would have cost in the technology time

1357
00:53:03,329 --> 00:53:09,540
Human Resources whatever it might be and

1358
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:11,010
what the actual path cost you deduct the

1359
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:14,279
one from the other and you end up with

1360
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:15,569
the date what's owed right and then what

1361
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,700
you do is you capture that in your

1362
00:53:15,569 --> 00:53:19,619
register so you say for this project the

1363
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:21,270
trade-off that we made if I kept like

1364
00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:22,290
what we should have done and I deduct

1365
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:23,670
what we actually did

1366
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:25,740
that's the date that's what we're

1367
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:27,720
leveraging and I add that into my into

1368
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:29,700
my register and if you want to be really

1369
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:31,410
fancy you can play a little bit with the

1370
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:33,689
interest rates that you then apply to

1371
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:35,279
that date so I think you start off with

1372
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:36,780
something like prime so what standard

1373
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,869
interest on something in South Africa

1374
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:40,740
what is it not five and a half percent

1375
00:53:38,869 --> 00:53:42,180
seven percent you know at one point

1376
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:44,189
since South Africa when I was first

1377
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:46,799
looking at buying a house we were being

1378
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:48,780
charged twenty two percent interest on

1379
00:53:46,799 --> 00:53:51,030
the home run but that in your pipe and

1380
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:52,589
smoke it twenty two percent you guys

1381
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:56,640
don't even know what interest is we know

1382
00:53:52,589 --> 00:53:58,410
for interest but whatever the interest

1383
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,879
rate is in your in your environment you

1384
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:01,259
take that interest rate and then what

1385
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,849
you can do is you can dial that up or

1386
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:04,230
dial it down a little bit based on the

1387
00:54:02,849 --> 00:54:07,829
severity of the issue that you're

1388
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:09,359
looking to address all right then what

1389
00:54:07,829 --> 00:54:10,440
you do is once you've got that register

1390
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:12,690
and you feel comfortable that you can

1391
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:14,270
express it you start communicating it to

1392
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:16,380
your leadership so in our case my team

1393
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:17,670
develops a board report which we submit

1394
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:19,619
to our board every day my team sitting

1395
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:21,420
in the frontier they all all looking

1396
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:24,329
panicked and tired from having to

1397
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:25,710
generate the constant board reports what

1398
00:54:24,329 --> 00:54:27,210
I would do is I just start to expressed

1399
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:29,250
that with risk register in the board

1400
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:32,250
report just as a as a metric for the

1401
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:34,049
board to consider and over time I would

1402
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:35,579
crank up the rhetoric around that and

1403
00:54:34,049 --> 00:54:37,140
start commenting on the amount of debt

1404
00:54:35,579 --> 00:54:39,119
what needs to be done to repay the debt

1405
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:41,098
etc you know let's just introduce it

1406
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:42,390
into the conversation no doubt what will

1407
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:43,740
happen is you'll get pushback you'll get

1408
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:45,058
questions you get arguments about how

1409
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:46,709
you're doing it and that's fine

1410
00:54:45,059 --> 00:54:48,569
you use that to refine your process make

1411
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:49,950
it better over time until you develop a

1412
00:54:48,569 --> 00:54:52,259
language between yourself and your

1413
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:53,580
leadership that talks about the debt

1414
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:55,560
that's being accrued

1415
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:57,450
and the mission to repay that debt over

1416
00:54:55,560 --> 00:55:00,330
time right rather than just talking

1417
00:54:57,450 --> 00:55:01,649
about risk and then finally we have to

1418
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:04,440
start having those conversations with

1419
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:06,720
our vendors also now your vendors won't

1420
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:08,400
do this for you I've no doubt but if

1421
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,439
you're persistent enough and you keep

1422
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,030
pushing hard enough then over time I

1423
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,680
think we can see that that way of

1424
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:17,940
thinking with our vendors also write to

1425
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:19,410
the parties we depend on and there's an

1426
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:21,660
example that I stuck together an excel

1427
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:24,330
with my absolutely unbelievable Excel

1428
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:25,589
skills and you'll see that the basic

1429
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:27,360
components are expressed it's very

1430
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:29,400
simple I wouldn't recommend that you try

1431
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:31,650
and do this in at home but it sort of

1432
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:33,720
captures the idea you captured the dates

1433
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:35,640
you know where the where the trade-off

1434
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,990
was made what project are affected I've

1435
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:38,940
got some basic categories from the

1436
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:40,859
trade-off I've described it and then I

1437
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:42,750
have a grading on a scale between one to

1438
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:45,900
ten which is what I use to crank the

1439
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:48,060
interest rate up or down and from that I

1440
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:49,200
captured the what I call prime interest

1441
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:51,900
rate so what's the standard interest

1442
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:54,089
rate that's being paid in my space at

1443
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:56,550
that time my example it's five and a

1444
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:58,170
half percent I applied the grading to

1445
00:55:56,550 --> 00:56:00,360
that standard interest rate to come up

1446
00:55:58,170 --> 00:56:01,800
with the derived interest rate and I

1447
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:04,230
simply captured their trade off the way

1448
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:05,720
I calculated it so in the first line I

1449
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:09,030
reckon the trade off that was made there

1450
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:11,069
was cost two thousand six hundred pounds

1451
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:13,320
that's exactly what we didn't spend that

1452
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:15,120
I think we should have spend and then

1453
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:17,430
over time your honor that accumulates

1454
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:19,350
interest until some of it's paid off so

1455
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:21,600
when we do it when we put that money in

1456
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:24,960
then that decreases again over time

1457
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:28,170
right and that I think quite simply

1458
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:29,580
captures accumulated data over time

1459
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:30,090
across all the security trade-offs that

1460
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:32,250
we make

1461
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:34,110
I don't think it's genius I don't think

1462
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:35,250
it's perfect but it feels to me like

1463
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:37,650
something I could start having a

1464
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:38,880
conversation with my leadership about no

1465
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:40,890
doubt as I said they'll be pushed back

1466
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:44,160
but it's a way to get the conversation

1467
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:45,930
started so there you go there's a model

1468
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:48,810
for calculating debt and introducing it

1469
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:50,580
into conversations with our leaders so

1470
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:51,990
on an end and a little bit of time that

1471
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:54,240
I've got left just for some parting

1472
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:56,609
thoughts and the first one relates to

1473
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:59,189
this idea of the security debt crisis

1474
00:56:56,610 --> 00:57:02,010
and the question I want to put in your

1475
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:04,480
mind is how many zombies does it take to

1476
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:07,900
make an apocalypse

1477
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:09,190
yeah I just said that and the idea is

1478
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:10,780
this you're sitting at home on your

1479
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:13,119
balcony drinking a cup of tea and you

1480
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:14,530
see a zombie walking past there's a

1481
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:16,720
zombie like oh my god that's a zombie

1482
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:17,920
but you don't panic you don't panic

1483
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,000
because you know all that needs to

1484
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,950
happen is it needs to beat the zombie

1485
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:24,130
with the baseball bat and it goes away

1486
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:26,020
and as long as there's one zombie or one

1487
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:30,940
or two zombies or a zombie here and a

1488
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:32,650
zombie there it's okay right what we

1489
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:34,630
can't ignore though is the network

1490
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:36,670
effects of zombies the fact that zombies

1491
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:39,040
infect each other and the zombies

1492
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:42,369
multiply suddenly an exponential rate

1493
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:44,529
that we can't control anymore that we

1494
00:57:42,369 --> 00:57:46,750
can't predict anymore and what happens

1495
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:49,300
then is we jump from having a handful of

1496
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:50,680
zombies to a zombie apocalypse at some

1497
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:52,540
point that I've never quite figured out

1498
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:54,730
who decides what that point is all right

1499
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:56,380
who decides what when is a zombie a

1500
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:58,420
bunch of zombies action apocalypse and

1501
00:57:56,380 --> 00:58:00,820
the analogy I'm trying to draw obviously

1502
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:02,829
is that we see these security incidents

1503
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:04,630
these major breaches these complete

1504
00:58:02,829 --> 00:58:07,210
failures of security happening around us

1505
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:10,660
all the time one here one there be a

1506
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:12,010
equifax right there all happening and

1507
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:13,629
it's easy to look at them all in

1508
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:15,150
isolation and argue that their

1509
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:18,190
individual zombies are not easily

1510
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:21,130
addressed but if we accept this network

1511
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:24,640
effect we accept this shared and accrued

1512
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:27,040
debt over time what we have to recognize

1513
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:29,650
is that at some point when enough of

1514
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:31,359
those happen in the right place it

1515
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:32,770
suddenly becomes a zombie apocalypse and

1516
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:35,529
that's a reality that I think we have to

1517
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:37,800
deal with I just really wanted to say

1518
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:39,910
that okay and then in concrete terms

1519
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:41,680
here's the summary of my message

1520
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:44,740
I think we're facing real threats I

1521
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:47,259
think we're looking at a scenario in

1522
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:49,270
which the fundamentals of the world and

1523
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:50,470
the Internet and our societies as we

1524
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:52,180
know and love them the world that we

1525
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:53,890
want to tell him to grow up with can be

1526
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:56,618
fundamentally changed if the right

1527
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:58,240
decisions around security are made I

1528
00:58:56,619 --> 00:58:59,619
think that means we have to address the

1529
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:02,529
way we talk about things and the

1530
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:04,210
analogies that we use Alex Hutton when

1531
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:07,990
talking about risk he argues that we

1532
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:09,460
should rather look at immunology and the

1533
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:11,649
manage of the management of medical

1534
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:12,890
crises as an analogy for what we do and

1535
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:15,410
I think that maybe has

1536
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:17,240
as legs I think that's something to be

1537
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:21,170
considered clearly more has to be done

1538
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:23,629
around calculating security date few

1539
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:26,210
people have made I think relatively poor

1540
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:29,240
efforts including myself moving that

1541
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:32,210
needle as Irene said I think more can be

1542
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:35,629
done in that space but finally my

1543
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:37,460
quarters is let's try and introduce the

1544
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:39,290
language of debt into what into how we

1545
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:41,300
talk to people just start by using the

1546
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:44,240
word and let's see how it shapes

1547
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:47,000
people's perceptions of what we're

1548
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:49,359
dealing with and that's me thank you

1549
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,360
very much

1550
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:54,900
