1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,890
okay let's begin thank you run for

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,500
coming to our talk on machine learning

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,149
and how to hack it I'm going to begin in

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,920
a moment start with short introduction

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,170
and walk you through the stuff I hope

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,838
you have a fun time this is was a very

7
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,490
fun talk to construct and I hope that

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,949
we'll be able to share the fun that

9
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,769
we've had doing it so first and foremost

10
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:25,710
I would like to acknowledge our employer

11
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:27,479
and give you a chance to go over the

12
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,740
legal disclaimer and to understand all

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,699
of the terms and conditions that apply

14
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,660
to this talk

15
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:35,309
thank you no no seriously I really do

16
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,410
want to thank our that actually allows

17
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:39,180
us and helps us to do these things I am

18
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,690
required by legal to show you this slide

19
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:45,570
I am NOT required to make you read it

20
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:48,360
we haven't hardened any machine learning

21
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,510
system horses penguins flamingos etc as

22
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,250
you would see throughout the talk and a

23
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:57,629
bit of introduction about ourselves my

24
00:00:53,250 --> 00:01:00,180
name is guy Barnhart McGann as well - we

25
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:01,920
are both founding members in besides

26
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,530
tel-aviv as well as running the local

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,260
DEFCON group in Israel and we are

28
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:11,070
working together for for almost a year

29
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,630
now this talk has been built on a lot of

30
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,369
information and a lot of research that

31
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,470
has been they assured with the community

32
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:17,729
and I want to acknowledge that because a

33
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,470
lot of time when people come and present

34
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:20,509
their work on stage it seems like

35
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,220
they've done everything themselves

36
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:25,680
nobody does it themselves nobody's

37
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,750
working in all alone nobody's doing

38
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,460
everything from scratch and we should

39
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,490
acknowledge that and to help you to see

40
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,380
where where we learn stuff and where we

41
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,149
got that information from you can

42
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,770
usually see a link at the bottom right

43
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,360
corner you don't have to take pictures

44
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,158
of that link we will release the slides

45
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,450
when we finish our talk but just we will

46
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,630
have like a reference point you know

47
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:48,720
where things are coming from you can

48
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:51,060
always take pictures of me and I also

49
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,520
wanted to acknowledge a very important

50
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,770
thing and we wouldn't be here today

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,990
without it and that is shears which is

52
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,860
as was fiancee as we say getting married

53
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,809
in ten days

54
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,020
so the fact is actually right here right

55
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,020
now

56
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,890
so as you can imagine I'm doubly

57
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,420
terrified first equals I'm delivering a

58
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,038
talk here second because she wants to

59
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:16,049
kill me because I'm here and not

60
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:17,910
organizing there at the tables and a bit

61
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,820
of background how this is all how did

62
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:24,060
all of that begin so last year Def Con

63
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:26,519
25 we sat around some sofas a group of

64
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,500
friends we started discussing what AI is

65
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,360
what machine learning is how does it

66
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,340
apply to our everyday life as security

67
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,170
researchers how difficult would it be to

68
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,330
actually break machine learning systems

69
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,549
and that discussion got us going and we

70
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,320
opened like a new research venue for us

71
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,760
and saying ok let's see what we can

72
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,519
break let's see what we can do with that

73
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,310
and that was last year and we're here

74
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:50,489
this year just to present the results

75
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,870
from our research so we're going to talk

76
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:53,670
a bit about what machine learning is

77
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,170
what kind of attacks can you do on

78
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,970
machine learning system what works

79
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,290
better well doesn't work at all and

80
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,239
where you should focus your attention

81
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:03,989
both as an attacker defender and a

82
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,190
researcher where whenever there's

83
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:06,660
something that I want you to pay more

84
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:09,840
attention to I highlight it in yellow

85
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:12,180
and we are not going to talk about like

86
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,739
zero days in machine learning and what

87
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,720
do they mean you can catch us up to the

88
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:16,590
talk and to explore that a bit more but

89
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,690
they do you want to give me like a

90
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,989
breath information about what those

91
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:25,170
systems are what they are what what you

92
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:26,459
can do about it so I want to kick it off

93
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,619
with a story about a horse

94
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:32,640
this is a very clever horse called Hans

95
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:35,220
clever Hans 1903 and the reason he was

96
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,230
named clever Hans was because he could

97
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,720
do stuff that other horses couldn't for

98
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,340
example he could solve simple arithmetic

99
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,780
question like two plus three one plus

100
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,110
five stuff like that

101
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:48,540
he could spell words in German which is

102
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:53,130
amazing for any horse and also because

103
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:56,429
it was in German and a psychologist was

104
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:58,769
tap understanding how was that horse so

105
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,630
clever and in a general scale it's

106
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:03,360
pretty clever to be able to do those

107
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:05,790
things and that psychologist came to

108
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,310
what we called now a double-blind test

109
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:10,769
and what he found out was that the horse

110
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,419
was actually very very clever and the

111
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:14,010
reason he was very clever not because he

112
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:16,500
knew how to do arithmetic or spell words

113
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,659
in German but because he would read body

114
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,209
body language cues out of his handler

115
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,650
that you can see here and whenever his

116
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:24,780
handler would say how much is two plus

117
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:27,060
three and he would say he would tap his

118
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,190
hoof on the ground one two three four

119
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,110
five and then he would detect that the

120
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:33,449
handler knew that he was right answer

121
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:35,310
and he would stop so he was a pretty

122
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:37,410
clever horse and the reason I'm telling

123
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:40,410
you this right now is because in many

124
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:42,660
aspects machine learning today is very

125
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,600
much like that horse machine learning

126
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,160
today is very good at solving specific

127
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,500
well-defined problems whenever you're

128
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,389
trying to go outside of the scope the

129
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,030
well-defined problem or to try to cross

130
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:55,350
domain from one day and knowledge domain

131
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:58,080
to a different other domain everything

132
00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:00,110
breaks and it usually breaks horribly

133
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,030
and we'll explore that in a bit

134
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,500
so some background some common language

135
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:07,229
to help us say understand what we're

136
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,150
talking about before whenever people are

137
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,500
talking about machine learning I want to

138
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,659
make it very clear what do they mean

139
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,090
machine learning is a system where you

140
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,370
push in lots of inputs and usually apply

141
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:20,760
some metadata to do those inputs and the

142
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:22,860
system has a way to recognize what those

143
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:25,289
inputs mean according to those outputs

144
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,000
and to get that information out and then

145
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:29,460
it provides some labels so if I provide

146
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,930
it with image of a cat and a label this

147
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,760
image is a cat and a different image

148
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,150
with a dog and a label that says this is

149
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,130
dog

150
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,870
the next time you will see a cat without

151
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:40,290
any label it will be able to probably

152
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:41,760
apply the label cat to that image so the

153
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:44,460
trick behind machine learning is how to

154
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,740
teach the system ingesting so much data

155
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,750
and coming out with the correct answers

156
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,310
at the other end

157
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:52,770
deep learning is the same thing without

158
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:55,530
any metadata and that means I take a lot

159
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:57,599
a lot of images and in our case to train

160
00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:00,210
a system to recognize cats and dogs we

161
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,560
take like maybe 1,000 images creating a

162
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,630
deep learning system would take one

163
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,310
million images ten million images so

164
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,409
we're talking about orders of magnitude

165
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,690
more data but without any kind of

166
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:11,490
metadata attached to it which is very

167
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,810
relevant in a lot of use cases where we

168
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:16,020
don't have the metadata oh it's too

169
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:17,310
costly to create that metadata but then

170
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,930
we have artificial intelligence

171
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,530
artificial intelligence something else

172
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,729
completely

173
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,229
usually when we are talking about

174
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:24,750
artificial intelligence we are thinking

175
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:27,419
something like Terminator or one of the

176
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,590
very nice robots in any kind of science

177
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:31,080
fiction television show

178
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:33,330
but the reality is that artificial

179
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,010
intelligence is about context it's about

180
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,599
understanding more than what you're

181
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:38,130
actually seeing when you're looking at

182
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,690
that picture there's something more to

183
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:42,090
that picture than a pin image of a girl

184
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,830
or a Fernando or Hedgehog you look at it

185
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:45,900
and say okay I know that picture this is

186
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:47,849
from Alice this is Alice she's about to

187
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,440
play cricket she knows what she's about

188
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,770
to do she's hugging the Flamingo she's

189
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,120
going to aim it whatever you have a

190
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:56,400
context allows you as an artificial

191
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,590
intelligent impersonation to know more

192
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,330
about what this is done but about this

193
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:03,030
image and what there is the general

194
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:06,359
context that it fits assistance today

195
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:08,250
are nowhere close into doing this know

196
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,930
where we are luck talking not like two

197
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:12,210
years away we're talking about 50 years

198
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:14,220
away we are nowhere near artificial

199
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:16,590
intelligence which is why whenever

200
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,060
anybody is talking about AI they're

201
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:21,060
wrong they're talking about machine

202
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,889
learning and whenever I say I'm wrong

203
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,470
and I apologize I actually mean machine

204
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:26,820
so that's like a big misnomer in the

205
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:30,510
industry and everybody should pay

206
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:33,419
attention to it so what do I mean when I

207
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:38,610
am saying that AI systems are created to

208
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:40,770
solve very well diffic problems specific

209
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,479
problems might be like how do I detect

210
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:44,549
an object in that image how would I

211
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,109
detect a payload in that NetFlow how

212
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:48,900
would I be TechEd if this is specific

213
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:51,210
binary is malicious or not these are

214
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:53,520
very well-defined problems to an extent

215
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:55,500
but if I'm saying like how do I detect

216
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,419
this language and I know what the words

217
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,139
are and I also transliterated into

218
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:00,330
something else

219
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:02,430
this is like a stack of algorithm not a

220
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:03,960
single algorithm and the reason that

221
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,789
this is built in such a way is because

222
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,979
there is no single algorithm to rule

223
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:09,630
them all so you have to build your

224
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:11,370
system out of a lot of different

225
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:14,880
components different algorithms for

226
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:17,490
different purposes so let's talk a bit

227
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,289
about machine learning machine learning

228
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,930
and in my example here I'm using neural

229
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:24,750
networks there are the methods as well

230
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:28,979
usually describe a network or a graph

231
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:30,840
that has weights and has nodes and when

232
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:32,549
I'm talking about that pieces of

233
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,669
information this is the mathematical

234
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:37,409
representation of it usually we are not

235
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:39,179
very much concerned with a mathematical

236
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:41,549
representation of it unless we are data

237
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:42,179
scientists if we're not data centers we

238
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:44,430
actually want to

239
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:46,380
those systems we're talking about code

240
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:49,109
we're talking about data we're talking

241
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:51,060
about how to parse specific inputs into

242
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:54,510
whatever the system is expecting to

243
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:57,089
ingest so it doesn't matter if we have a

244
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,410
small network or large network and by

245
00:08:57,089 --> 00:08:59,760
the way it's small and large here it

246
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,610
means there's a small network could be a

247
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,920
couple of megabytes tens of megabytes in

248
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:08,910
size deep Learning Network networks can

249
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:11,160
go up to tens maybe 20 gigabytes in size

250
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:13,100
so there's a big discrepancy between

251
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,410
small networks and large networks a

252
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,330
large deep learning network would have

253
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,189
on the order of magnitude of something

254
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:22,470
like ten hundred million different

255
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,300
parameters so that's very all

256
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,830
interesting if you're into how to build

257
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:30,390
those systems if you're into how to

258
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:32,820
deploy them it doesn't matter as much so

259
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:36,750
what are the concepts that I want you to

260
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:38,490
recognize to help the first one is that

261
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,959
there is a concept called topology or

262
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,899
layout and this is the way that the

263
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:44,969
network is constructed does it have a

264
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:47,040
lot of nodes a little nodes how the

265
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:48,270
nodes interconnected between them do you

266
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,459
have a lot of connection on a few

267
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:51,930
connection how are those connections

268
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:53,400
defined what kind of mathematical

269
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,469
property do they have for each

270
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:58,740
connection what function defines them

271
00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:00,839
etc the actual parameters themselves the

272
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,730
numbers they actually have meaning so

273
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:05,430
those numbers do we also call the

274
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:06,900
weights or parameters but the bottom

275
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,310
line the most important aspect of it

276
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,500
whenever we're discussing machine

277
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:12,449
learning the real IP the intellectual

278
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,220
property behind all of this is the

279
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:15,779
construction of that network not the way

280
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,820
that you define in order to construct

281
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:18,209
the network but once the network is

282
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,650
built

283
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:21,540
that's your IP this is the thing that

284
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:23,579
you want to protect once you deploy it

285
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,589
into the field and somebody gets a hold

286
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,529
on your IP that's it it doesn't matter

287
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:32,339
how much you invest it to build that IP

288
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:35,730
once it's there it's there so what

289
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:40,140
happens when we go about it from a view

290
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:42,839
if the mic is just speak left ok it

291
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:46,370
keeps cutting out from a mathematical

292
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:49,709
perspective what are representing

293
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:51,060
matrices so if one matrix represents the

294
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:53,219
weights and the parameters and we have a

295
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,869
different matrix to presents the the

296
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,910
edges of that graph of the

297
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:59,980
and we multiply all of those matrices

298
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:03,400
together along with a matrix that

299
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:05,280
represents the input the bottom line is

300
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,660
that whenever you're multiplying

301
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,930
matrixes together you get another matrix

302
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:12,579
and that's all good and fun but we don't

303
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,219
really care about the math we just care

304
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:16,960
about the code how does it look

305
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:19,210
so when we're looking at it we're

306
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,980
looking at vectors which are arrays or

307
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:24,100
we are looking at two dimensional

308
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:26,080
matrixes which are arrays in memory so

309
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,360
the bottom line for all of that math

310
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:31,270
speak is that it doesn't matter how the

311
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:35,290
data scientists build the system is that

312
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:42,510
if you have a blob in memory data field

313
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:42,510
that data you're let's speak normally

314
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:19,870
it's a different debate for each magic

315
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,300
stuff in the end you will get a

316
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:24,040
prediction for example if you see the 10

317
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,479
image if the cat is an input you will

318
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,069
get a prediction which is a piece of

319
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,640
string that's enough food for me system

320
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:33,790
says cat with 0.78 probability of

321
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:36,220
confidence but I want to do some big you

322
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,689
funny this information so this is not

323
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,400
black magic this is not voodoo

324
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,800
in the end what happens is that you have

325
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,720
a very short stage called intermediate

326
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,969
representation where you take the input

327
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,950
might be an mp3 might be an image might

328
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:49,450
be a binary and you convert it into

329
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,520
something that you can multiply the

330
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:53,920
matrices with in other words you include

331
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,510
that same information into a matrix with

332
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,400
whatever method that you decided to do

333
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,810
it's very important which method but

334
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,060
it's just an way to encode that

335
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:02,920
information then you multiply the

336
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,359
matrices there's lots of very smart

337
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,279
algorithms how to do this efficiently

338
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,740
nobody cares you just use the library

339
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,449
and let me get the outputs the outputs

340
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,829
are very interesting because whenever

341
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:14,329
you are feeding an information into

342
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:16,069
those system you should not get a single

343
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:17,359
output you will get a vector that

344
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:19,849
describes what's a different probability

345
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,800
that it matches one of loop classes that

346
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,689
you have in your data so if I put an

347
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,750
image of a cat into the system would say

348
00:13:23,689 --> 00:13:29,029
well it's a cat 0.78% probability but it

349
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:31,670
also might be an airplane 0.01

350
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:33,199
probability okay so all of that

351
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:35,509
information is being outputted by the

352
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:37,639
system but the way that the system

353
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:40,069
outputs that information is not by using

354
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:42,620
a lot of strings just using indexes so

355
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:45,050
it doesn't say cats 0.78 it says index

356
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,579
17 0 point 7 8 and then there's a

357
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,079
mapping process where you map the

358
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:52,069
results into something that's human to

359
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:53,628
human readable human identifiable then

360
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:56,779
you get the prediction and your system

361
00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:59,180
is working and everybody's very happy so

362
00:13:56,779 --> 00:14:01,579
when you're training the system it's a

363
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,290
very iterative process you take that

364
00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:05,000
information the first image of a cat you

365
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:08,029
fit it in the system you measure the

366
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,610
accuracy feedback loop take the second

367
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:12,589
image calculate whatever you got that

368
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:15,139
measure the accuracy correct the weights

369
00:14:12,589 --> 00:14:17,990
correct the parameters repeat this 15

370
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:19,399
million times okay I'm just throwing

371
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,980
number it's usually much higher than

372
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:23,509
that maybe 500 million times and this is

373
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,309
where most of the compute is going when

374
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:27,319
you are creating the idea when you're

375
00:14:25,309 --> 00:14:29,209
creating the model when you're deploying

376
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:31,250
the model something else completely is

377
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:33,888
almost like a deterministic almost

378
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:36,290
linear process you don't retrain it you

379
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:37,699
don't modify the job to change it you

380
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:39,110
actually have no Tara to do know if

381
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:41,959
someone change it but we'll come back to

382
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:43,639
that later and what you have is just the

383
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:45,829
same method going from end to end

384
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:50,389
feeding information on one end getting

385
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:51,949
results me however looking at models and

386
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:54,920
you can encode is not the same thing

387
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:57,109
it's not the same thing because whenever

388
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,819
we are looking at code we can look and

389
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:00,259
discern the execution flow we can open

390
00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:01,819
it in either we can look at the

391
00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:03,500
disassembly and say ok this is what they

392
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:05,479
meant this is a code that generated

393
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,769
disassemble I know what it means but

394
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,329
when I'm looking at the machine learning

395
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:10,370
model well I have a bunch of math

396
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:13,279
operation and a matrix what does that

397
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:15,399
mean how do I know what it includes and

398
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:18,589
they're shorter you so that you don't

399
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:19,470
the longer answer is that those same

400
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:22,440
data structure

401
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:24,360
you're familiar with from the structures

402
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,700
in memory in the way different data is

403
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,620
represented in the code in the data

404
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,180
segment code segment etc it's not

405
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,260
transferable into the same kind of

406
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,870
structures when you're looking at

407
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:36,330
matrices so there's a big open problem

408
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:39,870
today saying how to reverse engineer and

409
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:42,600
model to know how it became that model

410
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:44,850
what were the set of circumstances that

411
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:49,470
created that model and get more on that

412
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:51,780
later the crux of the matter is you

413
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:53,310
can't do code with you to a matrix you

414
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:55,620
can't really do with verse engineering

415
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:57,719
to a matrix and how do we even know in

416
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:00,870
some somebody did something fishy to

417
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:03,120
that model and we're going to so show a

418
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:05,040
couple of examples the first thing that

419
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,290
I want you to know and like really get

420
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,900
from the stock machine learning models

421
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:12,270
aren't scary in the end it just pieces

422
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:15,020
of code floating somewhere in memory so

423
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:17,160
what you're seeing here is actually

424
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:19,319
machine learning model called less than

425
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:22,050
50 because it classifies 50 different

426
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,370
objects this is the hack stuff this is

427
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:25,620
just a piece of memory there are no

428
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:27,690
transfer functions here there is no

429
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,490
nodes graphs etc and this is the way

430
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,930
it's represented in memory and this is

431
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,860
the only thing that we care about when

432
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:36,300
we go about it so three different

433
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,700
important things to mention the first

434
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:41,609
one is that those algorithms the ones

435
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:44,280
with training positions are optimised to

436
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:47,760
detect the strongest signal in the input

437
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:49,110
it might not be the input or the signal

438
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,120
that you would expect when looking at

439
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:52,710
that input the machine learning model by

440
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,750
looking at the picture of the cat and

441
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:56,790
decided this is not because it has some

442
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,350
whispers in eyes and 20 years in

443
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,360
miticide because this specific pixel

444
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,490
relationship and the histogram in that

445
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,090
image signifies this is cat more than

446
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:05,220
anything else

447
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:07,020
so it's not analyzing the input the same

448
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:10,589
way that we are but it's getting to the

449
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:12,569
same result the optimization is built in

450
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:14,490
order to fixate on the strongest signal

451
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:16,889
in the image and if we have control of

452
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:19,410
the strong signal in that input we can

453
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:22,320
do a misty stuff the other thing is that

454
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:24,420
these are very very large pieces of

455
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:27,569
memory this is not like disassembly and

456
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:30,960
for megabyte binary this is 6 6

457
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:32,169
gigabytes memory and in grow so it might

458
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,030
be

459
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:35,380
somewhat problematic to to

460
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:37,149
reverse-engineer whatever you have in

461
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,370
memory we need better tooling and better

462
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:42,250
perspectives and the last thing that I

463
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:44,649
want to discuss is the bias so I want to

464
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:46,630
tell you a short story so some

465
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:48,790
researchers try to build the machine

466
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:51,760
learning the system is machine learning

467
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:54,909
model taking various blood type

468
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:57,190
information mean compressibility volume

469
00:17:54,910 --> 00:18:00,580
the number of blood side red blood cells

470
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:03,040
etc in order to detect cancer so they

471
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,480
took a lot of inputs some of them from

472
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,070
cancer patients some were not from

473
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,770
cancer patient not a lot of data like a

474
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:10,450
very large CSV comma separated value fun

475
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,860
and they went over all of that

476
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:13,510
information and they built the machinery

477
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:15,840
model and they were very happy because

478
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:18,430
they did they created a system that had

479
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,639
97 I'm just making up the number right

480
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:23,890
now 97 plus accuracy of detecting a

481
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:28,570
cancer patient based on his blood type

482
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:30,160
blood the parameters but whenever they

483
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:32,590
try to use this in the real world it

484
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,120
felt horribly gave very very low

485
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:36,520
detection rates and you try to debug

486
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,560
their system if you understand what went

487
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,870
so horribly wrong and what the

488
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,940
discovered is something that is usually

489
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:45,790
related to somebody we call bias and

490
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:48,160
that means that the data that they had

491
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:50,530
the storm signal the data that they had

492
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,960
was the name of the hospital so if you

493
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:54,639
went to Chevron General it doesn't mean

494
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,370
much but if you go to John Hopkins

495
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,430
Center for cancer research it's a good

496
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:02,439
indication that this patient has cancer

497
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:05,110
so when I'd say with somebody's fixating

498
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,240
on the strongest signal in the

499
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:09,070
information that you provided it this is

500
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,840
one of those examples and they had to

501
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:14,980
scourge the entire system and rebuild it

502
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:16,840
computer these systems have a lot of

503
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,490
different attack limiters and I describe

504
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,220
in just a couple of those attack vectors

505
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:23,200
here we will be discussing those

506
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:25,120
highlighted in red today we will talk a

507
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,660
bit about how backdoors denial of

508
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,550
service

509
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,680
I prefer mispredictions in model

510
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:31,990
tampering lockira look like in those

511
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,270
systems but specifically there are a lot

512
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:36,100
more different attack surfaces and we'll

513
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:40,450
be happy to discuss them more offline

514
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:41,919
off stage we wanted to use a common

515
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,919
framework to discuss these different

516
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,639
grant vectors and

517
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:50,389
IFS in like a very natural subject to do

518
00:19:46,639 --> 00:19:57,649
so so we took our top five top five

519
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:59,809
attackers scoring them and we rank them

520
00:19:57,649 --> 00:20:01,998
according to their CBS escort as you can

521
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:04,369
see the OS is the most important one

522
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:06,919
here and then we went to talk to our

523
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:08,749
various customers and partners and after

524
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:11,690
well what do you care most about when

525
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:13,700
you're deploying AI systems well they

526
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:15,320
couldn't care less about the OS they

527
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,659
didn't care at all about misprediction

528
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,100
the most important aspect to the way

529
00:20:17,659 --> 00:20:21,559
that they were looking in from a

530
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,259
business impact point of view is what

531
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:25,309
would happen if someone steals my ID

532
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:27,200
what would happen how do I protect

533
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:29,720
myself against those kind of things and

534
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,759
if I'm running that IP summer harmonic

535
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,009
that machine learning engine summer how

536
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:35,749
do I know nobody changes nobody tampered

537
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:37,850
with it is it even doing the same thing

538
00:20:35,749 --> 00:20:39,889
that I expect it to do because I have no

539
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:41,689
controls I have no metrics to measure is

540
00:20:39,889 --> 00:20:46,070
it still doing what I'm expecting it to

541
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:49,220
do and at the end we want you to answer

542
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:51,080
some very simple questions how would an

543
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,909
attacker actually attempt these kinds of

544
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,199
machine learning systems assume that

545
00:20:52,909 --> 00:20:55,850
there's the machinery system doing

546
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,679
somewhere something somewhere usually

547
00:20:55,850 --> 00:21:00,049
involving the cloud or blockchain

548
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,899
whatever buzz with you here and how can

549
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:04,850
attacker go about and practice systems

550
00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:06,529
to either still something get something

551
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:09,320
get something escalate something

552
00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:13,730
whatever something so to discuss this

553
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:15,439
I'm going to hand the mic over to thank

554
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:20,720
you guys so first I'm going to try with

555
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:24,559
this one it seems to work cool so we we

556
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:28,129
had now to build an attack and we could

557
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:30,918
go to two different parts of it first we

558
00:21:28,129 --> 00:21:34,129
could try and go against our systems or

559
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:36,109
we can try and go to the algorithms and

560
00:21:34,129 --> 00:21:39,830
to be able to explain that let's do a

561
00:21:36,109 --> 00:21:43,070
little recap so if you remember the

562
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:45,259
first face on our processes we got an

563
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:50,330
input and this input it's a file or it's

564
00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:52,639
a mp3 file or a bitmap or whatever the

565
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:54,499
system doesn't understand bitmaps it

566
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:56,040
needs to convert it into a matrix or

567
00:21:54,499 --> 00:21:58,380
internal representation

568
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:02,340
so there is a parsing process in here

569
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:05,040
this is a fully systematic operation

570
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:07,350
unless of a mathematical one and then we

571
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:10,370
have the part that the algorithm itself

572
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:14,040
it's working and it's performing the

573
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:17,610
magic inside and afterwards it's mapping

574
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:21,389
the output from this face from the

575
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:24,240
algorithmic old face into an index again

576
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:28,230
imagine this index is also something

577
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:30,440
systematic where we have a number and a

578
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:34,200
label to that number okay

579
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:36,240
so we wanted to attack both the

580
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,720
scenarios and we're going to start with

581
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,400
the system part and I just want to

582
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,040
return to the first part and want to

583
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:47,280
understand something if you remember we

584
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:52,610
have an image that needs to be converted

585
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:56,280
into a matrix that's parsing that's

586
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:57,899
something that it's very known in the

587
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,670
industry and it's a simple parsing

588
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:02,640
because machine learning needs to

589
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:08,070
convert whatever you Shooter it into

590
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:09,840
matrixes and person is hard I mean it's

591
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:14,669
hard and whenever there is parsing

592
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:18,449
involved there is font we have oh and

593
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:21,240
most importance whoever develops AI or

594
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:24,240
machine learning do not develop file

595
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,820
formats or parsers or whatever it's not

596
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:30,480
very speciality their specialities

597
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:32,550
matrixes and data and you know what

598
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,640
usually happens when you don't know how

599
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:39,419
to do a specific file format to just

600
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,830
bring that dependency cool they are

601
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,540
bringing outside libraries to the

602
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:44,189
project and to their stack and this

603
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:46,230
instead levers need to perform a very

604
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:48,450
specific way that's that gives very

605
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:51,270
specific parameters because the entire

606
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:54,840
model is trained on those parameters and

607
00:23:51,270 --> 00:24:00,120
if the parameters change the model

608
00:23:54,840 --> 00:24:02,629
change so we bring now supply chain

609
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,979
we're in now patch management which

610
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:07,770
traditional is hard but when you have

611
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:09,780
change parameters is harder and it's

612
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:15,420
harder in the really bad way

613
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:18,000
oh and yes you cannot support a single

614
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:20,490
format because imagine that you are now

615
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,430
creating a framework the duals image

616
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:25,170
recognition and can only support a

617
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:27,420
single format it wouldn't work for

618
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:30,840
anything because it's just one format so

619
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:34,440
you'll support many of them the obvious

620
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:38,639
thing what we wanted to do at this at

621
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:45,750
this moment was to try to fast the file

622
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:47,820
format parsing and we failed and we then

623
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:49,740
failed because it was garbage we fail

624
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:54,990
because we had for example a huge

625
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:58,170
cluster and this cluster was running all

626
00:24:54,990 --> 00:25:01,020
the time this dis machine learning

627
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:04,830
predictions and that means that the

628
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:08,700
entire machine learning process was been

629
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:13,250
run so we failed within took into

630
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:18,690
consideration that machine learning is a

631
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:21,360
operational intensive process and we

632
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:24,420
were having terrible results and we were

633
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,790
not having anything so we decided to

634
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:30,410
start and take a look at what could be

635
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:32,850
happening there so we were focusing on

636
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:36,060
fuzzing a common framework that it's

637
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:38,399
called tougher and our approach when we

638
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:41,340
were passing it's having full coverage

639
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,560
because when we're facing traffic we're

640
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:45,120
facing the actual target the actual

641
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,649
objective and we find something there is

642
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,159
going to be the same thing that it's

643
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:52,530
going to be on production or whatever

644
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:55,470
but it was slow and I want to be clear

645
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:59,100
here in case I was not clear enough we

646
00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:02,540
were in every iteration we were running

647
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,540
a machine learning prediction

648
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:32,039
[Music]

649
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:34,220
this was so you know what happens

650
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:39,109
whenever we have a challenge like this

651
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:43,499
we get to the next level

652
00:26:39,109 --> 00:26:45,600
so basically Cafe is using a framework

653
00:26:43,499 --> 00:26:49,619
that it's called open CV open computer

654
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:52,320
vision where yeah it was also used to

655
00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:54,689
parse the images how it has a problem it

656
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,249
has limited coverage we don't know we're

657
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:58,739
not using all the code paths that are in

658
00:26:56,249 --> 00:27:00,869
there and it could be that something

659
00:26:58,739 --> 00:27:03,419
that we find it's not relevant for the

660
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:06,090
exploitation that we want to attack

661
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:09,149
because it's simply there is no code pad

662
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:13,978
in there but the speed was acceptable

663
00:27:09,149 --> 00:27:18,359
and it's we are going to return to this

664
00:27:13,979 --> 00:27:21,019
in a few on the other hand we could have

665
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:23,699
gone directly to fast the specific

666
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:26,580
libraries that are being used to parse

667
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:29,429
the file formats like going to live BMP

668
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:34,470
or late TAFE or whatever which would be

669
00:27:29,429 --> 00:27:36,529
extremely fast but if in open CV we have

670
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:41,309
limited coverage and we didn't know knew

671
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:44,220
if the code pads were being taken over

672
00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:46,408
here it would be extremely more complex

673
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:49,769
because it could be that the model are

674
00:27:46,409 --> 00:27:51,149
using very specific functions they story

675
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:55,950
the framework is using very specific

676
00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:59,820
functions so at the end we choose open

677
00:27:55,950 --> 00:28:02,450
CV it was the best trade around between

678
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:06,210
speed and code paths and whatever

679
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:08,149
however we also found something very

680
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:11,989
interesting

681
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:16,139
upstream passing is not needed sometimes

682
00:28:11,989 --> 00:28:18,299
because as I was explaining before the

683
00:28:16,139 --> 00:28:19,799
fact that there is some modification in

684
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:22,679
the parameters that are being fed to the

685
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:25,499
model could extremely affect or further

686
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:28,859
and true story

687
00:28:25,499 --> 00:28:29,820
it can actually be using libraries that

688
00:28:28,859 --> 00:28:32,580
are not even

689
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:35,040
supportive anymore I'm not going to name

690
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:36,270
names but you can definitely go and take

691
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,830
a look at the source and you will

692
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:39,830
immediately know what I'm talking about

693
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:47,600
however you know we have to triage and

694
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:53,300
verify if it was bad it's workable not

695
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:57,629
so yeah the solution was opencv and

696
00:28:53,300 --> 00:29:05,370
again we failed so we started with

697
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:07,410
ramdisk and and we crashed in the

698
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:10,290
different the research we were using

699
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:24,750
this specific cluster was also being

700
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:29,090
used to something else and we lost a lot

701
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:32,040
of rushes thank you guy I love you oh

702
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:33,899
and yeah another thing is that these

703
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,670
kind of systems are very noisy when it's

704
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,860
logging related we were doing everything

705
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:40,200
log it's to be able to actually after

706
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:44,250
it's try to identify something useful

707
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:48,180
and these logs were huge so that huge

708
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:50,310
that they fill our disk and we'll again

709
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:57,830
those some valid crushes and this time

710
00:29:50,310 --> 00:30:00,629
it was my fault nothing so so yeah

711
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:03,330
faithful because exploitation is hard

712
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:06,630
DevOps is a very very complex problem as

713
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:10,520
we all know but we eventually got our

714
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:17,430
quick and when we got our grip things

715
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:22,260
changed significantly our preliminary

716
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:27,410
results we basically found almost every

717
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:31,620
exploit category that you can imagine

718
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:33,780
not only that when we took a look to the

719
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:36,840
wrappers we found that there were a lot

720
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:40,139
of bag collisions which means that we

721
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:43,470
are not the only ones that are playing

722
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:45,990
in this area a lot of other

723
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:48,630
players in your industry are also doing

724
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:52,860
thousand to to the specific frameworks

725
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:56,820
and a lot of us were having fun we're

726
00:30:52,860 --> 00:31:00,080
having a lot of backs to report so huge

727
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:15,649
bug collisions in times of weeks even

728
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:15,649
and we have huge amount of crashes and

729
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:21,209
further Europe

730
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:23,490
take a kid to a candy store and told him

731
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:25,190
you have only made the budget and you

732
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:28,110
can buy whatever you want

733
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:31,080
we were like this who are playing with

734
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:33,750
whatever we're having and with racing

735
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:35,100
cool now I have this kind of I'm going

736
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,630
to play this one I'm going to exploit

737
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:39,629
this and then we moved but this one is

738
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:47,370
better no but this one is better so it

739
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:50,700
was it was hard yes at the end again we

740
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:53,489
had to get our grip and I'm going to be

741
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:55,770
as honest as possible we went for the

742
00:31:53,490 --> 00:32:00,240
easiest one at the end BMP it's a very

743
00:31:55,770 --> 00:32:02,340
easy to craft ah manually it's very very

744
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,500
simple file format and there were

745
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:10,500
interesting crashes in there and that

746
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:12,780
was what we started to do so now that I

747
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:17,610
explained what was the entire process

748
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:20,908
let's try to return to our numbers and

749
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:23,219
objectives we have ID theft mobile

750
00:32:20,909 --> 00:32:27,510
tampering the service das misprediction

751
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:29,520
whatever could we approach this kind of

752
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:36,270
different attacks with remote code

753
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:40,440
execution to be able to do so we build

754
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:44,280
our lab proof-of-concept application

755
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:46,590
that will mimic real scenario where

756
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:48,990
there would be an input which would be a

757
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:51,928
couple of case an image file and it will

758
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:55,620
produce an output which will which would

759
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:57,149
give us a label simple system simple

760
00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:00,869
common system that

761
00:32:57,149 --> 00:33:06,928
probably it's deployed somewhere it's

762
00:33:00,869 --> 00:33:12,349
actually very similar okay

763
00:33:06,929 --> 00:33:12,349
so demo time

764
00:33:12,589 --> 00:33:16,830
what I want to start with an I love

765
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:18,779
service this is an Aleph service on the

766
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:20,879
left side we are going to have the

767
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:22,979
attacker on the right side we are going

768
00:33:20,879 --> 00:33:26,070
to see their the statistics of the

769
00:33:22,979 --> 00:33:28,499
system so as you can see everything is

770
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:32,779
normal everything is running as usual on

771
00:33:28,499 --> 00:33:37,710
the left side just go and run my my

772
00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:45,960
prediction system I provide him a bitmap

773
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:48,450
file which again a couple of case and as

774
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:50,669
you can see the numbers start to get up

775
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:55,619
and will continue to get up for a long

776
00:33:50,669 --> 00:33:58,619
long long time which we don't have

777
00:33:55,619 --> 00:34:01,139
so we are going to do fast forward and

778
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:03,449
as you can see at this moment is a

779
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:05,728
couple of case file is actually using

780
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:09,270
something like six thirty two gigabytes

781
00:34:05,729 --> 00:34:14,159
of memory and it continues to fill and

782
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:17,089
it's again think about it ten case six

783
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:20,069
point eight and then we have a crash

784
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:34,710
because the memory gets filled we have

785
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:40,020
an exception everything crashes cool but

786
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:43,049
nobody likes in a low service so again

787
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:45,809
we're going to on both sides we're going

788
00:34:43,049 --> 00:34:47,969
to have the attacker so let's take a

789
00:34:45,809 --> 00:34:54,569
look the first thing take a look at the

790
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:58,618
hostname its WM and then we go to the

791
00:34:54,569 --> 00:35:00,329
library and just execute exploit you

792
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:01,829
will probably notice funny stuff on the

793
00:35:00,329 --> 00:35:03,390
name of the file that there is an

794
00:35:01,829 --> 00:35:06,510
explanation in there but we're not going

795
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:10,440
to get into details now house name

796
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:14,010
everything is working and it stays here

797
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:16,950
and let's take a look at the video where

798
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:20,609
we are connecting now to a shell that

799
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:22,529
was created with this exploit and I did

800
00:35:20,609 --> 00:35:24,990
a tight one instead of typing host like

801
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:27,450
host name I type house name and we are

802
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:30,058
now inside the Machine and we can see

803
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:48,390
all the files and we are a user this

804
00:35:30,059 --> 00:35:50,309
computer there single image and I want

805
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:53,129
you just to take a look at these who are

806
00:35:50,309 --> 00:35:55,440
going to return to this to this

807
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:58,859
directory listing it's it's important

808
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:03,510
I'm not going to explain it now but

809
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:05,788
still we are not doing what we wanted to

810
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:09,049
do at the beginning which was to do

811
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:09,049
model tampering

812
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:16,740
so we are going now to connect to the

813
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:21,689
machine we're inside the machine is

814
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:23,788
running see ok so first take a look this

815
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:25,650
is how it looks an image file a label

816
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:28,980
file we have the number and we have the

817
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:32,160
description of it ok now we are going to

818
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:36,299
run the exploit in a couple of seconds

819
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:37,890
and we have a segmentation fault we all

820
00:36:36,299 --> 00:36:40,650
know what this segmentation fault

821
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:42,480
actually means and now we are going to

822
00:36:40,650 --> 00:37:20,160
take a look again at this image file oh

823
00:36:42,480 --> 00:37:23,320
yeah so now oh and we're going to do the

824
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,940
last demo the IP theft actually know

825
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,590
you actually saw it before I don't need

826
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:28,420
to get into details and to run another

827
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:30,370
video to you you saw that they have the

828
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,810
ability to see all the files that exist

829
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:34,089
in the full system and the same way I

830
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:34,650
did that shell I could just bring them

831
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:40,270
to me

832
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:46,900
so basically came our I mean we can do

833
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:52,930
this and easily so yeah Aarthi is the

834
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:55,560
king uh however I'm going to tell you a

835
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:58,750
little problem that something exists

836
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:00,880
again we were lucky we probably this

837
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:04,960
kind of stuff it's not going to be with

838
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:07,600
us for many years probably it is I don't

839
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:10,500
know this kind of box exists but we

840
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:13,569
don't always cut remote good execution

841
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:16,630
so if you don't have remote code

842
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:19,960
execution you do the most intelligent

843
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:29,890
thing that you can do ever and it's just

844
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:31,450
go to guy okay start so far is that if

845
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:33,370
we have a remote code execution on the

846
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:34,930
server we can do a lot of things which

847
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:37,240
look like they're relatively easy

848
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:38,370
they're not but they're very doable

849
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,479
so if you have the knowledge experience

850
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:43,720
exploitation techniques you can go after

851
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,850
the server but actually there are other

852
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:48,580
methods that you can employ which are

853
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:50,620
much more interesting in a sense they

854
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:52,360
don't even require you to know these

855
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:54,220
kinds of exploitation techniques and I

856
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,750
want to describe a couple of them the

857
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:58,330
first one that I'm referring to here is

858
00:38:55,750 --> 00:39:00,010
a cloning a functional cloning of the

859
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:01,360
machine learning service and what do I

860
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:03,130
mean by that imagine that you have some

861
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,870
sort of machine learning service maybe

862
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:07,990
somewhere up in the cloud it has a

863
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:09,940
public facing API so you can run queries

864
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:11,890
against that API and you get results

865
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:13,450
from that API doesn't matter what kind

866
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:15,069
of machine learning service it is it

867
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:16,960
might be you upload binaries and get

868
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:19,150
results if it's malicious or not might

869
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,880
be an image classification it might be

870
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:24,190
alexa okay it's a public facing API with

871
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:27,370
some black box in the backend which you

872
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:30,490
have no knowledge of but what you can't

873
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:32,950
do actually is use that public facing

874
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:34,779
API to train your own system using the

875
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:35,919
knowledge already encoded in that black

876
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,290
box

877
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,670
and that is called a cloning attack

878
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:42,390
using that cloning attack and using that

879
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:44,980
Oracle somewhere up in the sky you can

880
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:47,470
significantly accelerate your training

881
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:49,660
time and rebuilding the same system or

882
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:54,100
functionally the same system on your

883
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:55,600
hand just using those api's and I got a

884
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,339
common their response it again when I

885
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,680
say this well you can just really meet

886
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:01,390
the api's well of course you can but the

887
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,220
your customers are uses the same API so

888
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:05,440
what would you do well I will attach a

889
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:07,569
cost to that was a P I so each API pair

890
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,190
will cost me a dollar okay but if you

891
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:12,190
invested 10 million dollars in building

892
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:12,520
that IP I will invest $10,000 to steal

893
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:15,610
it

894
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,990
so most of the common practices that we

895
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:18,910
have to protect against these kinds of

896
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:21,160
attacks are really relevant against the

897
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:24,190
type of attackers that we are trying to

898
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:26,200
defend against there are a couple of

899
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:28,270
different variants of these kinds of

900
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:30,669
attacks the first one is what we call a

901
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:32,470
white box cloning attacks in a white box

902
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:33,460
during attack you have full access to

903
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:35,830
all of the information you know the

904
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:37,360
topology you know the functions you know

905
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:39,220
how the inputs and the outputs behave

906
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,900
and you would say okay this is not a

907
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:43,149
realistic scenario because who would

908
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:45,310
give you all of that information well

909
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:47,410
surprise a lot of companies who are

910
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:49,180
doing machine learning stuff we go and

911
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:50,890
talk in different academic symposiums

912
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:53,049
they will present their work in

913
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:54,940
different conferences they usually hire

914
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,830
data scientists which are usually people

915
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:59,230
through the PhD which means that their

916
00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:00,730
own PhD dissertation is probably the

917
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:02,050
reason that are working in a company and

918
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:03,520
dissertations are public

919
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:06,190
you just have to drag your feet to the

920
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,930
local library and get a copy so all of

921
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:10,450
that information and most of the

922
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:12,580
Articles PDFs etc are freely available

923
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:14,009
and they will give you a huge amount of

924
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:17,830
information that you can base your

925
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:20,170
cloning on top of and that means that

926
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:22,360
construction constructing a white box

927
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:22,810
attack is not as complex as you would

928
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,290
imagine

929
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:28,390
and we've done that and we've done that

930
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:30,670
successfully hugely successful it was

931
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:32,680
such a success and we got somewhere

932
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:35,410
around one and a half to two percent

933
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:38,410
accuracy loss from our system to the

934
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:40,120
original system we invested we thought

935
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:42,069
it would be going to take us like three

936
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:44,170
hundred thousand queries a hundred and

937
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:45,850
thousand queries in magnitude the

938
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:47,650
reality was that we were able to clone

939
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:48,720
with that accuracy in under five

940
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:52,560
thousand queries

941
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:55,589
so this is not a very difficult attack

942
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,400
to execute a gray box attacks is a bit

943
00:41:55,589 --> 00:41:58,109
more difficult

944
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,510
black box attacks means I don't have

945
00:41:58,109 --> 00:42:01,920
access to it to the PhD dissertation I

946
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:03,599
have no idea what they're doing inside

947
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,300
but they do have some domain knowledge

948
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,980
and what that means it means that even

949
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:09,300
if I don't have access to the data set

950
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:11,099
let's say that you have the machine

951
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:13,859
learning system somewhere who's doing

952
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:15,900
traffic sign recognition so you know if

953
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:18,060
it's a stop sign or a right-of-way sign

954
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,490
or a serpentine sign or whatever and you

955
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:23,069
build it out of the USA database for

956
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:24,720
traffic signs whatever I don't have

957
00:42:23,069 --> 00:42:26,640
access to the database I only have

958
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,040
access to the Oracle but I do have

959
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:33,029
access to the Brazil database of traffic

960
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:35,640
sign recognition I can use that database

961
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:38,160
or a same domain knowledge from a

962
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:40,140
different data set to do my attack and

963
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,660
it will still work with a very high

964
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:44,640
accuracy and that means that even you're

965
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:47,250
very protective of the data set that

966
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:50,129
you've built your IP on top of if I can

967
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:53,430
get similar data set I can still clone

968
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:54,900
your model the last car type of that is

969
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:56,970
a black box where we are actually

970
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:59,609
clueless we have no idea what this thing

971
00:42:56,970 --> 00:43:00,660
what this thing is doing we're not even

972
00:42:59,609 --> 00:43:01,890
sure if it's sharing all of the

973
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:04,799
information that it can with us

974
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:07,140
sometimes you put filters on the outputs

975
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,310
so we all give us your top ten and

976
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:10,799
predictions they give us your top one

977
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:12,540
prediction so we're not sure that we

978
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,050
have full access to every aspect of that

979
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:15,119
system

980
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:16,560
that's a black box attack so we're still

981
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,780
working at those attacks and we've made

982
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,520
a lot of progress and we have we feel

983
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:23,990
that they are very doable and maybe

984
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:26,910
we'll be here next year to explain this

985
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:28,890
but then again maybe the attacker has no

986
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:32,430
access to the data what can he do in

987
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:35,400
that case well another very interesting

988
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:37,109
thing sorry if an attacker has access to

989
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:40,200
the to the Trinity of what can you do in

990
00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:42,480
that case so if you have access to the

991
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:44,098
training data which is might be easier

992
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,200
than you think especially when you are

993
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:48,210
considering supply chain issues where

994
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:50,040
you get the data from data scientists

995
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:53,670
are not very good with data hygiene in

996
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:56,099
general and I can manipulate the data in

997
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:57,839
order to manipulate your system and I

998
00:43:56,099 --> 00:43:59,250
can do it in a very crude brute force

999
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:02,270
type of thing and corrupt everything

1000
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:04,280
which is nice but very detectable

1001
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:06,170
detectable because nothing will work or

1002
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,690
I can do this very strategically

1003
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:10,730
surgically manipulating very specific

1004
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:12,680
inputs and creating backdoors into the

1005
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:15,080
system so we've been dealing with

1006
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:17,270
backdoors for quite some time now in the

1007
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,740
code sphere in the software sphere but

1008
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:20,390
in machine learning it's very different

1009
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:24,290
and the reason it's very different is

1010
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:26,299
again I remind you that the result of

1011
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:28,070
all of that work is a matrix the matrix

1012
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,750
encodes all of the information that you

1013
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:32,570
train the system on but it's not

1014
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:34,400
reversible so even if I get the machine

1015
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:36,290
learning model I bought an appliance

1016
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,990
from a vendor who runs some sort of AI

1017
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:40,460
appliance and I'm looking at it and I

1018
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:41,629
full access to the appliance and I can

1019
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:44,300
do whatever I want with the appliance

1020
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:46,490
and I run all of my validation in test

1021
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:49,250
meaning I get positive cases it works

1022
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:52,609
and give it negative cases it works the

1023
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:54,830
system is working brilliantly I have no

1024
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:56,960
way to know if there's a backdoor built

1025
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:58,520
into the system because I don't know the

1026
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,620
password I don't know the magic number I

1027
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:02,600
don't know the magic header and without

1028
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:05,000
it I have no way to discern what it is

1029
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:07,040
when I'm looking at the matrix it's not

1030
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,000
reversible and that is a huge problem

1031
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:13,580
and it's a huge problem both in academia

1032
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,290
and a huge problem in trust in the way

1033
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:17,660
that we are trusting AI systems right

1034
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:19,460
now because when I go and buy something

1035
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:20,270
from a vendor and introducing it into my

1036
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:22,160
own Network

1037
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:25,430
I want to trust that appliance I want to

1038
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:27,620
know that nobody injected the back door

1039
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:29,750
into the system so I will be absolutely

1040
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:32,029
certain nobody has access to my system

1041
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:34,850
when I'm plugging into my architecture

1042
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:36,710
but if I have no verifiable way to test

1043
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:40,130
this to know this what would they do

1044
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:42,680
what can I do and by the way the answer

1045
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:45,890
to that question right now is nothing we

1046
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:50,060
don't have tools we don't have ways to

1047
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:52,430
navigate these problems in the end all

1048
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:54,170
of that information is encoded into that

1049
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:57,109
matrix into that machine learning model

1050
00:45:54,170 --> 00:46:00,080
and the way that that machine learning

1051
00:45:57,110 --> 00:46:02,330
model reacts to the inputs good inputs

1052
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:04,700
bad and boots backdoor inputs whatever

1053
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:08,630
it is determines the dv8 behaviors the

1054
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:11,990
behavior of the system but we can use

1055
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:14,240
that to do other things as well so I

1056
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:15,089
want to show here from this year's black

1057
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,368
hat like

1058
00:46:15,089 --> 00:46:19,469
month and a half ago work from IBM

1059
00:46:17,369 --> 00:46:20,099
called deep Locker and what they've done

1060
00:46:19,469 --> 00:46:21,779
here

1061
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:24,210
which is very interesting in my opinion

1062
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:27,029
is that they've built a machine learning

1063
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:29,339
payload password generator of sorts

1064
00:46:27,029 --> 00:46:31,309
which means you have a malware it has an

1065
00:46:29,339 --> 00:46:34,769
encrypted payload and it will only

1066
00:46:31,309 --> 00:46:37,650
become active or be triggered if a

1067
00:46:34,769 --> 00:46:39,209
specific set of parameters are set it

1068
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:40,979
shows that this is a specific gene

1069
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:42,599
registry and a specific file in the file

1070
00:46:40,979 --> 00:46:44,640
system or whatever you want to trigger

1071
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:46,289
it on top of and if you don't see these

1072
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:49,170
triggers then you will not behave

1073
00:46:46,289 --> 00:46:50,969
maliciously usually what malware

1074
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:52,499
researchers do they look at the file or

1075
00:46:50,969 --> 00:46:55,109
look at the binary to disassemble it and

1076
00:46:52,499 --> 00:46:56,399
they analyze what the triggers are in

1077
00:46:55,109 --> 00:46:59,400
order to understand what triggers that

1078
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,779
behavior but now they encoded all of

1079
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,029
that information into a machine learning

1080
00:47:00,779 --> 00:47:05,279
model so they have a piece of malware

1081
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:07,499
which behaves completely naively nothing

1082
00:47:05,279 --> 00:47:09,420
very important unless it sees the right

1083
00:47:07,499 --> 00:47:11,910
triggers and only then it becomes

1084
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:14,249
malicious but the reverse engineer the

1085
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:15,930
malware researcher here has no tools has

1086
00:47:14,249 --> 00:47:18,238
no way to look at the matrix and

1087
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:21,118
determine what the triggers are we have

1088
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:23,729
no way to decipher what that means and

1089
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:25,380
it means that if some animal were filled

1090
00:47:23,729 --> 00:47:29,160
we actually build such a real-world

1091
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:31,739
malware we will not have a way to look

1092
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:33,839
at the binary and understand what caused

1093
00:47:31,739 --> 00:47:35,339
it to behave the way it does we will

1094
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:37,200
know it it did what it ever did because

1095
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:39,150
he did some random error or it caused

1096
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,799
some damage but we'll have to

1097
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:42,630
investigate the entire system and not

1098
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:44,190
just the binary and do a lots of

1099
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:45,930
experiments to see maybe this regular

1100
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:47,519
now maybe that maybe the combination

1101
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:49,940
triggered it it's a very difficult

1102
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:49,939
problem

1103
00:47:49,969 --> 00:47:55,950
another thing is misprediction I

1104
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:57,900
mentioned in the beginning that this the

1105
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:59,939
the systems are optimized to look at the

1106
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:03,359
strongest signal that they can find in

1107
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:04,739
the input and we can take advantage of

1108
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:07,558
of the way that the systems are

1109
00:48:04,739 --> 00:48:11,670
constructed by creating our own

1110
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:15,420
strongest signal in the input and there

1111
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:17,609
was a lot of let's say discussion or

1112
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:19,259
argument or lots of shouting in the

1113
00:48:17,609 --> 00:48:21,869
academia in the real world

1114
00:48:19,259 --> 00:48:23,999
does this even apply because it's very

1115
00:48:21,869 --> 00:48:25,950
easy to show that it applies to to two

1116
00:48:23,999 --> 00:48:27,660
dimensional images stickers stuff like

1117
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:28,220
that but in the real world we have

1118
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:30,410
camera

1119
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:33,169
goes and we have zoom issues and we have

1120
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:36,078
lighting problems and objects are 3d

1121
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:39,170
they are not to be so would that even

1122
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:42,069
work in the real world and the answer

1123
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:44,599
short answer to that is yes it does

1124
00:48:42,069 --> 00:48:46,759
so what you see here it's not an actual

1125
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:49,400
turtle this is a 3d printed turtle and

1126
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:51,280
you will look closely at the top shell

1127
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:54,650
you will see like red spot or red dots

1128
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:57,650
these are the the maliciously crafted

1129
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:59,540
strongly signal to that image and if you

1130
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:01,430
will look at the bars on the left you

1131
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:03,920
will see that whenever the top shell is

1132
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:07,430
topmost it is identified by the system

1133
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:09,680
as a rifle the system in here is the

1134
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:12,379
Google's inception v3 object recognition

1135
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,940
system and mother if constructed here or

1136
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:15,800
what they've shown here is that they can

1137
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:18,950
apply this adversarial image or a

1138
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:20,990
material construction to a real world 3d

1139
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:23,270
object that will actually cause the

1140
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:25,279
system to miss predict or misclassified

1141
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:27,349
that object as whatever they decided it

1142
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:30,200
would be in this case they decided that

1143
00:49:27,349 --> 00:49:33,290
this is going to be a rifle so excellent

1144
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:35,029
I want to show you a different way to do

1145
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:38,779
these kinds of attacks and for this I

1146
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:43,849
would need you to use them closely with

1147
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:45,650
other data set the articles useless the

1148
00:49:43,849 --> 00:49:47,540
original audio sample as you would

1149
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:49,069
probably hear it and this is the

1150
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:52,099
adversarial sample or the malicious

1151
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:54,800
sample without the data set the articles

1152
00:49:52,099 --> 00:49:58,310
useless show of hands how many of you

1153
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:00,230
heard the hacker payload something

1154
00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:05,599
something abnormal I'll play it again

1155
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:07,849
one person without the data said the

1156
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,859
articles useless so what actually

1157
00:50:07,849 --> 00:50:12,170
happens here is they multiplex the

1158
00:50:09,859 --> 00:50:14,690
single a second audio stream on top of

1159
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:16,220
that one but they mode modulated in such

1160
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:18,020
a way that it's a much stronger signal

1161
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:20,540
that the person that is speaking and

1162
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:23,599
what the system would hear is ok Google

1163
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:26,359
browse to evil calm that is the machine

1164
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:28,760
learning focusing on the most done the

1165
00:50:26,359 --> 00:50:30,380
strongest input in that system and that

1166
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:33,319
means that even we are thinking that we

1167
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:35,270
are hearing it and commercial on TV ok

1168
00:50:33,319 --> 00:50:36,950
we think that we hear it and we think we

1169
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:38,000
know what we are nearing the system

1170
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:39,980
might be hearing something else

1171
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,610
completely and that reminds me a

1172
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:43,230
different story that even if there is

1173
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:45,720
malicious attacker these systems are

1174
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:49,050
acting pretty funny anyway so there was

1175
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:51,689
a story like maybe 12 14 months ago a

1176
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:53,460
little over a year ago the woman was

1177
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:55,920
interviewed on television the local

1178
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:58,050
television news in America and she was

1179
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,730
and she was talking about her Alexa and

1180
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:01,470
how much she is very fond of her Alexa

1181
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:03,780
and she wanted to give an example

1182
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:06,480
and she said Alexa had toilet paper to

1183
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:08,580
my shopping cart and lo and behold Alexa

1184
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:11,000
added toilet paper to the shopping cart

1185
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:14,670
but then they aired that interview and

1186
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:17,280
20,000 households had Alexa adding

1187
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:18,780
toilet paper to their shopping carts so

1188
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:22,140
that was not a maliciously intended

1189
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:23,430
attack but then Domino's Pizza decided

1190
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:25,620
this would be actually and actually an

1191
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:27,750
excellent idea and air such a commercial

1192
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:29,520
during the Super Bowl where everybody

1193
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:32,610
would alexa order me a pizza from

1194
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,780
dominos not a good idea

1195
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:35,040
somebody blocked them from doing that

1196
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:37,170
but there's a lot of converts that

1197
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:46,830
controversy can they or should they be

1198
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:48,660
allowed to do that or not yeah okay

1199
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:51,299
another very interesting work this is

1200
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:54,990
from two years ago from Def Con 25 and

1201
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:56,970
what the person built here he built a

1202
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:57,839
machine learning system that uses

1203
00:51:56,970 --> 00:51:59,910
virustotal

1204
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:07,320
as an Oracle yeah who's familiar with

1205
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:09,089
virustotal here so high level

1206
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:11,190
description virustotal is a service that

1207
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:13,140
you can upload binaries it will run them

1208
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:15,210
against very a couple of different AV

1209
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:17,279
systems and we will report back score

1210
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:19,680
meaning how much of a malicious

1211
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:22,110
prediction is this finally is it very

1212
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:24,000
malicious not so much malicious etc and

1213
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:27,750
what he built was a machine learning

1214
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,400
model that trained in order to recompile

1215
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:31,290
the code to change the convict ate his

1216
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:33,960
code again and again and again and again

1217
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:36,420
in different paths and using that Oracle

1218
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:40,740
to lower the score that he was getting

1219
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:42,420
in the end he got a 0.49 score which

1220
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:44,399
means that his virus was no longer it

1221
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:47,040
was treated as malicious everything that

1222
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:49,020
he had to do in the end was removed the

1223
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:52,440
dot tax section rename it to something

1224
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:54,690
else and copy-paste the notepad acts and

1225
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:56,220
dot tax section to his own virus

1226
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:58,140
so that was the best method in order to

1227
00:52:56,220 --> 00:53:01,109
circumvent all of the different best

1228
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:05,670
anti viruses a system that we have in

1229
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:08,130
the world today so privacy machine

1230
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:10,980
learning is leaking privacy all over the

1231
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:12,720
place so lot of people are not really

1232
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:14,310
aware of that or discussing that but

1233
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:16,319
that is the reality of the situation and

1234
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:18,509
I'll give a very short example so

1235
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:21,810
imagine that you have some supplier

1236
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:23,490
building a diabetes detection system so

1237
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:25,440
he contacted some people or some of them

1238
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:26,879
have diabetes some of them do not and he

1239
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,980
trained his machine learning system to

1240
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,350
detect diabetes based off blood samples

1241
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:32,460
or whatever and he sold it now there's

1242
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:34,440
an appliance somewhere in the world

1243
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:36,870
being sold to an insurance company so

1244
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:39,360
they can run it against your own people

1245
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:40,650
applying for an insurance policy and

1246
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:43,470
then him decided to give them a health

1247
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:44,700
insurance or not so Joe comes along and

1248
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,470
they detain a machine learning system

1249
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:48,629
detects that he has a seven point four

1250
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:50,879
percent chance of being diabetic or

1251
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:52,860
maybe he has a thirty five point three

1252
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,570
percent chance of being doubly I don't

1253
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:57,090
know the system is working very happy

1254
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:58,500
but that Philip comes along and Philip

1255
00:53:57,090 --> 00:54:00,300
was part of the original data set the

1256
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:02,340
system was trained on and because of

1257
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:04,440
that we are going to see much higher

1258
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:06,300
numbers we are going to see ninety six

1259
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:08,550
point two percent probability which

1260
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:10,410
tells me with almost absolute certainty

1261
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:12,270
that this person was part of the

1262
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:14,540
original dataset I just flicked his PII

1263
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:16,620
is private identifiable information

1264
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:19,220
because that's the way those machine

1265
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:23,549
learning systems are constructed

1266
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:26,040
takeaways what we want you to to go away

1267
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:28,670
from this talk with are three different

1268
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:31,170
types of takeaways if your researchers

1269
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:33,510
think about your trust model think about

1270
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:35,610
the way that you are building those

1271
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:38,880
systems think about the emphasis that

1272
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:40,170
you need to put the single thing about

1273
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,000
the emphasis that you need to put on the

1274
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:43,260
infrastructure and the interfaces with

1275
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,330
the different components in that

1276
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:47,940
infrastructure because he relied

1277
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:53,670
rampions something someone needs to look

1278
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:55,560
at this if you're an attacker Wow nifty

1279
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:58,170
this lots of exciting stuff you can do

1280
00:54:55,560 --> 00:55:00,750
here nobody's really in doing this it's

1281
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:03,930
a right field go ahead do awesome stuff

1282
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:06,000
that's my best advice to you and you if

1283
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:08,348
you're a defender you really need to

1284
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,029
think about how you're going to sanitize

1285
00:55:08,349 --> 00:55:11,950
coming into the system that's the

1286
00:55:10,029 --> 00:55:13,930
biggest attack vectors that you have

1287
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:15,879
today you have a public facing API you

1288
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:17,440
can't just put it publicly you need to

1289
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:19,359
do something to make sure that you're

1290
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,519
getting the right information into your

1291
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:24,549
systems you need to validate the data

1292
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:26,288
and you need to think of your data as

1293
00:55:24,549 --> 00:55:29,440
untrusted it doesn't matter if you're

1294
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:31,479
using TLS if I as the as an attacker are

1295
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:33,819
using that amusing that TLS connection

1296
00:55:31,479 --> 00:55:35,348
it doesn't matter if it comes all the

1297
00:55:33,819 --> 00:55:36,700
way to your server is encrypted and

1298
00:55:35,349 --> 00:55:38,710
protected from everybody else

1299
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:41,049
I am the attacker it doesn't matter if

1300
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:42,549
you have tears think about those issues

1301
00:55:41,049 --> 00:55:45,430
think about everything that we'll

1302
00:55:42,549 --> 00:55:47,499
discuss and most important stop being

1303
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:50,288
scared for me on a I might sound very

1304
00:55:47,499 --> 00:55:52,959
very scared from a mathematic air from a

1305
00:55:50,289 --> 00:55:55,869
mathematical point of view in the end

1306
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:57,609
it's just someone else's code we want to

1307
00:55:55,869 --> 00:55:58,989
acknowledge the various people on our

1308
00:55:57,609 --> 00:56:01,239
team we actually helped out tremendously

1309
00:55:58,989 --> 00:56:04,239
in constructing those attacks in this

1310
00:56:01,239 --> 00:56:07,869
part Oh Mel addy Dennis Tracy are their

1311
00:56:04,239 --> 00:56:09,599
superior nolan some references again you
